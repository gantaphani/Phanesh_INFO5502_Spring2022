joseph curran sued the essex county sheriff department,the sheriff,and others,asserting they terminated his employment as a correctional officer in retaliation for his speech,in violation of the first amendment and the massachusetts declaration of rights.the district court found that the public interest in the employee speech was outweighed by the danger the speech would cause to the effective functioning of the department and entered judgment for the defendants.curran cousins,d.we affirm,in our first case on the subject since the supreme court opinion in garcetti ceballos,d.
curran was hired by the essex county sheriff department as a corrections officer on june,and remained one until his termination on february.
frank cousins,was appointed sheriff of essex county by the governor of massachusetts in,after the former sheriff pleaded guilty to corruption charges.the following year,the essex county correctional officers association the union or eccoa was formed.cousins and the union had a contentious relationship,creating a high level of public conflict during cousins tenure.
in,cousins ran for as sheriff.the union took a strong public position against him.curran served as the campaign manager for bill murley,cousins opponent this was widely known among department employees,including cousins himself.cousins was in november.
the plaintiff claims that within days of the election,cousins vowed to deal with those who supported his opponent.curran also claims that immediately thereafter,cousins removed him from the department tactical team,a prestigious unit.cousins then closed a boot camp program that had been created and led by cousins opponent.
suspension of curran 
on september,roughly a year after cousins,curran called in sick to work.about a month later,on october,department captain michael halley approached curran at work to discuss the department policy of conducting home visits when corrections officers called in sick the policy,apparently in reference to curran earlier sick day.the record does not indicate whether the department had visited curran at home during his september sick day.when curran told halley that the policy wasted taxpayers money,halley responded that he was just following orders.in response,curran told halley that german officers had raised the same defense during the nuremberg war crimes trials following world war ii.
three weeks later,on october,department captain arthur statezni discussed with curran concerns about whether curran september sick leave was legitimate.later that day,captain statezni filed an information report with the department which stated that he felt threatened by curran in that conversation.statezni wrote that curran became upset in the conversation and then said to statezni,y ou captains and deputies are gon na get shot.when captain statezni asked curran if he was threatening him,curran replied,n ot by me but by someone else.statezni report recounted that curran added,i see you tomorrow at my house i be out sickness in family sic you not welcome and a cruiser would be parked in my driveway.statezni then told curran that it sounds like you threatening me.curran then left work for the day.
as a result of statezni complaint about curran,the department held a disciplinary hearing on november.the department found curran comments to be threatening and menacing and that the two incidents would tend to adversely affect the operations of the department by prompting employees to direct orders.it suspended curran for thirty days starting on november.curran was also ordered to submit to a psychological evaluation to assess his fitness for duty as a corrections officer.within a week,curran had posted an angry message on the union website.
curran internet posting 
the union maintained a website,www.eccoa.org,which it owned and controlled fully independently from the department.the website contained a public discussion board on which any registered user could post comments and statements.any person with access to the a member of the union or register,post,and read messages.some messages were posted using pseudonyms while others had readily identifiable authors.thousands of messages were posted on the discussion board since it was created.according to the complaint,topics discussed included allegations of improprieties in the department,poor supervision of inmates,misuse of public funds,corruption,political coercion of employees and contractors and unsafe jail conditions.
the discussion board had earlier hosted threatening and racist messages by others directed towards cousins,who is.one posting included a picture superimposing cross hairs on the face of the sheriff with a caption stating,pull the trigger on the nigger another posting referred to the sheriff as a pimp and his subordinates as whore s.one poster referred to a department employee as a h ouse slave and the sheriff as the master who thinks he white cause he lives in whitevill.in a posting responding to a question of whether there was anyone able to help address alleged disparities in discipline,the author responded,yeah,there was someone who can sic help,but james earl ray is dead cousins requested that the essex county district attorney investigate the postings for potential hate crimes and civil rights violations.
curran had also posted messages on the board.on august,he posted the following 
my main thoughts are,that there are five types of people in this world 
the jews that got marched into the death chambers our officers 
the dictator hitler that ordered it you know who 
the that pushed the jews in dictator supporters 
the people that put on blinders and did nothing any one that does nothing 
the few that rebelled and attacked the nazi and saved some jews lives.know who you are 
if you are the ones that mess with and hurt my fellow officers,you are the worst form of hurting people for personal gain,i promised you i will do everything in my power to ensure that you are exposed and dealt with appropriately 
if you a person i praise you for having the courage of your conviction.but be careful about bashing the people,not everyone has been brought up to fight the good fight.thank god for people like harriet tubman who helped free the slaves,rosa one who started the civil rights movement bus,audey murphy wwii,most decorated soldier,and bill murley,for running against this dictator 
more than a year later and seven days into curran suspension,on november,curran posted a message on the discussion board under a topic entitled inmate assault.the message stated 
i wonder what it will take before one of the administrators gets the balls to stand up to the sheriff and do the right thing.how can a man allow all the evil that is unfairly being done to their people.i would think that out of the administrators there would be one that had an ounce of integrity.how can you sit back and watch the unfairness of the discipline and harassement being doled out to rivals of the sheriff and not stand up and say that it not right and try to stop it.the excuse of i need my job to take care of my family crap.
look at the list of people that have taken the biggest hits,all are from the list of murley supporters union were both.i wo bother going through the list of names,but if you look at the comparison list of alleged violation vs punishment,you would see that people were much more severe.that wrong.
a totaly unrelated history lesson do want to get in trouble again during wwii adolf hitler whose motto was have no pity act brutally,generals were deathly afraid of him,followed orders regardless of how the orders were.near the end,some of the generals realized just how wrong the orders were and started to plot against him knowing that the end was inevitable.well you know how the story ended.my point is that the right thing is not always the easy thing.
stay strong my and i see you at the union party.
death before dishonor 
there is no dispute curran posted this message to the website.
cousins responded to the november posting with a letter to curran dated february,informing curran that he would be subject to another disciplinary hearing due to allegations of misconduct against you in making inappropriate and offensive comments regarding adolf hitler generals in world war ii while on suspension.the letter noted that curran previous suspension had been based in part on references to german officers in world war ii,and stated that the alleged misconduct would be in direct violation of departmental policies,procedures and employee work rules,and the collective bargaining agreement.
the disciplinary hearing took place on february.curran and his counsel presented evidence on his behalf,but curran declined to testify in his own defense.after the hearing,the department,by letter dated february,from special sheriff thomas goff,notified curran that his employment was terminated.the february,termination letter expressly referenced curran prior discipline for confront ing senior officers in a threatening insubordinate manner while on duty.this letter stated that after reviewing curran website postings,it was clear that you identify hitler as the sheriff,the jews as the correctional officers,the nazi generals as the department deputies and captains,and another group,including yourself,as ones who may attack the nazis.the letter noted that your references in the november posting are violent and reference plots against hitler who you have repeatedly identified as the sheriff.taking into account both the november posting and the circumstances leading to your suspension,the letter informed curran that it is clear that you are either unable or unwilling to follow the department work rules and code of ethics.consequently,i have decided to terminate your employment with the department effective today.
lawsuit procedural history 
on march,curran filed a complaint pursuant to against cousins and goff,in their individual and official capacities,and the department,asserting violations of curran first amendment rights.the complaint also pled a pendent claim under the massachusetts declaration of rights,and defamation based on cousins letter to the billerica police chief during curran suspension.after the defendants answered,curran moved for partial judgment on the pleadings under rule c.the defendants filed a for judgment on the pleadings thereafter.
the district court,on march,granted the defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings on the first amendment claim and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining claims,leaving curran to pursue his claims in state court.curran,d at.the district court found that while curran november posting narrowly involved a matter of public concern,id.at,the interests served by his speech were outweighed by the department legitimate interests in preventing disruptions in carrying out its mission of law enforcement and maintenance of a correctional institution.id.at.
curran appeals the district court grant of judgment on the pleadings to the defendants and the denial of his motion for judgment on the pleadings.
standard of review 
we review judgments on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure c de novo.of,cir.the district court had before it for judgment on the pleadings.it appropriately focused its opinion on the defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings since a court may not grant a defendant rule c motion unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief,granting the defendant motion will necessarily resolve the plaintiff motion.de castro,cir quoting george frey concrete,pine hill concrete mix,cir bellino schlumberger,cir district court not required to write separately on each party for summary judgment as long as it evaluated each motion on its own merits.
a rule c motion implicates the pleadings as a whole,at.because this motion,like a motion to dismiss a complaint under rule b,involves some assessment of the merits,we view the facts contained in the pleadings in the light most favorable to the party opposing the,the draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.fin,cir.the court may supplement the facts contained in the pleadings by considering documents fairly incorporated therein and facts susceptible to judicial notice,at.
in reviewing a motion under rule c,as in reviewing a rule b motion,we may consider documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties documents central to plaintiffs claim and documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint.watterson page,cir under rule b.this is true even when the documents are incorporated into the movant pleadings beddall state street bank and trust,cir when,as now,a complaint factual allegations are expressly linked admittedly dependent document offered by the movant the authenticity of which is not challenged,that document effectively merges into the pleadings and the trial court can review it citing fudge penthouse int l,cir.see also dirrane brookline police,cir.
this is similar to the situation when a court is presented with for summary judgment.here,as there,c ross motions simply require us to determine whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law on facts that are not disputed.barnes fleet bank,cir quoting wightman springfield terminal,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
b.the first amendment claim 
public employees do not lose their first amendment rights to speak on matters of public concern simply because they are public employees.connick myers,d.still,those rights are not absolute the first amendment protects a public employee right,in certain circumstances,to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern.garcetti.at.if a court finds the employee has made statements that are within the scope of first amendment protection,the court must then balance the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.pickering bd.of,d see also,waters churchill,d rankin mcpherson,d connick,at.
garcetti has clarified and expanded on the earlier law.the supreme court described the correct analysis as involving a initial inquiry.the first step requires a determination of 
whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.if the answer is no,the employee has no first amendment cause of action based on his or her employer reaction to the speech.
garcetti.at citing connick,at.pickering,at.citations omitted.garcetti recognizes that this first step itself has two subparts a that the employee spoke as a citizen and b that the speech was on a matter of public concern.id.
if the answer to the garcetti first two subpart step is yes,then the possibility of a first amendment claim arises,and the second step of the inquiry is made 
the question becomes whether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.this consideration reflects the importance of the relationship between the speaker expressions and employment.a government entity has broader discretion to restrict speech when it acts in its role as employer,but the restrictions it imposes must be directed at speech that has some potential to affect the entity operations.
id.citing pickering,at.citation omitted.
garcetti initial steps are consistent with this circuit prior test,cir,which also asks a third question.that third question is concerned with causation,with whether the plaintiff can show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.of course,the employer must have the opportunity to prove that it would have made the same decision regardless of the protected expression.see healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.the parties agree there is a causal relationship between termination of curran employment and his speech,particularly his posting on november.
this is significant in the context of a motion for judgment on the pleadings because it is the judge who decides as a matter of law the issues in the two steps garcetti identifies.see connick,at.the inquiry into the protected status of speech is one of law,not fact.lewis city of boston,cir.the court must first determine whether the speech involved is entitled to any first amendment is,whether the speech is by an employee acting as a citizen on a matter of public concern.if so,the court then decides whether the public employer had an adequate justification,to use garcetti rephrasing of the pickering test.at.whatever the label of the before the district court,the material facts were not disputed.the issues were ones for the court to decide.
speech as a citizen on a matter of public concern 
we analyze the first garcetti question as to his speech,one leading to his prior suspension and his speech in his november posting.the termination of curran employment was the culmination of progressive discipline within the department,and so both events are relevant.
curran had earlier been disciplined,through a suspension,for threats made to others.the suspension did not involve speech by curran which had first amendment protection under garcetti.curran initial threats were made not as a citizen,but were made in the course of his duties within the department,to his superiors,and during a discussion of official department policy.thus,the first event in the history leading to curran termination involved speech which had no first amendment protection.see garcetti.at.
the plaintiff concedes that he was fired because of his november posting it is uncontested,based on the pleadings,that but for the november statement,the plaintiff would not have been fired and that because of the november statement,he was fired.we ask whether the november posting involved speech curran made a as a citizen and b on a matter of public concern.we will assume arguendo that curran was acting as a citizen since the posting was on a union website open to public posting and viewing.as to the next inquiry,the district court found that the posting did contain speech on matters of public concern.we agree,rejecting the defendants argument that no matter of public concern was involved.
whether an employee speech involves a matter of public concern is a,inquiry.while an employee has his own first amendment interest in his speech,the first amendment interests at stake extend beyond the individual speaker.garcetti.at.the supreme court has acknowledged the importance of promoting the public interest in receiving the views of government employees engaging in civic discussion.id.
if the topic of the speech is clearly a legitimate matter of inherent concern to the electorate,the court may eschew further inquiry into the employee motives as revealed by the form and context of the expression.baron suffolk county sheriff dep t,cir.matters of inherent concern include official malfeasance,abuse of office,and neglect of duties.see id.at jordan carter,cir.
the first and second paragraphs of curran november posting may be read as accusing cousins of using political favoritism rather than merit in making personnel decisions as to employees.see rutan republican party of,d holding that consideration of political affiliation is impermissible in making employment decisions about employees.in the first paragraph,curran asks,how can you sit back and watch the unfairness of the discipline and harassement sic being doled out to rivals of the sheriff and not stand up and say that it not right and try to stop it.he then references the list of people that have taken the biggest hits,points out that those people were all supporters of the union or cousins political opponent,and notes that if you look at the comparison list of alleged violation vs punishment,you would see that murly sic union people were much more severe.that wrong.
the topic of a public official basing personnel actions,as to employees,on political affiliation rather than merit is a topic of public concern.see,connick,at.finding speech about political pressure applied to employees in a prosecutor office to be a matter of public concern.
there was public interest value in the identified portions of the november posting.however,that does not establish that there was first amendment value in the remainder of the posting.
adequacy of the defendants justification 
we turn to the next step in the inquiry whether the department had an adequate justification for terminating curran garcetti.at.
government employers,like private employers,need a significant degree of control over their employees words and actions without it,there would be little chance for the efficient provision of public services.id.because public employees often occupy trusted positions in society,w hen they speak out,they can express views that contravene governmental policies or impair the proper performance of governmental functions.id.however,because a citizen who works for the government is nonetheless a citizen,so long as employees are speaking as citizens about matters of public concern,they must face only those speech restrictions that are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and effectively.id.
here,there is no dispute about what curran said in the posting further,there is no dispute about the employer stated justifications,which are contained in the termination letter as follows 
based on curran actions on october and october,he had been suspended because his conduct was threatening and menacing,and would tend to adversely affect the operations of the department by prompting employees to direct orders.
while curran was serving his suspension on november,he made highly inappropriate and violent comments regarding adolf hitler and the nazis on the eccoa website.reviewing curran prior website postings and comments,it is clear that curran identifies hitler as the sheriff,the jews as the correctional officers,the nazi generals as the department deputies and captains,and another those who may attack the nazis.in curran november posting,curran references are violent and reference plots against hitler,whom curran has repeatedly identified as the sheriff.
in his psychiatric evaluation required as part of the november discipline,curran acknowledged the importance of the employer interest in curran getting along and not creating friction with the administration and senior officers.
based on not only the offensive and violent comments posted while on suspension but also the circumstances leading to curran suspension,it was clear that he was either unable or unwilling to follow the department work rules and code of ethics.
we turn to curran arguments as to why these reasons are insufficient to justify the termination of his employment.curran recognizes that the stronger the first amendment interests in the speech,the stronger the justification the employer must have.see connick,at.from this,curran first argues that the value of his speech was very high 
that some of curran speech expressed topics of value in the civil discourse does not render all of his speech protected.see,waters,at.an employee who makes an unprotected statement is not immunized from discipline by the fact that this statement is surrounded by protected statements.heil santoro,cir noting that an employee who engages in unprotected conduct can not escap e discipline for that conduct by the fact that it was related to protected conduct hennessy city of melrose,cir analyzing each instance of speech separately to determine whether it was protected.the november posting included speech going far beyond providing information in which there was a legitimate public interest.
the posting urged department administrators to engage in insubordination and insulted their integrity.the posting then referred to adolf hitler and his generals,likening sheriff cousins to hitler,with a motto of have no pity act brutally.this repeated the theme of his august posting,that the sheriff was the dictator hitler,who ordered the jews marched into the death chambers our officers.curran likened those who followed cousins instructions to hitler generals,and accused them of following orders regardless of how immoral or wrong the orders were.
the posting referred to a plot by hitler generals against him.the reference was to a july,attempt by german military officers to assassinate hitler
