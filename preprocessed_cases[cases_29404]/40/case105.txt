a hoary proverb teaches that large oaks from little acorns grow.that is a natural progression.this case,however,features a less natural progression an obscure violation of a state securities regulation,not especially egregious in itself,has led to a litigation extravaganza that pits a prominent hedge fund operator against a state official with broad regulatory authority over the securities industry.this appeal is the latest but,we fear,not necessarily the last chapter in the tale.
the matter before us turns on allegations in the plaintiff amended complaint that the state official used his oversight powers to retaliate unlawfully against the plaintiff for his opposition to what he deems excessive regulation of the securities industry.the case raises a farrago of interesting questions about the scope and extent of the immunities afforded to state officials whose duties encompass both adjudicatory and prosecutorial functions.the district court resolved these questions against the plaintiff and dismissed the action.goldstein galvin,wl,at.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
phillip goldstein is a principal of bulldog investors general partnership,a hedge fund business.by his own description,the plaintiff is an outspoken public critic of excessive regulation of hedge funds.he takes particular pride in having invalidated a bothersome federal securities rule.see goldstein sec.
william galvin,an elected official,is the secretary of the commonwealth of massachusetts.under state law,the secretary is charged with oversight of the local securities industry.see.laws ch,a.the plaintiff alleges that,in retaliation for his stance,the secretary induced prosecutorial advocates in the enforcement section of the massachusetts securities division to prosecute an administrative complaint against him.the administrative complaint which named as respondents the plaintiff and other individuals and entities was filed on january.it charged the respondents with violating the massachusetts uniform securities act the act.laws ch,by offering unregistered securities for sale in massachusetts.although the secretary did not sign the complaint it was signed instead by four of his minions in the enforcement section the secretary is charged with enforcing the act and can delegate that authority to others.see id.a see also id.ch.
in answering the administrative complaint,the respondents interposed a number of affirmative defenses,including a defense premised on the first amendment.during the course of the administrative proceeding,the hearing officer ruled that the first amendment issue was not in play and rejected the other affirmative defenses.the acting director of the securities division adopted the hearing officer findings,decided that the respondents had violated the act,ordered them to cease and desist,and imposed a fine.
the respondents sought judicial review.their efforts were unsuccessful.see bulldog investors sec y of the commonwealth bulldog i.like the administrative proceeding itself,that review did not encompass the first amendment issue.id.at.
during the pendency of the proceedings described above,the respondents including the plaintiff filed a separate action in a massachusetts state court in an attempt to vindicate their first amendment rights.see bulldog investors sec y of the commonwealth bulldog ii.this action,brought pursuant to against the secretary in his official capacity,challenged the constitutionality of the state regulations that prohibit general solicitation and advertising by anyone offering unregistered securities,which allegedly infringed upon the respondents constitutional entitle ment to maintain their web site and communicate with any interested person.id.at.the massachusetts courts,up to and including the supreme judicial court,rejected these section claims.id.at.
before the dust had settled that is,while bulldog i and bulldog ii were still pending on appeal in the state court system,the plaintiff commenced another section action.this action,filed in the federal district court,alleged that the secretary had i induced the enforcement section to deviate from normal investigatory practices and charging standards ii induced the enforcement section to file the administrative complaint and iii gone out of his way to announce,on his website,that secretary galvin charges phillip goldstein and bulldog investors for unregistered securities offering.the district court dismissed the suit,concluding that the defendant was absolutely immune with respect to the prosecution of the enforcement action and qualifiedly immune with respect to the website announcement.see goldstein,wl,at.
this timely appeal ensued.because the district court dismissed the complaint on immunity grounds,we review de novo.coggeshall.bd.of regist.of psychologists,cir.in that endeavor,we take as true the facts set forth in the plaintiff amended complaint.see sec tambone,cir en banc.
ii.claim preclusion 
the secretary argues that the doctrine of claim preclusion barred the maintenance of the underlying action.this argument hinges on the preclusive effect of bulldog ii.
when a federal court considers the preclusive effect of an earlier state court judgment,it must apply that state preclusion principles.see migra warren city sch.dist.bd.of,see also.this remains true even when the new case poses a quintessentially federal question.see geiger foley hoag llp ret.plan,cir.accordingly,we look here to massachusetts preclusion principles.
under massachusetts law,c laim preclusion makes a valid,final judgment conclusive on the parties and their privies,and prevents relitigation of all matters that were or could have been adjudicated in the action.kobrin bd.of regist.in,internal quotation marks omitted.three elements must be satisfied to trigger the application of this doctrine the parties to the prior and present actions must either be identical or in privity the causes of action must arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact and the prior action must have produced a final judgment on the merits.see id.in this instance,our inquiry begins and ends with the first element.
in bulldog ii,suit was brought against the secretary in his official capacity.here,however,the suit is against the secretary in his individual capacity.this distinction is critically important.
o suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent monell dep t of soc.servs.of.in other words,an suit is,in all respects other than name,to be treated as a suit against the entity.kentucky graham.this means,of course,that a public official,sued only in his official capacity,is a proxy for the government entity that employs him and is in privity with that entity.see town of seabrook new hampshire,cir per curiam.the situation is quite different when an official is sued in his individual capacity.by definition,such a suit takes aim at the individual,not the government entity with which he is associated.such a defendant is,therefore,not considered to be in privity with the government entity.see,conner reinhard,cir.
the flipside of this coin is that a person sued in his official capacity is a different party,in contemplation of law,than the same person sued in his individual capacity.it follows inexorably that a person sued only in his official capacity is neither identical to,nor in privity with,the same person sued in his individual capacity.see mitchell chapman,cir andrews daw,cir howell hydrocarbons,adams,cir willner budig,cir per curiam conner,at gregory chehi,cir headley bacon,cir roy city of augusta,cir see also restatement second of judgments.the upshot is that a person who is sued in one capacity whether official or individual can not assert a defense of claim preclusion in a later action in which he is sued in a different capacity.
we conclude,therefore,that an official who has litigated a claim in his official capacity is not precluded from relitigation in his personal capacity.charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.updated.similarly,we conclude that a person who has defended a suit brought against him in his official capacity is not protected by principles of claim preclusion from a subsequent suit brought against him by the same plaintiff s in his individual capacity based on these conclusions,we reject the secretary claim preclusion argument.because the secretary was sued only in his official capacity in bulldog ii,the plaintiff is not precluded from bringing this second section action against the secretary in his individual capacity.
iii.absolute immunity 
creates a private right of action through which plaintiffs may recover against state actors for constitutional violations.see rehberg paulk.claims of retaliation for the exercise of first amendment rights are cognizable under.powell alexander,cir.
section does not,however,have an unlimited remedial reach.among other things,it was not meant to effect a radical departure from the immunities applicable in tort suits.rehberg.at.courts must look to federal law in appraising the viability of immunity defenses in section actions.wang bd.of regist.in,f d,cir.the must carry the devoir of persuasion to show that an immunity applies.see burns reed.
immunities come in various shapes and sizes.the secretary principal defenses in this case implicate claims of absolute immunity from suit.absolute immunity applies to a narrow swath of public officials,including judges performing judicial acts within their jurisdiction,prosecutors performing acts intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,and agency officials with functions similar to judges prosecutors.bettencourt bd.of regist.in med.of,cir internal quotation marks omitted see butz economou.the protection afforded by an absolute immunity endures even if the official acted maliciously and corruptly in exercising his judicial or prosecutorial functions.wang,at internal quotation marks omitted.it likewise endures in the presence of grave procedural errors.nystedt nigro,cir quoting stump sparkman.the imperviousness of this protection is no accident a lthough this concept of absolute immunity allows some abuses of official power to go unredressed,it is necessary for the effective administration of government that government workers be able to perform their jobs without fear of liability.ricci key bancshares of,cir.
in determining whether an official qualifies for absolute immunity,an inquiring court must examine the particular functions that the official performs.see buckley fitzsimmons.
by statute,the secretary is responsible for both adjudicatory and prosecutorial functions with respect to the act.see.laws ch,id.ch.the secretary asseverates that the actions of which the plaintiff complains are protected under principles of judicial immunity,prosecutorial immunity,or both we test this asseveration.
an inquiry into the existence vel non of judicial immunity encompasses three questions.first,we ask whether the defendant carries out traditional adjudicatory functions.see bettencourt,at.if so,we ask whether the defendant is called upon to decide cases that are sufficiently controversial that,in the absence of absolute immunity,he would be subject to numerous damages actions.id.if the answers to these two queries are affirmative,we then ask whether the defendant performs his adjudicatory functions against a backdrop of multiple safeguards designed to protect the plaintiff constitutional rights.id.we explain briefly why we need not conduct this tripartite inquiry here.
judicial acts are those that are intimately associated with the judicial function.nystedt,at quoting burns,at.the bedrock judicial function is,of course,the adjudication of disputes.id.other traditional judicial functions include such things as weighing evidence,making factual findings,reaching legal determinations,choosing sanctions,and expounding reasons for decisions.coggeshall,at.
in his amended complaint,the plaintiff concedes,as he must,that the secretary has comprehensive power to interpret the act to determine if it has been violated,to adjudicate whether any violations occurred,and to impose sanctions for violations of the act or the rules and regulations adopted thereunder.this concession has deep roots in the statutory scheme,which imbues the secretary with a host of judicial functions 
holding adjudicatory hearings and,in the course of them,administering oaths and affirmations,subpoenaing witnesses,compelling the attendance of witnesses,taking evidence,and requiring the production of documents and other materials,see.laws ch,b 
after providing notice and opportunity for a hearing,determining that a person has violated the act,id.a and 
ordering those who have violated the act to cease and desist as well as imposing other penalties and sanctions,id.
all of these functions are intimately associated with the judicial task.they are not,however,put in issue by the plaintiff amended complaint.
the retaliation alleged in this case involves the secretary actions in choosing to bring,and actually bringing,the enforcement action.it does not involve the secretary actions in regard to the actual decisionmaking process that is,the secretary performance of his core judicial functions.the plaintiff has offered no developed argumentation connecting the alleged retaliation to the secretary performance of these latter functions.consequently,we need not pursue the judicial immunity inquiry.see united states zannino,cir explaining that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.even though the secretary performed judicial functions in the enforcement action,the plaintiff retaliation claim,as presented here,does not implicate those functions.
this conclusion does not end our odyssey.the plaintiff vociferously challenges the secretary performance of acts.the secretary responds by asserting that his performance of these acts is entitled to prosecutorial immunity.we turn to that assertion.
the baseline rule is that a state official who performs prosecutorial functions,including the initiation of administrative proceedings that may result in legal sanctions,is absolutely immune from damages actions.see wang,at see also butz,at.by statute,the secretary responsibilities include administering and enforcing the act,see.laws ch,id.ch,a instituting proceedings,see id.ch,d and determining whether grounds exist to believe that any person has violated any provision of the act,id.a.
the secretary exercised these powers in the case at hand.in doing so,he was performing prosecutorial functions.acts that collectively comprise the pursuit of an enforcement action fit snugly within the realm of traditional prosecutorial functions.see,butz,at wang,at.
in an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,the plaintiff maintains that the secretary acted beyond the bounds of prosecutorial immunity by induc ing prosecutorial advocates to file the administrative complaint.this divests an official of immunity,the plaintiff says,because there is a material difference between prosecuting a case which comes within the scope of immunity and inducing its prosecution which falls outside the scope of immunity.while this dichotomy may be helpful in certain circumstances,it has no bearing here.
the plaintiff argument relies disingenuously on the supreme court decision in hartman moore.there,postal inspectors were alleged to have induced an assistant united states attorney to initiate a prosecution.see id.at.the court explained that the postal inspectors were strangers to the prosecutorial process and,therefore,did not enjoy prosecutorial immunity.see id.at.
hartman is easily distinguishable.here,unlike in hartman,the defendant is not an outsider who seeks to persuade a prosecutor to initiate a proceeding.rather,the secretary is the official statutorily charged with enforcing the act.that the secretary may have ordered subordinates to carry out his prosecutorial functions is not equivalent to inducement.compare,the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed defining order as t o issue a command or instruction,with,id.at defining induce as t o lead or move,as to a course of action,by influence or persuasion.in the last analysis,it is difficult to fatho
