opinion of the court 
in this appeal,we consider whether the secretary of labor retained jurisdiction to impose sanctions for violations of visa regulations when she failed to act until eighteen months after the time period prescribed by statute for her actions had expired.we conclude that,under the analysis prescribed by the supreme court in brock pierce county,d,the secretary had jurisdiction to act after the deadline passed.
cyberworld enterprise technologies is a temporary staffing company that obtains visas for its employees and then places the employees with other companies,known as secondary employers.under federal law,cyberworld is required to inquire of the secondary employer whether the hiring of an employee will cause a united states worker to be laid off,or displaced.on august,the department of labor received a complaint that cyberworld had failed to comply with this requirement.although the department was required by law to determine within thirty days whether a reasonable basis existed for the complaint,it did not make this determination until march,when it found that cyberworld had failed to make the required inquiries on fourteen occasions.as provided for by statute,the secretary of labor assessed a penalty and notified the attorney general to deny cyberworld b applications for the ensuing year.
after unsuccessfully challenging these sanctions through an administrative appeal,cyberworld brought an action in federal district court against the secretary and other officials under the administrative procedure act apa,contending that the secretary was without jurisdiction to impose sanctions because she had failed to act before the deadline.cyberworld also contended that the secretary action was untimely under the doctrine of laches,that sanctions were improper because cyberworld had not knowingly violated the statute,that the sanctions imposed were not authorized by department of labor regulations,and that the secretary should have exercised her discretion not to impose sanctions.the district court granted summary judgment to the government defendants.like the district court,we are not persuaded by cyberworld arguments,and will affirm the district court order granting summary judgment.
the visa program is designed to allow professionals from other countries who are employed in specialty occupations to work in the united states on a temporary basis.employers obtain visas for their employees by filing certain applications with the department of labor and the department of homeland security.see id.employees either work directly for the employer who obtained the visa or are placed with other employers in need of specialty labor.as a temporary staffing agency,cyberworld places its employees with other employers and is therefore known as a placing employer.since the bulk of cyberworld workforce consists of employees,it is also known as an employer.
in order to obtain visas for their employees,employers must file a labor condition application lca with the department of labor under procedures set forth by n,which was incorporated into the immigration and nationality act ina by the immigration act of the act and later amended by the american competitiveness and workforce improvement act of acwia.see,stat,stat,to.as part of this application,an employer must make several attestations required by n,including that the employer will pay employees no less than the prevailing wage for that type of job that the employer current employees are not on strike that the employer has notified its employees of its intent to hire workers and that the employer has attempted to recruit employees in the united states to fill its positions.
the attestation requirement relevant here was enacted by the acwia,and requires that placing employers attest in the lca that they have confirmed with secondary employers that the hiring of an employee will not displace a united states worker employed by the secondary employer.specifically,n f provides that the lca must state that 
the employer will not place the nonimmigrant with another employer regardless of whether or not such other employer is an employer where 
i the nonimmigrant performs duties in whole or in part at one or more worksites owned,operated,or controlled by such other employer and 
ii there are indicia of an employment relationship between the nonimmigrant and such other employer 
unless the employer has inquired of the other employer as to whether,and has no knowledge that,within the period beginning days before and ending days after the date of the placement of the nonimmigrant with the other employer,the other employer has displaced or intends to displace a united states worker employed by the other employer.

the inquiry requirement is also contained in department of labor regulations 
the employer is prohibited from placing the b nonimmigrant with another employer,unless the employer has inquired of the employer as to whether,and has no knowledge that,within the period beginning days before and ending days after the date of such placement,the employer has displaced or intends to displace a worker employed by such employer.
d emphases added.the regulations then set forth standards and guidance that apply to the inquiry obligation.id.
the secretary is required to certify an lca within seven days unless she finds that the application is incomplete or obviously inaccurate.n.thus,she is not generally permitted to investigate the veracity of the employer attestations on the lca prior to certification.however,she is required to investigate complaints regarding an employer failure to meet a condition of n or misrepresentation of material facts in an lca.n a.such complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization,and must be filed not later than months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation.id.
the statute mandates that the secretary shall provide,within days after the date such a complaint is filed,for a determination as to whether or not a reasonable basis exists to make a finding described in subparagraph c.n b emphases added as relevant here,subparagraph c refers to a failure to meet a condition of paragraph f,which sets out the inquiry obligation described above.n c i.
department regulations delegate the reasonable basis determination to the administrator of the wage and hour division the administrator,see,and impose a deadline for the administrator to issue this determination.
if the administrator determines that an investigation on a complaint is warranted,the complaint shall be accepted for filing an investigation shall be conducted and a determination issued within calendar days of the date of filing.the time for the investigation may be increased with the consent of the employer and the complainant,or if,for reasons outside of the control of the administrator,the administrator needs additional time to obtain information needed from the employer or other sources to determine whether a violation has occurred.no hearing or appeal pursuant to this subpart shall be available regarding the administrator determination that an investigation on a complaint is warranted.
a emphases added.
if the department ultimately determines that the inquiry requirement was violated,the statute provides for monetary penalties and a suspension of future approvals of applications 
if the secretary finds,after notice and opportunity for a hearing,a failure to meet a condition of paragraph b,e,or f,a substantial failure to meet a condition of paragraph c,d,or g i i,or a misrepresentation of material fact in an application 
i the secretary shall notify the attorney general of such finding and may,in addition,impose such other administrative remedies including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed per violation as the secretary determines to be appropriate and 
ii the attorney general shall not approve petitions filed with respect to that employer under section or c of this title during a period of at least year for aliens to be employed by the employer.
n c i emphases added.the suspension required by n c i ii is known as debarment.
the department regulations provide for the same sanctions 
b civil money penalties.the administrator may assess civil money penalties for violations as follows 
an amount not to exceed per violation for 
i a violation pertaining to or displacement of workers 
d disqualification from approval of petitions.the administrator shall notify the department of homeland security pursuant to that the employer shall be disqualified from approval of any petitions filed by,or on behalf of,the employer pursuant to section or section c of the ina for the following periods 
at least one year for violation s of any of the provisions specified in paragraph b i through iii of this section 
emphases added.
on august,the department wage and hour division received a complaint regarding cyberworld compliance with n.the division then investigated the complaint,and on march,over nineteen months after receiving the complaint,the administrator issued his reasonable basis determination,finding that cyberworld had failed to make the required displacement inquiry of the secondary employer.app.the administrator assessed a penalty and determined that the attorney general would be notified of the violation so that he could impose a debarment 
cyberworld filed an administrative appeal.the company conceded that it had failed to make the required displacement inquiry with respect to each of the fourteen lcas that it submitted between january,and october.it also stipulated that the fourteen workers whom it placed with secondary employers during this period perform ed duties for the other employers and that there were indicia of an employment relationship between the b workers and the other employers,thus satisfying the other elements of a n f violation.however,cyberworld challenged the secretary jurisdiction to act after the deadline,as well as her authority to impose sanctions without proof of scienter.an administrative law judge alj rejected these arguments and affirmed the determination that cyberworld was subject to sanctions.cyberworld then appealed to the department of labor administrative review board,which summarily affirmed on the grounds provided by the alj.cyberworld then filed a complaint under the apa in federal district court,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.
the government defendants moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted the motion.relying on the supreme court decision in pierce county,the district court held that the language in n b providing that the secretary shall make a determination within thirty days does not deprive the secretary of jurisdiction to issue such a determination after the thirty days have expired.the district court also rejected cyberworld argument that the secretary action was foreclosed by the doctrine of laches,since cyberworld had failed to show that it was prejudiced by the secretary delay.finally,the court concluded that the secretary was not required to show any knowledge on the part of cyberworld,and that the secretary had correctly determined that the debarment was required by law.
the district court had jurisdiction over this case under and the apa,and.we have jurisdiction under.
when reviewing a grant of summary judgment in a case brought under the apa,we apply de novo review to the district court ruling,and in turn apply the applicable standard of review to the underlying agency decision.concerned citizens alliance,slater,cir.an agency decision based on an issue of law that does not implicate agency expertise in a meaningful way,like the secretary decision in this case,is subject to de novo review.sandoval reno,cir.
cyberworld principal argument is that because n b states that the secretary shall make a determination within thirty days,and the word shall has a mandatory meaning,the secretary lost jurisdiction to take action against it by failing to issue a reasonable basis determination within thirty days of receiving the complaint against cyberworld.
this argument is foreclosed by the supreme court decision in brock pierce county.in pierce county,the court considered a deadline imposed on the secretary of labor by another statute,the comprehensive employment and training act ceta,which authorized the secretary to issue grants for job training and employment.at.the ceta also authorized the secretary to investigate complaints that ceta funds were being misused,but require d that the secretary shall determine the truth of the allegation or belief involved,not later than days after receiving the complaint.id.at.quoting b supp.v repealed.the secretary issued this determination with respect to pierce county nearly thirty months after receiving a complaint,and thus failed to meet the deadline.id.at.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that the limit was jurisdictional,and determined that the secretary thus lost his power to issue a determination after the expiration of the days.id.at.
the supreme court reversed,concluding that the mere use of the word shall,standing alone,is not enough to remove the secretary power to act after the deadline.id.at.the court noted that it was most reluctant to conclude that every failure of an agency to observe a procedural requirement voids subsequent agency action,especially when important public rights are at stake.id.at.it therefore studied the language and legislative history of the ceta to determine whether congress did indeed desire the somewhat incongruous result of depriving the secretary of his authority after the expiration of this deadline,and adopted a line of precedent holding that a statutory time limit does not divest an agency of jurisdiction unless the statute specifies a consequence for failure to comply with the provision.id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.after reviewing the ceta language and legislative history,the court found that there was nothing to suggest that congress intended to impose a jurisdictional limitation on agency action.id.at.
the court also discussed and rejected several opposing arguments.first,it distinguished pierce county from an earlier case,mohasco silver,d,in which the court had held that an action filed by a private plaintiff after the expiration of the time period provided in the civil rights act of was jurisdictionally barred.at.the court noted that while legislatures routinely create statutes of limitations for the filing of complaints with jurisdictional effects,t here was less reason to believe that congress intended such drastic consequences to follow from the secretary failure to meet the deadline,because the ceta requires him to resolve the entire dispute within that time.id.this is a more substantial task than filing a complaint,and is subject to factors beyond the secretary control.id.moreover,unlike in mohasco,which involved a private right of action,public rights are at stake,and the secretary delay would prejudice the rights of the taxpaying public.id.
second,the court rejected the argument that agencies should be permitted to act after the expiration of a deadline only when agency inaction would prejudice a private citizen seeking some sort of redress.id.at.the court noted that the protection of the public fisc is a matter that is of interest to every citizen,and we have no evidence that congress wanted to permit the secretary inaction to harm that interest.id.at.
third,the court rejected the argument that the secretary had also lost jurisdiction by failing to comply with administrative regulations establishing a deadline.as with the statutory deadline,the court noted that the regulations do not specify any consequences of a failure to meet that deadline.id.at.
the supreme court has since summarized the holding of pierce county as follows i f a statute does not specify a consequence for noncompliance with statutory timing provisions,the federal courts will not in the ordinary course impose their own coercive sanction.united states james daniel good real,d.thus,a statute directing official action needs more than a mandatory shall before the grant of power can sensibly be read to expire when the job is supposed to be done,and we will not construe a provision that the government shall act within a specified time,without more,as a jurisdictional limit precluding action later.barnhart peabody coal,d.
cyberworld attempts to distinguish this case from pierce county on three grounds.
first,according to cyberworld,pierce county applies only when an agency is required to complete a substantial task by the statutory deadline.cyberworld notes that under the ceta the secretary was required to resolve the entire dispute within the statutory time period,at,but that under n she is only required to make a determination as to whether or not a reasonable basis exists for finding a violation,n b.however,pierce county never limited its holding to cases where an agency must complete a substantial task.rather,it used that language to explain why a deadline for administrative action is not comparable to a statute of limitations in private litigation,which the court had held in mohasco to be jurisdictional.in any event,similar to the actions required by the ceta,the administrator under n issues a determination only after an investigation,must explain his reasoning in the determination,and must prescribe remedies for any violation that he finds.a,c.thus,even assuming arguendo that the nature of the task is a relevant consideration,the task here is not insubstantial.
second,cyberworld contends that pierce county applies only when an agency is acting to protect a public right or the public fisc.in pierce county,the court noted that it was especially reluctant to impose jurisdictional limitations on an agency trying to protect public rights and the public fisc,at,and explained that this was one reason why mohasco was distinguishable from actions under the ceta,id.at.here,like in pierce county,the rights that the secretary seeks to vindicate are of a public nature,since she is acting to protect the workforce from displacement by recipients and to enforce the rules of the immigration system.
third,cyberworld contends that even if the statutory deadline did not foreclose the secretary actions,the regulatory deadline imposed by a would bar her actions.under pierce county,we evaluate regulatory deadlines in the same manner as statutory deadlines,by determining whether a regulation specif ies any consequences of a failure to meet its deadline.at.nothing in indicates that any consequence results from a failure to issue a determination within thirty days.as the court of appeals for the seventh circuit has held,absent a clear indication to the contrary,regulatory deadlines,like statutory deadlines,provide no remedy for their own violation.hendrickson fdic,cir.
pierce county thus controls here,and requires that we analyze the express language of the statute,as well as its structure,purpose,and legislative history,to determine whether congress intended to remove the secretary authority to act after the deadline.barnhart,at.we find nothing in the language,structure,purpose,or legislative history of n to support cyberworld claim that congress had this intent.
the only relevant piece of statutory language cited by cyberworld is the word shall.cyberworld correctly argues that shall usually has a mandatory meaning.however,by virtue of pierce county,we can not rely on the word shall alone to conclude that congress intended for the secretary to lose her power to act.this is especially true given that n was enacted several years after pierce county,once congress was presumably aware that courts do not readily infer congressional intent to limit an agency power to get a mandatory job done merely from a specification to act by a certain time.barnhart,at.nothing else in the statute language indicates that congress intended to limit the secretary power after the expiration of thirty days,or to impose any other consequence for her failure to meet the deadline.
cyberworld also points to the other instances of the word shall in n b,and argues that if we allow the secretary to exercise jurisdiction after the statutory deadline has passed,we must construe the other instances of shall in a similarly permissive manner.if shall is not mandatory,it argues,then the secretary would not be required to give notice of her determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing,or to make a finding after the hearing.n b.this argument overstates the impact of pierce county.pierce county does not deprive the word shall of its mandatory force.the secretary is still required by n b to make a reasonable basis determination,to give notice of that determination to interested parties,to hold a hearing if requested,and then to make a further determination after the hearing.pierce county does,however,prevent us from reading the word shall so expansively as to mean that the secretary was forbidden from imposing sanctions because she failed to comply with the statute procedural requirement that she act within thirty days.at.
cyberworld also cites a statement in the legislative history of the act that the secretary of labor is to investigate and determine within thirty days if there is reasonable cause for finding a violation.pt,at,cong,emphasis added,and argues that the phrase is to demonstrates that congress intended for the word shall to have a mandatory meaning.even without relying on this legislative history,we agree that the word shall has a mandatory meaning.as in pierce county,however,this legislative history does not suggest that congress intended to impose a jurisdictional limitation on agency action occurring after the period.at.
indeed,the legislative history and purpose of n offer no support for cyberworld position.a report of the house committee on the judiciary regarding the act,which first implemented the process and timetable that are still in place today,demonstrates that congress was concerned with remedying the prior system,which had neither serve d business needs nor protect ed the domestic labor force,in part because of lengthy processing delays in issuing the visas.pt,at,cong.although the committee report refers to the deadline,it does not explain why the reasonable basis determination must be issued so quickly.id.at.when the acwia later added several provisions regarding the displacement of workers,including the inquiry requirement at issue here,congress emphasized its goal of ensur ing that companies will not replace american workers with foreign born professionals,such as by replacing a particular worker with a particular covered b worker.cong.rec,statement of abraham.again,however,the legislative history is silent as to the reasons for applying the deadline to reasonable basis determinations regarding the inquiry requirement.id.at.
thus,while the act made the investigative process and imposed deadlines to eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic processing,the deadline was certainly not a goal of the statute.the same is true of the acwia application of this deadline to investigations of the inquiry requirement.to the contrary,a primary goal of the act and the acwia was to prevent displacement of the american workforce.although congress was cognizant of the impact of government procedures on employers and workers,we can find no evidence that it intended to make the interests of employers paramount to the enforcement of regulations designed to prevent displacement.this is especially true given the federal government strong interest,which is not even shared with the states,in regulating immigration.if the federal government were prevented from acting after the deadline,the statute displacement requirements would be left essentially unregulated.we see no indication that congress intended such a drastic result.
we agree with cyberworld that nineteen months is a long period of time for an agency to take before acting when the governing statute specifies that the agency shall act within thirty days.nonetheless,since congress did not prevent the secretary from acting after the deadline had expired,pierce county dictates the conclusion that the secretary had jurisdiction to act when she did.
cyberworld also argues that the doctrine of laches bars the imposition of sanctions because of the secretary delay in issuing the determination,that it was entitled to discovery to establish facts supporting
