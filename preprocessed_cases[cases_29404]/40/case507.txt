on july,the district court in the barceloneta case arrived at the opposite conclusion municipalities must be compensated for the use of their rights of way liberty cablevision of puerto rico municipality of barceloneta,d.in so holding,the court found that these municipalities are owners of the,and must be compensated as such,while the franchise fee paid to the board solely encompasses access.id.at.the court pointed out that unlike most united states jurisdictions where the municipality is both the franchisor and owner of the,in puerto rico,the board is the franchisor,but a different entity,the municipality,is the owner of the rights of way being utilized.id.at.thus,the court ordered liberty to pay the board a franchise fee of of the gross revenues it derives from all municipalities,and,in addition,pay barceloneta and las piedras of the gross revenues from services it derives from those municipalities id.at.the court also recognized that the municipalities would be able to state a federal takings claim for liberty use of their once they had exhausted the state remedy of an inverse condemnation action.id.at.
this appeal follows.for the sake of the parties dual roles as both appellants and appellees,and given their myriad organize the issues as follows whether the cable act preempts these municipal ordinances whether the municipal fees are nonetheless justified under of the telecommunications act of due to liberty provision of cable modem service and whether the municipalities are entitled to just compensation for the alleged constitutional takings.as always,we review these abstract issues of law de novo.see,global naps,verizon new england,cir.
