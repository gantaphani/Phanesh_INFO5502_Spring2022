rita miller,a former employee of the clinton county probation office,brought this civil rights action against the president judge of the court of common pleas of clinton county,pennsylvania,richard saxton,pursuant to.miller complaint asserts that judge saxton terminated her employment in violation of her first amendment right to free speech,and her fourteenth amendment right to due process 
judge saxton moved to dismiss miller complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to.b.alternatively,he claimed that he was entitled to qualified immunity even if miller complaint stated a cause of action.he also moved for a more definite statement pursuant to.e in order to resolve any issue of fact that may have precluded a grant of qualified immunity.the district court denied judge saxton motion to dismiss as well as his rule e motion for a more definite statement and this appeal followed.for the following reasons,we will reverse.
factual background 
miller was employed as an adult probation officer by the clinton county probation office.the probation office employees had a collective bargaining agreement with the county.according to miller,one of her supervisors was ineffective and unprofessional.the supervisor allegedly referred to probationers as scum,and openly stated that they did not deserve the money that the probation office spent on them.
on january,miller wrote a letter to judge saxton expressing her dissatisfaction with the probation office.the letter was very short.in the letter,miller stated 
t he reason i am writing to you now is that i can no longer work under the stressful conditions which must endure since foresman has become my supervisor.i have tolerated intimidation and hostility from rosamilia numerous times throughout my employment with the county.i know that you are friends with both of them and you may not appreciate my candor but i believe that the time has come to explain my position to the court.
miller also complained that supervisor foresman asked her to identify probationers whose restitution payments were in arrears,and she complained about foresman suspending her because her clients were delinquent in those payments.she claimed that there was a difference in philosophy between herself and foresman.according to the letter,that difference was that miller believes in rehabilitation for most clients,whereas foresman believes the clients are scum and no money should be wasted on them.
judge saxton fired miller immediately after receiving her letter.soon thereafter,miller brought this suit under.she alleged a constitutionally protected property interest in her continued employment,and claimed that the failure to provide her with adequate notice and opportunity to respond was a violation of the fourteenth amendment guarantee of due process.she also asserted that her expression was protected under the first amendment guarantee of free speech and that she had been improperly terminated for exercising her right to free speech.
as we noted at the outset,judge saxton moved to dismiss miller claims under federal rule of civil procedure b.he also claimed immunity from suit.for reasons that are not at all apparent on this record,miller did not attach her letter to her complaint.however,judge saxton appended it to his motion to dismiss and asked the court to convert that motion to a motion for summary judgment in the alternative.in addition,he asked the court to require miller to provide a more definitive statement of the basis for her claim pursuant to.e,if his motion to dismiss or for summary judgment was denied.
the district court denied judge saxton b motion and refused to convert it to a summary judgment motion.the court concluded that judge saxton had not established that he was entitled to qualified immunity because the record did not support his claim that he had not violated miller clearly established constitutional rights.although the court also ruled that the pleadings were insufficient to determine if miller termination was the result of retaliation for protected speech,the court refused to consider miller letter appended to judge saxton motion to dismiss.the district court ruled that the letter did not sufficiently supplement the record to allow for summary judgment.the court also denied judge saxton rule e motion.finally,the court concluded that miller due process claim could not be dismissed at the pleading stage because she alleged that the terms of her employment were governed by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.this appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
a denial of qualified immunity is a final judgment subject to immediate appeal within the meaning of.behrens pelletier,d.thus,we have jurisdiction to review the district court denial of judge saxton motion to dismiss or for summary judgment.our review is plenary.doe groody,cir.
iii.discussion 
the doctrine of qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.qualified immunity is not merely a defense,but is an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.saucier katz,d citation omitted.therefore,any claim of qualified immunity must be resolved at the earliest possible stage of litigation.id.at.
in saucier,the supreme court made clear that claims for qualified immunity are to be evaluated using a process.id.at.first,we must decide whether the facts,taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,show a constitutional violation.if the plaintiff fails to make out a constitutional violation,the qualified immunity inquiry is at an end the officer is entitled to immunity.bennett murphy,cir.once it is determined that evidence of a constitutional violation has been adduced,courts evaluating a qualified immunity claim move to the second step of the analysis to determine whether the constitutional right was clearly established.id.
based on our phased inquiry under saucier,we conclude the district court erred in not dismissing miller complaint because her allegations do not establish either a violation of her right to free speech under the first amendment,or a denial of due process.as the court explained in saucier,i f no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established,there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.at.
first amendment retaliation claim 
in pickering bd.of,d,the supreme court first held that a public employee does not relinquish first amendment rights to comment on matters of public interest by virtue of government employment.thus,a public employer may not discharge an employee for a reason that infringes upon that employee constitutionally protected interest in the freedom of speech.rankin mcpherson,d.nevertheless,public employers are still employers,and they therefore have the same concern for efficiency and the need to review and evaluate employees as any other employer in order to ensure that the actions of employees do not interfere with the performance of public functions.id.at.on the other hand,the court recognized that the threat of dismissal from public employment is a potent means of inhibiting speech.id.at.quoting pickering,at.
thus,in order to determine if a public employer termination of an employee violates the constitutional guarantee of free speech,we must balance between the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the public employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employee.pickering,at.see also connick myers,d.
that balance turns on a inquiry.watters city of philadelphia,cir.accordingly,in order for miller to establish an unconstitutional firing,she must establish that her speech was protected,and that it was a motivating factor in the alleged retaliatory dismissal.id.citations omitted.if she does so,judge saxton must then establish that he would have taken the same employment action even in the absence of the protected conduct.id.citation omitted.
at this stage,we are only concerned with the first part of that the speech was protected and that is solely a question of law.to be protected,the speech must implicate a matter of public concern and must outweigh the employer interest in the effective operations of its public services.speech implicates a matter of public concern if the content,form,and context establish that the speech involves a matter of political,social,or other concern to the community.connick,at.if the speech touches on a matter of public concern,we must then balance the employee interest in engaging in her speech with the employer countervailing interests,including the employer prerogative of removing employees whose conduct impairs performance and concerns for the morale of the workplace,harmonious relationships among,and the regular operation of the enterprise.id.at.the balancing we must undertake is a inquiry that requires consideration of the entire record,and must yield different results depending on the relative strengths of the issue of public concern and the employer interest.id.at.no one factor controls the inquiry.
our inquiry is guided by the supreme court resolution of these competing interests in connick,supra.sheila myers was an assistant district attorney in new orleans who strongly opposed the district attorney,harry connick,in his plan to transfer her to another district.she voiced that opposition to connick policies to her direct supervisor who told her that others did not share her concerns.myers responded by distributing a questionnaire that solicited the view of her fellow staff members concerning office transfer policy,office morale,the need for a grievance committee,the level of confidence in supervisors,and whether employees felt pressured to work on political campaigns.sometime after the questionnaire was circulated,myers supervisor told connick that it was causing a in the office.connick responded by firing myers for refusing to accept the transfer.he also told her that circulating the questionnaire was an act of insubordination.myers responded by bringing a civil rights action under in which she alleged that the firing violated her first amendment right of free speech.the district court agreed and ordered her reinstated with compensation including attorney fees.the court concluded that she had actually been fired for circulating the questionnaire,that the questionnaire involved matters of public concern,and that the state had not clearly demonstrated that it substantially interfered with the operations of the district attorney office.id.at.connick appealed to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit,which affirmed on the basis of the district court opinion.connick then sought review in the supreme court by way of certiorari,which was granted.
the supreme court began its analysis by stating that f or at least years,it has been settled that a state can not condition public employment on a basis that infringes the employee constitutionally protected interest in freedom of expression.id.the court then explained that in order to resolve myers claim,it must as explained in pickering,seek a balance between the interests of the employee,as citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the court recognized the state interest as employer in promoting efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.id.quoting pickering,at.
after examining myers questionnaire,and the surrounding circumstances,the court concluded that questions pertaining to the transfer policy,her fellow employees confidence and trust in their supervisors,office morale,and the need for a grievance committee were merely extensions of myers dispute over her transfer.id.at.those questions were not intended to shed light on any actual or potential wrongdoing or breach of the public trust by the district attorney office.rather,they were merely an expression of myers personal grievance against connick.accordingly,they did not constitute matters of public concern.id.
the court believed that the only expression touching upon a matter of public concern was the inquiry into whether connick pressured employees to work on political campaigns.id.at.however,after viewing the statement in context and considering the circumstances in which she circulated it,the court held that one expression of public concern did not outweigh the district attorney interest in the efficient operation of his office because the questionnaire as a whole was of such limited value to the public.id.at.taken as a whole,it challenged the authority of myers supervisor,questioned the application of a transfer policy as applied to her,and undermined the close working relationships necessary for the effective functioning of the district attorney office.id.that did not outweigh the employer right to terminate myers id.
here,miller statements that the clinton county probation office was being run ineffectively,and that her supervisors called probation clients scum undoubtedly refer to matters of public concern.connick,at.stating that speech involves a matter of public concern if it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community.indeed,the public concern over the manner in which a probation office supervises probationers in the criminal justice system is obvious.
connick and its progeny illustrate the extent to which we must view miller statements in context with the entire letter.we can not cherry pick something that may impact the public while ignoring the manner and context in which that statement was made or that public concern expressed.our inquiry must also consider the form and circumstance of the speech in question.
the district court refused to consider the entirety of miller letter because it did not believe that judge saxton appending the letter to his motion was sufficient to convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.we disagree.a court may consider an undisputedly authentic document that a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiffs claims are based on the document.pension benefit guar.white consol,cir 
miller claims are undisputably based on her january,letter to president judge saxton,and only upon that letter.moreover,in her complaint,miller appropriately makes numerous references to the letter as the entirety of her speech is contained in it we find no reason why the district court should not have considered the letter in deciding the motion to dismiss,or in converting the motion to a motion for summary judgment.we will therefore consider the entirety of the letter in this appeal.see pension benefit guaranty white consolidated industries,at considering a document on appeal that the district court did not consider while deciding a motion to dismiss 
upon considering the entirety of miller letter it is obvious that,although a small portion of the letter touches upon a matter of public concern,the context in which the statement occurs establishes that the speech is not protected.miller letter focused upon her private grievances as an employee.her statements about the ineffective operation of the probation office,and her concerns about her supervisor comments that the probationers are scum,are collateral to the thrust of her complaint.she quite clearly states t he reason i am writing to you now is that i can no longer work under the stressful conditions which must endure since foresman has become my supervisor.that declaration provides the context for all that follows.miller was upset with foresman supervision of her,and could no longer tolerate being supervised by her.in that context,the brief references to an issue of public concern she can hardly be interpreted as manifesting anything other than a personal gripe not unlike that voiced in myers questionnaire.see connick,at.myers acknowledges that it is no coincidence that the questionnaire followed upon the heels of the transfer notice.the personal context in which miller letter
