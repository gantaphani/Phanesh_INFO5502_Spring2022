opinion of the court 
appellant ted kosenske brought this qui tam action under the false claims act,et,against carlisle hma,hma,and its parent company,health management associates.the complaint alleged that they submitted outpatient hospital claims to the medicare program and other federal healthcare programs,falsely certifying that such claims were in compliance with the stark act,the act,and the act.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the defendants motion and denied the plaintiff motion.this appeal followed.
this appeal presents two principal issues.first,we must decide whether the exclusive service arrangement between kosenske former practice,blue mountain anesthesia associates,bmaa,and defendants,in which bmaa provided pain management services at an outpatient hma clinic,triggered the restrictions placed by the stark and acts on the submissions of claims for services rendered following referrals by a physician having a financial relationship with the service provider.we conclude that the stark and acts were implicated.second,we must determine if the arrangement between bmaa and hma satisfied the personal service exception to the stark act and the substantially identical safe harbor provision of the act.we conclude that it did not.it follows that summary judgment was wrongly awarded to hma.accordingly,we will reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.because the parties agree that,in the context of this case,the requirements of the act and its implementary regulations are indistinguishable from those of the stark act,we refer only to the latter in the following analysis.
bmaa,a group of four physicians that practiced anesthesiology,engaged in negotiations with carlisle hospital and health systems chhs,culminating in an anesthesiology services agreement the agreement dated december.kosenske was a member of that group.
the purpose of the agreement was to establish an exclusive service arrangement under which bmaa would provide all anesthesia services required by the hospital patients at chhs hospital in carlisle,pennsylvania the hospital.while no pain management services were being performed by bmaa physicians at the hospital in,the agreement contemplated that such services might be rendered in the future.the agreement essentially provided that bmaa would provide anesthesia coverage for hospital patients on a basis the hospital would provide at no charge the space,equipment and supplies reasonably necessary and economical for bmaa to provide these anesthesiology services bmaa would use the personnel,space,equipment and supplies provided by the hospital solely for the practice of anesthesiology and pain management for the hospital patients the hospital would not allow anyone other than bmaa physicians to provide anesthesia or pain management services at the hospital and bmaa physicians would not practice anesthesia or pain management at any location other than the hospital and such other facilities and locations as may be operated by hospital and carlisle hospital health services chhs,the entity which owns hospital.ja at.
it is helpful to note at the outset two limitations on the obligations of bmaa under the carefully drafted agreement.first,as the section of the agreement we have just quoted suggests and as the remainder of the agreement confirms,hospital refers only to the carlisle hospital located at parker street,carlisle,pennsylvania.ja at.thus,the patients that bmaa committed itself to provide anesthesia services for were the patients in the existing facility of the carlisle hospital.while it is true that the agreement contains a few provisions that contemplated the possibility of bmaa services being performed elsewhere,those provisions only confirm that bmaa commitment under this agreement to provide services was limited to that facility.section,for example,provides as follows 
in the event that hospital or chhs obtains,opens,or operates another facility or location at which anesthesiology or pain management services are required or offered,hospital and chhs shall offer bmaa the opportunity to provide exclusive anesthesiology and pain management services at such new facility or location under the same terms and conditions as provided in this agreement,to the fullest extent that the hospital chhs is able to contract with bmaa to provide such services on the same terms and conditions as set forth herein.should hospital chhs be unable,for any lawful reason,to enter into a contract with bmaa to provide such services on the same terms and conditions as set forth herein,then hospital chhs shall offer bmaa the first opportunity to provide exclusive anesthesiology and pain management services at such new facility or location on whatever terms hospital chhs and bmaa may negotiate and,in the event that the parties are not able to negotiate an agreement for the provision of such exclusive services by bmaa,bmaa shall have the right of first refusal for any proposal or contract entered,offered,or made by hospital chhs with any other person or entity to provide anesthesiology or pain management services at such new facility.hospital chhs shall not enter into any agreement with any other provider without first offering to bmaa the opportunity and right to provide such exclusive services at such facility or location on identical terms offered to or negotiated with such other provider.
ja at emphasis added.
thus,understandably,bmaa was not committing itself to provide continuous service at any new facility that the hospital or chhs might choose to open in the future.rather,it insisted that if and when that happened they would either have to offer bmaa the opportunity to provide exclusive anesthesiology and pain management services in the new facility under the same terms and conditions or would have to provide bmaa with an opportunity to exercise a right of first refusal.in short,if bmaa were going to undertake the obligation of providing service beyond the patients of the then current facility,a new contract would be required.
second,while bmaa committed itself to satisfying all of the anesthesiology needs of the patients at the hospital,it did not similarly commit itself to provide pain management services.not surprisingly,given that no pain management services were being provided when the agreement was signed,bmaa only committed itself to devote such time as necessary to provide anesthesia services to hospital patients and provide anesthesiology consultation to other physicians in the medical staff as needed,including reasonable emergency response on a hour a day,day per week basis.ja at.
the agreement,while using the terms anesthesiology and pain management as distinct fields of practice,did not define these terms.in context,however,anesthesiology is used in the traditional practice of administering anesthesia to patients undergoing a surgical procedure.accordingly,it is a hospital or practice.the practice of pain management,as commonly understood,involves the evaluation and management of pain symptoms.it can be,but is not required to be.this distinction between anesthesiology and pain management is relevant in the context of the stark act because it bears on the issue of referrals.as the department of health and human services hhs has recognized,with traditional practices like anesthesiology,it is typically the hospitals that are in a position to influence the flow of business to the physicians,rather than the physicians making referrals to the hospitals.oig supplemental compliance program guidance for hospitals.in such situations,hhs is primarily concerned with any remuneration flowing from anesthesiologists to the hospital.with respect to a pain management practice that is not a practice,the concerns are different.patients typically come to see pain management physicians for office visits,and the physicians frequently order tests or procedures at a hospital,lab,or other facility.thus,in pain management,a physician in an outpatient facility is in a position to generate substantial business for a hospital.see id.at noting that p hysicians are the primary referral source for hospitals.therefore,hhs concern would be with remuneration flowing from the hospital to the physicians in order to induce the physicians to provide business for the hospital.
approximately fifteen months after signing the agreement,kosenske and a hospital nurse began administering pain management services,in addition to traditional anesthesia,to hospital patients.because there was no dedicated space for pain management services,kosenske saw these patients in space used for other hospital purposes.
in,the hospital built a new,facility,containing an outpatient ambulatory surgery center and a pain clinic the pain clinic,which was located about three miles away from the hospital.from the day of its opening,bmaa provided pain management services to patients in the pain clinic,and the hospital did not charge bmaa rent for the space and equipment,or a fee for the support personnel it provided to bmaa at the pain clinic.bmaa provided a physician to see patients in the pain clinic,and this physician when serving there did not have other anesthesiology duties at the hospital.as with the anesthesia services,bmaa physicians submitted claims to medicare for the professional services performed during these visits,and the hospital submitted claims for the facility and technical component of the visits.no one other than bmaa provided pain management services at the pain clinic.however,the parties did not amend the agreement or enter into a new agreement.
in june,hma purchased the hospital from chhs,as an asset purchase,and renamed it carlisle regional medical center.the agreement was not assigned to hma,but both hma and bmaa acted as if the agreement were still in effect at the hospital.we will assume,without deciding,that hma was chhs successor under the applicable law.

section a of the stark act provides,in pertinent part 
if a physician or an immediate family member of such physician has a financial relationship with an entity specified in paragraph,then a the physician may not make a referral to the entity for the furnishing of designated health services for which payment otherwise may be made under this subchapter,and b the entity may not present or cause to be presented a claim under this subchapter or bill to any individual,third party payor,or other entity for designated health services furnished pursuant to a referral prohibited under subparagraph a.
a.under the act,a physician has a financial relationship with an entity if the physician has an ownership or investment interest in the entity,or a compensation arrangement with it.a.a compensation arrangement consists,with certain exceptions not here relevant,of any arrangement involving any remuneration between a physician and an entity h a.the term remuneration includes any remuneration,directly or indirectly,overtly or covertly,in cash or in kind.h b.the stark act defines referral as the request by a physician for the item or service,including the request by a physician for a consultation with another physician and any test or procedure ordered by,or to be performed by or under the supervision of that other physician.h a.the goal of the act is to curb overutilization of services by physicians who could profit by referring patients to facilities in which they have a financial interest.see sakowitz klein,the stark laws conquering physician conflicts of interest,geo.
the act contains exceptions to its broad prohibition,however,in order to exclude from the prohibition financial arrangements that exist for reasons independent of referrals.see barry furrow et,health law practitioner treatise series,ed.one such exception excludes personal service arrangements if 
i the arrangement is set out in writing,signed by the parties,and specifies the services covered by the arrangement,
ii the arrangement covers all of the services to be provided by the physician or an immediate family member of such physician to the entity,
iii the aggregate services contracted for do not exceed those that are reasonable and necessary for the legitimate business purposes of the arrangement,
iv the term of the arrangement is for at least year,
v the compensation to be paid over the term of the arrangement is set in advance,does not exceed fair market value,and except in the case of a physician incentive plan described in subparagraph b,is not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or other business generated between the parties,
vi the services to be performed under the arrangement do not involve the counseling or promotion or a business arrangement or other activity that violates any state or federal law,and 
vii the arrangement meets such other requirements as the secretary may impose by regulation as needed to protect against program or patient abuse.
the act defines fair market value as the value in arms length transactions,consistent with the general market value h.once the plaintiff or the government has established proof of each element of a violation under the act,the burden shifts to the defendant to establish that the conduct was protected by an exception.rogan,d at.
in the course of concluding that hma was entitled to summary judgment,the district court found that bmaa received numerous benefits as a result of its relationship to hma which constituted remuneration for purposes of the act and established a compensation arrangement and financial relationship between bmaa and hma.the court further concluded that bmaa physicians had requested services from the hospital that constituted referrals and that hma had submitted claims to medicare based on those services.the court held,however,that hma undisputed evidence had established that its arrangement with bmaa at the pain clinic was within the scope of the personal service exception of e a.
in the course of concluding that hma had carried its burden of demonstrating satisfaction of all elements of the personal service exception,the district court tacitly assumed that the agreement was applicable to bmaa service at the pain clinic and held that it satisfied the arrangement in writing requirement because all parties intended hma to succeed chhs under the agreement for purposes of the stark act.ja at.after concluding that the provisions of the agreement adequately address all of the anesthesiology and pain management services to be rendered by bmaa at the hospital and the pain management clinic,ja at,it turned to the issue of whether the agreement set forth in advance compensation to be provided for those services,which did not exceed their fair market value.the court concluded that this requirement of the personal service exception was satisfied even though hma had tendered no evidence regarding the market value of the space,equipment and staff services provided to bmaa a
