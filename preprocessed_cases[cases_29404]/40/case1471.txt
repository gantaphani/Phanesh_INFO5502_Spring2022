during the relevant time period,certain carriers,called dme regional carriers dme regional carriers,processed dme claims within designated regions of the country.during the relevant time period,the dme regional carrier for region c,which includes maryland,was palmetto government benefits administrators palmetto.notably,the region c dmepos supplier manual autumn included the following guidelines for coverage of the power wheelchairs at issue here 
the patient condition is such that without the use of a wheelchair the patient would otherwise be bed or chair confined and,
the patient condition is such that a wheelchair is medically necessary and the patient is unable to operate a wheelchair manually and,
the patient is capable of safely operating the controls for the power wheelchair.
the same manual further provided that a patient who requires a power wheelchair usually is totally nonambulatory and has severe weakness of the upper extremities due to a neurologic or muscular.in all cases,medicare part b coverage is limited to services that are medically reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness.a a.

it is the primary responsibility of those supplying beneficiaries with durable medical equipment,prostheses,orthoses and supplies dmepos to assure claims billed to medicare have the proper documentation accurately reflecting the beneficiary medical condition as it relates to the medicare coverage criteria by which claims are adjudicated by the durable medical equipment regional carrier dmerc.even if a supplier has a physician order on file,failure of the patient medical records to substantiate the condition for which medicare approves reimbursement subjects the supplier to liability for repayment of that reimbursement to the medicare program,and possibly to civil and criminal penalties.therefore,it is to the benefit of suppliers,medicare beneficiaries and the medicare trust fund that physicians be well informed about their role in evaluating,ordering and documenting the need of dmepos for their medicare patients.the better informed the physician about dmerc regional medical review policies rmrps and medicare coverage criteria for dmepos,the less likely the supplier frustration at filling orders for items that will not be,or should not have been,reimbursed.
emphasis added.
during the period at issue,september,through february,mackenzie submitted to palmetto,for reimbursement,claims for a total of power wheelchairs.mackenzie supported each claim solely with a completed cmn,which claims palmetto initially approved and made payment.
in april,palmetto initiated a audit because mackenzie had submitted an extremely high volume of claims for power wheelchairs more than of the medicare payments received by mackenzie during the time period used the same referring physician and of the beneficiaries receiving power wheelchairs from mackenzie during the relevant time period,did not previously have any prior wheelchair,such as a manual wheelchair,which failed to indicate a progression of a medical condition that might medically lead to the use of a power wheelchair.these concerns resulted in an audit by a medical investigator of a random sample of thirty out of the claims,of which failed to satisfy the requirements for medical necessity.
the medical investigator requested all relevant medical records from mackenzie and the treating physicians and concluded that for of the beneficiaries,the information and progress notes supplied are not sufficiently specific to warrant powered mobility within the confines of a home or apartment.while powered mobility might help extend the distance the beneficiary might be able to travel beyond the boundaries of the home,it must be needed for mobility within the home to be considered medically necessary by medicare.the audit report further noted that no physicians surveys or progress note
