opinion of the court 
we are asked on this appeal to resolve a conflict among the district courts in our circuit,most notably in pennsylvania,regarding the applicability of the statute of limitations enacted as part of the amendments to the individuals with disabilities education improvement act idea to compensatory education claims that are brought after the statute effective date but that arise from conduct that occurred before the statute passage we conclude that,because the statute of limitations did not become effective until seven months after the enactment of idea,it is reasonable to apply it to claims based on conduct that the law passage.accordingly,we will reverse the order of the district court and remand for further proceedings 
background 
steven was enrolled in the central bucks school district from the school year until his graduation from high school on june.he was first identified as learning disabled in kindergarten,and continued to be eligible for special education programming and services through his high school graduation.on may,steven parents initiated a due process hearing seeking compensatory education from the school year through the filing for failure to provide a free appropriate public education under idea and section of the rehabilitation act.
idea was enacted on december.it broke new ground by providing for a two year statute of limitations where there previously had been none.the statute of limitations provision,f c,took effect on july,seven months after the law was passed it provides 
a parent or agency shall request an impartial due process hearing within years of the date the parent or agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the,or,if the state has an explicit time limitation for requesting such a hearing under this subchapter,in such time as the state law allows 
in concluding that the statute of limitations does not bar claims that accrued prior to the effective date of that statute,the district court applied the retroactivity analysis that the supreme court set forth in landgraf usi film,and ins cyr,focusing on whether there is clear congressional intent that the statute be applied retroactively,and whether the retroactive application of the statute would have an impermissible effect,that is,would it take away or impair vested rights acquired under existing law,or create a new obligation,impose a new duty,or attach a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.landgraf,at.the district court noted that the first prong was not satisfied because congress did not expressly state in idea that its statute of limitations was to be applied retroactively.the district court further determined that,under the second prong,applying the idea statute of limitations would have an impermissible retroactive effect because to do so would impair rights that steven had prior to the amendment by attaching new legal consequences to events completed before the amendment effective date.steven cent.bucks sch,wl,at,internal citation omitted.
on appeal,the school district urges that we should not apply a retroactivity analysis to the amended statute of limitations and should instead look to whether idea,given the delay between the statute enactment and the effective date of the statute of limitations provision,gave sufficient notice and a reasonable opportunity for litigants to commence an action based on claims arising in the past.steven responds that the district court correctly applied the landgraf analysis in concluding that the idea statute of limitations should not apply retroactively.
ii.discussion 
the landgraf analysis is typically controlling on issues of retroactivity,in particular the application of new substantive requirements to conduct that occurred in the past.however,because the statute of limitations in idea governs steven conduct in filing the claim,not the school district conduct giving rise to the claim,we need not engage in a retroactivity analysis generally,retroactivity concerns do not bar a changed limitation period application to a suit filed after the amendment effective date.united states simmonds,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states hurst,cir see also vernon cassadaga valley cent.sch,cir retroactivity concerns,therefore,generally do not bar the application of a changed statute of limitations to a complaint filed after the amendment the conduct to which the statute of limitations applies is not the primary conduct of the defendants but is instead the secondary conduct of the plaintiffs,the filing of their suit.forest united states postal,cir finding that the application of a new statute of limitations is prospective because it applies to the filing of the complaint,which occurred after the statute was enacted smith zeneca,finding that retroactivity is not at issue when applying an amended statute of limitations where defendant conduct occurred prior to the amendment,because w hether or not suit has been filed within the statute of limitations is an act of the plaintiff,not the defendant.the only issue is which law applies to plaintiff acts,aff,cir.thus,retroactivity is not at issue here because it is undisputed that steven filed the claim after the effective date of the statute of limitations.
the principles governing the application of amended statutes of limitation were first set out by the supreme court over years ago 
a ll statutes of limitation must proceed on the idea that the party has full opportunity afforded him to try his right in the courts.a statute could not bar the existing rights of claimants without affording this opportunity it is essential that such statutes allow a reasonable time after they take effect for the commencement of suits upon existing causes of action though what shall be considered a reasonable time must be settled by the judgment of the legislature,and the courts will not inquire into the wisdom of its decision in establishing the period of legal bar,unless the time allowed is manifestly so insufficient that the statute becomes a denial of justice.
this court has often decided that statutes of limitation affecting existing rights are not unconstitutional,if a reasonable time is given for the commencement of an action before the bar takes effect.
it is difficult to see why,if the legislature may prescribe a limitation where none existed before,it may not change one which has already been established.the parties to a contract have no more a vested interest in a particular limitation which has been fixed than they have in an unrestricted right to sue.
in all such cases the question is one of reasonableness,and we have,therefore,only to consider whether the time allowed in this statute is,under all the circumstances,reasonable.of that the legislature is primarily the judge,and we can not overrule the decision of that department of the government,unless a palpable error has been committed for what is reasonable in a particular case depends upon its particular facts.

since wilson,courts have routinely noted that an amended statute of limitations can not be unfairly applied so as to bar an action without providing fair notice and a reasonable time for plaintiffs to bring their claims.simmonds,at see also ochoa hernandez y morales,i t is that statutes of limitations may be modified by shortening the time prescribed,but only if this be done while the time is still running,and so that a reasonable time still remains for the commencement of an action before the bar takes effect.internal quotation marks omitted kelly burlington,cir stating that it would be unfair to apply a new shortened statute of limitations to a cause of action which accrued prior to the new rule without affording the plaintiff a reasonable period in which to file his claim after the announcement of the new limitations period hanner,cir plaintiffs whose causes of action accrued before a new statute of limitations was enacted should be given a reasonable time within which to bring their actions.
