appellant edward wojcik wojcik and his wife,debra,brought suit against the massachusetts state lottery commission lottery commission and a handful of lottery commission officials for damages arising out of wojcik termination as a lottery commission employee.after dismissing the claims against one defendant on eleventh amendment grounds,the district court granted the remaining defendants motion for summary judgment on all of the claims under federal law the leftover claims were dismissed without prejudice.on appeal,wojcik claims error in the district court eleventh amendment and summary judgment rulings.finding none,we affirm.
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to appellant,drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.see mcintosh antonino,cir.
wojcik was hired by the lottery commission in.in,he held the position of field service manager in the lottery commission office in fairhaven,massachusetts.his employment history with the lottery commission was largely uneventful until august.on that day,he was confronted in the fairhaven office by the lottery commission general counsel,internal auditor,and chief investigator.these officials were accompanied by a massachusetts state police officer.
wojcik was interrogated concerning allegations that he had been playing scratch tickets in violation of a massachusetts law that prohibits any member or employee of the lottery commission or any spouse,child,brother,sister or parent residing as a member of the same household in the principal place of abode of any member or employee of the commission from purchasing a massachusetts lottery ticket or a share of a ticket,and from being paid any prize from a lottery ticket.laws ch.
wojcik was also interrogated concerning his possible knowledge of eleven books of scratch tickets that had recently been discovered missing from the fairhaven office.at the end of the interrogation,the officials informed wojcik that he was suspended without pay.
at the time of these events,the lottery commission was the object of intense media scrutiny caused by allegations of theft and embezzlement by lottery commission employees.the media also picked up on the story of the missing scratch tickets in the fairhaven office and linked the story to the recent suspension of wojcik and two other employees in the same office.articles appeared in the boston globe,boston herald,new bedford standard times,and brockton enterprise.the lottery commission stated position in the articles was that wojcik and the others were under investigation for violation of lottery policies and procedures and applicable statutory provisions.
wojcik was a member of the service employees international union,local union or local,which had a agreement with the lottery commission.under that agreement,employees could not be terminated without just cause.according to wojcik,immediately following his suspension,local contacted the lottery commission on wojcik behalf,requesting specifics of the allegations against him,but the lottery commission provided no details,such as dates,places,and witness names.
on september,wojcik received a letter of termination,signed by the executive director of the lottery commission,appellee jay mitchell.the letter states that wojcik was terminated for violation of lottery policies and procedures and applicable statutory provisions.
again,publicity appeared in the news media.in particular,the boston globe and boston herald both reported that two lottery commission employees had been terminated and another had resigned under suspicion of stealing winning scratch tickets.the lottery commission official stance remained that wojcik was terminated for failing to meet standards and for violating lottery policies and procedures.
shortly after his termination,wojcik filed a grievance through the union to contest his termination and obtain a hearing on the allegations against him.after several months,during which wojcik claims that the lottery commission failed to give him specific notice of the allegations against him,the lottery commission finally denied the grievance.wojcik then filed for arbitration,as provided in the agreement.
the arbitration hearings began on august,and continued on a scattered basis for several months.at the hearing,wojcik had personal counsel representing him.the arbitration addressed only whether the lottery had just cause under the agreement to terminate wojcik for playing lottery tickets it did not address whether he had engaged in the theft.however,it is now undisputed that wojcik did not steal lottery tickets and that he was not connected to the eleven missing books of scratch tickets.the arbitration proceedings were not open to the public.
on may,months after the suspension,the arbitrator issued his decision.the arbitrator upheld the discharge,concluding that wojcik had played scratch tickets in violation of both state law and an agreement he signed at the beginning of his employment with the lottery commission.in particular,the arbitrator credited the testimony of a lottery commission security officer and an administrative assistant from the fairhaven office establishing that wojcik and others played lottery scratch tickets on a frequent basis.the arbitrator concluded that wojcik and others chased books of tickets,meaning that they kept purchasing tickets from a particular book until one of them won a prize or until they were told that another person had won a large prize from a ticket in that book.the arbitrator also found that wojcik once hit a large prize and had his cash the ticket on his behalf.finally,although wojcik ultimately admitted to his wrongdoing,the arbitrator concluded that he had engaged in dishonesty by initially denying that he violated the prohibition on playing lottery tickets.
wojcik did not seek review of the arbitrator decision.see.laws ch,providing grounds for vacatur of arbitrator award.
edward wojcik and his wife filed the instant action in district court on june.they named as defendants the lottery commission appellee shannon,the massachusetts state treasurer and chairman of the lottery commission mitchell and appellee dwight robson,a spokesperson for the lottery commission.the amended complaint contained claims for violation of violation of the massachusetts civil rights act.laws ch,defamation tortious interference with contractual relations invasion of privacy and loss of consortium.
on february,the district court dismissed all claims against the lottery commission as barred by the eleventh amendment.later,the district court also dismissed all claims asserted against the remaining defendants in their official capacities.
shortly after the arbitrator rendered his decision,the remaining defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.on june,the district court,in a ruling from the bench,granted the motion for summary judgment as to the claims.exercising its discretion under c,the district court also dismissed the remaining claims without prejudice,giving wojcik and his wife an opportunity to refile these claims in massachusetts superior court.although they did not avail themselves of this opportunity,a timely appeal to this court followed.
wojcik seeks review of several of the district court rulings.he asserts error in the district court conclusion that the lottery commission is immune from suit under the eleventh amendment.he also challenges the district court grant of summary judgment with respect to each of his three claims of a constitutional violation.
the standard of review is not in dispute.whether the district court correctly applied the immunity doctrine under the eleventh amendment is a question of law that engenders de novo review on appeal.arecibo cmty.health care,puerto rico,cir.
likewise,we review the district court ruling on summary judgment de novo.straughn delta air lines,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.barbour dynamics research,cir quoting.c.the record evidence must be construed in the light most favorable to,and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of,the nonmoving party.feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort and country club,cir.
as a general matter,states are immune under the eleventh amendment from private suit in the federal courts,absent their consent.greenless almond,cir.this immunity extends to any entity that is an arm of the state.in re san juan dupont plaza hotel fire,lst cir see also healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d holding that an arm of the state partakes of the state sovereign immunity,but that such immunity does not extend to municipal corporations or other political subdivisions.before moving to the merits of wojcik federal claims,we address the threshold question of whether the lottery commission is an arm of the state and therefore immune from wojcik suit in federal court.
to determine whether an entity is an arm of the state entitled to immunity,we apply a analysis comprised of the following inquiries 
whether the agency has the funding power to enable it to satisfy judgments without direct state participation or guarantees whether the agency function is governmental or proprietary whether the agency is separately incorporated whether the state exerts control over the agency,and if so,to what extent whether the agency has the power to sue,be sued,and enter contracts in its own name and right whether the agency property is subject to state taxation and whether the state has immunized itself from responsibility for the agency acts or omissions.
metcalf eddy,aqueduct sewer,cir.the entity asserting its immunity bears the burden of showing that it is an arm of the state.gragg.cabinet for workforce,cir.
with respect to its ability to satisfy a judgment,see metcalf eddy,at,the lottery commission points to the fact that its budget must be approved and appropriated by the legislature on an annual basis.see.laws ch.the budget disbursement is then paid back to the general fisc as the lottery makes money during the year.the lottery commission does not have the power to issue bonds to raise revenue for its operations.thus,any unanticipated expenditures or judgments against the lottery commission must be paid out of its appropriated annual budget,and any need for spending above the appropriated amount would require an additional appropriation from the legislature and approval from the governor.this demonstrates the lottery commission limited ability to satisfy a judgment without drawing upon the state fisc.
as for whether the lottery commission function s are governmental or proprietary,metcalf eddy,at,we think that this factor also favors recognizing immunity.the lottery commission is responsible under state law for conduct ing a state lottery and establishing a fund consisting of all revenues received from the sale of lottery tickets i n order to provide local property tax relief to massachusetts municipalities and continue services at the local level.laws ch.this function is decidedly governmental in nature.bretton state lottery comm n,the lottery commission activities are driven by legislative mandate,not business or personal objectives,and its activities hardly resemble endeavors conducted in a conventional business context.
the lottery commission exercises certain ancillary powers that also support this conclusion.for instance,the lottery commission has powers to resolve disputes involving any matter over which it has jurisdiction,control or supervision.laws ch,and its decisions in such disputes are subject to judicial review by the state courts pursuant to the massachusetts administrative procedure act.laws ch.see bretton,at.we therefore conclude that the lottery commission operations are more governmental than proprietary in nature.
it is also clear under massachusetts law that the lottery commission is not separately incorporated.metcalf eddy,at.instead,the lottery commission was established as a division of the massachusetts treasury department.see.laws ch.the state treasurer,an elected official,is required by law to serve as the chairman of the lottery commission,and the remaining board members consist of the secretary of public safety or his designee,the state comptroller or his designee,and two persons appointed by the governor.see id.
furthermore,the structure of the lottery commission reflects the significant degree of control the state retains over its operations.see metcalf eddy,at.as noted above,the annual budget for the lottery must be approved by legislative action,and the lottery commission governing officials are either elected by the public or appointed by the governor.in addition,the state treasurer authority to appoint a director of the lottery commission is subject to the approval of the governor.see.laws ch.
the lottery commission ability to enter into contracts is limited.see metcalf eddy,at.it does not have the power to lease real property in its own name instead,the state leases such property through its department of capital asset management,an agency within the governor executive office of administration and finance.
lastly,we detect nothing in massachusetts law evincing the state intention to immunize itself from responsibility for the lottery commission acts or omissions.see id.
viewed in their totality,the relevant factors clearly point in the direction of recognizing the lottery commission as an arm of the state entitled to immunity under the eleventh amendment appellant,however,disputes this conclusion by relying on a district court case which held that,under rhode island law,the rhode island lottery commission is not an arm of the state entitled to sovereign immunity.aclu lottery comm n.as appellant notes,we have cited this opinion with approval as recently as last year.see hawkins lottery comm n,cir.nonetheless,we do not view the rhode island case as controlling.
we are obviously not bound by the decisions of our lower courts.see calaf gonzález,cir see also in re executive office of president,district court decisions do not establish the law of the circuit,nor,indeed,do they even establish the law of the district.citations and quotation marks omitted.and on the issues before us,the eleventh amendment demands a inquiry into the specific structure and functions of the public entity in question.gross generalizations about entities performing similar functions in different states are not helpful.compare aclu.at holding that the rhode island lottery commission is not an arm of the state,with jeffries celeste,holding that officials of the ohio lottery commission were immune from damages in their official capacities,malone schenk,holding that the illinois lottery division partakes of the state eleventh amendment immunity,and ruman.dep t of.same with regard to the pennsylvania bureau of state lotteries,aff,cir.
regardless of whether the rhode island decision is correct on its own facts,it is clearly distinguishable from the case at hand.there,the court held that the rhode island lottery commission is fiscally and operationally autonomous from the state of rhode island.aclu.at.in particular,the court determined that the rhode island lottery commission is essentially run like a private business,in that it sets its own budget,has complete control over its expenditures,and finances its operational expenses entirely out of the revenue it generates.id.at.in addition,it possesses the power and resources to pay a judgment against it without prior approval from the state legislature or any other governmental officer or entity.id.at.by contrast,the operations of the massachusetts lottery commission are subject to significant control by the state government,which approves and appropriates the lottery commission annual budget.any adverse judgment that could not be satisfied out of that budget would require additional approval and appropriation of state funds.we therefore conclude that the lottery commission qualifies as an arm of the state for purposes of the eleventh amendment.
having determined that the lottery commission is immune from suit,we now turn to appellant federal constitutional claims against the individual appellees.appellant advanced three federal claims,all under the umbrella of.first,wojcik contends that he was deprived of a protected property interest without due process.second,he claims a deprivation of a protected liberty interest without due process.and third,he argues a violation of the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.we address each claim separately.
in order to maintain a constitutional due process claim arising out of the termination of his employment,a public employee must first demonstrate that he has a reasonable expectation,arising out of a statute,policy,rule,or contract,that he will continue to be employed.perkins bd.of,cir.the employee must also demonstrate that he was deprived of that property interest without the minimum amount of process that was due under the this context,the required process includes some kind of hearing and some pretermination opportunity to respond.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d see also gilbert homar,d.
we determine the claim of a protected property interest by reference to state law.bishop wood,d.wojcik argues that his reasonable expectation of continued employment was fostered by the agreement between the lottery commission and the union.the agreement provided that covered employees can not be terminated without just cause.it is undisputed that the agreement in place was valid and enforceable under massachusetts law.see.laws ch,providing for collective bargaining see also.laws ch,providing for binding arbitration of disputes arising under agreements.moreover,this court has said that,ordinarily,one who can be removed only for cause has a constitutionally protected property interest.perkins,at.we therefore conclude that wojcik had a protected property interest in his continued employment.ciambriello county of nassau,cir recognizing that a agreement gives rise to a property interest in continued employment under new york law.
our inquiry is not at an end,however.there remains the significant question of whether wojcik was provided with the constitutionally adequate procedural safeguards.we conclude that he was.first,he was given an opportunity to respond to the allegations of misconduct prior to his termination.see loudermill,at noting that the pretermination hearing need only be an initial check against mistaken decisions.it is undisputed that,when initially confronted and questioned by investigators from the lottery commission,wojcik was given the chance to explain his actions,and he denied the allegation that he had played scratch tickets in violation of lottery commission policy.second,the full arbitration hearing afforded by the agreement was more than sufficient to satisfy the requirement for a hearing.see baker,cir holding that arbitration of public employee termination grievance satisfies the requirements of due process.wojcik was represented by his own attorney in the arbitration,and he had ample opportunity to test both the fairness of his termination and the quality of the evidence offered against him.we therefore affirm the district court granting of summary judgment on appellant claim.
wojcik argues next that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment on his constitutional claim.the gravamen of this claim is that appellees were responsible for the publication of false and harmful accusations that wojcik was involved in the theft of lottery tickets.
it is beyond cavil that defamation,even from the lips of a government actor,does not in and of itself transgress constitutionally assured rights.pendleton haverhill,cir see also paul davis,d.however,an exception to this general rule exists where a employer creates and disseminates a false and defamatory impression about an employee in connection with the employee discharge.bd.of regents roth,d.in such circumstances,the constitution due process protections require the employer to provide the employee with an opportunity to dispute the defamatory allegations.codd velger,d.the employer failure to provide an adequate forum is actionable under.
in order to successfully establish a claim for the deprivation of a liberty interest without due process,we require the employee to satisfy five elements.first,the alleged statements must level a charge against the employee that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community and place his good name,reputation,honor,or integrity at stake.roth at.statements merely indicating the employee improper or inadequate performance,incompetence,or neglect of duty are not sufficiently serious to trigger the liberty interest protected by the constitution.second,the employee must dispute the charges made against him as false.codd,at.third,the stigmatizing statements or charges must have been intentionally publicized by the government.bishop,at.that is,the defamatory charges must have been aired in a formal setting and not merely the result of unauthorized leaks.silva worden,cir.fourth,the stigmatizing statements must have been made in conjunction with an alteration of the employee legal status,such as the termination of his employment.siegert gilley,d pendleton,at.finally,the government must have failed to comply with the employee request for an adequate opportunity.see quinn shirey,cir it is the denial of the hearing that causes the deprivation of the liberty interest without due process.the purpose of the hearing is only to allow the employee to clear his name of the false charges compliance with formal procedures is not necessarily required.see baden koch,cir citing henry friendly,some kind of hearing,see also quinn,at.
in this case,there is no doubt that an allegation that wojcik engaged in theft would be sufficiently stigmatizing to satisfy the first element of a claim.likewise,there is no dispute that such a charge would be false although wojcik was found to have played scratch tickets in violation of state law,there was no evidence linking him to the eleven stolen books of tickets.the claim falters,however,at the third requirement that the stigmatizing statements were intentionally publicized by the government.
wojcik has failed to adduce any evidence that the allegedly stigmatizing statements were disseminated by government actors in a formal setting.see silva,at.indeed,as far as the record discloses,the defamatory statements were not made by the appellees at all rather,the statements were those of newspaper reporters who hastily and incorrectly drew a connection between the disappearance of the eleven books of lottery tickets and wojcik suspension and subsequent termination.the appellees consistent stance throughout these was that wojcik was investigated and terminated for violation of lottery policies and procedures.appellees statements were undeniably true,regardless of whether the news media later reported on them in a manner that erroneously suggested a more serious degree of wrongdoing on wojcik part.although wojcik faults appellees for failing to alert the news media to the mistake,there is nothing in the constitution that compels government actors to take such steps.we therefore affirm the district court ruling with respect to wojcik claim 
finally,wojcik contends that he had a viable equal protection claim based on the selective enforcement of the ban against him.the supreme court has recognized successful equal protection claims brought by a class of one,where a plaintiff alleges that he has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.village of willowbrook olech,d per curiam.
wojcik argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the equal protection claim because it should have been up to the jury to decide whether there was a rational basis for the lottery commission to enforce a rule against wojcik that allegedly had not been enforced against others.we find these contentions hollow and affirm the judgment of the district court.
the legal test we apply to the appellees conduct is an exceptionally deferential one.an equal protection claim will only succeed if the decision to treat an individual differently than those similarly situated is wholly arbitrary or irra
