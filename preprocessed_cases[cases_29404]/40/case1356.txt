plaintiffs in this case challenge the federal funding of research involving embryonic stem cells.the district court dismissed the suit for want of standing.we appreciate the sensitivity of the underlying issue and respect the sincerity of arguments on all sides of the question.however,as a matter of law,the principles of standing enunciated by the supreme court mandate an affirmance of the judgment.
human embryonic stem cells hescs are valued by scientific researchers for their ability to transform into any type of cell in the human body.they are derived from embryos,largely embryos created via in vitro fertilization ivf for reproductive purposes and donated for research when no longer needed for that reason.the process of creating hescs generally results in the destruction of the embryo.embryos not donated for research can also be made available for adoption.
in addition to technical discussions,the issue of stem cell research has elicited debate on the role of science in alleviating human suffering and the relationship of science to the sanctity of life.federal funding guidelines have not surprisingly proven controversial.although hescs have been available for research since,the national institutes of health nih did not fund research involving hescs until.that funding,however,was restricted to research involving hescs derived from stem cell lines already in existence.see address to the nation on stem cell research from crawford,weekly comp.doc,see also exec.order.june.on march,president obama issued executive order,removing that restriction and expanding federal funding of hesc research.executive order also directed the nih to issue new guidelines on that research.the nih responded on july,with final guidelines for human stem cell research nih guidelines.
two sets of plaintiffs in these consolidated cases challenge executive order and the nih guidelines.plaintiff mary scott doe represents a putative class of all frozen embryos held throughout the united states for either research or adoption purposes.the other plaintiffs are several parents who have children that were adopted as frozen embryos and who are considering adopting embryos again.together,plaintiffs argue that the new hesc policies violate the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments,the administrative procedure act,and the amendment,div.f,title v,a,stat,a restriction on nih funding which bars the use of federal funds for research in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed,discarded,or knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death.the district court dismissed both lawsuits for lack of standing.plaintiffs now appeal.
we are not at liberty to resolve every grievance over government policy,no matter how significant,for article iii of the constitution confines the federal courts to adjudicating actual cases and controversies.allen wright.the supreme court has made clear that standing is an essential and unchanging part of that requirement,lujan defenders of wildlife,one that state s fundamental limits on federal judicial power in our system of government,allen,at.to satisfy that constitutional requirement,a plaintiff must demonstrate 
it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,inc.we review de novo the district court decision to dismiss for lack of standing.bishop bartlett,cir.
plaintiffs first assert that the class of all human embryos currently held at ivf clinics throughout the country,including named plaintiff mary scott doe,have standing to assert their constitutional and statutory rights.
plaintiffs contend that the class of frozen embryos is threatened with injury sufficient for standing because executive order and the nih guidelines increase the embryos risk of being reduced to embryonic stem cells.by itself,this contention is insufficient.the supreme court has made clear that named plaintiffs who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured,not that injury has been suffered by other,unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent.simon.welfare rights org,quoting warth seldin,u.without a sufficient allegation of harm to the named plaintiff in particular,plaintiffs can not meet their burden of establishing standing.
we can not identify a particularized harm because the complaint does not identify any of the named plaintiff particularized characteristics.instead,it leaves us only with questions such as whether the embryo will ever be used for research and whether that research will be funded by the nih.we have no idea under what terms the named plaintiff embryo was donated or stored or what its status even is.in the absence of answers,the chosen appellation of mary scott doe could equally designate any member of an amorphous frozen embryo class.indeed,the complaint even states that mary scott doe may be one of the embryos donated for adoption.ja.because the class of frozen embryos includes several subsets,we have no way of knowing whether the claims or defenses of the representative part y are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.a,which is to say whether the named plaintiff is threatened with the harm plaintiffs impute to the class as a whole.
while plaintiffs attempt to bypass the requirement of particularized harm by asserting that all frozen embryos are threatened with harm,this is not a sound contention.the nih guidelines permit funding for research involving only stem cells from embryos donated by individuals who sought reproductive treatment and who gave voluntary written consent for the human embryos to be used for research purposes.at.plaintiffs offer no reason to think,for example,that embryos already donated for adoption are at any risk for the injury allegedly caused by the guidelines.moreover,the complaint provides no basis to conclude that the named plaintiff in particular will be part of the subset that suffers any injury at all,much less an injury due to the challenged government policy.because the test requires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured,sierra club morton,we can not conclude that these plaintiffs have alleged a concrete and particularized harm,friends of the earth,at.
there is an additional difficulty with the embryo plaintiffs claim of standing.t he case or controversy limitation of art.iii still requires that a federal court act only to redress injury that fairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant,and not injury that results from the independent action of some third party not before the court.simon,at.here,the nih guidelines restrict funding to research involving stem cells t hat were created using in vitro fertilization for reproductive purposes and were no longer needed for this purpose and t hat were donated by individuals who sought reproductive treatment and who gave voluntary written consent for the human embryos to be used for research purposes.at.thus,the independent decision of biological parents to donate embryos for research is an intervening cause of the injury that plaintiffs assert on behalf of the embryos.
the conclusion that the injury asserted is not fairly traceable to executive order or the nih guidelines follows from the supreme court pronouncements.in allen,the court addressed an allegation that the internal revenue service irs failed to ensure that racially discriminatory private schools were denied status.though the plaintiffs had suffered a cognizable injury in the form of a reduced ability to attend a racially integrated school,the conclusion that withdrawal of a tax exemption from any particular school would lead the school to change its policies or that any given parent of a child attending such a private school would decide to transfer the child to a public school as a result was entirely speculative.at.
likewise in simon,the court found it purely speculative to conclude that non
