opinion of the court 
cna and continental casualty company stepping into the place of michael lahoff as his subrogees,sued the government under the federal tort claims act ftca,b.they base their claims on negligence that they allege led to lahoff being severely injured.cna and continental hereinafter subrogees appeal the district court order granting the government motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.they raise two arguments on appeal that the district court applied the wrong procedural framework when it ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that the court erred by dismissing the case despite subrogees alternative theories of liability against the government.for the reasons that follow though they differ from those of the district court,we affirm.
in january marty allen armstrong,and an accomplice walked onto the seventh floor of a downtown pittsburgh parking garage and robbed lahoff at gunpoint.after lahoff gave armstrong his wallet,and the in it,armstrong shot lahoff in the neck,resulting in his paralysis from the neck down.at the time of the shooting,lahoff was employed by rtr business products and was working within the course and scope of his employment.subrogees were the workers compensation carriers for rtr.they have paid nearly million in workers compensation benefits and expect that their future payments will total another million.
armstrong was a recruit in the united states army delayed entry program,and a few weeks short of graduating from high school in pittsburgh,when he shot lahoff.the program,authorized under,allows a recruit to enlist in the army and receive a cash bonus before his high school graduation.if,however,the recruit fails to graduate,he is separated from the program.in order to be admitted into it,a prospective recruit must pass a criminal background check and a drug test.armstrong passed the background check and the drug test on july,and enlisted in the program that day.
while the background check revealed nothing that precluded armstrong from enlisting,he in fact had a troubled past.as a,he was charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault,a charge that was dismissed in.the same year,armstrong was twice charged with disorderly conduct,and was involuntarily committed to allegheny valley hospital for psychiatric evaluation.
armstrong was recruited by staff sergeant korey lewis,an army recruiter attached to the pittsburgh recruiting battalion.part of lewis job was to stay in regular communication with recruits in the program.in late december,he learned that armstrong mother had kicked him out of her house and that he had no place to stay.lewis discussed this situation with his supervisor,sergeant first class joseph albrecht.albrecht told lewis to make sure that armstrong did not stay at his lewis apartment.lewis attempted to find armstrong housing at local shelters.
when lewis attempts proved unsuccessful,he allowed armstrong to live in his apartment.this not only violated the direct order of his superior noncommissioned officer,it breached united states army recruiting command regulation,which states that the program recruits are prohibited from s haring of lodging with personnel attached to the army recruiting command.
while staying at lewis apartment,armstrong discovered that lewis had a mm taurus handgun in an unlocked metal tin in his bedroom.armstrong took this gun from lewis apartment and used it to rob and shoot lahoff.
ii.procedural history 
subrogees brought this suit based on their claim that the government had waived sovereign immunity under b of the ftca.that provision allows plaintiffs to bring claims based on the action of government employees when private persons engaging in analogous behavior would be liable under state law.this waiver of sovereign immunity is subject to several requirements and limitations contained in b itself,as well as,which we address in detail below.
in subrogees amended complaint,they assert that the government was vicariously liable for lewis negligence subrogees also claim that the army itself,largely through the actions and omissions of lewis supervisors,was independently negligent.specifically,they allege that the army failed to enforce its regulations hired,trained,and supervised lewis negligently failed to conduct a proper background check on armstrong and pressured prospective recruits to enlist in order to meet recruitment goals,making recruitment goals more important than the welfare of society.
the government moved for dismissal under rule b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or,in the alternative,rule b for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.as a third option,it moved for summary judgment under rule.the government did not file an answer.in a memorandum of law accompanying its motion,it contended that lewis was acting outside the scope of his employment,and thus his actions did not fall within b.the government memorandum also addressed the alleged independent negligence of the army,arguing that the actions of the army and of lewis supervisors were too remote from the shooting for liability to attach to the government.
subrogees filed a brief opposing the government motion.they attached exhibits to their brief that included newspaper accounts describing lahoff shooting,armstrong criminal and psychological history,and challenges the army had recently faced in its recruiting efforts.
the district court chose to analyze the government motion under rule b,treating the question as one of subject matter jurisdiction.as a result,its first task was to classify the government motion as either a factual attack or a facial attack.the latter concerns an alleged pleading deficiency whereas a factual attack concerns the actual failure of a plaintiff claims to comport factually with the jurisdictional prerequisites.ex rel.atkinson.shipbuilding,cir.it appears the district court characterized the government motion as a factual attack because the motion challenged whether the district court actually had subject matter jurisdiction based on the facts alleged.see cna united states,wl,at,describing the government motion as based on the existence of jurisdiction.
that the government rule b motion made a factual attack had three important procedural consequences for the district court.first,on a rule b motion,no presumption of truthfulness attaches to the allegations of the plaintiff.id.second,the court placed the burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction on the plaintiff.third,it noted its authority to make factual findings which are decisive to the issue.id.
after a factual inquiry that extended beyond the pleadings,see id.at noting careful consideration of defendant amended motion to dismiss and related submissions emphasis added,the district court granted the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.it stated that the location of lewis conduct is undisputed and thus found no issue that ssg lewis conduct occurred outside authorized time and space limits of employment,which is one of the required factors under pennsylvania definition of conduct in the scope of employment.id.at.the court opinion did not discuss the army alleged independent negligence.subrogees now appeal to our court.
iii.appellate jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over an appeal of a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over legal conclusions.morgan gay,cir.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.carpet group int l oriental rug importers ass n,cir.the clearly erroneous standard of review also applies to findings of fact related to jurisdiction.see,chayoon chao,cir see also charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at,ed.
iv.proper subsection of rule 
the government contends that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.in its view,the six conditions on the waiver of sovereign immunity in the ftca,quoted below,are jurisdictional requirements.they argue that subrogees did not meet one of the statutory conditions because lewis was acting outside the scope of his employment hence there is a failure of federal subject matter jurisdiction.the district court agreed with the government and,as noted above,dismissed the case under rule b.
on appeal,subrogees argue that the determination of whether an employee acted within the scope of his employment is a question of the merits,or at least a simultaneously and jurisdictional question.thus,they argue that the district court erred by considering whether lewis acted within the scope of his employment on a rule b motion.in their view,the government motion to dismiss should have been treated as either a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or a rule motion for summary judgment which they believe their claims would have survived.
whether a government employee was acting within the scope of his employment plausibly could be addressed as one of jurisdiction or one of the merits of a claim.that choice corresponds to whether rule b or,on the other hand,rule b or rule provided the proper procedure.a great deal turns on this question because rule b or rule would provide more procedural safeguards to the plaintiff subrogees than does rule b.for example,a district court acting under rule b may independently evaluate the evidence regarding disputes over jurisdictional facts,rather than assuming that the plaintiff allegations are true.see infra section 
we think treating the issue as jurisdictional in the ftca context is the better course.we so hold because the ftca defines federal courts jurisdiction to hear cases seeking damages from the government,and the conditions on the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity appear in the same statutory provision that grants jurisdiction.moreover,the jurisdictional issue in this case is not overly intertwined with the merits of subrogees claims.the district court thus was correct to apply rule b in this case.
source of jurisdiction 
subrogees contend that allegations made under the ftca are enough to trigger jurisdiction and that their claims should survive a rule b motion based on their mere invocation of the ftca.we start by observing that the district court it not come from the general grant of jurisdiction of.instead,the ftca itself is the source of federal courts jurisdiction to hear tort claims made against the government that meet various criteria t he district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the united states.b.as the supreme court has stated,t he united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued,and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit.united states sherwood.citations omitted.thus,ftca plaintiffs must meet the criteria of b before a district court may exercise jurisdiction.
in particular,b lists six threshold requirements that a plaintiff claim must satisfy to confer jurisdiction.a claim must be made 
against the united states,for money damages,for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
fdic meyer,d quoting b alterations in original.the cause of action in an ftca claim,on the other hand,must come from state tort law.id.at.describing state tort law as the source of substantive liability under the ftca.
unfortunately,the split between jurisdiction and the merits is not always clear.the same facts may apply to whether an employee acted within the scope of his employment and,say,whether that employee breached a duty under state law.in the context of the ftca,as well as other areas,separating jurisdictional facts from factual issues relating to the merits has generated difficult problems,as we discuss below.
jurisdiction or merits 
subrogees make a number of arguments to the effect that the district court handled this case from the wrong procedural posture by dismissing under rule b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.as noted,they also contend that their amended complaint should survive a motion to dismiss on the merits under rule b or a motion for summary judgment under rule.we discuss these arguments in turn.as noted,we agree with the district court that the government in the alternative as made on any of rule b,rule b,or rule properly analyzed as a rule b motion.
congress authority versus federal courts jurisdiction 
subrogees rely on kulick pocono downs racing ass n,cir,for their contention that an attack on the merits of the claim must be handled under rule b or rule.in that case,the petitioner alleged a violation of his civil rights protected by.id.at.following a preliminary injunction hearing,the district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because there was no state action.id.on appeal,we noted that the existence of state action in a suit was a question of congress power under of the fourteenth amendment sometimes refer red to as jurisdictional,as opposed to a question of the federal courts jurisdiction under article iii.id.at.we reversed the district court dismissal because issues of congressional authority,like state action,come too close to the merits of a suit.id.otherwise,the district court could turn an attack on the merits into an attack on jurisdiction.
the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity represents congress setting the federal courts jurisdiction over tort lawsuits against the government.it is not an example of congress acting at the outer bounds of its own constitutional power,as in kulick in the context,or as in mortensen first federal savings and loan ass n,cir applying rule b rather than rule b in the context of the interstate commerce requirement of antitrust law.thus,kulick does not govern this case.
clear congressional statement 
in arbaugh y h,d,the supreme court held that the threshold,b,for employment discrimination claims under title vii of the civil rights act of was not properly treated as jurisdictional.instead,that threshold is a question.the court noted that since the federal question jurisdictional amendments act of,stat,federal courts jurisdiction over title vii claims has come from rather than the jurisdictional provision within title vii itself,f.see at.because neither,nor title vii jurisdictional provision,specifies any threshold ingredient akin to monetary floor,the court held that it was most prudent to treat statutory threshold requirements as jurisdictional only when congress explicitly makes them so.at.see also nesbit gears unlimited,cir we doubt that congress intended this definitional section b to have subject matter jurisdictional import.
arbaugh does not apply directly to our case,as it dealt with title vii rather than the ftca.but the reasoning of arbaugh suggests that the conditions laid out in the ftca are jurisdictional in nature,as jurisdiction for courts to hear suits against the government have their threshold set out in b.we recently applied arbaugh reasoning to consider whether a statutory requirement in the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla is jurisdictional or an element of a claim.beazer east,mead,cir.to evaluate whether congress clearly stated that a requirement should count as jurisdictional,we ask whether the requirement appears in or receives mention in the jurisdictional provision of a given statute,see arbaugh,at.
the requirement of the ftca appears in the same sentence as congress grant of jurisdiction.see b.j urisdiction in b suggests that each clause of that provision represents a limitation on congress waiver of sovereign immunity and thus a limitation on federal courts jurisdiction.by contrast,the requirement of title vii appeared in a separate provision from the jurisdictional provision see beazer east,at the absence of a reference to f in b,b,cercla jurisdictional provision,is notable because that provision expressly subjects its grant of jurisdiction to subsections a and h of.this a statute contains within itself the bounds of its the result in our case.section,by subsection b,tethers jurisdiction to meeting that subsection requirements 
intertwined with the merits 
subrogees invoke the principle that where the defendant challenge to the court jurisdiction is also a challenge to the existence of a f ederal cause of action,the proper course of action for the district court is to find that jurisdiction exists and to deal with the objection as a direct attack on the merits of the plaintiff case.cohen kurtzman,d,quoting williamson tucker,cir.this idea runs through numerous cases that classify issues as either jurisdictional or relating to the merits.see,mortensen,at contrasting antitrust claims from other claims whose jurisdictional bases are not as intertwined with their merits.
courts differ on what it means for jurisdiction to be intertwined with the merits.some focus on overlapping issues of proof.see,augustine united states,cir treating the statute of limitations on ftca claims in b as jurisdictional and stating that i n this case the determinative jurisdictional facts also go directly to the merits emphasis added.other courts discuss whether elements of establishing jurisdiction and of a particular cause of action are overlapping in part rather than distinct.see,crawford united states,cir analyzing whether the issues of mental capacity and negligence overlapped or were unrelated.still others define intertwined as when the elements of jurisdiction and a cause of action are completely coextensive.see,lawrence dunbar,cir the existence of plaintiff cause of action depends on whether the defendant was acting within the course and scope of his employment.the pertinent inquiry will resolve both the question of subject matter jurisdiction and a necessary element of the tort claim.our own approach to the meaning of intertwined with the merits most closely resembles the first path the phrase is best understood as referring to overlapping issues of proof.
a split among our sister courts of appeals has emerged on the proper procedure for handling situations in which jurisdiction is intertwined with the merits.in some circuits,whether a government employee was acting in the scope of his employment for purposes of an ftca claim must be handled as a question of the merits in order to give plaintiffs the appropriate procedural safeguards,having a plaintiff allegations assumed as true.see montez dep t of the navy,cir w e follow our general rule in holding that a jurisdictional attack intertwined with the merits of an ftca claim should be treated like any other intertwined attack,thereby making resolution of the jurisdictional issue on a b motion improper.lawrence,at vacating and remanding for consideration under rule b see also augustine,at treating the administrative claim requirement of b as relating too closely to the merits to be handled under rule b.yet the second circuit court of appeals recently reached the opposite conclusion on how a dispute should be handled procedurally in the ftca context.in hamm united states,cir,it held that where a waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply,a suit should be dismissed under.b and not.b for failure to state a claim.
our court approach has been to make disputes over the requirement of b jurisdictional.see matsko united states,cir affirming dismissal of an ftca claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction gould elecs.united states,cir holding that the phrase law of the place in the sixth prong of b is jurisdictional see also gotha united states,cir treating the discretionary function exception to the ftca of a as jurisdictional.this much accords with the approach of our second circuit colleagues.see,gould,at noting our court agreement with the approach of makarova united states,cir applying rule b to a b claim.
yet we have also recognized,where jurisdiction is intertwined with the merits of an ftca claim,that a district court must take care not to reach the merits of a case when deciding a rule b motion.gould,at.rule b does not provide plaintiffs the procedural safeguards of rule b,such as assuming the truth of the plaintiff allegations.thus,when faced with a jurisdictional issue that is intertwined with the merits of a claim,district courts must demand less in the way of jurisdictional proof than would be appropriate at a trial stage.id.at quoting mortensen,at.in this way,we have acknowledged the concerns expressed above by the courts of appeals for the fifth,ninth,and eleventh circuits.but we have not gone so far as to treat the issue,and the other conditions of b,as a question of the merits suitable for disposition under rule b.instead,along with the second circuit court of appeals,we have followed the basic approach of treating the conditions of b as jurisdictional.
in sum,we adhere to our court practice of applying rule b when evaluating whether a plaintiff claim has met the six conditions on the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity contained in b but we ensure that defendants are not allowed to use rule b to resolve the merits too early in litigation.by requiring less of a factual showing than would be required to succeed at trial,district courts ensure that they do not prematurely grant rule b motions to dismiss claims in which jurisdiction is intertwined with the merits and could be established,along with the merits,given the benefit of discovery.
c.the district court application of rule b 
in our case,the district court was correct to treat the issue as jurisdictional and decide it under rule b.but it did not address the intertwined with the merits problem explicitly.whether lewis acted within the scope of employment might involve issues of fact that also pertain to the merits of subrogees tort claims.district courts in this context should ensure that less proof is required of a plaintiff on a rule b motion than would be required at trial.see gould,at mortensen,at.
nonetheless,we hold that the district court applied the correct procedural rule,despite not making the above principle from mortensen and gould explicit in its analysis.the district court omission of the less in the way of jurisdictional proof standard from its opinion had no bearing on the result.there are here no factual disputes that are relevant to determining subject matter jurisdiction.for example,there is no issue that ssg lewis conduct occurred outside authorized time and space limits of employment.cna,wl,at.even if we took subrogees allegations in the amended complaint as true which we need not do under rule b,there is no factual dispute that lewis actions occurred in his at work.see infra section 
the district court applied rule b,with its attendant procedural consequences,properly.the government made a factual attack on the existence of subject matter jurisdiction in contrast to a facial attack that deals with the sufficiency of the pleadings.see wright miller,supra,at.this placed the burden of persuasion on subrogees.see kehr packages,fidelcor,cir.the district court was permitted to make factual findings,beyond the pleadings,that were decisive to determining jurisdiction.atkinson,at if this is a factual attack it is permissible for a court to review evidence outside the pleadings.
subrogees contend that the district court erred as a matter of law by prematurely ruling,prior to discovery,that lewis was not acting within the scope of his employment.however,the court may dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction at any time,regardless whether the moving party has filed an answer or the opposing party had an opportunity to conduct discovery.see berardi swanson mem l lodge of the fraternal order of police,cir.h.moreover,the court gave subrogees ample opportunity to be heard on the jurisdictional issue.see berardi,at wright miller,supra,at.after the government motion,subrogees filed an opposing brief,the government filed a reply brief,and subrogees filed a surreply brief.thus,the court did not grant the government rule b motion too early in the litigation.
we discuss first subrogees claims regarding whether army recruiter staff sergeant lewis was acting within the scope of his employment.secondly,we address subrogees claims based on the actions of lewis supervisor,sergeant albrecht,and the army as a whole.
lewis actions were outside the scope of employment 
the terms of the united states consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit.meyer,at.quoting united states sherwood.alteration in original.here,as described above,the terms of the united states consent are specified in the ftca.for convenience,we repeat that the ftca provides that the district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the united states for personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.b emphasis added.
in ascertaining whether sovereign immunity was waived and if it had jurisdiction,the district court correctly looked to pennsylvania law to determine whether lewis actions were within the scope of his employment.see id.waiving sovereign immunity where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred emphasis added.to answer such questions,we have applied the closely related doctrine of respondeat superior which determines when employers will be held liable for the actions of their employees under pennsylvania law,rather than using a federal definition.see mcswain united states,cir although the traditional doctrine of respondeat superior may not be appropriate to the relationship between military personnel and the armed forces,we are constrained by legislative mandate to apply this concept.
pennsylvania has adopted the restatement second of agency definition of conduct within the scope of employment.brumfield sanders,cir citing butler vending,see also shuman estate weber.under pennsylvania law,conduct is within the scope of employment if,but only if a it is the kind the employee is employed to perform b it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits and c it is actuated,at least in part,by a purpose to serve the master.brumfield,at quoting restatement second of agency first alteration in original.the district court concluded that lewis conduct was outside the scope of his employment because it occurred in an unauthorized time and space.in reaching this conclusion,the court looked to army regulations prohibiting armstrong from staying at lewis apartment and albrecht direct order to lewis not to allow armstrong to do so.
on appeal,subrogees focus their efforts on the third factor defining the scope of employment.they allege that lewis was motivated,at least in part,by his desire to serve the army recruiting goals when he allowed armstrong to stay at his home.we have stated before that the mere existence of a personal motivation is insufficient to relieve the employer from liability where the conduct also benefitted him and was within the scope of employment generally.id.citing eisenberg gagnon,cir.in a sworn statement lewis gave as part of an administrative disciplinary proceeding,he stated that he had concern as a humane individual about armstrong welfare if left on the streets.but lewis also had a concern that armstrong would not be able to continue with pursuit of a career in the army if unable to stay near pittsburgh to finish high school.
despite the third factor supporting subrogees argument,lewis actions fail to meet the first two factors of the test.because lodging recruits in one home violates army recruiting regulations,that action is not of the kind that army employees are to perform thus lewis actions do not meet the first factor.moreover,as the district court emphasized,lewis actions did not occur within authorized time and space limits.albrecht specifically forbade lewis to allow armstrong to stay at his home,so any actions that lewis took with respect to armstrong at his home occurred at an unauthorized place.
for our court to consider lewis actions to be within the scope of employment,all three factors must be satisfied.because the first and second factors are not close to being met here,we agree with the district court holding.as a result,lewis decision to bring armstrong into his home temporarily does not fit within the scope of employment needed to invoke the government waiver of sovereign immunity.the district court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over subrogees claims with respect to lewis actions.
albrecht and the army actions do not fit within the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity 
subrogees also argue that regardless whether lewis conduct was within the scope of his employment,the government may be held independently liable for its alleged acts of negligence.they contend that the army did not train lewis adequately pressured recruiters like lewis to meet recruiting goals,endangering society at large in the process did not conduct a sufficient background check of armstrong and,acting through albrecht,failed to follow up in enforcing its regulations prohibiting recruiters from giving lodging to recruits.we begin with the last claim first.
subrogees claim about failing to enforce regulations centers on the interaction between albrecht and lewis.subrogees contend that albrecht admonition to lewis was not enough.as lewis supervisor,they argue,albrecht had a duty to follow up with lewis and ensure that he did not allow armstrong to stay at his home.albrecht omission,in their view,constituted negligent supervision of his subordinate,lewis.
in support of their argument,subrogees cite sheridan united states,d.in that case,an and very drunk serviceman left the bethesda naval hospital with a rifle and ammunition.prior to leaving the hospital he fought with three other naval corpsmen who unsuccessfully tried to subdue him.after the serviceman fled,the corpsmen never alerted authorities that a drunken serviceman was wandering about with a rifle.the serviceman then fired shots at a car,injuring a passenger inside it.id.at.the government argued the serviceman had committed an intentional tort.claims stemming from intentional torts generally are excluded from the government waiver of sovereign immunity under h.it states that b waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to a ny claim arising out of assault,battery,false imprisonment,false arrest,malicious prosecution,abuse of process,libel,slander,misrepresentation,deceit,or interference with contract rights,with certain exceptions for investigative or law enforcement officers.the government can not take advantage of this assault and battery exception to its waiver of sovereign immunity in our case because the exception only applies in cases arising out of assaults by federal employees.sheridan,at.citing panella united states,cir harlan.armstrong,the assailant in our case,was an army recruit but does not qualify as a government employee.
because the plaintiffs in sheridan sought to sue for the government negligence in fail ing to prevent the serviceman use of a rifle,id.at,and not alerting other security authorities,the court held that the intentional tort bar to waivers of sovereign immunity did not apply,id.at.the government there was deemed to have waived its sovereign immunity to harm caused by its drunk.though that immunity normally remains where an employee acts intentionally,the negligence of the corpsmen who allowed a foreseeable assault and battery to occur may furnish a basis for government liability that is entirely independent of the drunk serviceman employment status.id.at.emphases added.regulations about firearm safety and the corpsmen decision to take the drunk serviceman into their care were two specific sources of the government independent negligence.id.at.to allow someone in the serviceman condition,armed with a rifle,out of the corpsmen care courted foreseeable trouble.thus,the government had waived its sovereign immunity and the plaintiffs case could go forward.id.at.
sheridan effectively represents an exception to an exception to an exception to a general rule.the general rule is sovereign immunity the government can not be sued.the ftca creates an exception to that rule by waiving sovereign immuni
