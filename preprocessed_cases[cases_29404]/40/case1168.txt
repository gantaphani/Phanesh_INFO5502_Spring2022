phil hefner appeals from an order entered by the united states district court for the district of new jersey,denying reconsideration of its order granting summary judgment in favor of,and denying an alternate remedy pursuant to c.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm.
hackensack university medical center humc operates a medical university and hospital.the north jersey primary care associates,njpc,a professional service corporation that is effectively controlled by humc,manages humc physician staffing.humc provides treatment to patients with infectious diseases at the infectious diseases clinic the clinic or the humc clinic,among other clinics.
steven sperber,a infectious disease physician,treated patients at the humc clinic.he did so in his individual capacity through an agreement with njpc,not as a member of the center for infectious diseases cid,which is a private practice of infectious disease physicians,including sperber.incidentally,the cid and humc are separate entities,although cid leased some medical office space from,and used the support services of,humc.
the services which sperber provided at the humc clinic were covered under a grant,specifically,the national institute of health ryan white title i grant the grant,which provided federal funding for the treatment of aids patients.maryann collins,the aids coordinator for humc,applied for and administered the grant on behalf of humc.
to administer the grant,collins submitted to the government monthly invoices itemizing the allowable services and requesting reimbursement.in support of the invoices,collins signed certifications that included the following 
i certify that none of the above service units have been previously submitted and paid all of the billable units are in compliance with the authorized budget and contracted for scope of service.additionally,all services below have been provided delivered as specified.
one of the conditions of the grant was that it could not be used to replace existing financial support.thus,the grant provided f unds may not be used to provide items or services for which payment has already been made or can reasonably be expected to be made by a payer,including medicare.humc understood this provision to mean that it was entitled to reimbursement by the grant for services that were payable by medicare,as long as it did not bill medicare.this was an incorrect interpretation,as confirmed by a study conducted by the grant administrator,the health resources and services administration hrsa,which determined that medicare should be the payer of first resort.the hrsa study also found,however,that of hospitals surveyed had billing problems arising from situations.
nevertheless,humc failed to conform to even its incorrect interpretation of its responsibilities under the grant.while collins included fees for sperber services in grant invoices,humc also charged medicare for the same services.this was caused by a breakdown in humc billing system.according to thomas flynn,humc director of compliance,billing information was generated by physicians and then sent to the physician billing department.there,billing staff clerks entered claims into the system.flynn explained that for claims that were reimbursable by the grant,the clerk was supposed to enter an allowance code that would indicate as much.however,because there had been some staff turnover,the staff member who was responsible for entering the allowance code was not doing so.this left a receivable in the system,which caused bills to go out to medicare.
in june,marilyn capek,an administrator at cid,received a form from njpc asking sperber to reassign his payments from medicare to njpc.capek thought that sperber services at humc were being paid for by the grant,so she called collins to ask about the discrepancy.collins promised to investigate and then passed along this information to flynn.flynn instructed the physician billing staff to run a report to determine if any claims connected to sperber work had been submitted to medicare.when the report disclosed that claims had been submitted to medicare,such billing was stopped,and flynn began reviewing the records to determine how many claims had been submitted in error so that humc could repay medicare.
around this time,humc engaged the services of health systems management network hsmn,a consulting firm,to help improve its compliance with documentation and billing regulations.relator hefner was hired by hsmn on june,and was assigned to humc on july.the next day,hefner had a meeting with theodore tarantini,the senior managing partner of hsmn,and mark clachko,a member and of the humc medical board.hefner arrived at the meeting two hours late,looking disheveled,and provided a totally outrageous excuse for his tardiness.tarantini concluded that hefner was an alcoholic,a big problem for hsmn,and was not up to doing his job.soon after this meeting,hefner had a second meeting with tarantini,and again arrived looking disheveled.
clachko was also unhappy with hefner performance.after a july,meeting with hefner,clachko told the of performance improvement and quality assurance at humc that he was extremely,extremely upset with hefner,and that hefner was inappropriate,acted very strange,and did not offer any advice or suggestions on any corporate compliant sic issues.clachko was apparently so upset with hefner that he was ranting and raving.after this conversation,humc called hsmn and asked that hefner be replaced.
after hefner and clachko meeting,hefner met with capek.during this meeting,capek told hefner that she had come across some paperwork that suggested there might be a problem with double billing concerning the grant.capek also stated,however,that she had brought it to humc attention and the company was working on remedying the problem.during her deposition,capek referred to the act of double billing as a fraud.she stated,well,you ca bill medicare and receive federal grants at the same time,that fraud.
immediately after this meeting,humc ordered hefner off humc premises.hefner was officially terminated by hsmn six days later.
in september,humc informed medicare that services reimbursed under the grant had been wrongly charged to medicare.humc then returned the medicare.
hefner filed a qui tam action under seal in the united states district court for the district of maryland against humc.thereafter,the united states filed a notice of election to decline intervention,and the complaint was unsealed.the matter was transferred to the district of new jersey,and hefner filed an amended complaint that added njpc and cid as defendants.
hefner amended complaint contained three claims under the false claims act fca,submitting false claims and false invoices making false records and false statements and retaliatory discharge.after discovery,the district court granted summary judgment to all defendants on all counts.hefner moved for partial reconsideration.hefner also requested that,if the district court denied his motion for reconsideration,he receive a share of humc repayment to the government as an alternate remedy to his fca action.the district court denied hefner motion for reconsideration and denied his request for a share of the administrative repayment.hefner now appeals.
we have jurisdiction over this appeal by virtue of.the district court order granting appellees motions for summary judgment is subject to plenary review.carter mcgrady,cir we review the district court order denying reconsideration of its order granting summary judgment for an abuse of discretion.harsco zlotnicki,cir.finally,we engage in a de novo review of the district court order denying an alternate remedy pursuant to c,because the issue turns on a question of law.shuman ex rel.shertzer penn manor sch,cir.
hefner presents four arguments on appeal.first,he argues that the district court should not have granted summary judgment to humc and njpc on his first and second fca claims because he presented evidence that their conduct satisfied the fca scienter requirement.second,he argues that the district court should not have granted summary judgment to cid on his fca claims because cid operated as
