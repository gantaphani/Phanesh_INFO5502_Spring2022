the facts of this case are recited in the very thorough and thoughtful may,report and recommendation of magistrate judge francis caiazza the r and r,which is attached hereto as an appendix.as the magistrate judge accurately notes t his case proves the axiom that the wheels of justice grind slowly.it has occupied state courts since march when the first of four consolidated claims was filed.app.at.
the r and r recites the factual and procedural history of this dispute,and we need not reiterate it here.rather,we only note that this litigation arises out of a two week mining operation that began in.thereafter,some purchasers of burial plots sued the cemetery and consol in the court of common pleas for greene county,pennsylvania challenging the cemetery right to execute a lease or subsidence agreement with the mining company,and alleging various violations of state law that purportedly interfered with the ground support of their burial plots resulting in subsidence of those plots.
all liability issues were resolved in favor of the plaintiffs based on summary judgment motions.the state court then held a nine day jury trial limited to the issue of damages.after all proof had been submitted,the jury was instructed that damages could be calculated based on the value of the coal taken from the cemetery.using this measure,the jury assessed damages against consol and the cemetery.
on appeal,the pennsylvania superior court determined that the damage award should not have been based on the value of the coal extracted,because the plaintiffs did not own the mineral rights to the burial plots.the court also found that the court of common pleas had erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on a number of claims.accordingly,the superior court reversed the order of the court of common pleas,and remanded the matter for a new trial encompassing liability as well as damages.
as the magistrate judge sets forth in his r and r,on retrial,the trial court explained the jury finding in favor of the defendants as follows 
the jury,after a trial and after hearing that there was no visible damage to the cemetery and that the sale of lots and burials had continued up to at least the time of trial,and after hearing that no one,plaintiff or otherwise,had requested the transfer of the remains of his or her loved one to another cemetery,found that whatever subsidence had occurred did not interfere with the reasonable and proper enjoyment of the lots as burial sites.
whitlatch braddock cemetery,wl,slip op.at.common pleas.app.at.
plaintiffs filed motions in which they argued,among other things,that allowing the verdict to stand would amount to an uncompensated taking of their property.the trial court rejected that claim and plaintiffs appealed to the pennsylvania superior court their brief raised seventeen issues their claims included the argument that the jury verdict effected a de facto condemnation of the plaintiffs support estate,entitling them to just compensation under the fifth amendment.the superior court rejected that argument,and affirmed the order of the court of common pleas.the supreme court of pennsylvania refused allocatur,and plaintiffs did not request a writ of certiorari from the united states supreme court,to raise their fifth amendment taking claim.instead,they filed the instant suit under in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania.
they argue that the supreme court of pennsylvania denial of their petition for reconsideration,clothed the defendants under color of state law with the authority to take private property without just compensation.they claim that the defendants actions thus resulted in an unconstitutional taking of their support estates in violation of the united states and pennsylvania constitutions.
consol responded by serving plaintiffs with a copy of the motion for rule sanctions that they intended to file with the district court pursuant to rule c in their accompanying letter,dated november,consol cited the doctrine,the lack of any state action as required for an action pursuant to,the bar of the applicable statute of limitations,and the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata in explaining why plaintiffs federal suit was barred.consol warned that in light of the long history of litigation and the final state court decision in defendants favor,plaintiffs federal suit was frivolous and in consol opinion,meant only to harass.when plaintiffs did not dismiss their complaint as requested in the rule notice,consol filed a motion to dismiss together with its motion for rule sanctions 
the case was referred to a magistrate judge who advised consol at a status conference that he would deny their rule motion without prejudice to consol right to renew that motion after a ruling on the motion to dismiss.subsequently,the magistrate judge issued the aforementioned r and r explaining that plaintiffs action was barred by the.the r and r also explained that plaintiffs could not maintain a suit under because the injuries they complained of were not the result of any state action.the district court subsequently adopted the r and r and dismissed the complaint,gary braddock cemetery.june,memorandum order granting motion to dismiss.this appeal followed.
thereafter,consol renewed its motion for rule sanctions,and the magistrate judge ordered plaintiffs to respond to consol rule motion by august.however,on july,plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal in challenging the district court dismissal of their complaint.on july,prior to receiving any response from plaintiffs on the rule motion,the magistrate judge issued an order which temporarily denied the rule motion while explaining that the motion would be stayed pending resolution of plaintiffs appeal.the district court overruled consol objections in an order dated august.thereafter,consol filed the notice of appeal in challenging the district court failure to rule on the rule motion before dismissing the complaint.
we first address the district court dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction based on the doctrine that doctrine takes its name from the two supreme court cases that gave rise to the doctrine.rooker fidelity trust.district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d.the doctrine is derived from which states that f inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had,may be reviewed by the supreme court.see also desi pizza,city of wilkes barre,cir.since congress has never conferred a similar power of review on the united states district courts,the supreme court has inferred that congress did not intend to empower district courts to review state court decisions.desi pizza,at.
after reviewing the arguments challenging the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we conclude that magistrate judge caiazza adequately explained why the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the thoughtful r and r that the district court adopted and which we attach as an appendix to this opinion.inasmuch as we can add little to the explanation offered in that r and r,we will affirm the dismissal of plaintiff complaint substantially for the reasons set forth therein.see app.at 
we need only add that this action falls squarely within that class of actions prohibited by the doctrine,even as limited by the supreme court recent opinion in exxon mobil saudi basic industries,d.plaintiffs,the losers,brought this suit complaining of injuries caused by a judgment rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of that judgment.exxon mobil,at.because federal district courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to entertain appeals from state courts,the district court correctly adopted the reasoning of the r and r and dismissed this action for lack of jurisdiction.rooker,at.feldman,at.exxon mobil,at.we will therefore affirm the district court order dismissing this suit substantially for the reasons set forth in the r and 
our affirmance of the dismissal of the complaint does not end our discussion because,in,consol argues that the district court erred in not ruling on the rule motion before entering final judgment we agree.we usually review a district court ruling on a motion for sanctions under rule for an abuse of discretion.simmerman corino,cir.here,however,there is nothing to review because the district court never ruled on the propriety of rule sanctions even though it entered a final order dismissing the suit.
almost twenty years ago,we adopted a supervisory rule that counsel seeking rule sanctions must file their motions before entry of final judgment in the district court.mary ann pensiero,lingle,cir.we explained that s wift disposition of a rule motion is essential so that any ensuing challenge to it might be included with the appeal on the merits.id.at.the supervisory rule was intended to eliminate piecemeal appeals and serve the interest of judicial economy without risking a significant waste of district court efforts.id.although we did not explicitly state that a district court was also required to rule on a motion for rule sanctions prior to entry of final judgment,pensiero clearly anticipates that a district court would rule on the motion for sanctions prior to,or contemporaneously with,entering final judgment.see id.we will henceforth require prompt action by a litigant whenever a rule violation appears.in that way,the district court will be able to decide the matter in a timely fashion so as to eliminate additional appeals.emphasis added.
thus,following pensiero,we held in simmerman that a district court imposing rule sanctions sua sponte must do so prior to the entry of final judgment.there,we explained 
there is no inordinate burden in requiring the district court to raise and resolve any rule issues prior to or concurrent with its resolution of the merits of the case similarly,concurrent consideration of challenges to the merits and the imposition of sanctions avoids the invariable demand on two separate appellate panels to acquaint themselves with the underlying facts and the parties respective legal positions.in the context of a rule violation,the court and opposing party are in similar positions.both know of the rule and its requirements,and both possess similar information about the conduct and the pleadings of counsel there is no reason why prompt action should be required of an opposing party and yet not similarly required of the court.
consol filed its motion for rule sanctions in a timely fashion,consistent with pensiero,and plaintiffs do not argue to the contrary.for reasons not apparent from this record,the rule motion was initially dismissed without prejudice,and consol renewed its rule motion after the district court granted the motion to dismiss an obvious corollary to requiring parties to file their rule motion prior to final judgment,and requiring a district court imposing sanctions sua sponte to do so prior to or contemporaneously with final judgment,is that district courts must resolve any issues about imposition of sanctions prior to,or contemporaneously with,entering final judgment.requiring rule motions to be filed before final judgment is entered accomplishes nothing unless we are able to resolve any challenge to the grant or denial of rule sanctions when we rule on the merits of the final judgment.
consol believes that the record supports imposition of sanctions because the district court dismissed plaintiffs suit on the precise grounds consol cited in the letter consol sent to plaintiffs as part of the notice it served under rule.consol therefore asks us to conclude that sanctions should be granted here and return the case to the district court the magistrate judge for a determination of the appropriate amount to be levied,or in the alternative,that we impose sanctions,based on the facts and law as set forth in the record.consol br.at.although consol reliance on certainly had merit as explained in the r and r,it is neither appropriate nor prudent for us to attempt to resolve the propriety or amount of any rule sanctions on this record.
as we have just explained,motions under rule must be decided in the first instance by the trial court absent extraordinary circumstances that do not appear on this record and which we can not now imagine.accordingly,we will remand this case to the district court to rule on consol rule motion.
for the foregoing reasons,the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction will be affirmed and the case is remanded for a ruling by the district court on consol motion for rule sanctions.

ii.factual and procedural background 
this case proves the axiom that the wheels of justice grind slowly.the underlying facts,which are straightforward and largely undisputed,have occupied state courts since march when the first of four consolidated claims was filed.the court revisits these facts in order to provide context for its conclusions of law 
in,and james braddock conveyed to the ruling elders of the unity presbyterian church an unrestricted deed to a two and acre parcel of land in greene county,pennsylvania.in,braddock and his second wife,belle,deeded to the same grantees a second parcel of land.excluded from this second grant was a seam of coal known as the pittsburgh vein,which ran under a portion of the land and had previously been conveyed to another party.
