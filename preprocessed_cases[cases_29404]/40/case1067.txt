discussion 
the courts of appeals have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states,except where a direct review may be had in the supreme court.a final decision is a decision by the district court that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment,catlin united states,or one by which a district court disassociates itself from a case,swint chambers county comm n.however,the supreme court has long given a practical rather than a technical construction.mohawk,carpenter,quoting cohen beneficial indus.loan,internal quotations omitted.under the collateral order doctrine enunciated in cohen over a ago,the courts of appeals have appellate jurisdiction over that small class of orders which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.at.the collateral order doctrine permits appeals not only from a final decision but also from a small category of decisions that,although they do not end the litigation,must nonetheless be considered final for purposes of.swint,at citing cohen,at.
