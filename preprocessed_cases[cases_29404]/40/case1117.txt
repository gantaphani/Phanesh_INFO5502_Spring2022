opinion of the court 
germantown hospital and medical center old germantown submitted to the representative of the secretary of health and human services,the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms or administrator,a reimbursement claim for loss on depreciable assets resulting from its statutory merger into germantown hospital and community health services new germantown.the administrator denied the claim because he found that the old germantown merger was between related parties and did not constitute a bona fide sale.albert einstein medical center,einstein,as to old germantown and new germantown,filed an action in federal court challenging the administrator interpretations of the relevant regulations and,in the alternative,challenging the administrator factual findings based on those regulatory interpretations.the district court,the honorable ronald buckwalter of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,granted summary judgment to the secretary upholding the decision of the administrator.einstein appeals.
factual and procedural background 
prior to the merger at issue in this case,old germantown was a hospital,located in philadelphia,pennsylvania.david ricci,who had served as president and ceo,testified before the provider reimbursement review board prrb that as a result of the development of managed care and healthcare systems in philadelphia in the early,small hospitals realized that they needed to join stronger organizations in order for them to have a future.app.at.by the,old germantown had seen a decline in admissions and was operating only of its licensed beds.ricci stated that this reduction in patient volume,combined with a feeding frenzy for acquiring physician practices,caused old germantown difficulty in retaining specialists.app.at.as a result,old germantown experienced yearly operating losses,with its operating loss amounting to between and million.in,old germantown outstanding liabilities totaled more than million,including approximately million in debt.at about that time,old germantown primary lender decided that the hospital was such a credit risk that it would no longer extend credit to old germantown.
by,old germantown assets included endowment funds of approximately million in principal,but the hospital could use only the annual interest from these funds.accordingly,the principal could not be used to satisfy old germantown debts or serve as collateral on future loans.in,the interest income from these endowments was roughly million,but there were also restrictions on the permissible uses of the interest income of many of these funds.therefore,even much of the interest income from these restricted funds could not be used to pay old germantown debts.
acknowledging the seriousness of its financial predicament,old germantown sent a request for proposal rfp to several healthcare systems on december,seeking a merger or a sale of assets.old germantown rfp stated 
the principal objectives the old germantown board expects to consider in evaluating proposals will be to i ensure that germantown continues to serve the health care needs of its community ii enhance the health care services available at germantown iii maintain,to the extent possible,germantown workforce iv achieve a fair value for germantown business and assets and v consummate any acceptable transaction expeditiously.
in response,old germantown received proposals from the albert einstein healthcare network aehn temple university,and primary health systems,phs 
aehn proposed to create a new subsidiary within its healthcare network that would assume all of old germantown assets and liabilities.aehn proposal also provided that the board of the new entity would include current members of the old germantown board of trustees,current management and medical staff leadership as well as aehn designees.app.at.in addition,aehn would invest million in the new entity over the course of its first five years of existence in order to increase services to the community and to insure continued access to current healthcare services.app.at 
phs proposed to purchase the physical assets of old germantown for million,with old germantown retaining all its other assets and liabilities including its endowments to pay off its debts and liabilities.the proposal was silent as to any continuing role of old germantown principals within the governing structure of the hospital after the sale.
old germantown opted to pursue a merger with aehn.the parties entered negotiations and the terms agreed upon were reflected in a letter of intent from aehn president,dated february.the letter stated that aehn would create a new subsidiary that would merge with old germantown,that members of old germantown management would have places on the board of trustees of the new entity,and that additional members of the board would be appointed from the community served by the hospital based upon recommendations submitted by old germantown to aehn.app.at.however,the letter of intent noted that the above stated board composition shall be subject to the parties intentions to maximize medicare recapture.app.at.in addition,the letter of intent stated that the members of old germantown board who were not offered places on the new entity board of trustees would be offered the opportunity to serve on aehn board of directors.app.at.the letter of intent also stated that the parties intend to preserve,to the extent possible,old germantown existing senior management.app.at.finally,aehn reiterated its plan to contribute million in funds to the new entity over the first five years of its existence.
old germantown and aehn signed a definitive agreement agreement on may.in large part,the agreement preserved the terms reflected in the letter of intent,except with respect to the composition of the new entity board of trustees and aehn board of directors.the new entity,new germantown,would have a board of trustees of up to forty members and include four members from old germantown board,three members of old germantown medical staff,at least two of whom had not previously sat on its board,the president and ceo of old germantown,twelve members from the germantown community not to be recommended by old germantown,as the letter of intent had contemplated,and up to twenty members chosen by aehn.all board members would be subject to the approval of the aehn nominating committee,which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.app.at.old germantown chairman of the board as of the date of the merger would serve as the initial chairman of the board of new germantown.two members of old germantown board of trustees would serve on the executive committee of aehn board of directors,and in addition aehn would offer the remaining members of old germantown board the opportunity to serve on aehn board of directors.app.at.finally,the president and ceo of old germantown would become the president and ceo of new germantown.
with respect to the composition of the new board,david ricci,who had served as president and ceo of old germantown,and now served as president and ceo of new germantown,later conceded at the hearing before the prrb that old germantown was worried about having more than twenty percent representation on the new board because it wanted to minimize anything that would jeopardize the loss of those medicare dollars we believe we were rightfully owed.app.at.
in june of,aehn created a subsidiary under the name of germantown hospital and community health services new germantown,a corporation,and on september,the parties completed the merger of old germantown into new germantown according to the terms of the agreement.effective as of this merger,old germantown ceased to exist and all of its assets and liabilities passed to new germantown by operation of law.the monetary assets assumed by new germantown were valued at million including the million in endowment funds,and the fixed assets were valued at million,totaling slightly over million.in exchange for gaining these assets,new germantown assumed old germantown liabilities of million.as anticipated,aehn also pledged million in contingent consideration to be paid to new germantown over the next five years.app.at.
on may,new germantown submitted a final cost report to medicare fiscal intermediary on behalf of old germantown,claiming that it had incurred a loss on sale of depreciable assets through its merger with new germantown,and sought reimbursement.app.at.because the consideration liabilities assumed by new germantown was less than the assets net book value described below,new germantown position was that the assets had depreciated more than medicare had estimated and that,as a result,medicare share of that loss was,later revised to.
on may,medicare fiscal intermediary denied the claimed loss,and new germantown appealed the decision to the prrb,which allowed the claim on september.however,the administrator reversed the prrb decision,disallowing the loss because he concluded that the merger was between related parties and did not constitute a bona fide sale.einstein,as to new germantown and old germantown,sought review of the administrator decision in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,which granted summary judgment in favor of the secretary on august.albert einstein medical center,leavitt einstein,wl.the district court held that the secretary interpretations of related party regulation,k statutory merger provision,and f bona fide sale provision were reasonable and consistent with cms prior interpretations.einstein,wl at.in addition,the district court found that the secretary factual findings were based on substantial evidence.id.at.einstein timely filed a notice of appeal with this court.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction to review the administrator decision under f and we have jurisdiction under.we review the agency decision under the standards set forth in the administrative procedure act apa.f.as such,we can set aside the administrator decision only if it is unsupported by substantial evidence,is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or is otherwise not in accordance with law.mercy home health leavitt,cir quoting a,e alteration in original.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.mercy home health,at quoting richardson perales,d.
moreover,we must afford substantial deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulations.mercy home health.at citing thomas jefferson.hosp.shalala,d.as we have noted,t his broad deference is particularly appropriate in contexts that involve a complex and highly technical regulatory program,such as medicare,which requires significant expertise and entail s the exercise of judgment grounded in policy concerns.id.quoting thomas jefferson,at.
in sum,so long as an agency factfinding is supported by substantial evidence,reviewing courts lack power to reverse either those findings or the reasonable regulatory interpretations that an agency manifests in the course of making such findings of fact.monsour med.ctr.heckler,cir.because this court applies the same standard of review as the district court,we proceed de novo with respect to our review of the district court disposition.mercy home health,at.
statutory and regulatory frameworka.provider reimbursement 
title xviii of the social security act medicare act establishes a healthcare program for the aged and disabled known as medicare,et,which reimburses healthcare providers for the reasonable cost of providing services to medicare beneficiaries,b.the medicare act defines reasonable costs as the cost actually incurred,excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services.v a.
under the medicare act,the secretary of health and human services is authorized to promulgate regulations establishing the method or methods of calculating reasonable,and therefore reimbursable,costs.v a.the cms known as the health care financing administration hcfa until july administers this program on behalf of the secretary.centers for medicare medicaid services statement of organization,functions and delegations of authority,reorganization order.july.reimbursement for reasonable costs to providers is made through private fiscal intermediaries with which medicare contracts.in addition to promulgating regulations,the secretary issues manuals to assist healthcare providers and fiscal intermediaries in administering the system,such as the provider reimbursement manual prm and the medicare intermediary manual mim.
in order to obtain a medicare reimbursement,a health care provider files an annual cost report with its fiscal intermediary.b,f.the intermediary then determines the amount of the reimbursement and issues a notice of amount of program reimbursement to the provider.if a provider disagrees with the intermediary determination,it may file an appeal with the prrb.the decision of the prrb becomes the final administrative decision after sixty days unless the secretary,through the administrator,elects to review the decision within that time period.f.a provider may seek judicial review of the final decision of the prrb or the administrator in a federal district court.f.
depreciable assets 
the medicare regulation governing claims for losses on depreciable assets provides that a n appropriate allowance for depreciation on buildings and equipment used in the provision of patient care is an allowable cost for which a provider may claim reimbursement.a.the annual depreciation for which the provider is reimbursed by medicare is calculated by prorating the historical cost,the price the provider paid to acquire the asset over the asset estimated useful life.a,a,b.as the prrb explained in this case,the cms reimbursed providers annually for a percentage of the yearly depreciation equal to the percentage the asset was used for the care of medicare patients.app.at the historical cost of an asset,minus the annual recognized depreciation,is known as its net book value.b.
the prrb explained that because the net book value is based on estimates of the yearly depreciation,the regulation at f provided for the determination of a depreciation adjustment where a provider incurred a gain or loss on the disposition,a sale of a depreciable asset.app.at alteration added.as the administrator noted,
basically,when there is a gain or loss,it means either that too much depreciation was recognized by the medicare program resulting in a gain to be shared by medicare,or insufficient depreciation was recognized by the medicare program resulting in a loss to be shared by the medicare program.an adjustment is made so that medicare pays the actual cost the provider incurred in using the asset for patient care.
c.the statutory merger provision 
the statutory merger provision of the regulation governing depreciable assets provides for a possible adjustment where assets are disposed of through a statutory merger,which is defined as a combination of two or more corporations under the corporation laws of the state,with one of the corporations surviving.the surviving corporation acquires the assets and liabilities of the merged corporation s by operation of state law.k 
however,a statutory merger results in a medicare gain or loss adjustment only if the merger was between unrelated parties,as defined by.k i in addition,the statutory merger provision states that if the merged corporation was a healthcare provider before the merger,then it is subject to the provisions of paragraph f of this section concerning recovery of accelerated depreciation and the realization of gains and losses.k i.it is the referenced provision of f that is at issue here.section f,the bona fide sale provision,covers gains and losses resulting from the disposition of depreciable assets through sale,scrapping,exchange,demolition,abandonment,condemnation,fire,theft,or other casualty.f.at the time of the transaction in this case,a sale of assets that resulted in a gain or loss would trigger a medicare adjustment only if it was a bona fide sale.f 
the purpose behind both the related parties regulation and the bona fide sale provision is to eliminate the potential for and ensure that medicare only reimburses providers for their actual costs.see,monsour med,at discussing related parties via christi reg l med,leavitt,cir discussing bona fide sale.
bona fide sale provision 
in may,the secretary amended the prm with regard to the bona fide sale provision through a transmittal of changes to the prm prm amendment 
a bona fide sale contemplates an arm length transaction between a willing and well informed buyer and seller,neither being under coercion,for reasonable consideration.an arm length transaction is a transaction negotiated by unrelated parties,each acting in its own self interest.
prm app.at.this additional language was listed under the section of the transmittal setting forth changes added to clarify existing instructions the agency did not list it as new material requiring an effective date.app.at.
similarly,on october,the cms issued a program memorandum on the clarification of the application of the regulations at cfr l to mergers and consolidations involving providers pm.app.at the pm notes that organizations associate or affiliate through mergers or consolidations for reasons that may differ from the traditional merger or consolidation.app.at.because there is no similar regulation specifically addressing mergers and consolidations between or among entities,we are clarifying the applicability of the bona fide sale provision and related parties regulation sections to such mergers or consolidations.app.at.
with respect to the bona fide sale provision,the pm clearly stated that a merger must constitute a bona fide sale,noting 
unlike mergers or consolidations,which are typically driven by the ownership equity interests to seek fair market value for the assets involved in the transaction,many mergers and consolidations have only the interests of the to drive the transaction.
app.at.the pm defined a bona fide sale as one negotiated at arm length between unrelated parties and involving reasonable consideration.app.at.it continued that a large disparity between the sales price consideration and the fair market value of the assets sold indicates the lack of a bona fide sale.app.at emphasis omitted.
regarding its interpretations of both the bona fide sale provision and the related parties regulation,the pm stressed that it was not establishing new rules this pm does not include any new policies regarding mergers or consolidations involving entities.app.at.
discussion 
the administrator denied einstein claim because he concluded that the merger did not constitute a bona fide sale and because the merger occurred between related parties.because either of these findings,if correct,was a sufficient independent basis on which to deny einstein claim,we will limit our focus to the bona fide sale issue.see robert kennedy med.ctr.leavitt,cir declining to reach the related parties issue because the bona fide sale issue is dispositive in this case.
a.the administrator regulatory interpretation 
einstein argues that a merger is not a sale and,therefore,is not subject to the bona fide sale provision.in support of this argument,einstein relies on a letter written by william goeller in when he was hcfa director of the division of payment and reporting policy in the office of reimbursement policy at the bureau of eligibility,reimbursement and coverage.this letter does not mention that a merger must be a bona fide sale and instead states that,f or purposes of calculating the gain or loss,the amount of the assumed debt would be used as the amount received for the assets.app.at.the significance of this letter as support for einstein position is questionable as the letter also states that whether a gain or loss is recognized will be governed by f,which encompasses the bona fide sale provision.
einstein also relies on a letter from charles booth,another former agency official,and on the testimony of former hcfa officials,michael maher and eric yospe.see appellant br.at.citing our decision in mercy home health,at,the secretary argues that statements from former subordinate officials are not owed deference instead,it is the secretary announced interpretation to which deference is due.appellee br.at.although mercy home health does not stand for the proposition that statements of former officials are owed no deference,we agree with the secretary to the extent that his announced interpretation s are owed greater deference.
we agree with judge buckwalter analysis of the relationship between the statutory merger provision and the bona fide sale provision as follows 
t he statutory merger regulation specifically references f,stating,if the merged corporation was a provider before the merger,then it is subject to the provisions of paragraphs d and f of this section concerning recovery of accelerated depreciation.k i.a reasonable interpretation of this provision is that recognition of a loss resulting from a statutory merger is only permitted if otherwise allowed under paragraph f.under paragraph f,the treatment of the gain or loss depends upon the manner of disposition of the asset.f.paragraphs f th r ough f identify the specific means through which a depreciable asset can be disposed including,bona fide sale or scrapping exchange,or donation demolition or abandonment or involuntary conversion.id.at f f.of all the circumstances listed,the disposition most applicable to the present case is the bona fide sale requirement.
einstein,wl,at.the court concluded,therefore,that the administrator interpretation of the merger regulation to require that the transaction constitute a bona fide sale was reasonable.
in addition to arguing that the bona fide sale provision does not apply to mergers,einstein argues that the administrator interpretation of this provision is inconsistent with prior agency statements.in its decision in this case,the administrator,quoting the prm,held that a bona fide sale contemplates an arm length transaction between a willing and buyer and seller,neither being under coercion,for reasonable consideration.an arm length transaction is negotiated by unrelated parties,each acting in its own.app.at.einstein,noting that this definition is found in the prm amendment and the pm,argues that this interpretation was impermissibly applied here because it was not articulated until after the merger at issue.einstein,citing black law dictionary,argues that a bona fide sale is simply one in which valuable consideration is given.it argues,therefore,that any disparity between the fair market value of its assets and the amount of consideration it received from new germantown in the form of assumption of liabilities is irrelevant.
the secretary responds that b requires that a sale can not be bona fide if it is not an exchange for fair value.appellee br.at.this regulatory provision defines fair market value as the price that the asset would bring by bona fide bargaining between buyers and sellers at the date of acquisition.b.we note that the regulation may not have the significance ascribed to it by the secretary as it defines fair market value,not bona fide sale.however,this regulation demonstrates the agency understanding of a relationship between a bona fide sale and fair market value.
the secretary argues that the agency has looked to the reasonableness of consideration since long before the transaction at issue in this case.appellee br.at.for example,in hosp.affiliates int,schweiker,medicare denied reimbursement because a sale was not bona fide and held there is no evidence in the record that the purchase price bore any relation to the actual value of the property.without such evidence,no determination of the transaction being bona fide is appropriate,emphasis omitted.this case shows that,contrary to einstein contention,at least as early as the agency looked to the fair market value when conducting the bona fide sale inquiry.
einstein points to decisions that it contends hold that sales were bona fide even though the consideration paid was less than the appraised value of the assets.however,as the secretary correctly notes,in each of those cases the board found that parties with adverse interests had negotiated at arm length to a
