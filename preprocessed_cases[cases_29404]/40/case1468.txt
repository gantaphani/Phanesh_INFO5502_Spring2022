in,congress created the tennessee valley authority the tva in the interest of the national defense,for agricultural and industrial development,to improve navigation in the tennessee river,and to control the destructive flood waters in the tennessee river and mississippi river basins.as part of its mission,the tva operates power plants in tennessee,alabama,and kentucky.the state of north carolina brought this nuisance action against the tva,contending that these plants emit various pollutants which travel through the atmosphere into north carolina,adversely impacting human health and environmental quality.north carolina seeks an injunction prohibiting the tva from operating its plants in a harmful manner and requiring it to abate the alleged nuisance.
the tva moved to dismiss north carolina suit,arguing that it is barred by the discretionary function doctrine,the supremacy clause,and the holding of ferris wilbur,cir.the district court rejected each of these arguments and denied the motion to dismiss.the district court then certified its decision for immediate appeal pursuant to b,and we accepted the appeal.the tva now reasserts the same arguments it raised in the district court for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
the tva first argues that this suit is barred by the discretionary function doctrine.the discretionary function doctrine precludes a suit in tort against the united states,its agencies,or its officers where the challenged conduct involves an element of judgment or choice,and that judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield,the challenged action is based on considerations of public policy.suter united states,cir internal citations omitted.this exception from suit for discretionary acts generally arises in the context of the federal tort claims act ftca,where congress provided that the united states waiver of sovereign immunity does not extend to a ny claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.a.the tva,however,recognizes that it does not benefit from the discretionary function exception embodied in the ftca because its sovereign immunity is not waived by the ftca but by its own organic act.that is,congress waived the sovereign immunity that the tva would otherwise have possessed by specifically providing that the tva may sue and be sued in its corporate name.b.while both parties agree that this clause waives the tva sovereign immunity to some degree,they dispute the scope of this waiver.
congress has waived the sovereign immunity of certain federal entities by including in the enabling legislation provisions that they may sue and be sued.loeffler frank,d.in contrast with other waivers of sovereign immunity,waivers should be liberally construed.id.thus,when congress establishes such an agency,authorizes it to engage in commercial and business transactions with the public,and permits it to sue and be sued,it can not be lightly assumed that restrictions on that authority are to be implied.id.instead,for an exception to the authorization to exist,it must be clearly shown that certain types of suits are not consistent with the statutory or constitutional scheme,that an implied restriction of the general authority is necessary to avoid grave interference with the performance of a governmental function,or that for other reasons it was plainly the purpose of congress to use the sue and be sued clause in a narrow sense.fha burr.footnote omitted see also loeffler,at.fed.deposit ins.meyer,d.absent such a showing,agencies authorized to sue and be sued are presumed to have fully waived immunity.meyer,at.emphasis added.in other words,it must be presumed that when congress launched a governmental agency into the commercial world and endowed it with authority to sue or be sued,that agency is not less amenable to judicial process than a private enterprise under like circumstances would be.loeffler,at.
under these principles,the tva clause stands as a broad waiver of sovereign immunity which,absent a showing to the contrary,would encompass north carolina claims.the tva,however,asserts that a discretionary function exception grounded in the constitutional concept of separation of powers renders this lawsuit inconsistent with the constitutional scheme.to support this position,the tva looks to our holding in mcmellon united states,cir en banc.
in mcmellon,we examined the question of whether a discretionary function exception bars a lawsuit filed against the united states under the suits in admiralty act siaa.after noting that the siaa does not contain a statutory exception from suit for discretionary functions,we concluded that such an exception nonetheless exists by virtue of the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.we based our conclusion on the fact that the constitution does not allow judicial regulation which might prevent the executive branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions.id.at.we likewise found that under our constitutional system the judicial branch may neither be assigned nor allowed tasks that are more properly accomplished by other branches.id.we therefore held that the courts may not assume the power to regulate,through the medium of tort liability,the manner in which the executive branch exercises the discretion which the constitution assigns to it.id.at.
we do not believe that the constitutional concerns underlying our decision in mcmellon are present here.the tva is a corporate entity,separate and distinct from the federal government itself.pierce united states.thus,the tva maintains a separate corporate identity,a separate legal staff,and a separate headquarters.tva epa,cir,vacated in part on other grounds,cir.the attorney general is prohibited from representing the tva in a legal proceeding unless expressly requested by the tva to do so,stat.in addition,the tva is removed from centralized control in washington,enjoys discretionary ratemaking authority,and is exempt from at least provisions of the administrative procedures act.tva epa,at.more important than these structural symbols of independence,however,are the marks of independence which congress has provided for the tva.congress has,for example,exempted the tva from suit in the court of federal claims,c provided that the tva shall be governed by an independent board of directors,exempted the tva from the civil service laws,exempted the tva from the purchasing requirements otherwise applicable to federal entities,b and provided the tva with authority to issue bonds which are not obligations of the united states,b.moreover,the tva funds its programs itself rather than with congressional appropriations.
congress statements with regard to the tva lend support to its independence.when creating the tva in,congress indicated that it intend s that the corporation shall have much of the essential freedom and elasticity of a private business corporation.at.even more telling,congress exempted the tva from the ftca,see l,because it intended that legal claims be exercised against the tennessee valley authority exactly as they could have been exercised against private utility companies.cong.rec.statement of hill.
this degree of independence which the tva possesses in large part alleviates the constitutional concerns which we recognized in mcmellon.a lawsuit against the tva is not a suit against the united states itself or one of its agencies subject to the direct executive control which is granted to the president by article ii of the constitution.rather,a suit against the tva is against a governmental agency in the commercial world,loeffler,at,that is governed by an independent board of directors,g because the tva is so far removed from the control of the executive branch,operating as the functional equivalent of a private corporation,the judiciary does not run the same risk of overstepping its bounds and prevent ing the executive branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions,mcmellon,at,that it did in mcmellon.
even were the tva more tightly linked with the executive branch,this case would not conflict with the principles recognized in mcmellon.in this case,a judicial decision on the lawfulness of the tva plant emissions does not strip the tva of its authority to execute its statutory duties.at most,it could require the tva to take into account and to abide by certain air quality standards when operating its power plants.as the district court recognized,t he executive ability to decide the level of pollutants to emit within the allowed bounds,how best to address any necessary reduction in pollutants,how to allocate the tva funds and other resources and a myriad of other issues and decisions would remain untouched.north carolina tva,d.similarly,permitting this suit to go forward does not require the judicial branch to perform executive branch functions or decide issues it is not equipped to resolve.see mcmellon,at i f all actions taking place in the maritime arena were subject to judicial review,the judiciary would be called upon to decide issues it is not equipped to resolve.the federal courts have long resolved nuisance claims,including public nuisance claims,through equity actions,and they have used this power to regulate pollution and other noxious emissions.see,scribner summers,cir wright masonite,cir.this case,then,involves the overlapping responsibility between the three branches of government which the constitution permits,mistretta united states,d,rather than intrusion by one branch into another functions.
accordingly,we conclude that this suit does not implicate the concerns which led to our decision in mcmellon.we therefore hold that the broad waiver of sovereign immunity effected by the tva clause is not restricted by a discretionary function exception in this case 
we next turn to the tva contention that the supremacy clause bars this lawsuit from proceeding.by virtue of the supremacy clause,the activities of the federal government are free from regulation by any state.mayo united states.however,congress may waive the protections of the supremacy clause and authorize state regulation of federal entities where the waiver is clear and unambiguous.goodyear atomic miller,d.at issue here is the waiver of supremacy clause immunity which congress included in the clean air act caa,et.
the caa provides that federal facilities such as the tva 
s hall be subject to,and comply with,all federal,state,interstate,and local requirements,administrative authority,and process and sanctions respecting the control and abatement of air pollution in the same manner,and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity.the preceding sentence shall apply a to any requirement whether substantive or procedural including any recordkeeping or reporting requirement,any requirement respecting permits and any other requirement whatsoever c to the exercise of any federal,state,or local administrative authority,and d to any process and sanction,whether enforced in federal,state,or local courts,or in any other manner.this subsection shall apply notwithstanding any immunity of such agencies,officers,agents,or employees under any law or rule of law.
a.the tva argues that this provision of the caa waives only some of the protections of the supremacy clause in that it subjects the tva only to state requirements which are based on objective,quantifiable standards subject to uniform application.the tva therefore contends that a nuisance action,not embodying an objective,quantifiable standard,does not fall within congress waiver of supremacy clause protection.in essence,the tva maintains that a nuisance action is not a requirement within the meaning of the caa.
in assessing the tva argument,we look first to the literal and plain language of the statute.markovski gonzales,cir.because the caa does not define requirement,we must accord the term its ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended it to bear some different import.directv,nicholas,cir.in common parlance,requirement means s omething that is required something obligatory.american heritage dictionary coll.ed.require,in turn,means t o impose an obligation on compel.id.nothing in the definition of requirement restricts the term meaning to objective,quantifiable standards which must be met.nor does anything in the caa indicate that congress intended that the term bear the narrow meaning the tva suggests.the plain language of the caa,then,does not support the tva position.
the tva reading of requirements likewise finds no support in case law,for the supreme court has held that state requirements include standards.in cipollone liggett group,d,the court considered the reach of a preemption statute which provided that 
no requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
b.the question before the court was whether this statute encompassed state claims.in answering this question,the court held 
the phrase n o requirement or prohibition sweeps broadly and suggests no distinction between positive enactments and common law to the contrary,those words easily encompass obligations that take the form of rules.state regulation can be as effectively exerted through an award of damages as through some form of preventive relief.the obligation to pay compensation can be,indeed is designed to be,a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy.
cipollone,at.plurality opinion internal citations and quotations omitted the court therefore rejected the notion that a tort action is not a requirement of state law while noting that a contrary interpretation would be at odds both with the plain words of the statute and with the general understanding of damages actions.id.
medtronic,lohr,d,is similar.there,the court relied on cipollone when determining the meaning of another preemption statute which provided that no state may establish or continue in effect any requirement which differs from the federal requirement.id.at.citing a.a majority of the court held that a state tort action may impose a requirement within the meaning of a justice breyer noted that o ne can reasonably read the word requirement as including the legal requirements that grow out of the application,in particular circumstances,of a state tort law.id.at.similarly,justice wrote that s tate damages actions operate to require manufacturers to comply with duties.id.at.
in this case,the phrases all requirements and any requirement sweep at least as broadly as the no requirement and any requirement language at issue in cipollone and medtronic the cipollone and medtronic courts expansive construction of requirement and their unequivocal holdings do not support the tva preferred narrow reading of the term,and we see no basis for adopting a more limited definition here 
in sum,the plain meaning of requirement and the supreme court broad interpretation of the term foreclose the tva argument that the caa does not mandate compliance with state requirements enforced through a tort suit.this being the case,we conclude that this lawsuit falls within congress waiver of the tva supremacy clause protections.
finally,we turn to the tva contention that our decision in ferris wilbur,cir,bars north carolina cause of action.in ferris,a private citizen sued the secretary of the navy in nuisance,seeking an injunction against the storage of weapons at a naval facility.we held that the suit must be dismissed because the use of government property had been authorized by congress and lay within the discretion of the executive.id.at.we noted that a contrary holding would permit the judicial department to interfere with the reasonable discretion of the executive.id.
this cited language amply demonstrates that ferris was an early case applying the discretionary function doctrine.further,because there was no statutory discretionary function exception at issue in ferris,our ruling necessarily rested on the constitutional concept of separation of powers.see id.permitting suit
