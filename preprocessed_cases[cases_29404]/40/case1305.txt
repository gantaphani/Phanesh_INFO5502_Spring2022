philip morris brings this appeal seeking review of a united states department of agriculture decision regarding the implementation of the fair and equitable tobacco reform act fetra,stat,codified at et.fetra instructs usda to levy certain assessments against manufacturers and of tobacco products.philip morris challenges usda decision to use tax rates instead of current tax rates in calculating how these assessments are to be allocated across manufacturers of different tobacco products.the district court concluded that usda decision was based upon a reasonable interpretation of fetra and granted usda motion for summary judgment.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
in,congress enacted fetra to end the system of quotas and other price supports that tobacco growers in the united states had enjoyed since the passage of the agricultural adjustment act of.it chose,however,to ease the transition from the old quota system by replacing it with a temporary system of periodic payments to tobacco growers and other holders of tobacco quotas.the payments began in and are to cease in.see.fetra created the tobacco trust fund to fund these payments.the fund is administered by the commodity credit corporation ccc,a government corporation administered by usda,and funded with ccc assets as well as assessments imposed on manufacturers of tobacco products.at issue in this case is the permissibility of usda chosen method for making those assessments.
each year,fetra requires usda to determine the total amount of funds that must be raised through the assessment process in order to make the payments required for that year under and to cover other fund expenses.b.then,usda is to follow a procedure to determine what portion of that total amount is to be paid by each manufacturer of tobacco products.
in the first step of that procedure,usda is instructed to calculate the percentages of the total national assessment to be paid collectively by the manufacturers of each class of tobacco product cigarettes,cigars,snuff,tobacco,chewing tobacco,and pipe tobacco.c.then,at step two,usda is to determine each manufacturer individual liability by multiplying its market share within each class by that class total assessment burden as calculated in step one.e,f.usda performs these calculations in an initial determination at the beginning of each year,and then collects the resulting amounts from manufacturers in quarterly payments.described at this level of abstraction,the procedure seems simple,but this veneer of simplicity dissolves under closer examination.
congress instructions for determining each class total assessment burden are sparse.fetra provides specific percentages of the assessment burden to be allocated to each of the six classes of tobacco product in fiscal year.c.but for subsequent years,the statute instructs only that these percentages are to be adjusted to reflect changes in the share of gross domestic volume held by each class of product.c.gross domestic volume,in turn,is defined as the volume of product removed into commerce and subject to federal excise taxes or import tariffs at the time of removal.a a.
volumes of different classes of tobacco product are measured in different units.volumes of cigarettes and cigars are measured in sticks,but volumes of all other tobacco products are measured in pounds.see g prescribing units of measurement to be used in calculating volume of domestic sales prescribing excise tax rates per stick for cigars and cigarettes,and per pound for the other classes of tobacco product.usda determined that,in arriving at the initial allocations in c,congress converted these volumes into a common unit dollars by multiplying each class volume by the maximum excise tax rate applicable to that class.to arrive at a percentage for each class,the resulting dollar amount for each class was then divided by the sum of all dollar amounts across all six classes.see tobacco transition assessments,february,codified at pt.the statute itself,however,does not explain that this is how the initial allocations were determined or explicitly indicate that future allocations are to be arrived at in this way.
step two of the fetra allocation procedure deals with subdividing the allocation among manufacturers of tobacco products within each class.as a starting point,fetra provides that the total assessment for each class of tobacco product is to be allocated among the manufacturers of that class based on each manufacturer share of gross domestic volume.e.more specifically,this allocation is to be calculated by multiplying each manufacturer market share within a class by that class total allocation from step one.f.a manufacturer market share,in turn,is to be its share of the volume of domestic sales for that class of product.a.
compared to its skeletal treatment of gross domestic volume,fetra provides considerable detail about how to calculate volume of domestic sales.fetra devotes two subsections to the latter,one for determining it and another for measuring it.g,h.usda is instructed to calculate volume of domestic sales based upon gross domestic volume,forms relating to a manufacturer volume of removals and taxes paid,and any other relevant information.g,g,h.thus,while e instructs usda to base its allocations on gross domestic volume,g indicates that other factors are to be considered as well.
in february of,usda promulgated a final rule implementing the fetra assessment methodology codified at.tobacco transition assessments.february,codified at pt.that rule provided that usda would determine each year allocation on the basis of each class share of the excise taxes paid b ased upon the reports filed by domestic manufacturers and importers of tobacco products with the department of the treasury and the department of homeland security.a 
with this interpretation in place,congress incorporated the fetra methodology into another statute,the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act fsptca,stat.that statute relies upon the fetra methodology to determine the user fee to be paid by manufacturers of tobacco products to the food and drug administration to fund the exercise of its newly conferred jurisdiction to regulate them.id.b b ii codified at b b ii.
congress also passed the children health insurance program reauthorization act of chipra,stat.as well as expanding federal health insurance programs for children,that bill also increased the excise taxes on every class of tobacco product.chipra.the cigar industry,through the cigar association of america,mounted a lobbying campaign to persuade congress not to increase excise taxes on cigars on the grounds that the tax itself would be burdensome and that the change in rates would increase the cigar industry fetra assessment burden.this campaign reached a great many congressional members.but the lobbying effort,it would seem,did not succeed.chipra equalized the tax rates for and small cigars at per thousand.chipra a,b.
though the rates were equalized,the relative change in rates was much larger for cigars than cigarettes.while the rate for cigarettes was increased to from per thousand,b chipra b,the rate for small cigars increased to from only per thousand,a chipra a.the tax rate for large cigars was also greatly increased the rate increased from per thousand cigars to per thousand cigars a chipra a.
as described above,the fetra allocation calculates each class share of the burden by multiplying the removed volume of each class of product by the maximum applicable excise tax rate.usda regulations at the time chipra was enacted provided that allocations would be determined on the basis of each class share of the excise taxes paid,which implied that usda would use current tax rates in performing these calculations therefore the tax rate changes in chipra would have substantially reduced the burden allocated to the cigarette industry and shifted it to manufacturers of other types of tobacco products.the cigar industry in particular would have seen a marked increase in its liability.
after the passage of chipra,however,usda promulgated a technical amendment to to make clear that it would continue to use the tax rates the rates applied by congress in setting the fiscal year allocations.tobacco transition payment program tobacco transition assessments,to be codified at pt.this amendment altered the text of the regulation such that usda would calculate each class share of the year assessment on the basis of each class share of the excise taxes paid using for all years the tax rates that applied in fiscal year.a emphasis added.usda published an extensive explanation of the amendment.at,which it summarized as follows 
usda is modifying the regulations for the tobacco transition payment program ttpp to clarify,consistent with current practice and as required by the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of fetra,that the allocation of tobacco manufacturer and importer assessments among the six classes of tobacco products will be determined using constant tax rates so as to assure that adjustments continue to be based solely on changes in the gross domestic volume of each class.this means that usda will continue to determine tobacco class allocations using the federal excise tax rates that applied in fiscal year.these are the same tax rates used when ttpp was implemented and must be used to ensure,consistent with fetra,that changes in the relative class assessments are made only on the basis of changes in volume,not changes in tax rates.this technical amendment does not change how the ttpp is implemented by usda,but rather clarifies the wording of the regulation to directly address this point.
the technical amendment first had an effect in usda allocation of the fiscal year national assessment.philip morris contends that,because usda used the tax rates,it calculated that the cigarette industry would pay of the national assessment instead of,the maximum that would have been allocable to it had the rates been applied.the cigar class was allocated instead of.in the first quarterly assessment of that year,therefore,manufacturers of cigarettes paid approximately million instead of million.of this million,million was assessed to philip morris by virtue of its cigarette market share.had usda allocated only million to the cigarette class,philip morris individual assessment would have been significantly lower.
philip morris appealed this assessment,as well as the assessments for the next two quarters,to the secretary of agriculture under i.usda denied all three appeals on the basis that the appeal process could only be used to assert mathematical or factual errors,not to challenge the assessment formula itself.
philip morris also petitioned usda for a rulemaking that would,in effect,repeal the december,technical amendment to,and require usda to always use current tax rates.usda rejected that petition.see.
finally,philip morris brought this lawsuit,arguing that usda december,technical amendment was inconsistent with fetra.it sought an order vacating that amendment,restraining usda from collecting assessments in excess of what philip morris would have paid had current tax rates been applied,and directing usda to refund the excessive payments philip morris had already made.at summary judgment,however,the district court concluded that usda methodology faithfully adjust s the percentage of the total amount required to be assessed against each class of tobacco product as directed by c and reasonably reflects the congressional intent underlying fetra.philip morris usa vilsack,d.accordingly,it granted usda motion for summary judgment.this appeal followed.
in determining whether usda decision to use only the tax rates applicable in is permissible,we conduct the analysis articulated in chevron,natural resources defense council.we first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.at step one,we employ the traditional rules of statutory construction.elm grove coal,cir quoting brown williamson tobacco fda,cir.in so doing,we consider the overall statutory scheme,legislative history,the history of evolving congressional regulation in the area,and other relevant statutes.id.at this stage,the court gives no weight to the agency interpretation.mylan,fda,cir.if the court determines that congress intent is clear,then the inquiry ends and congress intent is given effect.see chevron,at.
if we conclude that congress has not clearly answered the question at issue,we then consider whether the agency interpretation of the statute is based upon a permissible construction of the governing statute.id.at.to elucidate the gaps and ambiguities in the programs created by congress is one of the core functions of an administrative agency,a function that we presume congress intentionally invokes in drafting such a statute.id.at.we therefore will not usurp an agency interpretive authority by supplanting its construction with our own,so long as the interpretation is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.a construction meets this standard if it represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency care by the statute.id.at quoting united states shimer.
when an agency decision constitutes a change in position,the court must be satisfied that such a change in course was made as a genuine exercise of the agency judgment.such a change does not,however,require greater justification than the agency initial decision.see fcc fox television stations.we defer to the agency new position no less than the old,so long as we are satisfied that the agency change in position was intentional and considered.it is not the court role to evaluate whether the agency reasons for its new position are better than its reasons for the old one.id.we review the district court factual and legal conclusions on an administrative record de novo.ohio valley envtl.coal.aracoma coal,cir.
we begin our chevron step one analysis with this most basic observation nowhere does fetra explicitly say that usda is required to use any tax rate at all in computing an assessment allocation,much less that it must use the rates that were applicable in any particular year.the statute only overt references to taxes or tax rates can be found in a b h b.section a b requires that gross domestic volume only include tobacco product that is taxable when removed.section h b requires that manufacturers of tobacco products submit copies of forms related to their excise tax payments.significantly,neither of these provisions deal directly with the computation of assessment allocations.
instead it was usda that discovered,through mathematical reverse engineering,that congress had used the excise tax rates applicable in to compute the initial assessment allocation in c.usda determined that it could reproduce the numbers in that paragraph by obtaining volume information from publically available statistical reports published by the treasury and multiplying those volumes by the maximum excise tax rate applicable to each class of product.this process generated dollar amounts that,when taken as percentages of the total dollar amount across all six classes,corresponded with the percentages in c.
but even at chevron step one,we must not confine ourselves to a merely superficial reading of the statute.we must also make use of our traditional tools of statutory construction to determine whether congress intent is revealed in more still.elm grove coal,at.
notwithstanding the lack of any overt reference to a requirement,philip morris argues that such a requirement is implied from the overall structure of the statute and by subsequent congressional action.it does so by cobbling together various provisions relating to fetra allocation procedure and by speculating about the policy goals of congress chosen method for performing the allocation calculations.philip morris reading of fetra may be a plausible one,but its burden is far higher than showing plausibility.to disturb usda decision at chevron step one,it must persuade us that usda decision is contrary to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.this it has not done.
philip morris argues that congress commanded usda to adjust the class shares based upon changes in the share of currently taxable removals in a b.therefore,it argues,it follows that congress intended usda to use current rates.appellants br.at emphasis omitted.philip morris premise is correct,but its conclusion does not necessarily follow.it might have made sense to use the same edition of the internal revenue code to determine what products are to be included in gross domestic volume and to determine how volumes are to be translated into percentages.but there is nothing incoherent about taking a different approach.
to conclude otherwise would invert the standard we apply under chevron step one we vacate an agency decision if congress clearly manifested a contrary intent,not when congress could have but did not clearly manifest its approval.in this light,congressional silence might actually cut the other way.section a b exemplifies language that congress could have used in c,but conspicuously did not,to make clear that current tax rates were to be used in calculating the assessment allocations.
philip morris argues that congress clearly indicated that it expected usda to always use current rates in the allocations by requiring manufacturers to submit forms that relate to the payment of tobacco product excise taxes.but fetra only instructs usda to use these forms as a part of the allocation process.
the requirement that manufacturers submit these forms appears in h,which is entitled measurement of volume of domestic sales.consistent with this characterization,fetra only requires that usda actually use the forms in one place g.this paragraph directs usda to compute volume of domestic sales,not gross domestic volume,based on information provided by the manufacturers and importers as well as any other relevant information id.and,as we have noted,fetra only instructs usda to use volume of domestic sales for one purpose computation of a manufacturer market share to determine the allocations at step two of the fetra assessment procedure.a,f 
philip morris argues that congress can not have intended to require the use of these forms only for the allocation because information about taxes paid is unnecessary for those calculations.this is so,it contends,because market share calculations will always be or,comparisons.therefore,unlike the allocation that deals with differing units of measurement,there is no need to use the excise tax rates as a conversion factor for calculations.
this overlooks,however,the possibility that congress intended for usda to use these forms for some purpose other than unit conversion.they could be valuable,for example,in determining the volume of taxable products actually removed by each manufacturer.indeed,the record indicates that usda uses the forms in exactly this way.but even if philip morris assumption were correct,the forms irrelevance would be an infirmity in fetra,not in usda interpretation of it.that the data might be superfluous in the calculation for which congress directed it be used does not amount to a clear articulation that it should actually be used for some other purpose.
philip morris remaining step one arguments presuppose the existence of a textual basis for concluding that congress intended for usda to always use current rates under c.but,for the reasons discussed above,we conclude otherwise.the only direct evidence of congress intent in this regard is its actual use of the rates,in establishing the initial allocation under c.but this provides no basis for determining whether congress intended that usda would always use current rates or that it would always use rates.the minimal textual evidence is equally consistent with both methodologies.
this conclusion dooms philip morris remaining chevron step one arguments.most basically,philip morris argues that usda must follow the methodology congress used in establishing its initial allocation,and that this methodology was to use the excise taxes that applied in the year the products were removed.but,as we have just pointed out,there is no independent textual support for this contention.
philip morris also argues that,in adjusting for changes in each class share of gross domestic volume,congress decided to use each class excise tax burden as the factor with which to convert volumes to shares.but this argument begs the same question.
likewise,we are not persuaded by philip morris argument that congress intended to further the policies underlying its choice of excise tax rates by building them into the fetra assessment allocation.there is no evidence in the text of fetra or elsewhere to indicate that congress intended to use fetra as a vehicle to further tax policy writ large.the record equally supports the conclusion that congress used the excise tax rates only because they were a useful mathematical expedient.therefore,having found no clear statement of congressional intent,we turn to step two of the chevron analysis.
the chevron step two analysis brings us closer to the heart of this dispute.here we examine whether usda decision is based upon a permissible reading of fetra,a reading that reflects a reasonable balancing of the policy considerations that congress entrusted to usda care.chevron,at.we do not evaluate which interpretation of fetra is best.that is a responsibility delegated by congress to usda.our task is simply to determine whether usda interpretation is reasonable in light of all we know about congress intent in passing it.
many of philip morris arguments at step two of the chevron analysis are reiterations of its arguments.they are equally unavailing in the context of chevron step two.
in particular,as it did under chevron step one,philip morris contends that usda was entrusted with all of the complex and important policy considerations that drive tax law generally.usda interpretation is unreasonable,it argues,because it disregards the considerations reflected in other statutes involving tobacco excise taxes.but as we concluded above,there is no evidence that congress intended for fetra to do anything more than provide a workable methodology for the allocation of assessments across manufacturers of tobacco product.
philip morris does,however,present some independent arguments.it argues that usda decision is based upon an interpretation of fetra at odds with the text of the statute that usda decision is inconsistent with its previous position,and that congress subsequently entrenched this prior position,rendering it immune to further modification by the usda.we consider each of these arguments in turn,and conclude that,as at step one,philip morris presents nothing more than a plausible alternative reading of fetra.
philip morris argues that usda decision to continue using rates rests on an impermissible interpretation of the phrase share of gross domestic volume in c.usda has interpreted that term to mean a given class contribution to the total such that the share changes only in response to changes in actual volume produced.philip morris presents two arguments.first it argues that usda interpretation defines share of gross domestic volume as a volume and,thus,makes it synonymous with a different statutory term,volume of domestic sales.in the alternative,philip morris argues that usda interpretation has defined the term as a percentage but impermissibly uses different conversion rates for calculating this percentage at the two steps of the assessment process tax rates for the allocation,but current tax rates for the allocation 
these arguments are,however,unavailing.a volume is an actual number of objects in an absolute sense.but a share,as usda has interpreted it,is an abstract relationship between a volume and a larger total volume.usda interpretation therefore defines share of gross domestic volume differently from volume of domestic sales.
share of gross domestic volume,as usda has interpreted the term,also need not be a percentage.a percentage is a numerical representation of a share,not the share itself.therefore share of gross domestic volume as usda has interpreted it,need not incorporate any conversion factor at all.philip morris argues that usda does,in fact,use taxes actually paid and thus current tax rates as a conversion factor in the allocation procedure.but usda uses taxes
