carlos lizama,a native and citizen of el salvador,petitions for judicial review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under article iii of the united nations convention against torture cat.lizama claims that he fears violent persecution by gangs in el salvador on account of his membership in the social group of young,americanized,salvadoran male deportees with criminal histories who oppose gangs,and that the salvadoran government would be unwilling or unable to prevent such violence.for the reasons explained below,we dismiss lizama asylum claim for lack of jurisdiction and deny the petition for review of his withholding of removal and cat claims.
carlos lizama left el salvador on february,and entered the united states soon thereafter.on june,the department of homeland security issued lizama a notice to appear,charging him with removability for entering this country without inspection.
on july,lizama testified at a merits hearing before an immigration judge ij.he conceded removability but petitioned for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.lizama recognized that asylum claims must generally be brought within one year of the petitioner entry into the united states.he argued,however,that because his asylum claim was based in part on the wealth he accumulated in this country between and,he was not eligible to bring that claim until.he claimed that the recent acquisition of his wealth constituted changed circumstances which excused his failure to file a timely asylum application.
lizama asylum and withholding of removal claims were based on his fear of persecution on account of his membership in the purported social group of young,americanized,salvadoran male deportees with criminal histories who oppose gangs.he explained that he would be easily recognizable by salvadorans as a member of this group due to his dress,accent,demeanor,and standard of living.lizama based his cat claim on the assertion that it is more likely than not that gang members would torture him with the willful government officials.
in support of his claims,lizama testified that he owned and managed a successful painting business in northern virginia,which accounted for his recently accumulated wealth and allowed him to regularly send between and a month to his mother in el salvador.lizama also stated that he gave his mother to rebuild her home in her farming village of san moritas.according to lizama,his mother home is now one of the nicest in her community,and villagers in san moritas are aware she receives money from a relative in the united states.lizama claimed that,if removed to el salvador,he would live with his mother,though he conceded that he could live elsewhere.
lizama also testified that he was afraid to return to el salvador for fear of being persecuted by gangs.as a deportee,lizama testified,he would be targeted by gang members curious to know if he was affiliated with a gang,especially a rival gang.he claimed his resistance to gang recruitment would inspire manipulation,extortion,and even death threats from gang members.lizama testified that his fear of extortion was based primarily on what he had seen on television.he did not claim his mother had ever been harassed or harmed by gangs in el salvador.moreover,although he testified that he personally knew eight individuals with criminal records who were deported to el salvador,he did not assert that any of them had encountered the problems he fears.
in support of his claims,lizama proffered the expert testimony of harry edwin vanden,a country expert on el salvador and salvadoran gangs.vanden testified that gangs such as and mara have a pervasive presence in el salvador and operate,simply put,all over the country.according to vanden,lizama could be identified and targeted by gangs as different from others in el salvador because of his clothing,manner of acting,and altered accent when speaking spanish.in addition,gangs would be interested in lizama financial situation as well as his criminal would want to know how lizama made his money in the united states and whether he was affiliated with any gang.in short,vanden testified,gangs in el salvador would target lizama as a person of interest because of his age,muscular and tough appearance,criminal record,and financial situation.
vanden believed it was very doubtful the government of el salvador would protect lizama from gangs because the police are not always present in san moritas,where lizama might live.he conceded,however,that most middle and individuals live in neighborhoods and that lizama could find full protection from the widespread violence by living in such a community.
lizama submitted as additional evidence the state department issue paper entitled youth gang organizations in el salvador,which recognized criminal gang organizations as a serious and pervasive challenge to the security,stability and welfare of el salvador.the issue paper also stated,however,that the salvadoran government law enforcement policy may be having a noticeable effect on gang behavior,and at least in the short term,in controlling gang violence.id.at.
the ij found lizama credible,but denied him relief.first,the ij deemed lizama asylum application untimely because it was filed more than one year after he entered the united states.the ij rejected lizama argument that his relatively recent accumulation of wealth established changed circumstances that would justify an exception to the filing period.with respect to withholding of removal,the ij concluded that being a young,americanized,salvadoran male deportee with a criminal history who opposes gangs did not qualify lizama for membership in a social group possessing the common,immutable characteristics and recognized level of visibility and particularity required by bia precedent.even if lizama could show he was a member of a protected social group,the ij went on to conclude that he could not show a likelihood that he would be persecuted on that basis if returned to el salvador.finally,the ij denied lizama protection under the cat based on evidence that lizama could avoid danger by living in a area,and could not prove the government of el salvador would acquiesce in his torture.
lizama appealed the decision to the bia,which affirmed the ij determinations.it agreed that lizama was statutorily ineligible for asylum due to the untimely filing of his application,rejecting lizama argument that the changed circumstances of recently accumulated wealth excused the delay.in addition,the bia found that lizama had failed to establish that he belonged to a legally cognizable social group for purposes of withholding of removal.finally,the bia upheld the ij denial of relief under the cat.finding lizama ineligible for relief,the bia ordered him removed.this timely petition for judicial review followed.
on appeal,lizama raises three arguments.first,he asserts that the bia erred in holding his asylum application to be untimely.lizama specifically contends that the ij erroneously interchanged the proper standard of changed circumstances with that of exceptional circumstances.second,lizama argues that the bia erred by ruling that he failed to establish membership in a legally cognizable social group as the basis for his withholding of removal claim.according to lizama,it incorrectly analyzed his purported social group,focusing on each of the group characteristics individually instead of considering them in totality.lizama lastly argues that,contrary to the bia findings,the evidence in the record is sufficient to support his claim for protection under the cat.we review each contention in turn.
in so doing,we must uphold the bia determinations unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion and must treat findings of fact as conclusive unless the evidence before the bia was such that any reasonable adjudicator would have been compelled to conclude to the contrary.mirisawo holder,cir citations and quotations omitted see also b b,d.
we first turn to lizama challenge to the denial of his asylum application.an alien must file an application for asylum within one year of arriving in the united states.see a b a ii.asylum applications may be considered beyond the deadline,however,if an applicant demonstrates changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum,or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified.a d.changed circumstances may include c hanges in conditions in the applicant country of nationality or c hanges in the applicant circumstances that materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum,including activities the applicant becomes involved in outside the country of feared persecution that place the applicant at risk.a i.extraordinary circumstances refers to events or factors directly related to the failure to meet the deadline.id.a.an applicant attempting to demonstrate the existence of changed or extraordinary circumstances must also demonstrate that he filed the application within a reasonable period,given those circumstances.see id.a.
lizama contends that even though he did not file his application for asylum within one year of the date of his arrival in the united states,as required by a b,he is eligible for the changed circumstances exception.specifically,he argues that,because his asylum application is based in part on his wealth,he only became eligible to file the application after he acquired that wealth between and.the bia upheld the ij determination that lizama was statutorily ineligible for asylum.it reasoned that,even assuming lizama accumulation of in this country constituted changed circumstances that would excuse his late filing,he failed to file his asylum application within a reasonable period after acquiring that wealth.
as a general rule,this court lacks jurisdiction to review the bia decision regarding the timeliness of a petitioner application for asylum.see a,providing that n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination on whether the alien filed his application within a year of entry or whether changed circumstances exist which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum.congress passage of the real id act of however,created an exception to this jurisdictional bar,preserving constitutional claims and questions of law for appellate review.see id.a d.
lizama asserts,without elaboration,that in confusing the legal standard of changed circumstances and exceptional circumstances,the ij committed plain error which is subject to our review.although the precise thrust of this argument is unclear,it is significant that lizama does not characterize the mistake as raising a question of law for jurisdictional purposes.in any event,it is clear from the record that the ij substitution of the term exceptional circumstances for changed circumstances was inadvertent and not a legal determination affecting the substance of this analysis.
in applying a d,the ij correctly noted at the outset that the deadline may be overlooked only if lizama demonstrates clearly changed circumstances affecting eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances directly relat ed to the delay in filing.this statement demonstrates the ij recognition of the distinction between changed and exceptional circumstances and the situations in which each applies.in addition,the ij properly understood lizama argument to be that he has worked in the united states since his arrival in the united states and has made more income in the last few years and that that constitutes changed circumstances.
although the ij mistakenly referred to exceptional instead of changed circumstances on three occasions,he nevertheless proceeded to explain why the recent accumulation of wealth failed to affect lizama eligibility for asylum,thereby appropriately applying the changed circumstances standard.see j.t he respondent has not established the point at which the respondent wealth would change such that he could not return to el salvador and that he would apply for asylum within a reasonable period of time from that point.and the ij ultimately concluded that he did not believe that respondent has established changed circumstances as required.
in any event,the bia decision refers only to changed circumstances and provides a reasoned explanation for why lizama untimely filing is inexcusable 
although the respondent argues that he was not aware that he would be at risk in el salvador until he had a sudden increase in wealth in,the immigration judge found that,for many years prior to,the respondent made significantly more income in the united states than an average resident of el salvador at tr.at.see respondent brief at.in fact,the respondent testified that he worked since his arrival in the united states and made over in tr.at.see exh,tab thus,given the evidence presented,it was not clearly erroneous for the immigration judge to find that,assuming that the respondent acquisition of wealth constituted changed circumstances under the act,the respondent did not meet his burden of showing that he filed his asylum application within a reasonable period of time after he acquired this wealth at.
since the ij misstatement was simply a labeling error and not an issue affecting his or the bia legal analysis,lizama argument regarding the misstatement fails to raise a question of law vesting us with jurisdiction to review the denial of his asylum application.accordingly,we dismiss lizama asylum petition.
we next turn to lizama argument that he is entitled to withholding of removal withholding of removal is available under b to an alien who shows clear probability of persecution in the proposed country of removal because of his race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.see b a b.to establish clear probability,the alien must prove it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal.gomis holder,cir.the applicant bears the burden of demonstrating a clear probability of persecution based on one of the five protected grounds enumerated above.niang gonzales,cir.
lizama claim of persecution is based on membership in a particular social group consisting of young,americanized,salvadoran male deportees with criminal histories who oppose gangs.neither the relevant statute nor its associated regulations specifically define the term particular social group.we therefore defer to the bia reasonable interpretation of the term.hui zheng holder,cir explaining that under chevron,nrdc,d,we afford the bia the deference that must be given to agency interpretations of their own governing statutes.the bia defines a particular social group as meeting three criteria its members share common,immutable characteristics,the common characteristics give its members social visibility,and the group is defined with sufficient particularity to delimit its membership.matter of,in re,matter of acosta,overruled on other grounds by matter of mogharrabi,
the social group as defined by lizama clearly fails to meet the required criteria.for example,as lizama own expert admitted,americanization is not an immutable characteristic.while lizama claims that his americanized dress and speech distinguish him,such acquired traits are not beyond the power of the petitioner to change,nor so fundamental to his conscience that it ought not be required to be changed.matter of acosta,at finding that the proposed social group of taxi drivers who refused to participate in work stoppages did not share an immutable characteristic,because the drivers could avoid guerrilla threats either by changing jobs or by cooperating in the work stoppages.
moreover,wealth,americanization,and opposition to gangs are all amorphous characteristics that neither provide an adequate benchmark for determining group membership,matter of,at,nor embody concrete traits that would readily identify a person as possessing those characteristics.see,matter of,holding that salvadoran youths who have resisted gang recruitment failed to meet the particularity and social visibility requirements matter of,at holding that the group wealthy guatemalans failed to meet the particularity and social visib
