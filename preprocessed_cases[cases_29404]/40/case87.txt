we revisit in this case whether federal law forbids puerto rico from removing individuals from its active voter registry for the office of resident commissioner the only federal elective position in puerto solely on their failure to vote in one general election.in,in an interlocutory appeal brought just weeks before election day,the panel majority held that the national voter registration act nvra does not apply to puerto rico and thus does not supersede the commonwealth voter deactivation procedures.see colónmarrero conty pérez,cir per curiam.the majority also concluded,however,that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that another federal statute the help america vote act hava does bar puerto rico from removing voters from the registry for the office of resident commissioner unless they fail to participate in the preceding two general federal elections.id.at.we nonetheless refused to order plaintiffs immediate reinstatement to the voter registry,deeming such preliminary injunctive relief improvident given the uncertain feasibility of properly reinstating voters in the short time remaining before the election.id.at.
on remand for consideration of the merits of plaintiffs claims after the election,the district court agreed with our preliminary assessment that hava invalidates article of puerto rico act of insofar as it applies to voter eligibility for federal elections.it thus issued injunctive and declaratory relief barring the puerto rico state elections commission sec from removing otherwise eligible voters from the active election registry unless hava requirements are met.defendant liza garcía vélez,as sec president,now challenges that ruling in a,plaintiffs ask us to reconsider our conclusion that nvra does not apply to puerto rico,and they further argue that excluding the commonwealth from nvra coverage would violate the equal protection clause of the constitution.
having considered each of these claims,we reiterate our conclusion that nvra does not apply to puerto rico.in addition,we reject plaintiffs constitutional challenge to that statute coverage.we also adhere to our preliminary view that hava,which comprehensively addresses federal election administration,invalidates article deactivation procedure.we further hold that plaintiffs may bring a private cause of action seeking relief under hava pursuant to.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual background 
a.the litigation 
plaintiffs myrna colón marrero and josefina romaguera agrait filed this action in september claiming they were unlawfully removed from the commonwealth active voter registry,pursuant to article for having exercised their right not to vote in the election for resident commissioner.am.compl.they asserted violations of nvra,hava,and the constitution,and sought declaratory and injunctive relief that included invalidation of article and immediate reinstatement of themselves and all similarly situated persons as eligible voters in the upcoming election for federal office.id.under both nvra and hava,registered voters retain eligibility to vote in a federal election unless they have failed to respond to a notice seeking to confirm eligible residency and have not voted in two consecutive general elections for federal office.see b nvra id.a a hava plaintiffs also asked for an order directing the defendants to abide by all the voter registration and other applicable mandates of the nvra,hava and the first,due process and equal protection amendments to the constitution.am.compl.
the district court denied plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction,and colón marrero but not romaguera agrait appealed.after holding a special oral argument session on october,a panel of this court concluded that colón marrero had shown a likelihood of success on the merits of her claim for reinstatement.see colón marrero,at.we determined,however,that serious factual questions remained as to the balance of harms and the public interest in ordering the immediate reinstatement of the more than voters who had been stricken from the registration roll.id.accordingly,we remanded the case to the district court for on the feasibility of reactivating the affected voters in time for the november election.see id.
based on testimony presented at a hearing on october and,the district court found it would be feasible to reactivate the i voters if this court ordered such relief by october and devised a recusal procedure that would allow the commonwealth to exclude voters who had become ineligible for reasons other than article such as moving out of the precinct or the commonwealth.id.at.the district court certified its findings to this court on october.in a brief order the next day,the appellate panel,with one dissenting member,affirmed the denial of preliminary relief because the district court findings did not alleviate the majority feasibility concerns.
opinions explaining the october ruling were issued on november.among other factors,the majority noted that puerto rico law does not include a mechanism for challenges to voter eligibility,which the district court had identified as necessary,and the majority observed that,e ven if it were appropriate for a federal court to prescribe alternative recusal procedures,we would be ill equipped to do so in the short time remaining before the election.id.at.the majority also pointed out that,although plaintiff originally sought to vote only for the federal position of resident than seeking to vote generally in the she had elicited scant evidence at the evidentiary hearing on the practicality of a limited reinstatement.id.at.as a result,the district court had made no finding on that issue a major concern for the majority because the candidates for both resident commissioner and governor appear on the same ballot.id.at.moreover,the panel expressed concern about the plaintiffs decision to bring this action less than two months before a general election that had long been scheduled for november.id.at.
having determined that,in these circumstances,it would be improvident to grant plaintiff requested relief with only eighteen days remaining before the general election,the panel refused to grant a preliminary injunction and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings 
proceedings on remand 
in june,on remand,the parties agreed to submit the case to the district court for decision on the merits based on a joint stipulation of facts and memoranda of law.on march,the district court ordered the parties to file the stipulation by april and simultaneous memoranda by may,with replies due by june.the court described the case at that point as follows 
although the nature of the controversies has been well defined during the preliminary injunction relief stage,primarily during the remand hearing and in the first circuit opinion issued in colón marrero conty pérez,cir,the parties are advised that the scope of relief whether the remedy is limited to the election of the resident commissioner in puerto rico or extends to the general election process is an open question that shall be addressed in the parties briefs.
in compliance with the order,the parties filed a limited stipulation of facts stating only that the two plaintiffs voted in the general election,did not vote in the general election,did not follow the reactivation requirement of article to eligibility to vote in,and did not vote in the general election.in their memoranda,the last of which was filed on june,the parties presented arguments on plaintiffs hava and constitutional all parties agreeing that our ruling governed on the applicability of nvra.
the district court found in favor of plaintiffs on january,and entered final judgment granting declaratory and injunctive relief on june,in its decision,the court cited the undisputed fact that hava by its terms applies in puerto rico,see,and it concluded that the hava provision setting out the prerequisite for deactivating voters is not limited to jurisdictions covered by nvra.the court explained that the pertinent provision in hava does not merely incorporate the equivalent nvra provision,but explicitly set s forth the requirement that a voter miss two consecutive general elections before being deactivated.
the court thus held that the deactivation standard of article must give way to hava requirement.it further concluded that,because puerto rico has a single voter registration system,not two,hava necessarily regulates the registration lists for the general elections in puerto rico,which always include the election for the resident commissioner as an integral part of the general election process.the court permanently enjoined the sec from removing from the official list of eligible voters any registrant who did not vote in a single general election and declared that the sec is affirmatively ordered that no lawfully registered voter may be removed from the official list of eligible voters unless they have not voted in the two immediately preceding elections and have received and have been given notice of an intent to remove them from such list.
these appeals followed.defendant garcía vélez challenges the grant of declaratory and injunctive relief for plaintiffs based on hava.in their,plaintiffs argue that this court should reconsider its ruling that nvra does not apply to puerto rico,emphasizing that said determination was solely a preliminary injunction review as to probable outcomes.alternatively,plaintiffs seek a ruling that excluding puerto rico from nvra violates the equal protection clause of the united states constitution 
ii.the cross appeal applicability of nvra 
statutory construction 
we decline to revisit our prior decision that nvra does not apply to puerto rico.although plaintiffs are correct that we reached that decision in the context of a request for preliminary relief,our examination of the statute was neither tentative nor incomplete.we concluded that t he textual signals and the legislative history,taken together,constitute persuasive evidence that congress did not intend to include puerto rico as a state under the nvra.colón marrero,at indeed,the district court and parties have treated our analysis as decisive,and plaintiffs essentially admit in their brief that they reiterate their nvra statutory construction argument out of an abundance of caution.to eliminate any ambiguity,we now explicitly reaffirm our earlier determination that nvra does not apply to puerto rico for the reasons outlined in our november opinion.see colón marrero,at.
b.the constitutionality of nvra 
we also find unavailing plaintiffs theory that they are entitled to the protections provided by nvra because excluding puerto rico from the statute coverage violates the equal protection clause.plaintiffs assert that,absent nvra protections,citizens residing in puerto rico have a version of the right to vote that is unconstitutionally inferior to the right afforded citizens residing in the fifty states and the district of columbia.
plaintiffs first suggest that congress decision not to apply nvra to puerto rico must be examined under strict scrutiny.they rely on the fact that a legislative classification is subject to strict scrutiny if it impermissibly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right.bd.of ret.murgia,and that the right to vote is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure.state bd.of elections socialist workers party.but a necessary prerequisite to strict scrutiny is a showing that a fundamental right has been burdened,see romer evans,and the plaintiffs have failed at the threshold to demonstrate how nvra exclusion of puerto rico burdens their right to vote.the mere fact that a statute concerns voting does not establish that the statute infringes on a fundamental right.see igartua de la rosa united states,cir per curiam.absent a showing that nvra substantially burdens the rights of puerto rico residents to vote in federal elections and no such showing has even been attempted here strict scrutiny does not apply.
in the absence of strict scrutiny,plaintiffs equal protection challenge prompts rational basis review.see romer,at.plaintiffs claim founders on this standard.to be sure,nvra prescribes more restrictive deactivation prerequisites than does article and,in that respect,arguably offers greater protection to the federal voting rights of mainland citizens.yet,significant factual differences exist between federal elections in puerto rico and in the jurisdictions covered by nvra.unlike in the states and the district of columbia,general federal elections in puerto rico occur on a,rather than,cycle.see setting a term for the resident commissioner.article thus allows election officials to remove individuals from active voting rolls after the same period prescribed by nvra albeit after one election rather than two.
in addition,the only federal election in puerto rico is for the office of resident commissioner,a position in congress.unlike the district of columbia,puerto rico does not choose presidential electors.see const.art.ii,cl id.amend.xxiii.plaintiffs do not explain why congress could not rely on those distinctions to refrain from extending nvra obligations to the federal election process in the commonwealth 
we thus conclude that plaintiffs have not articulated a viable constitutional challenge to nvra based on the exclusion of puerto rico from its scope.
iii.the appeal hava and a private right of action 
at the heart of this appeal is the district court grant of declaratory and injunctive relief for plaintiffs based on its determination that hava deactivation threshold supersedes the trigger of article appellant garcía vélez,as sec president,challenges those remedies on two separate grounds.she first argues that the pertinent provision of hava like the equivalent section of nvra does not apply to puerto rico elections.second,she insists that,even if puerto rico is within the provision scope,there is no private right of action to seek a remedy.
we consider each of these issues of law in turn.our review is de novo.see motors darling,cir.
does hava section a supersede article deactivation procedure 
the november presidential election and its attendant controversies prompted congress to review and reform the administration of federal elections.state conf.of the naacp browning,cir see also h,pt,at,wl,at the circumstances surrounding the election that took place in november brought an increased focus on the process of election administration,and highlighted the need for improvements.samuel issacharoff,pamela karlan richard pildes,the law of democracy ed.hava was the product of that review,and the statute,inter alia,revisited the subject of voter registration that also had been the primary focus of nvra.see b stating that the purposes of nvra include establish ing procedures that will increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for federal office and ensur ing that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained outlining hava requirements for election technology and administration unlike nvra,however,hava by its express terms applies to puerto rico and the united states territories,in addition to the states and the district of columbia.id.
the specific hava provision at issue in this case,section a,is titled computerized statewide voter registration list requirements.a.with an exception not relevant here,the section directs that each state shall implement,in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner,a single,uniform,official,centralized,interactive computerized statewide voter registration list that contains the name and registration information of every legally registered voter in the state.id.a a.appellant focuses on hava section a,which is titled minimum standard for accuracy of state voter registration records and provides 
the state election system shall include provisions to ensure that voter registration records in the state are accurate and are updated regularly,including the following 
a a system of file maintenance that makes a reasonable effort to remove registrants who are ineligible to vote from the official list of eligible voters.under such system,consistent with the national voter registration act of et,registrants who have not responded to a notice and who have not voted in consecutive general elections for federal office shall be removed from the official list of eligible voters,except that no registrant may be removed solely by reason of a failure to vote.
b safeguards to ensure that eligible voters are not removed in error from the official list of eligible voters.
a emphasis added.
based on the highlighted language above,appellant argues that this subsection of hava applies only to those jurisdictions governed by nvra.her contention is that the hava requirement would not be consistent with nvra if it is applied beyond the scope of that statute given that congress excluded puerto rico from essentially the same deactivation requirement under,by limiting nvra coverage to the states and the district of columbia the district court concluded otherwise,pointing out that hava does not simply invoke nvra,leaving it to the reader to refer to that law to determine its contents,but instead explicitly sets forth the requirement for deactivation of voters.
our starting point in discerning the meaning of a statute is the provision itself,and t he plain meaning of a statute text must be given effect unless it would produce an absurd result or one manifestly at odds with the statute intended effect.arnold united parcel,cir quoting parisi ex rel.cooney chater,cir see also matamoros starbucks,cir we assume that the ordinary meaning of the statutory language expresses the legislature intent,and we resort to extrinsic aids to statutory construction such as legislative history only when the wording of the statute is freighted with ambiguity or leads to an unreasonable result.of course,we focus on the plain meaning of the whole statute,not of isolated sentences.arnold,at quoting beecham united states.
the statute text 
the plain meaning of section a a is apparent from both its structure and its wording.most significantly,the provision mandate is stated independently of the consistent with phrase that is the foundation of appellant argument.the first sentence of the subsection explains that a system of file maintenance must be created to remove registrants who are ineligible to vote from the official list of eligible voters,and the second sentence explains how such system must operate.a a.these required actions are not defined by reference to obligations arising from nvra.
rather,in clear,affirmative language,the second sentence directs removal of registrants from the official list of eligible voters if they have not responded to a notice and did not vote in consecutive general elections for federal office.id.the provision then emphasizes the need for both notice and a voting gap by stating that removal is barred solely by reason of a failure to vote.id.the reference to nvra,by contrast,appears in a subordinate clause in that sentence.its content and placement clearly signal a collateral purpose to instruct responsible election officials and others including the courts that the measures required by hava do not alter nvra requirements and,hence,they should be implemented consistently with nvra.
appellant insists that examining section a a in context undermines this textual analysis.she argues that,despite the explicit inclusion of puerto rico and the territories within hava overall scope,congress expressly exempted these jurisdictions from obligations that also appear in nvra.we disagree.
the statutory context 
as a prelude to our discussion of appellant contextual argument,we pause briefly to note the detailed landscape of hava section.section governs two different categories of prescriptions,as reflected in its overall heading computerized statewide voter registration list requirements and requirements for voters who register by mail.subsection a addresses the statewide registration list,and subsection b addresses registration by mail.each of those subsections is divided into five paragraphs,most of which are further subdivided into a number of subparagraphs.a contextual review thus requires close examination of multiple provisions.to aid the reader understanding of our analysis,and as a supplement to the specific provisions within section that are reproduced as part of our discussion,we provide the full text of section a and b in an appendix to this opinion.
appellant claims that the inapplicability of hava deactivation requirements to puerto rico is announced in section b,which provides that n othing in this subsection shall be construed to require a state that was not required to comply with a provision of the national voter registration act of before october,to comply with such a provision after october.b citation omitted.appellant effort to prove her point through context,however,relies on taking this particular provision out of context.as described above,subsection a of hava section addresses the computerized statewide voter registration list requirements,while subsection b details requirements for voters who register by mail.
the language appellant invokes nothing in this subsection is the fifth,and final,paragraph of subsection b,the subsection that addresses registration by mail given its placement,section b can only reasonably be construed to refer to the requirements related to voting by mail.moreover,paragraph by its terms merely states that hava is not changing the scope of nvra,a state excluded from nvra requirements remains excluded from obligations imposed by nvra.it says nothing about the state additional obligations under hava.
however,two provisions within subsection a also invoke nvra although neither proves helpful to appellant.both provisions appear within the subsection second paragraph,which is labeled computerized list maintenance,and,specifically,under subheading a of that paragraph,labeled in general.the introductory portion of section a a directs state and local election officials to perform list maintenance with respect to the computerized list on a regular basis,a a,and it then specifies how to do so in terms that refer to nvra.
one of those instructions states that,i f an individual is to be removed from the computerized list,such individual shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of the national voter registration act of.see id.a a i.this instruction then lists several subsections of nvra that prescribe removal procedures.id.among those provisions is one titled removal of names from voting rolls,id.d,which contains the notice and prerequisites for removal,linked to a change of residence.see id.d b see supra.other provisions listed contain nvra requirements for the content of the notice that must be sent to registrants,id.d a general program to remove the names of ineligible voters based on death or change in residence,id.a and procedures to allow a registrant who has moved within a district,without officially changing his address,to vote in his old or new polling place,id.e.
this reliance on nvra does not,however,describe a limitation of hava coverage.rather,by invoking these nvra provisions,and directing that removal of voters under hava be done in accordance with nvra,congress is simply borrowing the earlier statute procedures for effectuating the independent hava requirement to maintain an accurate list of eligible voters.it is telling that,while congress piggybacks in section a a i on nvra methodology,it affirmatively sets out the deactivation prerequisites in a separate provision section a a reproduced above and labels those requirements as elements of the m inimum standard for accuracy.
to similar effect is the other subparagraph within section a a addressing the list maintenance requirements in relation to nvra.section a a iii provides that,if a state is described in section b of the national voter registration act of,that state shall remove the names of ineligible voters from the computerized list in accordance with state law.a a iii citation omitted.states described in section b of nvra are those that either have no registration requirements for voting in federal elections or allow all voters in the state to register to vote at the polling place at the time of voting in a general election for federal office.id.b.puerto rico would not be such a state even if it were included within nvra definition of state.indeed,this litigation would be unnecessary if that description applied to puerto rico.
put simply,hava to nvra in section a a is sensibly understood only as an assurance that the obligations and procedures required by that hava subsection,a system of file maintenance that makes a reasonable effort to remove registrants who are ineligible to vote from the official list of eligible voters,but protects eligible voters align with those previously mandated by nvra by contrast,hava does not draw upon nvra for the fundamentally different matter of which jurisdictions it covers.each statute has its own definition of a covered state.under nvra,the term state means a state of the united states and the district of columbia.under hava,the term state includes the district of columbia,the commonwealth of puerto rico,guam,american samoa,and the united states virgin islands.id.
nothing in the two sentences of section a a or in the other provisions within subsection a discussed above suggests that,despite this explicit difference between the statutes coverage,this hava provision applies only to jurisdictions subject to nvra.indeed,it is inconceivable that congress would have made hava applicable to these jurisdictions,but exempted them from this aspect of hava without saying so clearly.the fact that the removal requirements in the two statutes overlap does not signify their irrelevance to puerto rico,but rather underscores their perceived importance as part of any effort to improve the administration of elections.
nor is it illogical to hold that hava requires puerto rico election officials to adopt voter registration procedures for the office of resident commissioner that we have concluded nvra does not require of them.different considerations,and experience over time,may have affected political judgments about the need for uniform national requirements in puerto rico even though citizens residing there elect only one federal official.indeed,as described above,the november election brought an increased focus on the process of election administration,and highlighted the need for improvements,pt,at,wl,at.in addition,the house report on hava observed that the legislation for the first time provides financial assistance from the federal government to state and local governments to improve their election infrastructure,making funds available to those jurisdictions that want to modernize their systems.id.at,wl,at.there is nothing absurd or unreasonable in a legislative judgment that such assistance should be available to all united states jurisdictions,along with the corresponding obligation to comply with national standards for maintaining accurate voter registration records.
we thus agree with the district court and the prior panel that a sensible reading of hava section a compels the conclusion that congress intended the obligations it sets forth to apply to all jurisdictions within hava definition of state.colón marrero,at colón marrero,wl,at june,quoting panel opinion.accordingly,we hold that,under the plain language of hava section a a,puerto rico may not deactivate voters unless they have not responded to a notice and did not vote in two consecutive general elections for federal office.see a a.
may plaintiffs seek a remedy under hava 
appellant argues that,even if puerto rico election officials must comply with hava requirements,plaintiffs claims must be dismissed because individuals have no private right of action to seek a remedy under the statute.although the parties debated this contention in their memoranda to the district court,the court did not directly address the issue.its ruling,however,reflects an implicit conclusion that plaintiffs have properly sought relief under hava.to evaluate the correctness of that determination,we must closely examine the statute against the backdrop of the applicable precedent.
hava enforcement provisions 
hava by its terms does not create a private right of action.the statute,however,does expressly provide two mechanisms for remedying grievances a civil action brought by the attorney general,and in states receiving funds under hava,e stablishment of administrative complaint procedures,id.a states that do not receive hava funds must either certify that they have a comparable administrative scheme or submit a detailed compliance plan showing the steps the state will take to ensure that it meets the statute requirements.id.b b.the code sections containing these two procedures constitute a separate subchapter of hava titled enforcement.see id.
governing law 
even when a federal statute does not explicitly provide for a private remedy,two different paths may be available to individuals seeking to enforce their rights under the provision.the statute may either include an implied right of action under the provision itself or be enforceable through a cause of action brought under.see generally city of rancho palos verdes abrams,gonzaga doe,the inquiries to determine whether such paths exist are similar and begin with the same question did congress intend to create a federal right see gonzaga,at.one difference between the two approaches is that an individual seeking to sue under an implied right of action must show that the statute manifests an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.id.at quoting alexander sandoval.by contrast,an individual pursuing relief under do es not have the burden of showing an intent to create a private remedy because generally supplies a remedy for the vindication of rights secured by federal statutes.id.
plaintiffs in this case assert a remedy only under,and we therefore examine that pathway to relief.if a plaintiff satisfies the threshold inquiry and demonstrates that congress intended to confer an individual right,the right is presumptively enforceable by.id.to rebut the presumption,the defendant must show that congress shut the door to private enforcement either expressly in the statute creating the right,or impliedly,by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under,id.at quoting blessing freestone.
does hava section a create an individual right 
taken as a whole,hava is aimed at election administration improvement the title of the united states code chapter in which it is codified and many of its provisions are therefore framed as requirements for the state officials who are in charge of the election process.subchapter i,for example,provides for payments to states to facilitate improvements in their election procedures and,among other things,it directs states to use such funds to carry out tasks such as educating voters,training poll workers,or establishing voter fraud hotlines.see.subchapter ii establishes an independent election assistance commission,id,to serve as a national clearinghouse and resource for the compilation of information and review of procedures with respect to the administration of federal elections,id,and subchapter v establishes the help america vote college program,id.subchapter iii the one directly pertinent to this case is titled uniform and nondiscriminatory election technology and administration requirements.see id.its provisions include hava section,which itself is titled computerized statewide voter registration list requirements and requirements for voters who register by mail.id.subchapter iii also imposes requirements for voting systems generally public posting of information on election days,and provisional voting.id.
the fact that many of hava provisions indeed,probably most of them are crafted in regulatory terms rather than in terms of voters rights does not bar a conclusion that a particular provision confers an individual right.the supreme court has made clear that generalized language in some sections of a statute is not a barrier to a private right of action under another section of the same statute.for example,in blessing,the supreme court examined provisions of title iv d of the social security act that the plaintiffs had relied upon,concluding that they did not give rise to individualized rights because they were designed to guide the state in structuring its systemwide efforts at enforcing support obligations.at.the court noted,however,that some provisions of title iv d might confer enforceable individual rights,and it returned the case to the district court to determine exactly what rights,considered in their most concrete,specific form,respondents are asserting.id.at see also sandoval,at contrasting of title vi of the civil rights act of,which creates individual rights,and,which does not.
hence,the question before us is whether the specific provision on which plaintiffs rely hava section a a creates a private right.the supreme court has identified three factors to guide the inquiry into whether congress has unambiguously conferred a right to support a cause of action brought under.gonzaga,at.
first,congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.second,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.third,the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states.in other words,the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.
blessing,at quoting wright roanoke redev.hous,citations omitted.
establishing the first factor the intent to benefit the plaintiff requires more than a showing that the plaintiff is an intended beneficiary of the statute or within the general zone of interest that the statute is intended to protect.gonzaga,at.rather,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the federal statute creates an individually enforceable right in the class of beneficiaries to which he belongs.rancho palos verdes,at see also gonzaga,at since the adoption assistance and child welfare act of conferred no specific,individually enforceable rights,there was no basis for private enforcement,even by a class of the statute principal beneficiaries.citing suter artist,california sierra club,the question is not simply who would benefit from the act,but whether congress intended to confer federal rights upon those beneficiaries.
the targeted portion of hava section a fits comfortably among those statutory provisions found to create individually enforceable rights because of their unmistakable focus on the benefited class.gonzaga,at quoting cannon of.although section a primary focus is the obligation of states to adopt measures to ensure accurate registration records,and section a a furthers that objective by directing state officials to implement certain safeguards for voter roll maintenance,the fact that a statutory command is directed at state officials as part of a broader plan for implementation does not preclude it from likewise creating privately enforceable rights.language that directs state officials in the implementation of statutory objectives may still create an enforceable right where it mentions a specific,discrete beneficiary group within the statutory text and speaks in individualistic terms,rather than at the aggregate level of institutional policy or practice.rio grande cmty.health ctr.rullan,cir accord bryson shumway,cir.
the relevant text of section a a satisfies these requirements.it specifies a discrete class of beneficiaries registrants and describes specific procedures for removing individual registrants from the state active voter rolls,including the requirement of notice and failure to vote in consecutive elections.a a.moreover,the command of the provision final clause,that no registrant may be removed solely by reason of a failure to vote,resembles the language in titles vi and ix of the civil rights act of that the supreme court has highlighted as indicative of congress intent to create an individual right no person shall be subjected to discrimination.gonzaga,at quoting a.on its face,section a a confers a right on every registrant not to be removed from a state active registry for failure to participate in one general election.
the role of this language is reinforced by the contrast drawn by the supreme court in gonzaga university between the language quoted above from titles vi and ix and the language of the family educational rights and privacy act of ferpa under review in that case.the court pointed out that the ferpa provisions speak only to the secretary of education,directing that n o funds shall be made available to any educational agency or institution which has a prohibited policy or practice.at quoting b.the court observed that t his focus is two steps removed from the interests of individual students and parents and clearly does not confer the sort of individual entitlement that is enforceable under.id.quoting blessing,at.the court thus concluded that the ferpa provisions under scrutiny do not confer enforceable rights.id.
similarly illustrative is the court decision in blessing.there,the court observed that a provision requiring child support programs to operate in substantial compliance with title iv d of the social security act f ar from creat es an individual entitlement to services,and instead provides a standard that is simply a yardstick for the secretary to measure systemwide performance.at.the court in sandoval likewise found the necessary language absent from of title vi of the civil rights act of.at quoting cannon,at.the court explained 
whereas decrees that n o person shall be subjected to discrimination,the text of provides that e ach federal department and agency is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of.far from displaying congressional intent to create new rights,limits agencies to effectuat ing rights already created by.
id.at.the court then utilized the two steps removed imagery to which it returned the next year as quoted above in gonzaga university,at 
and the focus of is twice removed from the individuals who will ultimately benefit from title vi protection.statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.section is yet a step further removed it focuses neither on the individuals protected nor even on the funding recipients being regulated,but on the agencies that will do the regulating.
sandoval,at citation omitted quoting sierra club,at.
by contrast,no gap exists between the operative text of hava section a a and the persons whose interests are at stake.the statutory proscription no registrant may be removed directly and explicitly protects individual voters.that language explains why appellant incorrectly invokes the supreme court decision in brunner ohio republican party,per curiam,in support of her view that plaintiffs may not bring a private action under section a a.in brunner,the court vacated a temporary restraining order directing ohio secretary of state to update the state voter registration database,having concluded that the plaintiffs were not sufficiently likely to prove that hava section gave them a private right of action.at.the subsection of section at issue in brunner,however,directs action by the state chief election official and it lacks any language showing an intent to create individually enforceable rights.thus,brunner does not govern the question here sandusky cty.democratic party blackwell,cir per curiam holding that the language of hava a,u.a stating that individuals shall be permitted to cast a provisional ballot is unambiguous.
moreover,it is noteworthy that hava,including section a,was enacted pursuant to congress authority under the elections clause of the constitution.see,pt,at,wl,at const.art.i,cl.the supreme court has observed that statutes enacted under congress spending power rarely give rise to enforceable individual rights,as the typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions in spending legislation is not a private cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the federal government to terminate funds to the state.gonzaga,at quoting pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman.the court further commented that its more recent decisions have rejected attempts to infer enforceable rights from spending clause statutes,absent language that unambiguously confers such rights on the statute beneficiaries.id.at.here,the provision at issue is both authorized by constitutional authority more specific than the spending power and contains language unambiguously conferring individual rights.
the other two factors of the inquiry described in blessing are easily satisfied by section a.enforcing the right to retention on a state active voter registry would impose no strain on judicial competence,as the right is concrete and.blessing,at.the specificity of the provision directives shields against potentially disparate outcomes,bolstering the conclusion that the language is.see rullan,at.the statute requirements are also couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms,and unambiguously impose a binding obligation.accord sandusky,at t here can be no doubt that hava as a whole is couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.
we therefore conclude that plaintiffs are entitled to a presumption that.appellant makes no meaningful attempt to rebut this presumption,and we could thus end our analysis here.recognizing the importance of this issue,however,we explain why the rationales the supreme court has found adequate to defeat such a presumption do not apply here.
did congress manifest an intent to foreclose a remedy under 
congressional intent to shut the door to private enforcement of a federal statute may be shown by means of language in the act itself specifically foreclosing a remedy under or by implication from congress creation of a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under.gonzaga,at quoting blessing,at.we have found no express language in hava rejecting a private remedy under for violation of the individual right that we have determined is created by section a a.we thus must consider whether an individual remedy under is compatible with the enforcement mechanisms that hava does provide for the deprivation of the federally secured right it creates.wright,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court has cautioned against lightly conclud ing that congress intended to preclude reliance on,id.at quoting smith robinson,and the availability of a private remedy through an administrative mechanism is not necessarily enough to show such intent,see,golden state transit city of los angeles.rather,to confine individuals to a statutory remedy,the legislation must reveal congress purpose to exclude independent relief in federal court pursuant to.see,wilder.hosp.ass n,finding no indication that congress specifically intended that the statute administrative procedure replace private remedies available under.
the rarity of that deliberate exclusion was noted in rancho palos verdes,see at,where the supreme court observed that it previously had rejected as an available remedy for violations of federal statutory rights in only two cases middlesex county sewerage authority national sea clammers association,and smith,at.in sea clammers,the environmental statutes at issue contained unusually elaborate enforcement provisions,allowing any interested person to challenge actions of the administrator of the environmental protection agency in federal appeals courts,at,and,in addition,authoriz ing private persons to sue for injunctions to enforce these statutes,id.at.similarly,in smith,the court found that the carefully tailored administrative and judicial mechanism,at,in the education of the handicapped act manifested congress intent that each child individual educational needs be worked out through a process that begins on the local level and includes ongoing parental involvement,detailed procedural safeguards,and a right to judicial review,id.at.hence,the court concluded that congress meant to foreclose the ability of a handicapped child to go directly to court with an equal protection claim.id.
in rancho palos verdes,the court added a third exemplar to the short list of statutes found to preclude relief under for violation of a federal right.see at.the statute at issue,a provision of the telecommunications act of tca,c,contains a remedial system that includes judicial review,but limits relief in ways that does not.id.at.the statutory period for filing a claim is shorter,the district court must hear the claim on an expedited basis,and the available remedies do not include attorney fees and costs.id.at.the court concluded that enforcement of c through would distort th is scheme of expedited judicial review and limited remedies.id.at.the court thus held that the tca by providing a judicial remedy different from in c itself precluded resort to.id 
in its discussion,the court in rancho palos verdes observed that,for statutory violations,the dividing line between those cases in which we have held that an action would lie under and those in which we have not has been the existence of a more restrictive private remedy in the statute itself.id.at.importantly,however,it is not a remedy of any type that has supported an inference that congress intended to foreclose private enforcement through.a plaintiff ability to invoke can not be defeated simply by t he availability of administrative mechanisms to protect the plaintiff interests.blessing,at quoting golden state,at.the supreme court has emphasized that,in all of its cases holding that is available,the statutes did not provide a private judicial remedy for the violation of federal rights.see rancho palos verdes,at citing cases.
hava enforcement provisions,described above in section,fall clearly on the side of the dividing line.there is no private judicial remedy provided in the statute.the attorney general may bring a civil action in federal court,but the only remedial option for individuals is to file complaints with the state,id.a b.pursuant to the required administrative procedures,a finding by the state that no violation occurred results in dismissal of the complaint.id.a g.far from indicating congressional intent to foreclose a private remedy under,these limited enforcement options reflect an intention to leave that door wide open.see,e,wright,at in both sea clammers and smith robinson,the statutes at issue themselves provided for private judicial remedies,thereby evidencing congressional intent to supplant the remedy.there is nothing of that kind found in the housing act.accord sandusky,at bay cty.democratic party lund,d,gonzaga,at noting that the detailed federal enforcement procedures in ferpa squarely distinguish this case from those where an aggrieved individual lacked any federal review mechanism.
we thus find no congressional intention to preclude federal judicial review of violations of section a a that are asserted through the vehicle of a private lawsuit brought under.
iv.conclusion 
we hold that hava section a a invalidates the voter deactivation procedure of article of puerto rico law and,hence,individuals may not be removed from the commonwealth active voter registry for federal elections unless they have failed to respond to a notice and did not vote in the preceding two consecutive general federal elections.because hava affords plaintiffs an individually enforceable right to remain on the active voter registry absent those failures to act,and appellant has not shown that congress intended to foreclose a remedy under,plaintiffs properly sought relief for their improper removal in this federal action.
accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of declaratory and injunctive relief barring the sec from removing voters from the official list of eligible voters for federal elections unless hava requirements have been met.we recognize that questions may arise concerning the administrative steps necessary to bring the sec procedures into compliance with hava.the district court should therefore retain jurisdiction over this case for the time necessary to resolve any conflicts that arise between the parties during the transition.
so ordered.costs are awarded to plaintiffs.

over time,new defendants have been substituted for their predecessors upon their appointment as president of the sec or electoral commissioner.garcía vélez,for example,succeeded ángel gonzález román,who previously had succeeded héctor conty pérez as sec president and,as a result of that role,as a defendant in this case.in addition,certain defendants representing particular political parties,who originally opposed plaintiffs request for relief,are either not part of this appeal or have adopted the plaintiffs position and join them as appellees.currently,garcía vélez is the sole.
in pertinent part,article,laws ann.tit,provides if a voter fails to exercise right to vote in a general election,file in the general voter registry shall be inactivated.the commission may exclude voters from the general voter registry on the grounds provided by this subtitle or established through regulations.the exclusion of a voter shall not entail the elimination of information from the general voter registry.
the only federal office for which puerto rico residents are eligible to vote is resident position that exists only in puerto rico.see.
plaintiffs estimated in their complaint that approximately otherwise qualified voters were deactivated for the election simply because they did not vote in the general elections.am.compl.more than of those voters used the designated reactivation procedure to qualify to vote in.see colón marrero,at,laws ann.tit.the deactivated voters are known as i voters.
statutory provisions relating to voting and elections,including nvra and hava,recently were transferred from titles and into new title,which is labeled voting and elections.see disposition table.other than in quoting sources that use the old code references,we refer to the new title section numbers.
colón marrero raised the broader question of a right to vote on local candidates and issues to the appeals court for the first time in her supplemental briefing after the district court.at.
the dissent argued,inter alia,that puerto rico is covered by both nvra and hava,and that the requested preliminary injunction should have been granted.
in its june order,the court granted final judgment on plaintiffs claim under hava and explained that,given the relief ordered pursuant to that claim,it was unnecessary to reach plaintiffs nvra and constitutional claims.that same day,the court also reissued the decision that it had issued in january under the title declaratory judgment with a new title memorandum opinion declaring rights and granting equitable relief.
because plaintiffs sought an order requiring the defendants to abide by all of nvra requirements including expanded methods of voter registration invalidation of article deactivation procedure based on hava does not render their other claims moot.
nvra defines state as a state of the united states and the district of columbia.
we note,however,that congress via hava later imposed the same prerequisites for removing puerto rico residents from the registry of eligible voters for federal elections.see infra section.
in its memorandum opinion,the district court noted that puerto rico has a combined voter registration system for federal and commonwealth elections and,hence,it concluded that the provision set forth in hava necessarily regulates the registration lists for the general elections in puerto rico,which always include the election for the resident commissioner as an integral part of the general election process.we,however,offer no view as to whether the sec is able to comply with hava without also changing its requirements for eligibility to vote for commonwealth offices.see colón marrero,at i t is an open and difficult question one not addressed by plaintiff whether hava would provide a basis for a federal court ordering the reinstatement of voters in commonwealth elections.
although the two statutes share a purpose to protect the integrity of the electoral process,b see also,pt,at,wl,at stating that hava purpose is to improve our country election system,nvra primary emphasis is on simplifying the methods for registering to vote in federal elections,see young fordice,while hava voter registration provisions are focused on achieving greater accuracy by improving technology and administration,see.nvra,for example,requires each state to permit prospective voters to register to vote in elections for federal office by any of three methods simultaneously with a driver license application,in person,or by mail.arizona inter tribal council of,quoting u.a.hava requirements include creation of a c omputerized statewide voter registration list to ensure that voter registration records in th
