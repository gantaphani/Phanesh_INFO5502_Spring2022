on appeal,we consider the district court denial of csxt request for a set off against the fela award based on its contributions to the tier ii fund used to pay a portion of sloas rra disability benefits,and sloas request for judgment as a matter of law in his favor on the issue of contributory negligence.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
we begin with a summary of the evidence presented at trial,the jury apportionment of fault,and the district court disposition of the parties motions.
on january,csxt employees were attempting to service and redeploy a locomotive that had been sideswiped.sloas was tasked with removing and replacing the locomotive damaged snyder valve,an aluminum valve that threads into the neck of a locomotive fuel tank in order to secure the fuel cap.damage to the snyder valve precluded sloas from using the preferred tool for this procedure,a spanner wrench.
sloas testified that he first attempted to break the valve loose using a inch pipe wrench.when this effort failed,sloas further testified that he went to the tool room to retrieve a sawzall or reciprocating saw and a inch pipe wrench.according to sloas,no sharp blades were available for the sawzall and his attempt to use that saw to cut the snyder valve merely scratched the valve surface.csxt cast doubt on sloas testimony,however,by presenting evidence that sloas did not consistently mention the lack of sharp sawzall blades to his supervisors,as well as by eliciting testimony from an assisting coworker who did not recall the presence of a sawzall.
sloas subsequently used a torch to heat the collar of the locomotive fuel tank in the hope that the collar would expand and the valve would come loose.once the valve was fully heated,sloas unsuccessfully used a hammer in an attempt to dislodge it.sloas and a coworker then tried to leverage the valve out using the inch pipe wrench,but that effort also failed.
consequently,sloas reheated the collar of the fuel tank and he and his coworker repeated their use of the inch pipe to lift the valve.in total,sloas and his coworker used the inch pipe wrench to apply pressure to the snyder valve for approximately fifteen to minutes.sloas experienced back pain toward the end of their last attempt.believing that he could walk it off,joint appendix at,sloas initially did not mention his potential back injury to his coworker.
both sloas and his coworker then took a regularly scheduled break.sloas testified that he later returned to the snyder valve,used a hammer to beat it,heard a tone,and the valve just c a me loose.id.at.this version of events was contradicted by a report generated the night of the incident by csxt supervisory employees,which stated that sloas indicated that he ultimately used a sawzall to remove the valve.sloas completed his shift,but was instructed to fill out an incident report after he informed his local union representative that he had wrenched his back.id.at.once the reporting process was complete,sloas drove home.by the time he arrived home he was in a lot of pain.id.at.
the next day sloas went to the hospital for an and thereafter received extensive treatment from his family physician and a neurologist,who prescribed prescription pain killers and steroid injections.this treatment caused sloas to have blurred vision and trouble concentrating.
sloas returned to work at csxt for two extended periods from june to december,and again from may to june.due to sloas obvious pain,csxt management removed him from his position in june and instructed him to obtain medical authorization before returning to work.sloas neurologist never authorized a return to work at csxt.
testimony offered by csxt employees at trial established that use of a pipe wrench or a sawzall was an appropriate method to remove snyder valves and that the valves often proved difficult to remove.several employees explained that a shortage of sharp sawzall blades at the repair facility was not uncommon,but that certain supervisors could retrieve sharp blades from a locked storeroom.
the evidence presented at trial,by sloas and others,also established that csxt had a policy against the use of brute force.see,id.at.csxt supervisory employees explained that this policy generally cautioned employees against overexerting themselves.id.at see also id.at brute force is just a terminology for straining yourself d o just take it upon yourself to do something where there an easier course to do it.if you can get help,get somebody else to help you.if you can use a crane or a hoist or something or a forklift,use something like that.several csxt witnesses opined that sloas violated this policy when he continued to use the inch pipe wrench to leverage the snyder valve,despite a lack of discernable progress in removing it.
the jury ultimately determined that both csxt and sloas were negligent and that their combined negligence contributed to sloas back injury.when asked to apportion the percentage of sloas injury and the commensurate damages attributable to each party negligence,the jury found csxt and sloas to be equally liable.the jury further determined that in damages would fully compensate sloas for his total injury.in accordance with the jury apportionment of fault,the district court entered judgment in sloas favor in the amount of.
csxt filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure e to alter or amend the judgment because sloas received disability payments under the rra based on his inability to return to work,csxt argued that it was entitled to a setoff against the jury award of damages to sloas in the amount of,as this number represent ed the present value of the disability benefits attributable to csxt contributions to the disability benefits received by sloas during the time period of december,through december.id.at.without a setoff,csxt argued it would be forced to pay twice for the same loss,resulting in sloas impermissibly receiving double payment.id.at.
the district court denied csxt request for a setoff.in so doing,it relied on the supreme court statement in eichel central railroad,that t he rra is substantially a social security act for employees of common carriers the benefits received under such a system of social legislation are not directly attributable to the contributions of the employer,so they can not be considered in mitigation of the damages caused by the employer.at quoting eichel,at.the district court was not persuaded by csxt contention that the holding in eichel was abrogated by congress subsequent amendment of the rra in.as the court explained,
i t has been years since this supposed paradigm shift occurred,yet apparently the only cases granting a setoff under the rra that csxt can muster are two state trial court cases,both decided in the last five months by courts in states outside the fourth circuit.see fairchild csx,case jefferson,div,radder csx,index i,county of erie.moreover,while csxt has produced the orders of these courts that grant the setoff in each case,these orders contain nothing of the courts reasoning.csxt also has produced portions of congressional reports discussing the change in the funding of tier benefits,but nowhere do they indicate an intention to break with eichel.the court is not prepared to deviate from supreme court precedent on this authority.csxt is seeking a setoff and it has the burden of demonstrating to the court that it is entitled to one.csxt has not succeeded in this endeavor.
after the jury rendered its verdict,the district court also ruled on sloas motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of contributory negligence under federal rule of civil procedure b.sloas argued that csxt failed to identify any act or inaction on his part that added to the risk of injury created by csxt negligence.memorandum of law in support of plaintiff rule b motion at.accordingly,sloas argued that csxt impermissibly asked the jury to infer that sloas was negligent from the happening of the accident.id.
the district court denied sloas rule b motion,opining that sloas arguments ignored evidence that he violated csxt policy against the use of excessive force.at.the court noted that csxt witnesses testified that each employee must know his or her own physical limitations and what constitutes excessive force for him or her and that sloas should have stopped trying to remove the valve with the wrench when it became apparent that the valve was not moving.id.because sloas testified that he used the inch wrench for an extended period of time and discontinued this method only after injuring his back,the district court concluded a reasonable jury could conclude that sloas own contributory negligence helped to cause his injury.id.at.
both csxt and sloas filed timely appeals and we have jurisdiction under.
on appeal,csxt reasserts the argument it raised in the district court,that the denial of an offset of the tier ii disability benefits that were received by sloas and funded in substantial part by csxt sloas and forced csxt to pay twice for the same injury.opening brief at.this result,according to csxt,is contrary to fela,contrary to supreme court and fourth circuit precedent,and contrary to good public policy,as it provides an invitation to opportunistic litigation.id at.
specifically,csxt contends that the district court erred in holding that the supreme court decision in eichel precluded the grant of an offset.see stillman norfolk,cir noting that eichel held that defendants in fela cases are not permitted to inform the jury that a plaintiff has received benefits from a collateral source.the eichel court considered the railroad retirement act of.it concluded that the rra is substantially a social security act for employees of common carriers and that t he benefits receive under such a system of social legislation are not directly attributable to the contributions of the employer,so they can not be considered in mitigation of the damages caused by the employer.at quotation omitted.
unlike benefits awarded under the act,csxt argues that the benefits at issue here,tier ii benefits were first established by the railroad retirement act of.opening brief at.csxt asserts that tier ii benefits are analogous to a private employer paid pension,id.at quotation omitted,and are in substantial part directly attributable to the contributions of the employer.id.at emphasis and quotation omitted.thus,csxt contends that congress alteration of the statutory scheme not only abrogated eichel holding,but also rendered an offset appropriate 
for his part,sloas argues that the district court separately erred when it submitted the matter of contributory negligence to the jury.sloas asserts that csxt was not entitled to a contributory negligence instruction,as it failed to provide evidence that he failed to exercise reasonable care.response brief at.indeed,sloas maintains that e vidence that does not support a contributory negligence instruction includes a plaintiff assuming the risk of his or her employment,a plaintiff violating a general safety rule that does not provide specific guidance with respect to conduct,attacking a plaintiff credibility or,relying on the mere fact that an accident and injury occurred.id.because,in his view,t he evidence csxt presented at trial fell solely within these four prohibited areas,sloas maintains that csxt failed to meet its burden of proof to create a jury question concerning contributory negligence.id.
we first consider csxt argument that it was entitled to deduct or offset the tier ii contributions it made,as sloas employer,against the jury fela award because tier ii funds paid a portion of sloas rra disability benefits.our review of the district court denial of csxt rule e motion is for an abuse of discretion.see robinson wix filtration.llc,cir.as we explained in wolfe johnson,cir,the district court necessarily abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.
we begin our analysis by examining the nature of the connection csxt draws between its tier ii contributions and the jury fela award.csxt seeks an offset to that award in the amount of.according to csxt economic expert,this figure represents the portion of the tier ii disability benefits paid to sloas from december,to december,which is directly attributable to csxt tier ii employer contributions.csxt contends the should be offset from the jury fela award because this sum was included in the jury award of in damages,an amount that covers sloas uncontested past wage loss calculation.at.
sloas responds that the jury in this case rendered a general verdict therefore,it is impossible to know the basis upon which the jury awarded damages.we agree in this case,sloas requested approximately in damages and the district court informed the jury that it could award damages for any or all of the following discomfort,pain,or inconvenience,past lost wages,and future lost wages.the total amount the jury ultimately deemed appropriate to fairly compensate sloas for his injury was only,nearly eighty percent less than sloas requested damages award.we have no indication upon which of the three categories of damages the jury based its verdict or in what combination.
on the facts in this case,it is not reasonable for us to assume the jury accorded sloas the full measure of his requested award for past lost wages.see,welsh burlington,employee benefits plan,cir because the jury rendered a general verdict,we have no way of knowing exactly what portion of the award was for pain and suffering and what portion was for future lost wages.the difference between sloas requested damages and the jury final award gives us no way of knowing the basis of that award csxt,therefore,can not meet its burden of demonstrating that the denial of an offset would provide sloas with double payment for his past lost wages 
but even if the jury verdict did encompass sloas requested award of in past lost wages,we conclude that csxt can not demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in denying a setoff.the collateral source rule holds that compensation from a collateral source should be disregarded in assessing tort damages.united states price,cir.that a benefit comes from the defendant tortfeasor does not itself preclude the possibility that it is from a collateral source.id.at.the plaintiff may receive benefits from the defendant himself which,because of their nature,are not considered double compensation for the same injury but are deemed collateral.id.
thus,whether a given benefit is derived from a collateral source depend s upon the exact nature of the compensation received.id.at.if the tortfeasor provides a benefit to the plaintiff specifically to compensate him for his injury,the benefit does not constitute a collateral source.see clark burlington,cir noting that the collateral source rule does not apply to payments which the employer has undertaken voluntarily to indemnify itself against possible liabilities under the fela.such payments may,therefore,be taken into account in fixing tort damages,as the tortfeasor need not pay twice for the same damage.price,at.
but if the tortfeasor does not provide the benefit to the plaintiff as compensation for his or her injury,the benefit is from a collateral source and should not be offset against the sum awarded from the tort nor considered in determining that award.see also phillips v.the of,cir explaining that the collateral source rule applies,for example,to fringe benefits or deferred compensation.we accordingly consider a benefit to be from a collateral source unless it results from payments made by the employer in order to indemnify itself against liability.phillips,at quotation omitted.
to analyze the nature of csxt tier ii contributions,we must first explore the current structure of the rra compensation scheme the rra of created a benefit system in which tier i corresponds to the benefits an employee would expect to receive un
