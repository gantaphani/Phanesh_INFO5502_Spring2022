this case comes before the court on an appeal of the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendant,the united states coast guard uscg,in a personal injury and wrongful death action.the central issue in the case concerns whether the coast guard breached a duty of care in attempting to rescue susan turner and her husband,roger turner.based on the record in this case,we conclude that the coast guard is not liable for turner injuries or turner death.
in addition,the case presents questions arising from three subsidiary matters turner demanded sanctions premised on the uscg alleged deliberate spoliation of evidence she opposed the district court decision to grant the uscg permission to file an motion for summary judgment,claiming the decision deprived her of due process and she challenged the propriety of the uscg responses to turner freedom of information act foia request.the district court ruled against her on all three issues.we find that the rulings on the issues of spoliation and the timeliness of the motion reflect proper exercises of the district court discretion and should not be disturbed.we also affirm the district court ruling that the coast guard response to turner foia request satisfied its duty under that act.
we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
susan turner commenced this action by filing a complaint in which she in her individual capacity and as administratrix of her husband estate brought personal injury and wrongful death claims against the united states and the uscg under the suits in admiralty act siaa.
the case arises from a tragic boating incident that occurred in the coastal waters of north carolina.on the afternoon of july,turner and her husband,roger turner,collectively,the turners,left their home on the little river on their private foot long motorboat,intending to watch holiday fireworks.before leaving,roger spoke to his father,roger,telling him that the turners would be going to one of three possible locations that evening the pasquotank river,the perquimans river,or mann harbor.after leaving home,the turners decided to travel to a party at the home of a friend,located on the perquimans river.
the turners left that affair at around by then,the seas were rough,with waves of three to four feet.the turners did not wear life jackets.attempting to move from bow to stern,turner fell overboard at approximately,nearly one and a half miles offshore.she cried out to her husband,who responded,and turned the boat around to come back for her.turner could see the boat but could not see roger.soon turner lost sight of the boat.at some point thereafter,roger also entered the water.the turners boat stayed afloat,drifting downriver.
when the turners did not return home by,roger became concerned.after trying without success to reach the turners on their cell phones,he called at about.that office relayed roger information to the north carolina wildlife resources commission nc wildlife and the uscg,which returned roger call at about on july roger told the command duty officer that the turners were overdue in returning home,and that they might be in one of three locations his son had given him earlier that afternoon.he also mentioned that the turners could be at a fourth location,a friend cabin of unknown address.
roger told the duty officer that the turners were experienced boaters and strong swimmers.he also told the coast guard that the turners vessel had flares,a vhf radio,cell phones,flotation devices,an anchor,and food and water.upon receipt of this information,the uscg decided that,due to the number of potential locations and the current deployment of search assets on a confirmed emergency mission a missing jet ski,the uscg would not initiate an active search for the turners overdue boat at that time.instead,the duty officer informed roger that the uscg would begin making radio calls and would inquire with local marinas later that morning.
nc wildlife contacted the uscg in regards to roger call.the uscg told nc wildlife that it would request assistance from nc wildlife if necessary,but that due to the size of the area in which the turners might be located and the nature of the call an overdue boat manned by two experienced boaters and swimmers,the uscg did not intend to initiate a search and rescue operation at that time.
at approximately,a uscg helicopter that had been searching for the overdue jet ski left that operation to return to elizabeth city to refuel,traveling on a flight path that led up the pasquotank river.the uscg ordered that helicopter,as it traveled up the pasquotank,to look for the turners boat,an activity that did not require the helicopter to deviate from its flight path.the crew did not see the turners boat while en route to elizabeth city.
later that morning,the uscg conducted a series of preliminary and extended communication searches precoms and excoms,respectively.these operations,in effect activities,included to the turners boat,an urgent marine information broadcast requesting other boaters to contact the uscg with any information,and calls and visits to marinas where the turners might have decided to tie up.the uscg concluded their precom and excom searches at approximately on july.
shortly before,the uscg dispatched a foot utility boat from the oregon inlet coast guard station.that craft launched at approximately and began searching the area of mann harbor,one of the four places that roger gave as a possible location of the turners.meanwhile,the host of the party the turners had attended on july,aware of their failure to return home,began retracing the turners likely return route up the perquimans river.he discovered the turners boat,beached and empty,at approximately upon learning of this discovery,the uscg reclassified the incident from a possible overdue to an overdue distress case,and launched an air and sea search for the turners.from the morning of july through the evening of july,the uscg deployed twelve manned search and rescue boats and planes,and searched square nautical miles.the uscg utilized the turners boat gps when performing their search.the uscg suspended its search activities on july at 
during the night of july and into the morning of july,turner tread water for nearly hours,surviving by clinging to crab pot buoys.she came ashore at about on july.the uscg,despite the extensive search efforts described above,did not find roger his body washed ashore two days later.the medical examiner listed roger cause of death as drowning but could not identity a precise time of death.
