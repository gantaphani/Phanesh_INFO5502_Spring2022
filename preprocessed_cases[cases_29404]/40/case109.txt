appellant heidi heineman guta heineman guta,on behalf of the united states,brought a qui tam action under the false claims act fca,et,against guidant corporation guidant and boston scientific corporation bsc alleging they engaged in a kickback scheme to promote the sale and use of their cardiac rhythm management devices.the district court dismissed heineman guta complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b on the basis that an complaint barred consideration of heineman guta complaint under the rule of the fca,id.b.heineman guta challenges the dismissal,arguing on appeal,as she did below,that the complaint can not adequately serve as a preclusive complaint to trigger the bar because it does not meet the heightened pleading standard under rule b 
heineman guta raises an issue of first impression in this circuit that is,whether b requires the complaint to meet the heightened pleading standards of rule b to bar a complaint.we hold it does not and affirm the district court.
background 
to set the stage,we start with a brief overview of the fca and the provisions that are relevant to this case.the fca prohibits the knowing submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment,or causing the submission of such claims,to the federal government and prescribes fines and treble damages to penalize offenders.a the fca qui tam provisions supplement federal law enforcement resources by encouraging private citizens to uncover fraud on the government.united states ex rel.rost pfizer,cir.such provisions permit private persons known as relators to bring certain fraud claims on behalf of the united states government.b qui tam actions are filed under seal and remain that way for at least days.id.b.this procedure gives the government an opportunity to assess the relator complaint and decide whether to intervene and assume primary responsibility for prosecuting the case.id.b,b,c.a relator is entitled to recover a share of the proceeds from the action,subject to the requirements of the statute,regardless of whether the government decides to intervene.id.d.
the fca also,however,includes certain jurisdictional bars,limiting a district court subject matter jurisdiction over qui tam actions.united states ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,cir.as relevant to this case,the rule bars a person other than the government from bring ing a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.b.with this statutory scheme in mind,we turn to the two complaints against guidant and bsc and detail the allegations made in each below 
b.the fca allegations against bsc 
the bennett complaint 
on october,elaine bennett filed a qui tam action against bsc in the united states district court for the district of maryland in that action,bennett,a former employee of bsc,claimed that between and early october,bsc engaged in an unlawful kickback scheme within its cardiac rhythm management crm division to induce physicians and hospitals to use bsc pacemakers,internal cardiac defibrillators,and cardiac resynchronization therapy crt,thereby increasing the company market share of these devices.bsc has allegedly offered various types of renumeration to hospitals and physicians in exchange for their use of bsc devices in violation of the anti kickback statute,and has caused physicians who received kickbacks to make false claims for reimbursement under medicare in violation of the fca.
bsc furthers its alleged kickback scheme in a number of ways first,by provid ing doctors and hospitals with kickbacks in the form of medical services in exchange for the providers use of bsc cardiac rhythm devices second,by induc ing doctors and hospitals to bill for medical services and procedures they d id not perform third,by requir ing bsc sales personnel to provide medical care in the absence of a licensed physician or staff member fourth,by improperly conduct ing medicare billing for physicians and hospitals through,staff fifth,by provid ing monetary grants to foundations set up by physicians and physician groups in return for favored status by such physicians,and sixth,by sponsor ing dinner meetings for implanting physicians to invite potential referring physicians to,in order for the implanting physician to increase the number of patients he receives for implants from those referring physicians.in most instances,the benefitting implanting physician also receives an honorarium for speaking about his or her expertise at the program.
bsc provides physicians access to an monitoring system called the latitude patient management system latitude,which allows patients to receive care from their residences without having to meet with a physician.latitude transmits information obtained from the implanted device through the internet to the physician office.the physician can then use the information to determine whether the device is working properly,and whether any adjustments are necessary.part of bsc representatives care for a patient device includes office visits,phone checks,and driving to rural areas to conduct site visits.because phone checks cost less than office visits,bsc representatives often conduct more phone consultations so that physicians can increase their billing to medicare.bsc representatives advise physicians offices on how to bill medicare for the maximum reimbursement for latitude services.
in addition,bsc organizes networking events where surgeons can meet physicians who might provide referrals.the host surgeon is allegedly paid as if the event were a speaking engagement when in fact it is simply a marketing ploy to increase the surgeon and bsc business.bsc incentivizes the use of its devices by planning and funding dinner programs held by implanting physicians.bsc identifies implanting physicians and organizes and pays for lavish dinner programs so that the physician in question can network with potential referring physicians.in many instances,bsc improperly pays the benefitting physician honoraria for speaking at these dinner programs.
on september,the united states declined to intervene in bennett case.one month later,the government and bennett agreed to voluntarily dismiss the matter.the district court dismissed the case and the seal was lifted 
the heineman guta complaint 
on november,while the bennett complaint was still pending and under seal,heineman guta filed a qui tam complaint under seal alleging bsc violated the fca.heineman guta amended her complaint on january.
like bennett,heineman guta made numerous allegations concerning bsc kickback scheme.heineman guta,a former account manager in bsc heart failure management group from april until november,claimed that over her employment with bsc,it defrauded the government by engaging in a scheme to provide kickbacks in various forms to physicians to encourage them to both implant its cardiac rhythm management devices and refer patients that would be implanted with such devices.
specifically,heineman guta says that bsc instructed her to provide lavish trips and entertainment to physicians in order to encourage them to refer patients for implantation of guidant cardiac rhythm management devices.bsc offered physicians paid trips and used expensive meals to induce them to insist on the implantation of bsc devices or refer patients for implantation.bsc required sales representatives to prepare customer management plans on how to retain customers,grow their business or win back their support and gain market share from them.
bsc paid physicians as speakers to gain their loyalty,repeatedly paying one implanting physician between and per engagement over the course of two years.a july company power point presentation on training allegedly instructed that best practices at the company included compensating physicians by providing them with speaking opportunities.
bsc used case reviews to funnel money to referring physicians and to provide a steady stream of patient referrals for implanting physicians who were loyal to bsc.under the case review program,bsc invited an implanting physician along with several referring physicians to an expensive dinner.at the dinner,the implanting physician reviewed cases for possible referral.in addition to paying for the dinner,bsc allegedly paid each referring physician a fee for each patient chart they brought to the dinner.bsc used the case review program as a means to not only funnel money to referring physicians,but also to ensure the commitment of participating implanting physicians to implant bsc cardiac rhythm management devices.
in addition,bsc conducted sham clinical trial programs.heineman guta pointed to one specific sham program called advancent,which was an observational registry of patients with certain symptoms of cardiac failure.through this program,bsc allegedly targeted physicians who were loyal to bsc and paid them for each patient they entered into the database who had those symptoms.
bsc also assisted fellows in finding employment in practices that primarily implanted bsc devices.bsc helped place fellows in certain practices and hospitals in exchange for promises from those practices and hospitals that they would mainly use bsc devices.
according to the amended complaint,these kickbacks caused certain physicians to implant or recommend the use of bsc devices.in addition to providing the initials of the specific referring and implanting physicians,the initials of the patients who received implantations due to the purported scheme and the dates and places of implantation,the amended complaint detailed the trips,meals and hotel reimbursements for physicians who implanted bsc devices.bsc,knowing that medicare would pay for the vast majority of these implants,allegedly promoted the highly lucrative nature of implanting its devices by pointing out to implanting physicians the extent to which medicare would provide reimbursement for implantations and the profit margins physicians could make from such reimbursement.lastly,heineman guta claimed that bsc caused physicians and hospitals,who must certify compliance with the federal anti kickback statute,to make false certifications that were material to the government decision to pay for the implantation of the companies cardiac devices.
the dismissal of the amended complaint 
on july,about nine months after the government and bennett voluntarily dismissed the bennett complaint,the district court in this case granted bsc motion to dismiss heineman guta amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under rule b.guidant,d at.the court held that the rule under b barred consideration of the amended complaint because it alleged the same essential facts of the kickback scheme as the bennett complaint.id.at.the court found that the essential facts contained in the bennett complaint provided the government sufficient notice that it was the potential victim of fraud worthy of investigation and,that as a result,it served as the preclusive complaint for the purposes of b.id.at.
despite the fact that the bennett complaint had been voluntarily dismissed in another court which had not been called upon to examine its rule b sufficiency,heineman guta main argument below was that the bennett complaint did not satisfy that rule particularity requirements.she contended that the bennett complaint lacked specific details about the alleged kickback scheme such as dates,places and names of physicians involved.according to heineman guta,the bennett complaint failure to satisfy rule b pleading requirements meant it could not serve as a preclusive complaint under b to bar her qui tam action.the district court,recognizing we had yet to rule on whether preclusive complaints must comply with rule b,rejected her argument.id.at.in doing so,it adopted the reasoning of the circuit in united states ex rel.batiste slm,which held that a complaint need not satisfy rule b requirements to serve as a preclusive complaint under b.id.at.heineman guta timely appealed.
discussion 
heineman guta argues that the district court erred in dismissing her amended complaint based on its conclusion that the fca rule does not require the complaint to meet the particularity requirements for pleading fraud under rule b.we review de novo the dismissal of an action under the fca for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.united states ex.rel.estate of cunningham millennium labs.of,wl,at cir.
the question in this case is narrow.it is whether a complaint under the fca rule,b,must comply with rule b particularity requirements in order to give sufficient notice to the government of an alleged fraudulent scheme.to that narrow question,for reasons explained below,we hold it does not.
the rule bars a plaintiff from bringing a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.b the rule is intended to provide incentives to relators to promptly alert the government to the essential facts of a fraudulent scheme.duxbury,at alteration in original quoting united states ex rel.lujan hughes aircraft,cir.to further that purpose,we have said that the rule bars a complaint if it states all the essential facts of a complaint or the same elements of a fraud described in an earlier suit.duxbury,at emphasis omitted quoting united states ex rel.lacorte smithkline beecham clinical,cir under this essential facts test,the rule bars a later complaint even if that complaint incorporates somewhat different details.duxbury,at quoting lacorte,at internal quotation mark omitted.heineman guta says the appropriate standard under which complaints should be assessed is not an essential facts standard,but rather the pleading standard set forth in rule b.
under rule b,a party alleging fraud or mistake must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.b.to satisfy rule b pleading requirements,the complaint must specify the time,place,and content of an alleged false representation.rost,at quoting doyle hasbro,cir.to discern whether b imposes rule b pleading standard on complaints alleging fca violations,we start,as we must,with the language of the statutory provision.united states armstrong,cir.where the language of the statute is plain and the meaning unambiguous,we will do no more than enforce the statute in accordance with those plain terms.united states booker,cir.section b says no person other than the government can bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.b.nothing in the language of b references rule b particularity requirements.we will not ordinarily read requirements into a statute that do not appear on its face.see dean united states,d quoting bates united states,d internal quotation mark omitted.the language is plain and simple an action is barred if it is a related action that is based on the facts underlying the pending action.b emphasis added.section b contains no exceptions,and certainly not one requiring that the pending action comply with rule b heightened pleading standard.duxbury,at noting b is quoting lujan,at.
had congress wanted to incorporate rule b particularity requirements into b,it could have done so.congress referenced the federal rules of civil procedure in various fca provisions.see,a,b b,c,h,j.indeed,b twice refers to the federal rules of civil procedure.see id.b,b referring to rule service requirements.as is the case here,when congress includes language in one section of a statute but omits it in another,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.keene united states,d quoting russello united states,d internal quotation mark omitted.congress reference to the federal rules of civil procedure in some of the fca provisions,particularly the subsections under b,and the omission of any rule b requirement from b,tells us that congress did not intend the rule to incorporate rule b heightened pleading standard.
contrary to heineman guta contention otherwise,the allegations of a preclusive complaint under b need not comport with rule b pleading requirements to provide the government with sufficient notice of potential fraud.in amending the fca in to add b,congress sought to strike the appropriate balance between adequate incentives for insiders with genuinely valuable information and discouragement of opportunistic plaintiffs who have no significant information to con
