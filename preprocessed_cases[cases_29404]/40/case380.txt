in this age discrimination case,ernesto dávila challenges the entry of summary judgment in favor of his former employer,corporación de puerto rico para la difusión pública the station.discerning no reversible error,we affirm.
background 
the critical facts are uncomplicated.the station is puerto rico public broadcasting outlet.on august,it hired the appellant as a temporary worker in its engineering department.one month later,the appellant received an appointment as chief engineer,subject,however,to an explicit probationary period.during that interval,the appellant was to be trained in the duties of the position and periodically evaluated.
evaluations were conducted on three occasions during the probationary period in december,march,and may.these reviews,composed by the station director of engineering,jorge,were generally unfavorable.according to,the appellant lacked a working knowledge of the station equipment,neglected to complete his assigned tasks in a timely manner,and proved to be in constant need of instruction.
relying on these negative evaluations,the station president,linda hernández,chose not to extend a permanent appointment to the appellant and,instead,terminated his employment at the end of the probationary period.
the appellant sued,asserting that the station had discriminated against him because of his age in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea,and puerto rico statute,laws ann.tit,law.he claimed in substance that he was terminated solely because thought he was too old for the job.the station denied the pivotal allegations of the complaint.
at the conclusion of discovery,the station moved for summary judgment.see.the district court granted the motion over the appellant objection,concluding that there was no probative evidence of discriminatory animus.dávila corporación de para la difusión pública,civ,wl july.as an alternative ground,the district court ruled that the station was immune from the appellant claims for damages.see const.amend.xi.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.discussion 
we subdivide our analysis into several segments.first,we briefly limn the standard of review and,relatedly,the summary judgment standard.next,we deal with an evidentiary question concerning certain untranslated documents.third,we explain why we eschew any inquiry into the question of eleventh amendment immunity.when these preliminaries have been completed,we turn to the merits of the discrimination claims.
we review a district court entry of summary judgment de novo.see iverson city of boston,cir.like the district court,we must take the facts of record in the light most flattering to the nonmovant here,the appellant and draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see id.
the object of summary judgment is to pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties proof in order to determine whether trial is actually required.acosta ames dep t stores,cir quoting wynne tufts.sch.of,cir.thus,summary judgment is appropriate only when the record show s that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
for this purpose,an issue is genuine if a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party.suárez pueblo int l,cir.by like token,a fact is material if it has the potential to determine the outcome of the litigation.see calvi knox county,cir.where,as here,the nonmovant has the burden of proof and the evidence on one or more of the critical issues in the case is not significantly probative,summary judgment may be granted.acosta,at quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.
we next address a threshold matter.in support of its motion for summary judgment,the station submitted an array of papers.these included several documents unaccompanied by corresponding english translations.submission of these documents contravened a local rule requiring all litigation papers to be submitted in english.see b.the district court granted the station leave to file these writings but ordered certified translations to be furnished within one month time.the station failed to comply.
more than two months after ordering the filing of translations,the district court entered summary judgment for the station.dávila,wl,at.in its decision,the court did not allude to the missing translations.the appellant contends that the rendering of summary judgment with the untranslated documents in the record constituted reversible error.
it is well settled that federal litigation in puerto rico must be conducted in english.family dep t,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted see requiring that all pleadings and proceedings in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico be conducted in the english language.when a district court accepts documents without the required english translations,an appellate court can not consider the untranslated documents on appeal.see assocs.of,cir fed.where the record shows that english translations were used in the trial court but somehow were not put into the record as they should have been,the parties may invoke fed.to correct the record.see,united states vazquez guadalupe,cir.that is not the situation here.if the untranslated documents are or may be essential to the resolution of an issue raised on appeal,and are not subject to cure by means of fed,the lack of translation may undermine meaningful appellate review.united states,cir.
the documents in question here,translations of which have been made available on appeal,consist of the appellant performance evaluations,letters from the station president notifying him of his appointment and termination respectively,and excerpts from his deposition testimony.it is crystal clear that none of these documents bear on any of the issues that the court found dispositive in adjudicating the summary judgment motion.in any event,in addition to the untranslated documents,the station submitted other documents with its motion for summary judgment.these included a sworn statement,in english,from nancy piñero,the director of the station legal division.in that statement,piñero summarized the contents of the appellant personnel file,including the three performance reviews.whatever additional information might exist in the untranslated documents is wholly extraneous and,therefore,inconsequential to the district court resolution of the matter.in short,the existence of the piñero statement makes it readily evident that nothing contained in the documents had any bearing on the district court ratio decidendi.
that ends this aspect of the matter.because the untranslated documents had no potential to affect the disposition of the case at the summary judgment stage,we conclude that the mere presence of the untranslated documents in the district court record can not support a claim of reversible error.see,at.
eleventh amendment immunity.
the district court found,as an alternate ground of decision,that the station enjoys eleventh amendment immunity.the appellant not only disputes that finding but also advances a claim of waiver.
this contretemps might easily be mistaken as a threshold issue.after all,the eleventh amendment has been described as implicating jurisdiction.see.dep t of corr.schacht,d kennedy,concurring.this is potentially important because,in many instances,colorable challenges to a court jurisdiction must be adjudicated prior to adjudicating the merits of a case.see steel citizens for a better env t,d.
here,however,controlling circuit precedent allows us to defer thorny eleventh amendment questions in cases in which it is perfectly clear that the state entity will prevail on the merits see parella ret.bd.of employees ret,cir.this is such a case.consequently,we avail ourselves of this bypass option and proceed directly to the merits of the appellant claims.
d.the merits.
the appellant seeks to recover on three causes of action.first,he claims that the station violated his procedural due process rights in failing to provide him with notice and a hearing prior to his discharge.second,he claims that his ouster was predicated on age and,thus,violated the adea.third,he recasts his federal age discrimination claim in the idiom of law.we deal with each cause of action in turn.
due process.the appellant asserts,for the first time on appeal,that the station abridged his procedural due process rights by failing to grant him notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to cashiering him.although he concedes that a probationary employee has no such rights,see,somers city of minneapolis,cir,he posits that he had moved from probationary status to career status before the ax fell.
the appellant bases this proposition on a statute that provides in pertinent part that a probatory work contract in no case shall exceed three months.laws ann.tit,h.the statute further declares that,should the employee continue to work for the employer after the term established in the probatory work contract,said employee shall acquire all the rights of an employee.id.the appellant takes this to mean that the probationary period to which he subscribed was illegal and that he attained the status of a permanent employee after occupying the chief engineer position for three months and one day.
this is an interesting argument,but it comes as an afterthought.the appellant did not present it to the district court.the argument is,therefore,forfeited see united states leahy,cir.we review forfeited issues for plain error.see id.at.plain error review is not we will resuscitate a forfeited argument only if the appellant demonstrates that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the appellant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.as we explain below,the appellant in this case can not satisfy this exacting standard.
the station was created by statute as an independent public service corporation.see public broadcasting corporation,laws ann.tit.pursuant to this statutory scheme,the station is authorized to adopt,amend and repeal regulations to govern its affairs and activities.id.it is also authorized to appoint and contract employees in accordance with the personnel regulations that are promulgated.id.
exercising these powers,the station promulgated a comprehensive set of regulations.see reg.july.pertinently,one of those regulations provides that the duration of a probationary work period for a station recruit can be between three months and one year.see id.
this regulation,which validates the probationary period contained in the appellant contract,arguably conflicts with section h in that it purports to allow probationary periods longer than three months.the question,then,reduces to whether the puerto rico legislature intended the general h to restrict the latitude that it gave to the station in an statute.there is no controlling case law to guide us on how to navigate our way through such a conflict.as a result,the answer to the nuanced question that the appellant argument poses is not immediately obvious.
that is game,set,and match.the lack of any clear,easily determinable answer to a legal conundrum is,in itself,enough to defeat a claim of plain error.see united states,cir.accordingly,we reject the appellant procedural due process claim.
adea.the adea makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual because of such individual age.a see suárez,at.the appellant alleges that his discharge transgressed this proscription.
when an employee claims to have been discharged in violation of the adea,he must shoulder the ultimate burden of proving that his years were the determinative factor in his discharge,that is,that he would not have been fired but for his age.mesnick,cir quoting freeman package mach,cir.the supreme court has developed a framework to facilitate the process of proving discrimination in the absence of direct evidence.see mcdonnell douglas green,d,see also sanchez oil,cir applying that framework in an adea case.
the initial burden lies with the plaintiff to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination.see,nce foods,cir.to satisfy this burden,the plaintiff must produce evidence showing four facts i that he was at least forty years old when shown the door ii that his job performance met or exceeded the employer legitimate expectations iii that his employer actually or constructively discharged him and iv that his employer had a continuing need for the services he formerly furnished.see suárez,at.
here,the first,third,and fourth prongs of the appellant prima facie case are not in dispute.the station acknowledges that the appellant was in the protected age group on may,it admits that it terminated his employment on that date and it concedes that it hired a replacement upon the appellant departure.there is a substantial question as to whether the appellant has satisfied the second element but we assume for the sake of argument that he has made the requisite showing.
once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,a presumption of discrimination arises and the burden of production shifts to the employer to proffer a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge.see rest.metro,cir.the employer burden is not a burden of persuasion the employer need do no more than articulate a reason which,on its face,would justify a conclusion that the plaintiff was let go for a nondiscriminatory motive.see sanchez,at mesnick,at.
in this instance,the station asserted,through the sworn statement of piñero,that the appellant was terminated because of poor work performance during his probationary stint.this statement,by itself,provides sufficient basis for the district court conclusion that the station articulated a nondisciminatory motive for the appellant discharge.see douglas penney,cir woodman haemonetics,cir.
when,as in this case,the employer produces a facially adequate explanation for the discharge,the presumption of discrimination created by the plaintiff prima facie case disappears from view.see ramírez rodríguez boehringer ingelheim,cir.at that juncture,the burden reverts to the plaintiff,who must show that the reason given by the employer for the discharge is pretextual,and,moreover,that it is pretext for age discrimination.sanchez,at.in other words,the question of discrimination vel non comes front and center.see ramírez rodríguez,at reckitt colman,cir.at summary judgment,this question reduces to whether or not the plaintiff has adduced minimally sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that he was fired because of his age.see ramírez rodríguez,at,at.
here,the appellant endeavors to carry this burden by showing that the station proffered reason was a pretext and that he was actually cashiered because of his age.his efforts take two forms.first,he tries to discredit his negative performance evaluations.second,he cites office gossip as a basis for concluding that the station wanted to get rid of him because of his age.neither offering bears fruit.
the appellant claim that his work performance was unfairly evaluated rests on three supporting allegations that he was not given adequate training that the reviews were an inaccurate reflection of his performance and that was unqualified to compile the reviews because he did not hold an engineering license.this is whistling past the graveyard.these allegations,even if true,would indicate no more than that the appellant dismissal was unfair or unwise they would not indicate age discrimination.we explain briefly.
when assessing a claim of pretext in an employment discrimination case,a court focus is necessarily on the motivations and perceptions of the decisionmaker.mesnick,at.thus,as long as the station believed that the appellant performance was not up to the appellant has presented no evidence suggesting that management thought is not our province to a decision to fire him as a poor performer that is true regardless of whether,to an objective observer,the decision would seem wise or foolish,correct or incorrect,sound or arbitrary.see,at see also mesnick,at explaining that courts may not sit as super personnel departments,assessing the merits of employers nondiscrimin
