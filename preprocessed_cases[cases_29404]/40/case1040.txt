on march,the equal employment opportunity commission the eeoc or the commission filed a subpoena enforcement application in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania,seeking enforcement of a administrative subpoena it issued to kronos incorporated kronos pertaining to the eeoc investigation into a charge of discrimination against kroger food stores kroger.on june,the district court issued an order narrowing the scope of the subpoena and directing the parties to negotiate a confidentiality order.on july,the district court denied the eeoc motion to adopt its proposed confidentiality order,granted kronos motion for adoption of its order,and entered kronos proposed order as the court own,with slight modifications.the eeoc appeals from both of these orders.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm in part and reverse in part the district court order of june,modifying the scope of the subpoena.we will vacate the district court july,confidentiality order and remand for further proceedings.
vicky sandy,who is hearing and speech impaired,filed a charge of discrimination with the eeoc against kroger on or about june.according to her charge,sandy applied for work as a cashier,bagger,and stocker in may at a kroger in clarksburg,west virginia.she alleged that kroger did not hire her because of her disability,in violation of the americans with disabilities act of,et ada.sandy alleged that i n may,a management official name unknown told me that i would not be a good fit for any openings because of the way that i speak.after denying me employment,they continued to advertise for openings.joint appendix ja.
kroger utilizes a customer service assessment,created by kronos the assessment or kronos assessment,in its hiring process the assessment purports to measure the human traits that underlie strong service orientation and interpersonal skills,such as controlling impatience showing respect listening attentively working well on a team and being sensitive to others feelings.ja.according to kronos,applicants who perform well on the assessment are more likely to a ct cheerful,polite,and friendly l isten carefully and c ommunicate well with customers.ja.sandy score on the assessment was.ja.
according to kroger position statement in response to sandy charge,the store manager,bob bowers,interviewed sandy for the open positions.kroger alleged that during the interview,bowers had difficulty in understanding sandy verbal responses to questions and found her responses to be garbled and at times inaudible and unintelligible.ja.kroger also noted that bowers discussed with sandy her low score on the kronos assessment and her lack of job experience.
kroger provided the eeoc with a copy of sandy employment application summary.the portion summarizing the results of the kronos assessment provides,inter alia,that sandy is less likely to listen carefully,understand and remember.ja.the summary contains an interview guide that lists suggested questions.sandy questions include,describe the hardest time you had understanding what someone was talking about.sandy application summary also suggests observations the interviewer should make,such as how does the applicant speak during the interview listen for correct language,clear enunciation,appropriate contact.ja.
after kroger admitted in its position statement that it relied at least in part on the assessment in its hiring decision,the eeoc sent kroger a request for information rfi,dated january,seeking several categories of documents related to the assessment and its use.included was a request for copies of any and all validity studies and information pertaining to applications for the position of cashier bagger going back to january.ja.the rfi asked that kroger provide the information on or before february,date of the eeoc investigator planned.
kroger responded to the rfi on february,but failed to provide all of the information requested,including validity studies.the eeoc contends that it was not sure at that point whether kroger had access to kronos validity studies.ja.
on march,the eeoc issued a administrative subpoena to kronos.the subpoena sought validity studies related to the kronos tests kroger purchased,instruction manuals for the assessment tests kroger used,documents related to kroger,and any validation efforts made regarding any or all jobs at kroger,any documents related to potential adverse impact on people with disabilities,and job analyses related to any and all positions at kroger.ja.
the eeoc later notified kroger that it was expanding the scope of its ada investigation 
based upon its authority,the eeoc hereby serves notice that the above referenced charge has been expanded to include the issue of disability with respect to the use of assessment test in hiring class during the period august,to the present and for all facilities in the united states and its territories.
according to the eeoc,around this time it discovered an article,by a kronos employee,which indicated that minority applicants performed worse than applicants on the kronos assessment administered by a large,geographically diverse retailer.further,the eeoc maintains that its charge database contained complaints against kroger alleging failure to hire based on disability and race.
based on these circumstances,the eeoc sent kroger a letter informing it that the eeoc was expanding its investigation once again,this time to include race 
based upon its authority,the eeoc hereby serves notice that the above referenced charge has been expanded to include the basis of disability and race black with respect to the issues of the use of assessment tests in hiring class for the period beginning from the date that such test s were implemented by kroger through the present and for all facilities in the united states and its territories.
ja.the eeoc rescinded its original subpoena to kronos and issued a new subpoena directing that kronos 
produce any and all documents and data constituting or related to validation studies or validation evidence pertaining to unicru a kronos subsidiary kronos assessment tests purchased by the kroger company,including but not limited to such studies or evidence as they relate to the use of the tests as personnel selection or screening instruments.
produce the user manual and instructions for the use of the assessment tests used by the kroger company.
produce any and all documents and data,including but not limited to correspondence,notes,and data files,relating to the kroger company its use of the assessment tests results,ratings,or scores of individual and any validation efforts made thereto.
produce any and all documents discussing,analyzing or measuring potential adverse impact on individuals with disabilities an individuals sic race.
produce any and all documents related to any and all job analyses created or drafted by any person or entity relating to any and all positions at the kroger company.
furnish a catalogue which includes each and every assessment offered by.additionally provide descriptions of each assessment 
kronos filed a petition to revoke the subpoena with the eeoc,objecting that the subpoena requests information that is not relevant to any allegation made in sandy charge,and constitutes sic commercially valuable and trade secret property of kronos,which the eeoc seeks without adequate protection.ja.the eeoc denied the petition to revoke on january,and ordered kronos to comply with the subpoena.the eeoc determined that the information the subpoena requested was directly relevant to its properly expanded investigation and well within the eeoc investigative authority.ja.it further concluded that title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,the ada,and the eeoc regulations regarding confidentiality of information obtained during an investigation provided sufficient protection against disclosure without a confidentiality agreement.
when kronos failed to comply with the subpoena,the eeoc filed a subpoena enforcement action,which the district court granted in part and denied in part.the district court characterized the subpoena scope as including most of kronos business documents,covering its entire client base,with no time,geographic,or job description limitations.ja footnotes omitted.the district court determined that materials unrelated to sandy discrimination charge were not relevant to the investigation.the district court modified the subpoena to include only kronos work for kroger limited to the time period of january,to may,the state of west virginia,and the job positions of bagger,stocker.specifically,the district court ordered kronos to comply with the following provisions 
produce any user manual and instructions for the use of the assessment tests provided to the kroger company.
produce any and all documents and data,including but not limited to correspondence,notes,and data files,relating to the kroger company the kroger company use of the assessment tests results,ratings,or scores of individual at the kroger company and any validation efforts performed specific ally for and only for the kroger company.
produce any and all documents discussing,analyzing or measuring potential adverse impact on individuals with disabilities,relating specifically to and only to the kroger company.
produce any and all documents related to any and all job analyses created or drafted by kronos relating to the bagger,stocker,positions at the kroger company.
furnish any catalogue provided to the kroger company.
items through are limited to the time period of january,through may,in the state of west virginia,for the positions of bagger,stocker.
the district court also ordered the parties to enter into any appropriate confidentiality order to protect any trade information of kronos and the personal information of persons taking the assessment tests.ja.the parties negotiated and agreed to certain provisions of a confidentiality order,but failed to arrive at an agreement regarding other terms kronos requested,including a limitation confining the use of confidential material to the investigation of sandy allegations against kroger and any subsequent charge she may file a restriction that during the investigation,confidential material may be disclosed only to eeoc employees with a need to know and any other person mutually agreed upon by kronos and the eeoc and a requirement that the eeoc return confidential material within ten business days after concluding the sandy investigation,and destroy any documents,including eeoc notes or memoranda,that reflect or refer to the confidential material within ten business days after a notice of right to sue.
both parties submitted proposed confidentiality orders to the district court.on july,the court denied the eeoc motion to adopt its proposed confidentiality order and granted kronos motion for entry of its proposed confidentiality order.the court added an additional term to the kronos order said confidential material shall not be entered into a centralized database.ja.
the eeoc appeals both decisions of the district court.
the district court exercised jurisdiction under and and.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.we review a district court decision to enforce an administrative subpoena for abuse of discretion.chao cmty.trust,cir.we also employ an abuse of discretion standard when reviewing the grant of a confidentiality order.pansy borough of stroudsburg,cir.abuse of discretion occurs when the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.chao,at quoting nlrb frazier,cir.
the ada prohibits,inter alia,use of employment tests that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities unless the test,as used by the employer,is shown to be for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity.b see also b defining discriminate to include failing to select and administer tests concerning employment in the most effective manner to ensure that,when such test is administered to a job applicant or employee who has a disability that impairs sensory,manual,or speaking skills,such test results accurately reflect the skills,aptitude,or whatever other factor of such applicant or employee that such test purports to measure,rather than reflecting the impaired sensory,manual,or speaking skills of such employee or applicant.both disparate treatment and disparate impact claims are cognizable under the ada.raytheon hernandez.
the eeoc is empowered to investigate charges of discrimination to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that an employer has engaged in an unlawful employment practice see b,a expanding the eeoc power to investigate and address discrimination on the basis of disability.in connection with its investigation,the eeoc may issue administrative subpoenas.see id.however,the eeoc statutory investigative authority is not plenary the eeoc is entitled to access only evidence relevant to the charge under investigation.a 
the relevance requirement is not particularly onerous.courts have given broad construction to the term relevant and have traditionally allowed the eeoc access to any material that might cast light on the allegations against the employer.eeoc shell oil,see also eeoc dillon,cir the supreme court has explained that the relevancy limitation on the eeoc investigative authority is not especially constraining.quoting shell oil,at eeoc ford motor credit,cir noting that congress intended the eeoc to have broad access to information relevant to inquiries it is mandated to conduct eeoc franklin marshall,cir the concept of relevancy is construed broadly when a charge is in the investigatory stage.nonetheless,the eeoc power of investigation is anchored to the charge of discrimination,and courts must be careful not to construe the charge and relevance requirements so broadly as to confer unconstrained investigative authority upon the eeoc.shell oil,at see also eeoc united air lines,cir.the relevance requirement is designed to cabin the eeoc authority and prevent fishing expeditions.united air lines,at quotation marks omitted.the eeoc bears the burden of demonstrating relevance.see eeoc farm bureau cas.ins,cir.
once the eeoc begins an investigation,it is not required to ignore facts that support additional claims of discrimination if it uncovers such evidence during the course of a reasonable investigation of the charge.see.of the,eeoc,any violations that the eeoc ascertains in the course of a reasonable investigation of the charging party complaint are actionable.eeoc cambridge tile,cir per curiam enforcing eeoc subpoena seeking information related to sex discrimination in job classification after eeoc uncovered evidence of such discrimination during investigation of allegations of sex and race discrimination in termination eeoc,cir t he original charge is sufficient to support action by the eeoc for any discrimination stated in the charge itself or developed in the course of a reasonable investigation of that charge.rather,the eeoc has the power to investigate a a broader picture of discrimination which unfolds in the course of a reasonable investigation of a specific charge.cambridge tile,at.
the eeoc argues on appeal that,by narrowing the subpoena scope rather than enforcing it as written,the district court abused its discretion.the eeoc contends that the information it sought in the subpoena is relevant because it might cast light on sandy allegations against kroger,and thus meets the liberal standard of relevance the supreme court espoused in shell oil.in particular,the eeoc argues that the scope of kroger use of the kronos assessment nationwide not just the state of west virginia,for all retail jobs not just for baggers,stockers,from whatever date kroger began using the test to the present not just from january,through may,is relevant as to whether kroger discriminated against sandy individually as a member of a class of individuals with disabilities adversely impacted by the kronos assessment test.eeoc br.at.the eeoc also asserts that kronos assessment instructions and manuals are relevant regardless of whether kronos actually provided them to kroger,as are materials related to validation studies and potential adverse impact based on disability,even if such materials are not specific to kroger use of the test.we agree.the district court applied too restrictive a standard of relevance in limiting the information related to geography,time,and job position.further,the district court erred in limiting the eeoc access to user manuals and instructions,validation information,and materials pertaining to potential adverse impact on individuals with disabilities.
sandy charge alleges failure to hire based on her disability.kroger admitted to relying at least in part on the kronos assessment in evaluating sandy in order for the eeoc to determine whether kroger failure to hire sandy was discriminatory,it is entirely appropriate for the eeoc to investigate kroger use of the assessment.the eeoc is entitled to information that may provide a useful context for evaluating employment practices under investigation,in particular when such information constitutes comparison data.eeoc of pittsburgh,cir holding eeoc request for faculty employment records of four related schools was relevant to charge of sex discrimination in the school of nursing,especially because the school of nursing faculty was almost entirely female see also eeoc associated dry goods,statistics and other information about an employer general practices may certainly be relevant to individual charges of discrimination franklin marshall,at holding materials related to other tenure candidates in a similar time frame were relevant and not overbroad in eeoc investigation of charge alleging discriminatory denial of tenure because they might provide useful comparison data and help determine whether there was a pattern of discrimination.in this case,information pertaining to kroger actual use of the kronos assessment may provide useful context and important comparative data for the eeoc investigation into sandy charge of discrimination.
the district court decision to narrow the subpoena to include only bagger,stocker,positions was an abuse of its discretion.kroger purportedly uses the kronos assessment in hiring for every retail position.ja.under the shell oil relevance standard,there is no reason to confine the subpoena to kroger use of the assessment for bagger,stocker,positions.information related to other job descriptions may shed light on whether the assessment has an adverse impact on persons with disabilities.such data,at the very least,provides comparative information on the assessment,which is absolutely essential to a determination of discrimination.eeoc roadway express,cir quotation marks omitted holding that the eeoc was entitled to information related to job positions other than those at issue in the charge because such information met the shell oil standard of relevance.
for the same reason,the district court misapplied the relevance standard when it limited the eeoc access to kroger information related only to the state of west virginia.kroger uses the kronos assessment in hiring nationwide.ja.an employer nationwide use of a practice under investigation supports a subpoena for nationwide data on that practice.eeoc united parcel serv,cir per curiam enforcing eeoc subpoena seeking information on how employer applied appearance guidelines nationwide in eeoc investigation of two complaints of religious discrimination.here,nationwide materials could provide important comparison data,as well as a useful context for evaluating whether kroger use of the assessment violates the ada.see of pittsburgh,at.
the district court also too narrowly circumscribed the subpoena when it instituted the temporal limitation of january,through may.although the relevance requirement does impose temporal limits on the scope of the eeoc inquiry,the duration of kroger use of the kronos test falls within the scope of information that might cast light on the practice under investigation.evidence related to the employment practice under investigation prior to and after sandy charge provides valuable context that may assist the eeoc in determining whether discrimination occurred.roadway express,at enforcing eeoc subpoena for information both before the alleged discrimination took place and after the charge of discrimination.
kronos argues that the eeoc is not entitled to the information it seeks because sandy charge is completely devoid of any allegations of nationwide discrimination and discrimination in job positions other than those for which she applied.kronos argument fails to recognize that the eeoc investigatory power is broader than the four corners of the charge it encompasses not only the factual allegations contained in the charge,but also any information that is relevant to the charge.thus,the eeoc need not cabin its investigation to a literal reading of the allegations in the charge.as we have acknowledged,t he concept of relevancy is construed broadly when a charge is in the investigatory stage.franklin marshall,at see also of pittsburgh,at the investigatory powers of the eeoc should be interpreted broadly.the eeoc does not seek information or materials related to assessment tests kroger has never purchased and has never used.eeoc reply br.at.the requested materials are not so broad as to render the relevance requirement a nullity.see shell oil,at noting that courts must not interpret the standard of relevance so broadly that it becomes a nullity.we decline kronos invitation to cabin the eeoc investigation such that it is unable to access materials that meet the shell oil relevance is,materials that might cast light on sandy charge of discrimination.
the district court decision denying the eeoc access to particular materials unless they relate only to kroger was an improper use of its discretion.the district court limited production of documents discussing,analyzing,or measuring potential adverse impact on individuals with disabilities to those relating specifically to and only to the kroger company.ja.the court also modified the subpoena to limit production of validation study information to validation efforts performed specific ally for and only for kroger.ja.such information,regardless of whether it was performed specifically for or relat es specifically to and only to kroger,certainly might shed light on the charge of discrimination.if kronos has information relating to whether its assessment has an adverse impact on disabled people,that information is clearly relevant to whether kroger violated the ada by using the assessment.additionally,information pertaining to the validity of the test,even if it was not performed specific ally for and only for kroger,could assist the eeoc in evaluating whether kroger use of the test constituted an unlawful employment action.modifying the subpoena to exclude these materials was a misapplication of the broad relevance standard that accompanies the eeoc subpoena authority.
kronos argues that sandy alleged disparate treatment in her charge but failed to allege disparate impact,and thus the eeoc is not entitled to investigate whether kroger use of the assessment has an adverse impact on people with disabilities.we disagree.sandy charge does not contain a legal theory,nor was she required to assert one.see a b requiring,inter alia,a clear and concise statement of the facts related to the alleged unlawful employment practices and noting that a charge that describe s generally the action complained of is sufficient.we have recognized that the individuals who draft charges are often not well vested in the art of legal description and as a result,the scope of the original charge should be liberally construed.hicks abt,inc,cir see also sanchez standard brands,cir noting that a layperson filling out a charge of discrimination might have difficulty articulating legal basis for alleged discrimination eeoc dupont de nemours,d.explaining that the precise language of the charge provides less guidance for subsequent proceedings than the general character of the grievances to which the charge alludes and that the charge is often drawn by a layperson who perceives only dimly the nature and cause of the discrimination,aff on other grounds,cir.it is entirely possible that sandy was
