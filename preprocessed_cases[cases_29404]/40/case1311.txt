we heard argument in this case in concert with the related appeal of sansotta town of nags head,wl cir.both suits involve a slew of federal and state law claims concerning the legality of efforts by the town of nags head,north carolina the town,to declare beachfront properties that encroach onto public trust lands a nuisance,and regulate them accordingly.the district court adjudicated the claims in sansotta,but concluded here that it was inappropriate for a federal court to intervene in such delicate matters,town of nags head toloczko,d,and therefore abstained from decision under burford sun oil.
mindful that the abnegation of federal jurisdiction is a serious measure to be taken only under extraordinary and narrow circumstances,martin stewart,cir,we conclude that the circumstances of this case do not merit abstention.while the claims asserted here do involve a sensitive area of north carolina public policy,resolving them is not sufficiently difficult or disruptive of that policy to free the district court from its unflagging obligation to exercise its jurisdiction.in re mercury constr,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore reverse the district court decision to abstain,and remand for further proceedings.
the town of nags head is a coastal municipality that has the atlantic ocean as its eastern boundary.its beaches have historically been used by the public for transportation and recreational activities.these activities enjoy legal protection under the public trust doctrine,which entitles states like north carolina to appropriate title to tidal lands in trust for the public.see gwathmey state through dep t of env t,health,natural.
various natural indicators can demarcate public trust lands from private property.although the vagaries of beach topography make it difficult to delineate a fixed boundary,the town and north carolina both define the relevant area as seaward of the mean high water mark.town of nags head,code of ordinances,see also.e.
historically,prevailing environmental conditions have pushed the high tide line westward from the atlantic ocean,resulting in erosion and the gradual migration of private beachfront property into public trust lands.to combat this trend,beachfront owners like matthew and lynn have periodically restored displaced sand and have raised the height of their cottages by sixteen feet to endure tidal surges.in the event of storm damage,the toloczkos obtained permits from the town to make all necessary repairs.
a few years ago,however,the town determined that certain beachfront properties were beyond rehabilitation because they were located within public trust lands.the town therefore resolved to demolish these structures through enforcement of its nuisance ordinance,which regulates a ny structure,regardless of condition located in whole or in part in a public trust area or public land.town of nags head,code of ordinances,c.
when a tropical storm inflicted serious damage on the toloczkos cottage in november,the town condemned the structure and sent the toloczkos a declaration of nuisance.the town refused to allow the toloczkos to abate any nuisance by acquiring a permit to make repairs.the town also began to assess daily fines to compel the toloczkos to demolish the structure.
the toloczkos refused to raze their cottage,and the town sued them in north carolina state court,seeking to collect the assessed civil fines and demolish the cottage.the toloczkos removed the case to federal court based on diversity of citizenship.
after removal,the toloczkos filed counterclaims alleging violations of state and federal law.the bulk of the counterclaims sought related,if not duplicative,declaratory judgments that the town acted unlawfully by enforcing the public trust doctrine through its nuisance ordinance.the toloczkos also sought injunctive relief and money damages for violations of state and federal law.
during the course of the litigation,the town amended its zoning ordinance to prohibit any structure if located wholly within the wet sand area of the public trust beach area,on the state owned property seaward of the mean high water mark or wholly or partially within any portion of the public trust beach area in such a manner that the building or structure impedes the flow of vehicular,pedestrian,or emergency services traffic at normal high tide.town of nags head,code of ordinances.the amended ordinance also forbids the issuance of building and repair permits for structures located on public trust lands.
in the meantime,a north carolina beach replenishment initiative added substantial sand seaward of the cottage,prompting the town to inform the toloczkos that it no longer considered their cottage a nuisance.the town subsequently offered the toloczkos the opportunity to procure new permits to repair the cottage to repair the cottage,however,the toloczkos needed to petition the north carolina department of environment and natural resources cama for approval to obtain a local permit to replace their damaged septic tanks.cama denied the permit due to the cottage location within an area of environmental concern and comments from the town of nags head indicating that the proposal has been deemed to be currently inconsistent with the code of ordinances of the town of nags head.accordingly,the parties continued the litigation.
the district court,however,declined to decide the case.invoking the burford doctrine of abstention,the court noted the danger of federal interference with unsettled,important policy matters reserved to the states,and determined that land use is an important public policy that lies within the prerogative of a sovereign state.toloczko,d at.because the dispute involved profound,unresolved issues that transcend the case at hand,id.at,the court exercised its discretion to decline federal jurisdiction this appeal followed.
we review a district court decision to abstain for abuse of discretion,ever mindful that,although the standard is a deferential one,the discretion to abstain is tempered by the truism that the federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation to exercise their jurisdiction.mlc,llc town of pines,cir internal quotations omitted.
