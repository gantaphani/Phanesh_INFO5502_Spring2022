opinion of the court 
emmanuel noel appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in the boeing company favor on his employment discrimination claim brought under title vii of the civil rights act of.on appeal noel argues that the recently enacted lilly ledbetter fair pay act of renders his otherwise administrative filing timely,preserving his claim.for the following reasons,we will affirm the district court ruling.
background 
noel is a black haitian national,who began working for boeing in as a sheet metal assembler at its ridely park,pennsylvania facility noel was hired at labor grade and repaired chinook aircraft.the terms of noel employment were governed by a collective bargaining agreement cba between boeing and the international union of united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america local,as well as internal boeing policies.
boeing employees were occasionally offered an opportunity to work at offsite locations.because employees working offsite received greater pay,per diems and additional training,offsite positions were coveted and individuals volunteered for these assignments.any promotions and corresponding raises were limited to the duration of the offsite assignment.according to the cba that governed noel employment,seniority was not the only factor that boeing considered when assigning workers offsite.rather,skill and ability were the determining factors,and seniority was only considered when those factors were equal.
noel took his first offsite assignment in at a boeing facility in shreveport,louisiana this lasted approximately six months.although he sought an offsite assignment in may,noel was not assigned offsite again until november,when he was designated an aircraft mechanic to work on modifications to the osprey at the bell helicopter facility in amarillo,texas.that assignment resulted in noel labor grade rising from to he also received a per diem.after two weeks of working in amarillo,noel salary was increased from per hour to per hour.
around the same time,chris carlin and gary newman,both white employees,were also assigned to amarillo from the ridley park facility.they too were reclassified from labor grade aircraft assemblers to offsite mechanics at labor grade.after working in amarillo for seven months,carlin and newman were promoted to offsite mechanic general,labor grade,while noel remained at the lower paying grade.in september,noel complained about these promotions to a union representative and a boeing labor relations representative.his complaints went unanswered.noel filed a title vii suit against boeing and one of its managers alleging discrimination based on race and national origin.on march,noel filed a formal grievance with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.
on june,noel filed a title vii complaint against boeing.he thereafter amended the complaint.count i of the amended complaint accused boeing of intentional discrimination and disparate treatment based on noel race and national origin.count ii raised the same issue under the pennsylvania human rights act.count iii levied a retaliation claim against boeing,and count iv demanded punitive damages.these claims were based on several specific incidents referenced by noel in his complaint.relevant to this appeal,noel complained that boeing did not send him offsite to amarillo in may when white,employees who held the same job as noel but were junior to him were sent offsite and in,while offsite at amarillo,he was promoted to labor grade while his junior,white,were promoted to labor grade 
b.the district court ruling 
after a bench trial,the district court ruled in boeing favor on all counts.the district court first granted defendant summary judgment motion on noel claim that boeing violated title vii when it failed to send him offsite to amarillo in may and when he was not promoted to offsite mechanic labor grade in,holding that this claim was since noel did not file a charge of discrimination with the eeoc until march,well outside the statutory time period.the district court also granted defendants motions for judgment on partial findings on noel claim that he should have been promoted to lead mechanic upon his return to ridley park.judgment was also awarded in boeing favor regarding noel erroneous placement on boeing offsite list,which stymied his promotion,since defendants subsequently promoted noel and awarded him backpay.
next,the district court granted judgment in defendants favor on noel claim that race and national discrimination animated boeing decision not to transfer him to the position of offsite material handler while it did transfer carlin and newman.although the district court noted that noel had established a prima facie case of discrimination,it nonetheless granted judgment in defendants favor because boeing successfully rebutted that case.specifically,the district court found credible boeing assertion that the sole reason carlin and newman were sent offsite to work as material handlers was because they were the only employees who directly expressed interest in and volunteered for the jobs and that in doing so,it followed the collective bargaining agreement guidelines to the letter as noel himself acknowledges,he never sought to have another job in amarillo other than the one which he was then.app.at.thus,the district court granted judgment in defendants favor because noel did not convince it that boeing stated reason for moving carlin and newman offsite was false and that discrimination was the real reason for the decision.id.at.
the only aspect of the district court ruling that noel challenges is its determination that he failed to administratively preserve his claim that,in,defendants failed to promote him to offsite mechanic general labor grade in violation of title vii according to noel,because of this discriminatory employment action,he received less pay than his white coworkers throughout his time at the amarillo plant.noel contends that the lilly ledbetter fair pay act of fpa makes clear that in pay discrimination matters an unlawful employment practice occurs each time an individual is affected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision.appellant br.at.noel argues that the district court erred as a matter of law when it granted summary judgment in defendants favor since boeing failure to promote him resulted in lower pay,and,therefore,each paycheck he received started the administrative clock anew.
title vii of the civil rights act makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment or to limit or classify his employees in any way which would deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,because of such individual race or national origin.a.before filing a claim in federal court,a title vii plaintiff in pennsylvania must file a charge of discrimination with the eeoc within days of the alleged unlawful employment practice.see mikula,at e.if a claimant fails to exhaust his or her claim within the requisite time period,that claim is administratively barred.this statute of limitations applies to discrete employment actions,including promotion decisions.see passenger morgan.
here,the adverse employment actions noel complained of occurred between july and september.because noel did not file his eeoc charge until march,well after the time period expired,the district court ruled that any claims of discrimination stemming from the employment decisions were barred as a matter of law.nevertheless,noel argues that the fpa revives his claim since each paycheck he received during the requisite time period started the administrative clock ticking anew.
congress passed the fpa in response to the supreme court decision in ledbetter goodyear tire rubber,which held that was a discrete act and therefore the period for filing an eeoc claim commences when the unlawful act occurs,superseded,in part,by statute,fair pay act of,e,as recognized in mikula,at.ledbetter worked for goodyear from until she introduced evidence at trial that th
