abdel moniem ali was fired from his job at bettis laboratory after the department of energy doe revoked his security clearance.sued the doe and its acting deputy secretary jeffrey kupfer,claiming that the revocation of his clearance violated the united states constitution and the administrative procedure act apa.the district court dismissed all of his claims.appeals.because we conclude that complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
the following statements of fact are drawn from complaint.because the district court decided this case on a motion to dismiss,the allegations in the complaint must be accepted as true for purposes of this appeal.nationwide life ins.commonwealth land title ins,cir.
is a egyptian.he came to the united states in and settled in pittsburgh,pennsylvania.he holds a master degree in atomic physics and a in nuclear physics.in,he became a united states citizen.in,he was hired as a physicist at bettis laboratory,a facility operated under contract with the doe.bettis was and remains dedicated solely to the naval nuclear propulsion program,a joint program responsible for the design,construction,operation,and maintenance of warships.job required a security clearance,and he received one in may of.that clearance was subject to at least five between and,and on each occasion retained his clearance.he never received a negative performance evaluation and was never accused of misconduct.
is muslim,and outside of work he was active in various causes related to his faith.he helped to establish one of pittsburgh first mosques,the islamic center of pittsburgh the islamic center,and served in its leadership.he regularly spoke at services there and at other mosques.
according to,government scrutiny of muslims increased after the attacks of september.on june,the fbi raided the light of age mosque,a mosque located on pittsburgh north side,during a solemn prayer service known as juma two weeks later,gave a speech at the islamic center criticizing the fbi and condemning the raid.during the same speech,he strongly criticized united states foreign policy.he was especially critical of american involvement in iraq.
then,in june or july of,gave a speech at a mosque to promote prison outreach.while there,he found fbi brochures recruiting muslim informants.he told the congregation that the fbi recruitment efforts were improper because the mosque was a house of worship.he argued that the fbi had become a political organization,not a law enforcement agency.he told congregants that they should report crimes if they knew of any,but that they should not serve as informants for the fbi until it stopped acting like a political organization.
around the same time,began serving as an imam for the pennsylvania department of corrections at the state correctional institution at forest.he requested to speak with the superintendent there about the treatment of muslim prisoners,but the superintendent declined to meet with him.in july of,he sought to raise money for eid ceremonies at for muslim prisoners who were unable to pay their share of the costs themselves the superintendent refused to accept any money raised by.shortly thereafter,learned that prison officials were upset with him for distributing to prisoners a book about islam titled the miracle in the ant.the book contained a passage about a defense mechanism found in certain ants,which allows them to burst open their body wall and spray deadly secretions upon attackers.
approximately a week after learning of the displeasure at over the miracle in the ant,drove a muslim inmate family four hours to a different state prison so that the inmate and her family could visit.the family had an appointment,but and the family were denied entry.complained and asked to speak with the deputy warden and the superintendent.both requests were denied.submitted a written complaint over the incident.several days later,he received a phone call stating that his contract with was being terminated.
on october,was called into a meeting with the bettis laboratory security manager.another person,unidentified,was present.at the meeting,was questioned extensively.he was asked whether he supported killing americans,whether he supported suicide bombings,and whether the miracle in the ant could be construed as encouraging suicide bombings.he was also questioned about his contacts with other muslims,his interactions with the pennsylvania department of corrections,his speeches at mosques,and his practice of sending money to a family in yemen.at the end of the meeting,was told that his security clearance was suspended pending resolution of issues.he was escorted from the building.
several weeks later,agreed to an interview with the fbi.fbi agents informed that the doe had asked the fbi to determine whether he should continue to hold his security clearance.the agents asked him questions similar to those posed by the bettis laboratory security manager.he was also asked about his views on the koran whether he ever watched television or internet news broadcasts depicting the deaths of americans in iraq whether he was a member of hamas or,or whether he knew anyone in those organizations and whether he believed an iraqi would be a martyr if he killed an american in a suicide bombing.at the end of the meeting,the fbi advised that more meetings might be necessary,but no more interviews were scheduled.
in december of,received a letter from a doe official informing him that he was suspended with pay.the letter stated that reported information cast substantial doubt on his continued eligibility for a security clearance.the letter further stated that the doe possessed information indicating that continued possession of a security clearance could endanger national security.on december,was placed on reduced pay for the length of his suspension.
in january of,received a letter explaining the reasons for the suspension of his security clearance.the letter stated 
reliable information in the possession of the department of energy indicates that you have knowingly established or continued sympathetic association with a saboteur,spy,terrorist,traitor,seditionist,anarchist,or revolutionist,espionage agent,or representative of a foreign nation whose interests are inimical to the united states,its territories or possessions,or with any person advocating the use of force or violence to overthrow the government of the united states or any state or subdivision thereof by unconstitutional means.
it further stated that 
reliable information in the possession of the department of energy indicates that you have engaged in unusual conduct or are subject to circumstances which tend to show that you are not honest,reliable,or trustworthy or which furnishes reason to believe that you may be subject to pressure,coercion,exploitation,or duress which may cause you to act contrary to the best interests of national security.specifically,the circumstances or conduct involve conflicting allegiances.
these allegations simply tracked the language of doe regulations,see b,l,and did not include any details about the reliable information possessed by the doe.
the letter also explained certain procedures through which could challenge the allegations against him.those procedures included a hearing before a doe hearing officer the right to submit written answers to the allegations against him the right to present evidence on his behalf and the right to be present and to be represented by counsel at his own expense.
accepted the doe offer to challenge the allegations in the january letter,and to that end he requested a hearing.after an initial status conference,however,the doe terminated the proceedings.on may,acting deputy secretary of energy kupfer notified that his security clearance was revoked the kupfer certification.kupfer certified under executive order that the usual procedures available in security clearance revocation proceedings could not be made available to without damaging the interests of national security by revealing classified information.kupfer stated that this determination was conclusive.he did not describe the specific national security concerns that motivated the decision to revoke clearance without a hearing.later,the kupfer certification was superseded by a similar certification by secretary of energy samuel bodman the bodman certification 
lacking a security clearance,lost his job at bettis laboratory on may.
on june,filed this lawsuit in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania.his complaint named kupfer and the doe as defendants.in count i,alleged that the defendants violated his first amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of religion.he contended that the doe revoked his clearance in retaliation for the speeches he gave criticizing the fbi,united states foreign policy,and the war in iraq.in count ii,he alleged that the doe and kupfer violated his fifth amendment right to equal protection by discriminating against him on the basis of his religion and national origin.according to,the doe invoked national security solely to mask its real reasons for revoking his clearance,and that the real reasons were retaliatory,discriminatory,and unconstitutional.in count iii,alleged that the defendants violated the apa and his fifth amendment right to due process by failing to follow doe regulations in revoking his clearance.he sought a declaration that defendants actions were unconstitutional and an order requiring the doe to provide him with a hearing and other procedures provided by doe regulations.significantly,he claimed that he did not seek to overturn the security revocation decision.he only sought a hearing and the opportunity to contest the revocation before a neutral arbiter.
the government moved to dismiss counts i and ii for lack of jurisdiction under department of the navy egan,and count iii for failure to state a claim.it argued that the executive branch revocation of a security clearance is not subject to judicial review and that,in any event,clearance was revoked in compliance with doe regulations.the district court concluded that counts i and ii required examination of the merits of the doe decision to revoke his clearance,and therefore dismissed those claims for lack of jurisdiction.the district court also concluded that the doe followed its own regulations and dismissed count iii for failure to state a claim.appealed.
the district court exercised jurisdiction under.jurisdiction in this court arises under.we exercise plenary review of the district court order granting the government motion to dismiss.phillips county of allegheny,cir.
the government,citing egan,contends that article iii courts lack jurisdiction over this case because they lack jurisdiction to review the merits of a security clearance revocation.citing webster doe,and stehney perry,cir,argues that we do have jurisdiction.to decide the jurisdictional question,we must examine all three of these cases in some detail.
the plaintiff in egan,thomas egan,worked at a naval facility where all employees were required to have security clearances.egan,at.after egan had worked at the facility for a short time,the navy denied him a security clearance and removed him from his position.egan sought review by the federal merit systems protection board the board id.at.during the ensuing board proceedings,the navy contended that the board did not have the authority to judge the merits of the underlying determination that led to egan removal.id.at.it argued that the board could only inquire as to whether a clearance was a requirement for egan position,and whether the required procedures had been followed in removing him.id.the board agreed that it had no authority to review the merits of a security clearance determination and sustained egan removal.id.at.on appeal,the federal circuit reversed the board,reasoning that the absence of any statutory provision precluding appellate review of security clearance denials in removal proceedings such as the one before it created a strong presumption in favor of review.id.at.
the supreme court reversed,holding that the board lacked authority to review the merits of the navy decision to revoke egan security clearance.egan,at.the court acknowledged the general rule that agency action is presumptively reviewable,but noted that this presumption has its limits,and that it runs aground when it encounters concerns of national security.id.at.it noted that the decision to grant a security clearance is a sensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call committed by law to the appropriate agency of the executive branch.id.the law to which the supreme court referred was the united states constitution.the supreme court explained that 
the president,after all,is the commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states,art.ii.his authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position in the executive branch that will give that person access to such information flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the president and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant.this court has recognized the government compelling interest in withholding national security information from unauthorized persons in the course of executive business.the authority to protect such information falls on the president as head of the executive branch and as commander in chief.
id.citations omitted.
the egan court also stated that it was obvious that no one has a right to a security clearance.id.at.the court noted that the decision to grant a clearance is discretionary,and must be premised on the judgment that an individual receipt of a clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.egan,at.because such judgments about whom to trust with classified information are made by experts in the executive branch,and because they implicate the president traditional authority over military and national security affairs,see id.at,the court reasoned that they are entitled to deference from nonexpert outside bod ies such as the board.id.at.
although egan held only that a agency the board lacked authority to review the merits of a security clearance decision,its holding has since been extended.many courts,including this one,hold that egan also forbids judicial review of the merits of clearance decisions.see,makky chertoff,cir citing egan and stating that there is no judicial review of the merits of a security clearance decision stehney,at noting the consensus in the courts of appeals about the scope of egan dorfmont brown,cir jamil sec of the dep t of,cir hill dep t of the air force,cir.
egan deferential approach may be contrasted with the supreme court holding in webster.there,the court decided the extent to which the employment decisions of the director of the central intelligence agency cia were judicially reviewable.section c of the national security act of permitted the director of the cia,in his discretion,to terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the agency whenever he deemed such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the united states.webster,at.john doe worked for the cia for nine years before voluntarily informing a cia security officer that he was a homosexual.id.at.ultimately,the director determined that doe homosexuality was a threat to national security and fired him under section c.id.doe sued,claiming that the cia actions were arbitrary and capricious under the apa.he also asserted a panoply of constitutional claims,including violations of his rights to due process and equal protection under the fifth amendment,and violations of his rights to property,liberty,and privacy under the first,fourth,fifth,and ninth amendments.id.at.the supreme court held that doe could not bring an apa claim,because section c granted the cia director unreviewable discretion in employment decisions.id.at.the court also held,however,that section c did not preclude judicial review of colorable constitutional claims arising out of the actions of the director pursuant to that section.id.at.the court reached this conclusion to avoid the serious constitutional question that would arise if a federal statute were construed to deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim.webster,at.
in stehney,this court sought to reconcile the decisions in webster and egan.the plaintiff in stehney worked at a private think tank involved in research for the national security agency the nsa.stehney,at.her job required a security clearance,which she received but later lost when she refused to take a polygraph test.id.at.stehney filed a complaint alleging that the nsa violated her constitutional rights to due process,privacy,and equal protection.she also alleged that the nsa failed to follow its own regulations in revoking her clearance.the district court dismissed stehney constitutional claims for lack of jurisdiction.id.it concluded that the revocation of stehney clearance was a political question.id.at.according to the district court,egan supported the conclusion that there was a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue of access to classified information to the executive branch under article ii and that any judicial review of such decisions violated the separation of powers.id.
we held that the district court erred in dismissing stehney claims for lack of jurisdiction.we adhered to egan holding that the merits of the revocation decision were.stehney,at.we emphasized,however,that not all claims arising from security clearance revocations violate separation of powers or involve political questions.id.we read egan and webster together as holding that article iii courts have jurisdiction to hear constitutional claims arising from the clearance revocation process,even though the merits of that revocation can not be reviewed.see id.citing webster,at in concluding that article iii jurisdiction existed,we stressed that stehney was not asking for review of the merits of the nsa revocation,but instead sought review of the constitutional claims arising from the nsa decision to revoke her clearance.stehney,at.
this court drew a similar distinction in makky.in that case,we exercised jurisdiction over a title vii claim challenging a security clearance revocation.citing stehney,we emphasized the distinction between challenging the merits of a clearance revocation and challenging the revocation process,noting our authority over the latter but not the former.makky,at.we reviewed the plaintiff claim on the merits,but were careful to note in doing so that we could not question the motivation behind the decision to deny makky security clearance.id.at.
in light of egan,webster,stehney,and makky,we conclude that the district court had jurisdiction over allegations that constitutional violations occurred in the process of revoking his security clearance.in count i,claims that the decision to suspend and then revoke his security clearance was made in retaliation for the exercise of his first amendment rights to freedom of speech and religion.in count ii,he asserts that the decisions to suspend and revoke his security clearance were based on his religion and national origin.read in the light most favorable to,counts i and ii both assert constitutional claims arising from the clearance revocation process.stehney,at.like stehney,does not ask us to restore his security clearance.he only seeks review of his claim that an agency violated his constitutional rights in the process of revoking his clearance,and at most,a new hearing concerning that clearance.while we can not review the merits of the decision to revoke security clearance,stehney requires us to exercise jurisdiction over constitutional claims and review them to the extent that we can do so without examining the merits of that decision.see stehney,at noting that to the extent that stehney seeks review of whether nsa violated her constitutional rights,she presented a justiciable claim,but emphasizing that there could be no review of the merits of the clearance revocation.see also makky,at reviewing plaintiff title vii claim but stating that the court was powerless to question the motivation behind the decision to deny plaintiff a clearance.thus,the district court erred in dismissing counts i and ii for lack of jurisdiction.nevertheless,we will affirm the dismissal of counts i and ii because they fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
as noted,count i is a first amendment retaliation claim.to state a prima facie case of retaliation,must show that his conduct was constitutionally protected and that his protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged retaliatory action.ambrose twp.of robinson,cir.the doe may defeat his prima facie case by showing that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of the protected conduct.id.quoting bd.of county comm rs umbehr.
could easily establish that the political and religious speech that allegedly led to the revocation of his clearance was constitutionally protected.it is the second element of his prima facie case that is problematic.proving that political speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision to revoke his clearance would inevitably require review of the merits of the doe decision.there is simply no way to prove or disprove what perhaps more importantly for this case,what was substantial or motivating factor in the decision to revoke clearance without demanding some explanation of that decision from the doe.it would require discovery of doe officials and documents concerning the various factors that led to the decision to revoke the clearance,and scrutiny of those factors to determine which were substantial or motivating.id.we can discern no difference between that inquiry and the review of the merits that is forbidden by egan.indeed,never explains how he could succeed on count i without reviewing the merits.just the opposite he admits that reviewing the merits is exactly what he seeks to do.he claims that the doe invocation of national security was pretextual,and that the real reasons would prove to be violative of his constitutional rights.he argues that 
a lthough a review of the doe action may entail an examination of the basis for its decisions,it does not follow that the court must the doe exercise of predictive judgment.the purpose of this lawsuit is to ensure that the doe actions are indeed based on such predictive judgment and not based on discriminatory animus.if it is determined that the doe actions were constitutionally permissible not based on rationale then no further review is necessary.
appellant br.at.in other words,argues that the doe need not tell him why it revoked his clearance,but it must tell him that it really did so based on national security and not as a pretext for discrimination.this argument fails.gives away the game when he concedes that his constitutional claims may entail an examination of the basis for doe decisions.this admission is fatal.an examination of the basis of the doe decision to revoke clearance is precisely what egan forbids.see egan,at explaining that an agency head who must bear the responsibility for the protection of classified information should have the final say in deciding whether to repose his trust in a particular person stehney,at dorfmont,at.
the ninth circuit rightly rejected an argument similar to in brazil dep t of the navy,cir.in brazil,the plaintiff sued the navy under title vii after his security clearance was revoked.he argued that his title vii claim did not require the court to determine whether the navy reasons for revoking his clearance were valid it merely require d a determination of whether the proffered reasons were the actual reasons.brazil,at.the ninth circuit rejected this attempt to escape egan by claiming pretext,for reasons that are equally applicable here 
the more valid a reason appears upon evaluation,the less likely a court will be to find that reason pretextual the converse is also true.even when the court faces independent evidence of a discriminatory motive,it is still necessary to weigh the validity of the defendant proffered reasons when deciding if they are pretextual.in short,the merit of such decisions simply can not be wholly divorced from a determination of whether they are legitimate or pretextual.
additionally,we note that even if could somehow make out the prima facie case for his first amendment claim,the doe right to defend itself against that claim also raises problems under egan.if made out his prima facie case,doe could theoretically still prevail by proving that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of religious and political speech.ambrose,at.that would inevitably require the doe to explain in detail its decision to revoke clearance,or at least submit an affidavit stating that it did not revoke clearance because of his protected speech but because of egan,no court could ever force the doe to do so.furthermore,even if the doe chose to offer a nondiscriminatory explanation for its decision to revoke clearance,a factfinder would then have to assess the plausibility of that explanation to decide whether the government met its burden under step three.weighing the strength of the government arguments against claims of pretext would amount to a judgment on the merits of the decision to revoke clearance.this too would violate egan.see brazil,at.for reasons of institutional competence,separation of powers,and deference to the executive on national security matters,stehney,at,the decision to deny a security clearance is left to the sole discretion of the executive branch.the secretary of energy,who serves as a trustee of the presidential power over information critical to national security,simply can not be ordered to justify his decisions in this area,nor can his justifications be subjected to weighing and by a nonexpert outside body such as a factfinder in a federal court.egan,at.
we conclude that count i was properly dismissed because can not prevail on his first amendment claim.the legal framework applicable to that claim would demand from the doe an explanation of its decision to revoke clearance,and allow a factfinder to weigh the doe arguments in support of that decision.egan forbids both.put another way,claim could never be meaningfully litigated the outcome is.whatever else happened,the doe would always prevail because of egan.in short,we believe that egan presents an insuperable bar to relief on count see benton merrill lynch,cir explaining that dismissal for failure to state a claim is appropriate where an insuperable bar to relief is evident from the face of the complaint wright miller,federal practice procedure ed same.therefore,count i was properly dismissed because it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.see port authority of arcadian,cir stating dismissal under rule b is appropriate where a complaint states a claim based upon a wrong for which there is clearly no remedy,or a claim which the plaintiff is without right or power to assert and for which no relief could possibly be granted emphasis added.
equal protection claim under the fifth amendment fails for similar reasons.this court would apply the mcdonnell framework to that claim.see,e,rode dellaciprete,cir applying mcdonnell douglas framework to equal protection claim stewart rutgers,cir applying framework to claim of racial discrimination in employment.under that framework,to prove that the decision to suspend and revoke his security clearance was based on his religion and national origin,would have to first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence.stewart,at.the burden would then shift to the doe to come forward with a explanation for its decision.id.finally,could offer evidence demonstrating that the doe explanation was a pretext.id.
count ii fails because the legal framework governing that claim,like the framework governing count i,would inevitably involve scrutiny of the merits of the doe decision to revoke clearance.even assuming that could establish his prima facie case,neither the second nor third steps could proceed without running headlong into egan.as explained above,neither nor a court could compel the doe to offer a explanation for its decision to revoke clearance.the doe can not be held to a burden to justify the decision to revoke clearance under the mcdonnell framework because the doe has no duty to justify that decision,period.it is beyond judicial review.for similar reasons,could never establish that the doe national security explanation was a pretext for a discriminatory motive.he could never gather the evidence necessary to prove that claim,and even if he could,no fact finder could be permitted to weigh the merits of the doe decision to decide whether it was a pretext.egan forbids it.see brazil,at.thus,as with count i,egan stands as an insuperable bar to relief on count ii,and it must be dismissed for failure to state a claim.see benton,at port authority of,at.
in count iii,alleges due process violations and violations of the apa,both arising from the doe alleged failure to follow its own regulations in revoking his clearance.at the outset,we note that there is no dispute as to the court jurisdiction over the allegations in count iii.the government concedes,as it must,that the apa grants federal courts the power to review whether an agency followed its own regulations and procedures during the revocation process.stehney,at.
count iii of complaint references both the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the apa.to the extent count iii alleged a due process violation,abandoned that claim at oral argument all that remains of count iii,then,is claim under the apa that the doe failed to follow its own regulations,the regulations,and executive order in revoking his clearance.the district court disagreed,as do we.because the doe followed the applicable regulations and executive orders in revoking clearance,count iii fails to state a claim and was properly dismissed.
in reviewing the doe actions in this case,we note that we owe great deference to the doe interpretation of executive order because the doe has been charged with administering that order.see udall tallman.similarly,we will give substantial deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulations,thomas jefferson shalala,and must accept the agency interpretation as controlling unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.see also morrison madison dearborn capital partners,cir.
argues that the doe interpretations of the relevant executive orders and regulations are not entitled to deference because its interpretations raise serious constitutional concerns.appellant reply br.at.does not state which of his constitutional rights would be violated by the agency interpretations,but presumably,he is arguing that he has a due process right to review under the regulations.this argument conflates statutory rights under the apa and his constitutional rights.may have a right under the apa to judicial review of whether the doe followed its own regulations and procedures during the revocation process,stehney,at,but he has no due process right to a security clearance.id.at.therefore,even if we were to accept his argument that an agency interpretation that raises serious constitutional concerns is not entitled to deference,that rule would not be applicable here.
the regulations implemented two executive orders.the first was executive order,titled safeguarding classified information within industry.see b.issued in,it describes certain minimum procedures required in clearance revocation proceedings.see exec.order.the order also preserves the authority of the head of an agency to bypass any procedure otherwise provided under the order,if he determines that such procedures can not be invoked consistently with the national security.executive order.the agency head determination that the use of such procedures is inconsistent with national security is conclusive.id.
the second executive order implemented by the regulations was executive order.that order establishes a uniform federal personnel security program for employees under consideration for security clearances.exec.order,preamble.section a of the order grants certain procedural rights to individuals who are denied security clearances.among those are the right to a
