this is an appeal from the dismissal of a complaint under the state secrets doctrine.after careful consideration of the public and classified pleadings,the district court correctly concluded that the information in question is properly privileged and that litigation of the case would present an unjustifiable risk of disclosure of that information.accordingly,we affirm.
appellant jacob abilt was hired by the central intelligence agency cia or the agency in june as an applications developer.around the time he was hired,abilt informed the agency that he had a diagnosis of narcolepsy.beginning in may until the ultimate termination of his employment in october,abilt was a covert employee.many of the basic facts regarding abilt employment with the agency are classified,as are the job responsibilities and even the identities of most of his former supervisors and.
in early,abilt began experiencing difficulty with his narcolepsy and asked his for permission to take periodic naps,which his granted.around the same time,abilt was cleared by the agency medical officer for a temporary duty yonder tdy assignment overseas,as well as to a warzone 
abilt was then assigned a new supervisor,referred to in the record only as lee.when lee witnessed abilt sleeping at his desk,lee delayed abilt tdy assignment by days in march.when abilt complained,he was told that his tdy assignment was delayed six months due to potential concerns about his narcolepsy,and a few weeks later told that he could not travel overseas for six months,or to a warzone for twelve months.abilt was instructed that any future decision would be based in part on his ability to manage his narcolepsy.
at the end of the period,abilt requested tdy assignment,and was told there were no plans to send anyone overseas.abilt alleges that multiple of his without disabilities were subsequently sent overseas.abilt was evaluated again by the agency medical officer,and both abilt and lee were informed that abilt was medically cleared to travel to a warzone.at the end of the period,abilt was given a list of new requirements he would have to meet to be assigned overseas or to a warzone.abilt alleges that the new requirements applied only to him.
in march,abilt was authorized for tdy overseas,but denied a tdy assignment to a warzone.the agency informed him that he needed to complete a tdy overseas assignment before he could be authorized for a tdy assignment to a warzone.abilt successfully completed his tdy overseas assignment,and then requested a tdy assignment to a warzone.after undergoing two examinations,both of which abilt passed,he was still denied,allegedly because of safety concerns related to his narcolepsy.
during this time,abilt complained to the equal employment opportunity eeo office about his treatment,and he alleges that as a result,lee delayed his tdy overseas assignment and also refused to provide him with the same training and opportunities offered to his.abilt filed administrative complaints in both and alleging disability discrimination,failure to accommodate,and retaliation.the agency issued a decision rejecting his claims as unsupported in.the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc affirmed the agency decision.abilt employment with the agency was ultimately terminated in october.
abilt first filed suit against the agency and director john brennan collectively,still the agency in february,alleging discrimination and ultimately termination based on his disability,failure to accommodate,and retaliation.the agency invoked the state secrets privilege over various information related to abilt employment.the district court held that the agency properly invoked the privilege,and dismissed the complaint without prejudice,finding that abilt could not prove his prima facie case of discrimination without resorting to privileged information.see abilt abilt i,wl.
while the motion for summary judgment was pending in his first suit,abilt filed this suit abilt ii against the same defendants on december,under the rehabilitation act of,pub,stat.codified as amended at,et,and title vii of the civil rights act of,pub,stat,codified as amended at to,alleging disability discrimination and failure to accommodate,as well as retaliation.in particular,abilt alleged that the cia canceled his tdy assignment to a warzone because of his disability,denied him other assignments and training opportunities available to his coworkers,and falsely reported that he was failing to satisfactorily perform his clandestine work assignments.after abilt i was dismissed,the agency moved for summary judgment in abilt ii based on the state secrets privilege.in support,the agency submitted two declarations from dir.brennan one public,which explained how disclosure of information would harm national security and compromise the agency,and one ex parte,in camera,that further explained the scope of information subject to the assertion of privilege.the district court held that the agency had properly invoked the state secrets privilege,and found that because the decision in abilt i covered many of the same categories of information,abilt was barred from relitigating those same issues.the court then dismissed the action because privileged information was at the core of abilt prima facie case the agency could not defend its case without resorting to privileged information and further litigation would risk disclosure of privileged information.
abilt timely appealed the district court decision in this suit,arguing that the district court misapplied the state secrets doctrine.
we review de novo a district court legal determinations involving state secrets,including its decision to grant dismissal of a complaint on state secrets grounds.united states,cir.quoting sterling tenet,cir.
under the state secrets doctrine,the united states may prevent the disclosure of information in a judicial proceeding if there is a reasonable danger that such disclosure will expose military matters which,in the interest of national security,should not be divulged.id.at quoting united states reynolds,the doctrine modern form was set forth by the supreme court in reynolds,and its continued validity has been repeatedly confirmed by the supreme court and by this court.see,tenet doe,at sterling,at.
reynolds dealt with suits filed under the federal tort claims act arising from the deaths of three civilians in the crash of a military aircraft that had been testing secret electronic equipment.at.the government filed a formal claim of privilege arguing that the plane had been on a highly secret mission of the air force,and that disclosure of the requested materials would seriously hamper national security,flying safety and the development of highly technical and secret military equipment.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court sustained the government claim of privilege,finding that the privilege against revealing military secrets is well established in the law of evidence.id.at.the court in a footnote cited a long line of decisions,both american and english,recognizing the government privilege against revealing state secrets.id.at,collecting cases and secondary sources 
the resolution of a claim of state secrets privilege requires a analysis,at.first,the court must ascertain that the procedural requirements for invoking the state secrets privilege have been satisfied.id.second,the court must decide whether the information sought to be protected qualifies as privileged under the state secrets doctrine.id.third,if the information is determined to be privileged,the ultimate question to be resolved is how the matter should proceed in light of the successful privilege claim.id.
the procedural requirements for invoking the state secrets privilege were established by the supreme court in reynolds.at.first,the state secrets privilege must be asserted by the united states government it can neither be claimed nor waived by a private party.id.at footnotes omitted.second,t here must be a formal claim of privilege,lodged by the head of the department which has control over the matter.id.at.third,the department head formal claim of the state secrets privilege may be made only after actual personal consideration by that officer.id.at.
after a court has confirmed that the reynolds procedural prerequisites are satisfied,it must determine whether the information that the united states seeks to shield is a state secret,and thus privileged from disclosure,at.this determination places on the court a special burden to assure itself that an appropriate balance is struck between protecting national security matters and preserving an open court system.islamic,bush,cir.
the state secrets privilege performs a function of constitutional significance,because it allows the executive branch to protect information whose secrecy is necessary to its military and responsibilities,at.as such,the executive determination that disclosure of information might pose a threat to national security is entitled to utmost deference.united states nixon,superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized by bourjaily united states.
yet at the same time,j udicial control over the evidence in a case can not be abdicated to the caprice of executive officers no matter how great the interest in national security,at quoting reynolds,at alteration in quoting source see also sterling,at noting the importance of j udicial involvement in policing the privilege.when the privilege is validly asserted,the result is unfairness to individual litigants,fitzgerald penthouse int l,cir.thus,to ensure that the state secrets privilege is asserted no more frequently and sweepingly than necessary,it is essential that the courts continue critically to examine instances of its invocation.ellsberg mitchell,cir.we take very seriously our obligation to review the government claims with a very careful,indeed a skeptical,eye,and not to accept at face value the government claim or justification of privilege.al haramain,at.appropriate judicial oversight is vital to protect against the intolerable abuses that would follow an abandonment of judicial control,reynolds,at.
the supreme court balanced these concerns in reynolds by leaving the judiciary firmly in control of deciding whether an executive assertion of the state secrets privilege is valid,but subject to a standard mandating restraint in the exercise of its authority,at.as such,a court is obliged to honor the executive assertion of the privilege if it is satisfied,from all the circumstances of the case that there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which,in the interest of national security,should not be divulged.id.at quoting reynolds,at.
the burden is on the government to satisfy the reviewing court that the reynolds standard is met.id.frequently,the explanation of the department head who has lodged the formal privilege claim,provided in an affidavit or personal declaration,is sufficient to carry the executive burden.citing sterling,at relying on declarations of cia director reynolds,at relying on a claim of privilege by secretary of the air force and an affidavit of the air force judge advocate general 
once this burden is carried,the claim of privilege will be accepted without requiring further disclosure.reynolds,at.although it is for the court to determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege,we must do so without forcing a disclosure of the very thing the privilege is designed to protect.reynolds,at.b oth supreme court precedent and our own cases provide that when a judge has satisfied himself that the dangers asserted by the government are substantial and real,he need not indeed,should not probe further.sterling,at.
once the information is found to be properly privileged,the final step in the state secrets privilege analysis is for the court to determine whether the case can proceed without the privileged information.
information that is properly privileged under the state secrets doctrine is absolutely protected from disclosure even for the purpose of in camera examination by the court,at.the supreme court was explicit as to this point in reynolds when the occasion for the privilege is appropriate,the court should not jeopardize the security which the privilege is meant to protect by insisting upon an examination of the evidence,even by the judge alone,in chambers.at.
furthermore,no attempt is made to balance the need for secrecy of the privileged information against a party need for the information disclosure a court determination that a piece of evidence is a privileged state secret removes it from the proceedings entirely,at citing reynolds,at.e ven the most compelling necessity can not overcome the claim of privilege if the court is ultimately satisfied that military secrets are at stake.reynolds,at.
as such,i f a proceeding involving state secrets can be fairly litigated without resort to the privileged information,it may continue,at.on the other hand,a proceeding in which the state secrets privilege is successfully interposed must be dismissed if the circumstances make clear that privileged information will be so central to the litigation that any attempt to proceed will threaten that information disclosure.id.at citations omitted see also sterling,at we have long recognized that when the very subject of the litigation is itself a state secret,which provides no way that case could be tried without compromising sensitive military secrets,a district court may properly dismiss the plaintiff case.quoting fitzgerald,at alterations in original bowles united states,cir.per curiam if the case can not be tried without compromising sensitive foreign policy secrets,the case must be dismissed.to be sure,dismissal is appropriate o nly when no amount of effort and care on the part of the court and the parties will safeguard privileged material,sterling,at quoting fitzgerald,at alteration in original however,dismissal follows inevitably when the sum and substance of the case involves state secrets,id.at.
we have identified three examples of circumstances in which the privileged information is so central to the litigation that dismissal is required.first,dismissal is required if the plaintiff can not prove the prima facie elements of his or her claim without privileged evidence.see farnsworth cannon,grimes,cir.en banc per curiam a ny attempt on the part of the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case would so threaten disclosure of state secrets that the overriding interest of the united states and the preservation of its state secrets precludes any further attempt to pursue this litigation.second,even if the plaintiff can prove a prima facie case without resort to privileged information,the case should be dismissed if the defendants could not properly defend themselves without using privileged evidence,at see also sterling,at.finally,dismissal is appropriate where further litigation would present an unjustifiable risk of disclosure.see,at a proceeding in which the state secrets privilege is successfully interposed must be dismissed if the circumstances make clear that privileged information will be so central to the litigation that any attempt to proceed will threaten that information disclosure.
with these principles in mind,and being cognizant of the delicate balance to be struck in applying the state secrets doctrine,at,we proceed to our analysis of abilt claim.
the district court correctly found that the government satisfied each of the first two steps of the state secrets inquiry outlined by this court in.at.the government satisfied the first step,the reynolds procedural requirements,by submitting the declaration of john brennan,in his capacity as the director of the cia,asserting the state secrets privilege after personal consideration of abilt claims and determining that the disclosure of information relating to intelligence sources,methods,and activities that may be implicated by the allegations in the plaintiff amended complaint are at risk of disclosure in this case.furthermore,after a review of the public and classified declarations filed by dir.brennan in support of the invocation of the state secrets privilege,we are satisfied that the government has satisfied the reynolds reasonable danger standard there is little doubt that
