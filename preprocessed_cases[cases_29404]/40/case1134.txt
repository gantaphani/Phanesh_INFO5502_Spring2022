opinion of the court 
in this appeal we review a district court order awarding attorneys fees to plaintiffs pursuant to b.plaintiffs brought this lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the city of pittsburgh city ordinance regulating expressive activities in public forums.plaintiffs complaint sought declaratory and permanent injunctive relief plaintiffs also filed a motion for interim injunctive relief.the district court granted plaintiffs motion and issued a preliminary injunction which prohibited the city from enforcing the challenged ordinance and imposed temporary procedures to govern the issuance of permits for expressive activities in public spaces until the city passed a new ordinance.the district court also directed the parties to meet and confer regarding the city proposals to revise the ordinance and supervised that process as disputes arose.the court lifted the preliminary injunction and closed the case only after the city passed a revised ordinance which,the parties agreed,corrected all of the alleged constitutional infirmities of the challenged ordinance.
although several of our sister courts of appeals have confronted the question,this appeal requires us to determine for the first time whether allows a plaintiff to be the prevailing party when it achieves relief on the merits of its claims in the form of a preliminary injunction,but does not secure a final judgment in its favor.under the circumstances of this case,we find that it does.because we conclude that plaintiffs were the prevailing party in this litigation and that the district court fee award was reasonable,we will affirm the order of the district court.
plaintiffs people against police violence papv,thomas merton center,and the national association for the advancement of colored people,pittsburgh branch,filed a lawsuit under raising first amendment challenges to chapter of the pittsburgh city code,pittsburgh ordinance regulating parades and crowds in public forums.plaintiffs alleged that on october,papv requested a permit from the city of pittsburgh for a parade to the allegheny county courthouse and a rally at the courthouse,to be held on november.the city informed papv that it would grant the permit only on the condition that papv prepay costs for police protection.plaintiffs brought this lawsuit on october,days prior to the planned,they asserted,as of that date the city had yet to notify papv of the amount of the costs being assessed or to issue the requested permit.the complaint also alleged that papv is a small organization which could afford no more than a nominal fee.
plaintiffs complaint detailed the city handling of papv permit request and set forth a long history of prior alleged first amendment abuses under chapter.it alleged that the city permitting procedures were unconstitutional,both facially and,in at least three ways they gave city officials excessive discretion regarding the use of public forums they imposed unconstitutional financial obligations on groups wishing to engage in expressive activities and they lacked sufficient procedural due process protections.the complaint also averred that plaintiffs intend to continue organizing and sponsoring marches and rallies in the future.plaintiffs requested a declaration that chapter violated the constitution,a declaration that the city assessment of security costs to plaintiffs violated the constitution,and a permanent injunction preventing the city from enforcing the ordinance and from charging event sponsors for costs plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order tro preliminary injunction.
at the initial hearing before the district court,held on october,the city represented that it was no longer enforcing chapter and that it would prepare a revised ordinance to replace it.the city also acknowledged,however,that it had not repealed chapter and that it had instituted no alternate procedures to govern the issuance of permits for public expressive activities in the interim.the court granted plaintiffs motion for temporary injunctive relief,concluding that chapter was facially unconstitutional under the first amendment as applied to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.app.at.it also ruled that,if the city no longer enforced that ordinance,a permit regime devoid of any prescribed process would also be unconstitutional.the court tro prohibited the city from enforcing chapter,prohibited the city from assessing costs to permit applicants,and imposed temporary procedures to govern the city issuance of permits until the city passed a constitutionally adequate ordinance.the court also directed the parties to meet and confer regarding the city proposed revisions and ordered the city to submit its proposals to the court.
the city submitted its initial proposal for a revised ordinance shortly thereafter.at a second hearing before the district court,on november,the court heard arguments regarding the proposal and,without ruling on the constitutionality of it,indicated that it found several aspects of the proposal constitutionally problematic and gave the city a clear signal that at least one aspect of it would make the ordinance facially unconstitutional.app.at.the court converted its tro into a preliminary injunction and continued it otherwise unchanged.the court also requested further briefings from the parties regarding particular aspects of the draft ordinance which the court found troubling.the city took no appeal from the entry of the preliminary injunction.
the city presented a second draft of its revised ordinance to plaintiffs in december.the city formally repealed chapter on february,and promptly filed a motion to lift the injunction and dismiss the lawsuit as moot.
at a third hearing held on february,the court heard testimony and argument regarding the city motion to dismiss and regarding the terms of the permitting procedures set forth in the preliminary injunction.the court also entertained arguments by plaintiffs that the city response to recent permit applications had violated the preliminary injunction,and that the city second draft ordinance failed to address some of their core complaints regarding,for example,the city assessment of fees and costs.the court denied the city motion to dismiss,finding that,because the city had merely repealed chapter but had yet to adopt any procedures to take its place,the action was not moot.the court also indicated that the city had violated the injunction.after the court denied the city motion to dismiss,the city consented to the injunction,and the court therefore continued the preliminary injunction in effect with certain modifications agreed to by the parties.
following the february hearing,the district court retained jurisdiction over the case,continued the injunction and supervised the parties meet and confer process until the city enacted a new ordinance and implementing regulations which,the parties agreed,complied with the constitution.that process proved to be a protracted one.the city presented further drafts of its revised ordinance which,plaintiffs argued,continued to include certain provisions which would violate the district court injunction and the constitution.although plaintiffs briefed and argued those contentions before the court,the city never pressed the court to reach a judgment on the merits of any of plaintiffs claims it eventually acceded to each.ultimately,in early,the city passed a new ordinance and implementing regulations which satisfied all of plaintiffs concerns.at that point the court lifted the injunction and closed the case with the agreement of the parties.
thereafter,papv filed a motion for attorneys fees under.the court concluded that plaintiffs were the prevailing party and ordered the city to pay attorneys fees and costs totaling.the city now appeals the court fee award.
the district court had jurisdiction over this action pursuant to and.this court has appellate jurisdiction pursuant to over the district court order awarding attorneys fees to plaintiffs.
we exercise plenary review over legal issues relating to the appropriate standard under which to evaluate an application for attorneys fees.ex rel.orange twp.bd.of,cir.we review the reasonableness of the district court award of attorneys fees for abuse of discretion.county of morris nationalist movement,cir.
the city contends that the district court erred when it found that plaintiffs were the prevailing party in this litigation.accordingly,we must first decide whether,under the circumstances of this case,prevailing party status can be predicated on plaintiffs having secured the preliminary injunction.the city also challenges the reasonableness of the district court fee award 
under the american rule,parties to litigation are to pay their own attorneys fees,absent statutory authority and a court order providing otherwise.buckhannon bd.and care home,west virginia dep of health and human resources,d.in civil rights cases,congress has provided such authorization courts may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee.b.pursuant to this authority,the prevailing party in such cases is normally awarded attorneys fees,absent special circumstances.truesdell philadelphia hous,cir county of morris nationalist movement,cir 
parties are considered prevailing parties if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefits the parties sought in bringing suit.ex rel.orange twp.bd.of,cir quoting hensley eckerhart,d internal quotation marks omitted.to succeed under this standard,a party must achieve a change in the legal relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.buckhannon,at.quoting texas state teachers ass garland indep.sch,d.therefore,courts may not award fees based on a catalyst theory a plaintiff does not become a prevailing party solely because his lawsuit causes a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.in that situation,the change in legal relationship lacks the requisite judicial imprimatur.id.at.
the supreme court recently held that securing temporary relief in the form of a preliminary injunction does not make the plaintiff a prevailing party for purposes of if the plaintiff ultimately loses on the merits.sole wyner,d.success achieved in a preliminary injunction,the court explained,does not render a party prevailing if that success is ultimately reversed,dissolved,or otherwise undone by the final decision in the same case.id.at.however,sole expressly reserved for another day the issue presented in this case whether,in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent injunctive relief,success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.id.at.
the supreme court affirmed in buckhannon that litigation need not progress to a final judgment on the merits for a fee award to be proper.for example,a settlement agreement enforced through a consent decree can serve as the basis for an award of attorneys fees in an appropriate situation.buckhannon,at.see also ex rel.clementon bd.of,cir truesdell,at cir.however,r espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claims before he can be said to prevail.buckhannon,at.similarly,this court has held that stay put orders which merely serve to maintain the status quo pendente lite do not afford meaningful relief on the merits of the underlying claims and will not suffice.john ex rel.paul.county intermediate unit,cir ex rel,at.
although this court has never had occasion to decide whether relief on the merits achieved in the form of a preliminary injunction can confer prevailing party status,nearly every court of appeals to have addressed the issue has held that relief obtained via a preliminary injunction can,under appropriate circumstances,render a party prevailing.we agree.moreover,we conclude that this case involves appropriate circumstances.
this is a case in which the trial court,based upon a finding of a likelihood of plaintiffs success on the merits,entered a judicially enforceable order granting plaintiffs virtually all the relief they sought,thereby materially altering the legal relationship between the parties the defendant,after opposing interim relief,chose not to appeal from that order and remained subject to its restrictions for a period of over two years and the defendant ultimately avoided final resolution of the merits of plaintiffs case by enacting new legislation giving plaintiffs virtually all of the relief sought in the complaint.in these circumstances,we conclude that the district court did not err in finding plaintiffs to be a prevailing party for purposes of b.
a preliminary injunction issued by a judge carries all of the judicial imprimatur necessary to satisfy buckhannon,watson,at and this preliminary injunction placed a judicial imprimatur on plaintiffs entitlement to substantially all the relief they sought in the complaint.this was not a case where the filing of the lawsuit resulted in voluntary change on the part of the city.it was precisely because the court believed voluntary change was not to be expected that it ordered the city not to engage in the practices of which plaintiffs complained.there was nothing voluntary about the city giving up those practices.and the preliminary injunction was not dissolved for lack of entitlement.id.rather,it was terminated only when the new statute was enacted after the preliminary injunction had done its job.id.the ultimate mooting of plaintiffs claims resulted not solely from the filing of the lawsuit but from the results of the legal process.see,select milk producers,at watson,at dupuy,at dubuc,at.
the city resists this conclusion,arguing that the district court preliminary injunction was akin to a order which did not address the merits of plaintiffs claims plaintiffs achieved success in this litigation only through the city voluntary actions and plaintiffs could not have prevailed in the process of drafting a new ordinance because those proceedings were superfluous and plaintiffs did not specifically request such relief in their complaint.we are not persuaded.
at the initial hearings in this case,plaintiffs achieved much of the relief they sought in this lawsuit.the district court ruled that chapter was facially unconstitutional it issued temporary injunctive relief preventing the city from enforcing that ordinance and from continuing specific challenged practices until the city passed an adequate ordinance and it directed the city to submit its proposed revision to the court and to confer with plaintiffs regarding the constitutionality of its proposal.unlike in john ex rel.paul,at,the court tro and preliminary injunction in this case did not simply maintain the status quo.rather,the injunction afforded plaintiffs virtually all of the substantive relief they sought,albeit initially on an interim basis.much like in select milk producers,at,the court orders prevented plaintiffs from being forced to operate under an unlawful fundamental goal they sought.see also watson,at discussing williams alioto,cir.the preliminary injunction,therefore,did not merely maintain the status quo it altered the legal relationship among the parties in a manner that afforded plaintiffs substantial relief on the merits of their claims.
while preliminary injunctions by their nature constitute provisional relief,this case is unlike sole.at,where the initial relief plaintiffs achieved under the court injunction proved to be fleeting.it is also unlike dupuy,at,where the fee award was premature because further proceedings on the merits of the injunction were clearly contemplated.in this case,plaintiffs achieved precisely what they sought on an enduring permanent demise of the challenged ordinance,and in its place a system that satisfied plaintiffs goals.when the city ultimately passed a new ordinance and implementing regulations which satisfied plaintiffs demands,the court closed the case with the agreement of the parties at that point,plaintiffs victories were no longer subject to reconsideration on the merits in this case.the fact that plaintiffs achieved their success by litigating and enforcing a preliminary injunction rather than by proceeding to final judgment on the merits does not diminish the substance of th
