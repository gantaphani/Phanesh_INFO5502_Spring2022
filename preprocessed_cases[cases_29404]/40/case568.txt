background 
public school experience and private school placement 
the following undisputed facts are drawn from the record on appeal.is a child with a disability under the idea.she spent her year in a public school operated by the department.at the school,she was placed in a collaborative team teaching class,which included general and special education students and which was taught by both a general and a special education teacher.the department also provided with special education itinerant teachers seits.
academically,made progress throughout the school year and performed at or approaching grade level in all subjects.but at a certain point schoolmates bullied her so severely that she came home crying and complained to her parents about the bullying on a near daily basis.three seits testified that her classmates constantly bullied her.one seit even described the classroom as a hostile environment for.a pediatrician found that the minimal interactions had with her classmates were mostly negative.
the witnesses supported these generalized assessments by describing specific instances of bullying.in may and november one student pinched hard enough to cause a bruise and stomped on her toes.her classmates ostracized her,backing away from her to avoid touching her.in one instance,they refused to touch a pencil,treating it as contaminated merely because had touched it.at other times they pushed away tripped her laughed at her and called her ugly,stupid,and fat.one student drew a demeaning picture of her and another made a prank phone call to her home.
teachers appear to have done little to stop the bullying.for example,when classmates refused to touch the pencil that she had touched,one of her classroom teachers foolishly reinforced their behavior by labeling the pencil with name,purportedly because of poor hygiene.when was tripped,a teacher berated for making a scene.two of seits explained that the classroom teachers ignored their concerns about l.bullying.the pediatrician observed that l.teachers neither intervened nor punished the students who bullied her.
it appears from the record that the bullying affected academic and development.her father described her as emotionally unavailable to learn as a result of the bullying,and his assessment was supported by other facts in the record.was late to school sixteen times in the spring semester due,the plaintiffs claim,to her fear of interacting with her classmates.she brought dolls to school for support.one of her seits reported that bullying negatively affected ability to initiate,concentrate,attend and stay on task with her homework assignments and activities after school.she volunteered less in class.and she counted the days until the end of the school year,when she might temporarily escape her tormentors.
plaintiffs several attempts to raise the issue of bullying with school were consistently rebuffed.without avail,they requested copies of any incident reports involving harassment of.they wrote to teachers and administrators about bullying,but received no response.the school stonewalling continued even during the process of developing iep,which is the central mechanism by which the idea ensures that states comply with its provisions.at a meeting on march,to develop behavior intervention plan a plan to be used in developing the iep,parents attempted to raise the bullying issue,but the school principal,without explanation,flatly refused to discuss the issue with them.joint app x.and at the iep team meeting on june,parents tried to revisit the bullying issue,but school officials again refused to discuss bullying,contending that it was an inappropriate topic to consider when developing iep.
plaintiffs decided to place in a private school rather than risk another year of bullying.on march,prior to the development of behavior intervention plan or iep,plaintiffs signed an enrollment contract with the summit school summit,a private school for students classified as learning disabled they also made a tuition payment to summit to reserve seat for the following school year.on june,two days after the development of iep,plaintiffs notified the department that they were rejecting iep in favor of a private placement.
ii.procedural history 
later in june plaintiffs started a new york state administrative action seeking reimbursement for tuition for summit,arguing,among other things,that the department violated the idea by refusing to discuss their concerns about bullying.they lost at both levels of administrative review first before the initial hearing officer iho and then before the state review officer sro.
plaintiffs next appealed to the united states district court for the eastern district of new york weinstein.concluding that students have the right to be secure in school and that significant,unremedied bullying could constitute the denial of a fape,the district court developed a test to determine whether bullying resulted in the denial of a fape was the student a victim of bullying did the school have notice of substantial bullying of the student was the school deliberately indifferent to the bullying,or did it fail to take reasonable steps to prevent the bullying and did the bullying substantially restrict the student educational opportunities d.the court remanded the case to the iho to consider plaintiffs claims under that test.plaintiffs again lost before the iho and the sro and again appealed to the district court,which granted summary judgment in plaintiffs favor among other things,the district court held that the department refusal to permit plaintiffs to discuss bullying in the development of iep violated the idea.d.because the district court also held that summit was an appropriate placement and that the equities favored reimbursement,it entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs.
the department timely appealed.
discussion 
in this appeal,we consider principally whether the department denied a fape by refusing to discuss bullying with her parents despite their reasonable concern that the severe bullying that endured could prevent her from receiving a fape.we hold that the department denied a fape by refusing to discuss an issue that,as we note below,it acknowledges may substantially interfere with a child learning opportunities.because plaintiffs have also met their burden to show that their choice of private placement for was appropriate and because the equities favor reimbursement of their private school tuition,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
