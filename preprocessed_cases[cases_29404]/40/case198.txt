this case arises out of a government investigation in six judicial districts into allegations that overseas shipholding group,osg had for years engaged in the practice of discharging oil from its vessels in american waters and falsifying mandatory ship records to conceal the discharges,in violation of the act to prevent pollution from ships apps,a.
in september of,barroso worked aboard the pacific ruby the pacific ruby,a tanker ship owned and operated by osg.on september,barroso telephoned the united states coast guard on behalf of himself and three crew members including altura,all filipino nationals the texas whistleblowers.barroso reported that he had observed the chief engineer illegally bypassing the ship oil pollution prevention equipment.barroso told the coast guard that the four men were willing to testify against osg.based on barroso report,the coast guard conducted two boardings of the ship.the four texas whistleblowers provided information that supported the allegations of illegal activity by osg.
a grand jury investigation was commenced in the eastern district of texas in late.a magistrate judge appointed separate counsel for each whistleblower from the district criminal justice act cja panel.on october,hawthorn was appointed to represent barroso,and another lawyer,bill harris harris,was appointed to represent altura.the scope of the representation in each case was to determine whether the client was a target or subject of a criminal investigation,to advise him of his fifth amendment rights,and to assist him in his appearance before the grand jury and during interviews with the government.
based on the texas whistleblowers testimony,in august of,the chief engineer of the pacific ruby,kun yun jho,and osg were indicted in the eastern district of texas on charges of conspiracy under,false statements under,and violations under apps,a.the apps case against osg was then expanded to include a dozen osg ships involved in oil dumping incidents in five other judicial districts,including the district of massachusetts.twelve whistleblowers in total provided information as to the incidents that formed the basis for the charges in the six districts.
the apps,a,provides that i n the discretion of the court,an amount equal to not more than of a criminal apps fine may be paid to the person giving information leading to conviction.in november and december of,government counsel informed hawthorn that barroso might be eligible for a monetary whistleblower award under the apps.as a result,hawthorn learned for the first time that his client might receive an award.however,on december,the eastern district of texas dismissed the apps counts against osg and the government appealed.see united states kun yun jho overseas shipholding grp,d on december,the government announced an agreement covering the six districts in which osg was under investigation,including the district of massachusetts and the eastern district of texas with respect to the cases other than the texas case,the agreement specified that the parties would recommend that the five cases be consolidated in massachusetts for plea and sentencing.osg agreed to plead guilty to representative apps counts in each of the five cases.under the terms of the agreement,osg would pay a total monetary fine of million,of which million was allocated to apps violations.the agreement also provided that if the fifth circuit reversed the texas dismissal of the three apps counts,osg would plead guilty to those counts as well and a fine under the apps of million would be imposed.if not,osg would instead plead guilty in the eastern district of texas to three additional counts of making false statements in violation of.the agreement left open the possibility that an additional fine would be imposed in the texas proceeding.the agreement contemplated that a single plea and sentencing proceeding for the five cases would be scheduled in the massachusetts district court in the near future,at which time that court would consider whistleblower awards.
on january,hawthorn sent barroso an email in which he informed barroso of the plea agreement and that he might be eligible for a whistleblower award.hawthorn added that he could represent barroso in pursuing any legal rights he might have to a whistleblower award,but that his representation would be separate from his representation.the email stated that despite the dismissal in the eastern district of texas,hawthorn thought that barroso could still be compensated in the massachusetts proceeding,but that the possibility of recovery was uncertain.because barroso was indigent,hawthorn proposed representation on a contingent fee basis whereby he would receive of whatever award barroso received.a proposed contingent fee agreement was attached.hawthorn also stated that he could not begin working for barroso on the whistleblower award matter until hawthorn received a signed copy of the agreement.barroso responded,stating that he needed to discuss the matter with the other three whistleblowers with whom he was associated.
on january,the five pending cases other than the texas case were consolidated and the plea and sentencing hearings were set for march,in boston.on march,government counsel contacted hawthorn,along with the lawyers for the other whistleblowers to advise them of the potential availability of the apps awards in the massachusetts case.on march,government counsel informed hawthorn that the government was considering filing a motion in support of an award.that same day,since hawthorn was not familiar with whistleblower proceedings,he asked government counsel for a sample of a motion filed on behalf of whistleblowers in other cases.the government provided hawthorn with a sample motion filed by the government in another case.
on march,altura contacted hawthorn by email,introducing himself and requesting that hawthorn represent him in the upcoming whistleblower action on the same contingency terms that hawthorn had proposed to barroso,stating i would gladly appreciate if you could represent me in a legal matter concerning any claim from the pacific ruby incident.gov t suppl.app x.he explained that he was having trouble reaching his attorney harris in the criminal case,stating that i want to inform you that since i joined this vessel i have heard from bill harris.that why i decided to ask you if you could represent myself.id.at.hawthorn did not attempt to contact altura attorney nor did he contact the texas district court.hawthorn altura the fee agreement along with a conflict of interest waiver.altura signed the fee agreement,which hawthorn had dated march.on march,barroso agreed to a fee agreement as well.hawthorn advised both altura and barroso of a possible conflict of interest in representing both in the same matter,and they waived any conflicts of interest stemming from the joint representation.
on march and,the government filed motions for whistleblower awards in the massachusetts proceeding,detailing the contributions of all of the whistleblowers,the four whistleblowers in the texas case and the eight whistleblowers in the other cases and recommending that the court award to each whistleblower.the government asked that the court award equal sums to each of the whistleblowers involved in the consolidated cases as well as to the whistleblowers involved in the eastern district of texas case because the contributions of the twelve whistleblowers to the overall outcome of the case were roughly equal.this recommendation was made even though the whistleblowers from the texas case,including barroso and altura,were not witnesses in any of the five cases consolidated in the district of massachusetts and there had been no apps conviction in the eastern district of texas.
on march,osg filed a response to the government whistleblower motion,stating that though it did not oppose the government motion,it was concerned about a grant of awards to the whistleblowers in the texas case.osg argued that any apps awards to those individuals should be administered by the district court in texas.on march,the government replied,explaining that because the four texas whistleblowers contributed to the successful overall resolution of the case against osg,the massachusetts district court had discretion to issue awards to them.that same day,hawthorn filed a memorandum responding to osg,and arguing that barroso and altura deserved awards because they contributed to osg plea of guilty in the consolidated case.hawthorn also pointed out that all of the apps counts that were pending in the eastern district of texas had been dismissed and as it currently stood,there were no awards to be administered by that court.he argued that even if the dismissal were overturned,altura and barroso would receive less in the eastern district of texas as the total amount of the fine there would be less than the fine from the consolidated cases,even though barroso and altura contributed to the overall result.
the plea and sentencing hearing was held on march.in accordance with the plea agreement,the district court imposed a fine of million for apps violations.under the statute of the total was available for awards to whistleblowers.at the hearing,osg argued that the texas whistleblowers should not receive whistleblower awards.the government urged the district court to award fees to all twelve whistleblowers.the court then voiced a modest reservation about issuing awards to the texas whistleblowers.gov t suppl.app x.the court heard from hawthorn,who argued for an award to barroso and altura.the district court then concluded it would make the whistleblower awards as proposed by the government.on may,the court issued an order authorizing awards of to each of the twelve whistleblowers,and further ordered that any proposed legal fees in excess of for legal services performed in connection with the granting of the whistleblower awards in this case,must be approved by the court after notice to the government.united states overseas shipholding.may,order concerning whistleblower awards.
on august,hawthorn filed a motion for approval of attorney fees in which he sought to receive one third of the whistleblower awards to barroso and altura,for a total of in legal fees.no other counsel for the whistleblowers sought approval for a fee in excess of.barroso and altura did not object to hawthorn fees at the time.the government opposed hawthorn request on the ground that the fees were unethically excessive.
the district court referred the matter of hawthorn fee request to a magistrate judge for a recommendation.on april,after conducting an evidentiary hearing,the magistrate judge issued a memorandum and order finding that hawthorn requested fees were unethically excessive,and recommending reducing the fees to for each client for a total of,a figure that represented the outer limit of reasonableness.united states overseas shipholding,d,opinion of magistrate judge quotations omitted.however,the magistrate judge requested that the district court for the eastern district of texas determine whether it would violate that court cja plan if hawthorn were to receive a contingent fee for representing barroso in the whistleblower matter.the eastern district of texas eventually advised that hawthorn contingent fee agreement with barroso did not violate the terms of the cja plan.the magistrate judge adopted this ruling 
on december,the district court adopted the magistrate recommendation in part.united states overseas shipholding,d.the court held that the award for legal services to both men approach es,if not exceed s,the limits of reasonable compensation under the circumstances,but stated that it would defer to the magistrate judge in setting the baseline figure.id.at.in the following discussion,we refer to the portions of the magistrate recommendation adopted by the district court as the district court decision.
however,the district court sua sponte further held that because altura may still have been represented by harris in the same matter at the time that hawthorn sent him a contingent fee agreement,and because altura may not have fully understood his legal interests,hawthorn violated the spirit,if not the letter,of two,and perhaps three,attorney disciplinary rules,namely.prof concerning communications with represented persons,b prohibiting legal advice to potentially conflicted persons,and b prohibiting solicitation of professional employment from impaired persons.id.at.the district court accordingly disallowed the awarded to hawthorn for services rendered to altura.
hawthorn timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
hawthorn first argues that the district court lacked the authority to adjudicate the propriety of the contingent fee agreements because neither barroso nor altura objected.hawthorn posits that there was never any case or controversy to be decided,and that accordingly the district court lacked jurisdiction.see,moore bd.of,d finding no case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution where both litigants desire d precisely the same result.hawthorn argument is premised on the fifth circuit holding in brown watkins motor lines,cir.in brown,the fifth circuit held that where the parties agreed to the fee arrangement there was no case or controversy,and that the district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the amount to be paid to the plaintiff lawyer.id.
we disagree with brown,and its approach has been previously rejected by this court.it is that a district court has inherent authority to supervise the conduct of attorneys that appear before it.see united states klubock,cir en banc.both this court and other courts of appeals have held that this supervisory authority encompasses the power to assess the fairness of attorney fee agreements,including contingent fee arrangements.see,bos.me.sheehan,phinney,bass green,cir contingent fees are,of course,of special concern to courts and are subject to strict judicial supervision.farmington dowel prods.forster,cir farmington dowel i this is so because c ourts have a stake in attorney fees contracts the fairness of the terms reflects directly on the court and its bar.rosquist soo line,cir.thus,a court has a particular interest in assuring itself that it is not an unwitting accessory to an excessive fee.farmington dowel i,at.
as this court explained in farmington dowel i,courts generally are not without power to modify excessive fee arrangements.farmington dowel i,at.while a court is not obligated in every case to ask whether a fee arrangement provides for excessive fees,a court may in its discretion inquire into such issue,particularly when it is brought to the court attention.id.further,this supervisory power is not dependent on whether a party challenges a fee arrangement.to the contrary,it seems clear that the court power to prevent excessive fees must be operative regardless of the arrangement by which the fee is obtained.id.at.thus,whether a client objects to a fee arrangement is relevant to whether the fee is excessive,but it is not controlling,for the object of the court concern is not only a particular party but the conformance of the legal profession to its own high standards of fairness.id.at.we conclude that the district court had the authority to review the fee agreements even though the clients did not object at the time.
we review the district court exercise of its supervisory authority for abuse of discretion.see de jesus nazario morris rodriguez,cir ramos colon sec y of health human,cir.
unlike awards under the statutes,where fees are normally limited to reasonable compensation,fee awards stemming from privately negotiated attorney fees agreements are reviewed deferentially.the court may exercise its supervisory power to reduce a fee only in exceptional circumstances.sargeant sharp,cir.thus,if the court finds that an agreement provides for an unethically excessive fee,it may sparingly exercise its supervisory powers over the bar to limit the amount the attorney may actually receive.id.at.the power to review fees pursuant to an agreement is not limited to situations in which the fee is ethically excessive at the inception but extends to situations in which the unreasonableness is due to factors that occur after the fee arrangement is made.mckenzie,at.
while we do not think the fee here was ethically excessive,the court supervisory power is not limited to the situation in which the fees are ethically excessive.courts can limit the fee on the ground that it exceeds the outer limit of reasonableness even if it is not ethically excessive.mckenzie,at cir green nevers,cir.in these circumstances,the court is determining whether the fee has resulted in such an enrichment at the expense of the client that it offends a court sense of fundamental fairness and equity.mckenzie,at.a fee can exceed the outer limit of reasonableness without necessarily being so clearly excessive as to justify a finding of a breach of ethics.id.at green,at.
although limitations on fees should only be imposed in exceptional circumstances,they are particularly appropriate in situations such as this where awarding an excessive fee to the attorney would itself undermine the objectives of the federal statutory scheme.the whole purpose of the discretionary award to whistleblowers under this statute is to create incentives for the whistleblower to take risks that may disadvantage the whistleblower in his relationship to his employer.the amount of the fee that will be siphoned off by the lawyer significantly affects the size of that award and the power of the incentive.the court in administering this statute is obligated to ensure his excessive legal fees will not diminish the statutory incentive.
in determining whether an attorney fee is clearly excessive,this court has held that courts should consider a variety of factors to determine the outer limit of reasonableness 
the time and labor required,the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the necessary skill level 
whether work on the case would preclude the attorney performing other work 
the customary charges of the bar for similar services 
the amount involved in the controversy 
the contingency or the certainty of the compensation and 
the character of the employment,whether casual or for an established and constant client.
farmington dowel i,at.adopting factors listed in farmington dowel prods.forster,for the purposes of determining whether a fee is excessive,the fee arrangement should be viewed to some extent according to the circumstances in which it was made.see also bos.me,at to deny a fee because it exceeds time charges and looks high in hindsight would penalize an attorney for a job well done emphasis in original.however,a court may nonetheless consider factors such as complexity of problems,quality of work,and results obtained.farmington dowel prods.forster,cir farmington dowel ii see also mckenzie,at.
hawthorn contends that the district court applied an improper standard in evaluating the fee agreements.there is no merit to the contention that the district court improperly applied the criteria from the statutes which look to the reasonableness of the fee.the magistrate judge opinion explicitly rejected that standard,noting that the court is applying the more deferential standard applicable to contingent fee agreements rather than the reasonable compensation standard applicable to determining fee awards pursuant to fee shifting statutes.see overseas shipholding,d at.the magistrate judge opinion,adopted in this respect by the district court,also looked to the pertinent factors as set forth in farmington dowel.there is no requirement that all of the listed factors be explicitly considered,especially when not appropriate to the particular case,and we have clearly stated that it can be appropriate to consider additional factors.see farmington dowel i,at.
the district court factual findings are,of course,reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard.cumpiano banco santander puerto rico,cir.we see no error in the district court findings with respect to the specific factors.
first,there was no clear error in finding that the time and labor actually expended were not significant.see overseas shipholding,d at.the record reflects that hawthorn performed little or no substantive work on the whistleblower claims until approximately one week before the sentencing hearing on march.hawthorn was contacted by altura on march,and received the signed agreement from him the same day.hawthorn did not receive the signed agreement from barroso until march,and represented in an email to barroso that he could not begin work on the whistleblower award matter until he received a signed agreement.between march,and the sentencing hearing on march,a period of only days,hawthorn worked on a memorandum during parts of two days.on march,he traveled to boston and met with local counsel concerning the sentencing hearing.on march,he argued at the sentencing hearing.hawthorn maintained below that he devoted a significant amount of time to communicating with his clients in order to prepare his arguments.however,the district court rejected this claim as implausible.overseas shipholding,d at see overseas shipholding,d at nn.
second,there was no clear error in finding that there was no significant risk that substantial additional time and effort might be required.hawthorn contends that there was a possibility of a hearing pursuant to miller united states,cir.in miller,the fourth circuit held that where individuals had monetary claims pursuant to a whistleblower provision of the refuse act,the due process clause of the fifth amendment guaranteed those individuals the right to confront and to adverse witnesses,the right to participate in the proceedings by counsel and to adduce relevant,admissible evidence in their own behalf,and the right to a decision based upon evidence adduced at such a hearing.miller,at.even if we were to assume that miller was correctly decided and that it applied to the whistleblower provision of the apps both dubious propositions,there was no showing that at the time the agreements were executed hawthorn intended to request a hearing in the massachusetts proceeding.
indeed,the evidence is to the contrary.hawthorn march,correspondence with the government,which took place shortly before the agreements were executed on march and,shows that he intended to largely piggyback on the government efforts and that he was aware that substantial effort on his part would not be required.in that correspondence,he asked the government for a sample motion in support of a whistleblower award,which he received and used to prepare his motion.he also noted that he would wait until the government had filed its sentencing memorandum before he filed his,stating i trust you would set forth everything fairly and accurately because your knowledge of the case is substantially greater than mine.overseas shipholding,at.hawthorn january email to barroso stated that i expect expenses to be minimal.id.at.this statement is strong evidence that a proceeding was not anticipated.there is no error in the district court finding that as of the time when hawthorn executed the contracts with barroso and altura,hawthorn must have known that he did not face depositions,discovery or a protracted trial and that he should have been aware that his efforts would be limited to filing a sentencing memorandum and presenting an argument at sentencing.id.at.
hawthorn also argues that there was a possibility of significantly more work under the agreements as both agreements provided that hawthorn would represent barroso and altura in the event of an appeal.even if we were to assume that barroso and altura had a right to appeal the denial of a mass
