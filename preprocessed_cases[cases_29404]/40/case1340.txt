the question here is whether section i of the national voter registration act nvra,which requires public disclosure of all records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters,i,applies to completed voter registration applications.the district court concluded that section i does apply to such applications and held that defendants virginia election officials had violated the nvra by refusing to disclose the completed applications with voters social security numbers redacted.because the district court correctly interpreted section i,we now affirm the judgment.
plaintiff project for america,project vote is a nonprofit organization seeking to increase voter registration among young,and minority voters.this suit arose after project vote learned that students at norfolk state university,a historically african american college,experienced problems in registering to vote in the november primary and general elections in virginia.in particular,project vote worried that the students registration applications had been erroneously rejected by the norfolk general registrar,defendant elisa long,who is responsible for processing voter registration applications.
on may,a project vote affiliate advancement project requested that registrar long make available for inspection and copying the completed voter registration applications of any individual who timely submitted an application at any time from january,through october,who was not registered to vote in time for the november,general election,as well as documents identifying the reasons the applications were rejected.the request was made pursuant to nvra section i,which provides 
each state shall maintain for at least years and shall make available for public inspection and,where available,photocopying at a reasonable cost,all records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters,except to the extent that such records relate to a declination to register to vote or to the identity of a voter registration agency through which any particular voter is registered.
i.registrar long responded to the request on may,indicating that she would not allow inspection or copying of the requested materials.martha brissette,an attorney and policy analyst with the virginia state board of elections vsbe,then emailed advancement project in support of long refusal.
on may,representatives from project vote and advancement project visited registrar long office in person and repeated their request,which was again refused.accordingly,the organizations wrote to the secretary of the vsbe,giving notice that registrar long was allegedly violating nvra section i and requesting remedial measures.on september,vsbe forwarded to project vote and advancement project an informal opinion of the attorney general of virginia.the opinion concluded that the completed voter registration application of any individual is not a part of the record of the implementation of programs and activities conducted for the purposes of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters covered by the public disclosure provision.to date,defendants have not disclosed the requested records.
project vote filed a complaint against registrar long and the secretary of the vsbe on february,alleging violations of section i and asking the court to require disclosure of the requested materials.defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,asserting that project vote lacked standing to sue under the nvra and that section i does not mandate public access to completed voter registration applications.the district court denied defendants motion on october.the court concluded that plaintiff had standing and that the common and ordinary meaning of the terms of section i encompass voter registration applications,as these records concern the implementation of programs and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters.project for america,long,d,quoting i.
project vote then moved for summary judgment.defendants opposed the motion,reasserting their original arguments and also claiming that the district court interpretation of the nvra was incompatible with two other federal statutes,the help america vote act hava,et,and the military and overseas voter empowerment move act,et.on july,the district court entered final judgment in favor of project vote.rejecting defendants arguments based on hava and the move act,the court concluded that nvra section i grants the plaintiff access to completed voter registration applications with the voters social security numbers redacted for inspection and photocopying.project for america,long,d.the court subsequently stayed its judgment pending this appeal.see.
the nvra reflects the view of congress that the right to vote is a fundamental right,that government has a duty to promote the exercise of that right,and that discriminatory and unfair registration laws can have a damaging effect on voter participation and disproportionately harm voter participation by various groups,including racial minorities.a.congress enacted the nvra in order to increase the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in federal elections,enhance the participation of eligible citizens as voters,protect the integrity of the electoral process,and ensure that accurate and current voter registration rolls are maintained.id.b.
the nvra directs states to establish at least three methods of voter registration for federal elections by application made simultaneously with an application for a motor vehicle driver license,by mail application using a federally prescribed form,and by application in person at designated voter registration agencies.id.a.it further requires that states conduct a general program to remove ineligible voters from official voter lists without engaging in improper voter removal.id.a.
finally,as explained above,section i of the nvra mandates public disclosure of voter registration activities.id.i.it generally requires states to make available for public inspection and,where available,photocopying at a reasonable cost,all records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters.id.this language embodies congress conviction that americans who are eligible under law to vote have every right to exercise their franchise,a right that must not be sacrificed to administrative chicanery,oversights,or inefficiencies.under the district court interpretation,this provision mandates disclosure of the records requested by project vote.
we begin by considering the commonwealth argument that the text of section i does not require public disclosure of completed voter registration applications.this issue of statutory interpretation is one that we review de novo.united states ide,cir.the starting point for any issue of statutory interpretation is of course the language of the statute itself.united states bly,cir.w hen the words of a statute are unambiguous,this first canon is also the last and judicial inquiry is complete.willenbring united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
appellants assert that t he plain and ordinary meaning of section i does not encompass voter applications,much less the rejected applications initially sought.appellants br.at.instead,they claim,the programs and activities referred to in section i of the nvra are programs and activities related to the purging of voters from the list of registered voters.id.at.
contrary to appellants insistence,the plain language of section i does not allow us to treat its disclosure requirement as limited to voter removal records.as the district court concluded,completed voter registration applications are clearly records concerning the implementation of programs and activities conducted for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy and currency of official lists of eligible voters.i.
