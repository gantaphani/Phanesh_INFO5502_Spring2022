opinion of the court 
this diversity action requires us to decide under pennsylvania law whether a subcontractor may recover against a school district for a claim of unjust enrichment.the case involves a dispute over unpaid services between the subcontractor wayne moving storage of new jersey wayne moving and the appellants the school district of philadelphia and the school reform commission collectively,school district.wayne moving sued the school district under a theory of unjust enrichment for unpaid moving services.the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania granted wayne moving motion for summary judgment and awarded it plus interest.on appeal,the school district contends that wayne moving claim of unjust enrichment is barred by section of the pennsylvania public school code,which applies to contracts of any kind.stat.ann.appellants maintain that contracts of any kind include those contracts implied by courts in unjust enrichment claims.we agree and hold that those acts of the school district not in compliance with the provisions of section are rendered void and unenforceable,and can not bind the school district under an implied contract of unjust enrichment.we further hold that the school district is not equitably estopped from relying on section.
for the following reasons,we conclude that the district court denial of the school district motion for summary judgment was in error.accordingly,we will reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of wayne moving and remand for entry of summary judgment for the school district.
wayne moving subcontracted with facility strategies,a professional relocation consultant,to provide moving services for the school district.the moving project dates back to when frank siefert,the special assistant to the commission,suggested consolidating the school district five administrative office buildings into one central location.on august,the school reform commission approved the purchase of north broad street to serve as the new school district headquarters.on june,the commission authorized the school district to enter into a contract for moving services in an amount not to exceed million.
facility strategies and wayne moving submitted a proposal for just under the million authorized amount.on september,facility strategies entered into a subcontract agreement with wayne moving for an amount not to exceed,and on september,facility strategies and the school district entered into a contract for an amount not to exceed.
the move into north broad street encountered numerous difficulties involving elevators,unanticipated work,and delays due to the school district disputes with a third party.the move was scheduled to begin in january of,and facility strategies and wayne moving contracted to complete the move by september.but it did not begin until april and most of the moving occurred in the final month before the deadline.
as a result of the delays,the project incurred additional expenses.sallyann ferullo,president of facility strategies,inquired of frank siefert at the school district as to what should be done about the additional expenses.siefert told her,according to ferullo testimony,d o worry,just document it.as long as we have documentation we take care of it at the end.wayne moving storage of school dist.of,wl,at.ferullo then inquired as to whether facility strategies and wayne moving should stop working.siefert,according to ferullo testimony,responded,oh no you got to finish.we got to finish.id.ferullo stated that she would get it done.whatever it takes.id.
two invoices and an extra work order are at issue.ferullo submitted an extra work order to the school district on september,for.siefert approved the extra work order and,according to the school district,was under the impression that the project was still within the million budget the work order only included cost estimates and the order was approved only on a basis.the district court did not find otherwise.id.at.
facility strategies submitted an invoice on october,for part of the work performed in september.in a cover letter,ferullo informed siefert that facility strategies received additional invoices from wayne moving and that the project was over the contracted amount by.ferullo also stated that she had yet to receive invoices from the last week of september,the most intensive week of work.id.at.she went on to note that o nce all of the invoices have been received,it is my understanding that you will need to go before the school reform commission for the additional funding.id.but ferullo expressed confidence that the remaining expenses will come within the projections that we discussed in the itemized extra work order.id.the school district paid facility strategies after receiving the invoice,and facility strategies subsequently paid wayne moving the full contracted amount.
facility strategies submitted a final invoice to the school district on december,for,which included for the extra work performed by wayne moving.wayne moving argued that the additional expenses were due to the expanded scope of work and unanticipated impediments.the district court agreed and found that the in extra work was attributed to the compressed schedule,inoperable or inadequate elevators,and an increased scope of the work to be performed.wayne moving storage of school dist.of,wl,at.regardless,the school district refused to pay because the claimed amount was in excess of the million authorized by the school reform commission.
wayne moving did not submit additional written demands for payment,nor did it file suit against facility strategies.wayne moving,however,did file suit against the school district.
on february,wayne moving filed this lawsuit against the school district in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,asserting claims for unjust enrichment for unpaid moving services in the amount of.on august,the district court denied the school district motion to dismiss the complaint.both parties filed motions for summary judgment,and on january,the district court granted wayne moving motion.
the school district argued that wayne moving claim should be denied for three reasons the prime contract between the school district and facility strategies and the request for proposal signed by wayne moving independently bar wayne moving claim section prohibits unauthorized payment to wayne moving and privity of contract exists between the school district and wayne moving,preventing wayne moving from bringing an unjust enrichment claim,and the unjust enrichment claim rests on disputed facts.the district court held that the provisions of the prime contract were not enforceable against wayne moving because it was not a party to the contract between the school district and facility strategies.with respect to the second argument,the court held that the school district was equitably estopped from relying on section,reasoning that siefert misleadingly told ferullo to order wayne moving to perform the extra work.finally,the court held that wayne moving and the school district were not in privity of contract and that the elements of unjust enrichment were met.under these circumstances,the district court stated,it would be unconscionable and grossly inequitable for the defendants to retain the benefits of additional moving services without paying for them.wayne moving,wl,at.the district court entered a judgment of in unpaid moving services plus in interest in favor of wayne moving.
on october,the school district timely appealed,and it makes the same three arguments on appeal.we only reach the second issue.

we first consider whether section of the pennsylvania public school code bars wayne moving ability to recover from the school district.section states 
the affirmative vote of a majority of all members of the board of school directors in every district,duly recorded,showing how each member voted,shall be required in order to take action on the following subjects 
creating or increasing any indebtedness 
entering into contracts of any kind where the amount involved exceeds one hundred dollars 
failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall render such acts of the board of school directors void and unenforcible.
stat.ann.this provision also applies to any subsequent modifications of a contract that would increase the school district indebtedness under that contract.hazleton area school dist.krasnoff.if section applies,any approval that siefert may have given for additional work is rendered void and unenforcible.
to determine whether section applies,we must examine the status of the relationship between wayne moving and the school district.wayne moving is not arguing that the school district is contractually bound to pay for its services.in that situation,section would apply directly.instead,wayne moving claims that no contractual relationship exists between them and that as a matter of equity the school district must pay for its services.for purposes of our analysis,we assume that there is no express contract between wayne moving and the school district the real issue,then,is whether section applies to implied contracts in cases of unjust enrichment.
before proceeding,we must consider the role of the federal courts in diversity actions.a federal court under erie is bound to follow state law as announced by the highest state court.sheridan ngk metals,cir quoting edwards hovensa,llc,cir.the supreme court of pennsylvania has yet to consider whether section applies to implied contracts.in this instance,w hen the state highest court has not addressed the precise question presented,we must predict how the state highest court would resolve the issue.orson,miramax film,cir citing erie tompkins.w e must consider relevant state precedents,analogous decisions,considered dicta,scholarly works,and any other reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand.covington cont l tire,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.moreover,

we begin our analysis with intermediate state court judgments and grant them significant weight in the absence of an indication that the highest state court would rule otherwise.orson,at quoting bosch estate.in price school district of borough of taylor,the superior court of pennsylvania held that a school board treasurer had no implied claim to compensation because he was not properly appointed by the school board.the court rested its analysis on section 
this section is mandatory and there must be strict compliance with its provisions before any rights can be acquired against a school district.if the statutory methods for the authorization of expenditures are not pursued,a deserving plaintiff can have no recovery,even on claims of quantum meruit,for the statute excludes all equities and implied liabilities.
id.likewise,in re borough of sykesville involved plaintiffs who sued a school district for unpaid work under an implied contract.the superior court of pennsylvania held that the contractors could not recover due to the statutory requirement that all contracts must be authorized by the school board.id.at.regular official action,evidenced by official minutes,is what the statute requires to ground such an action as the present,and because it is a statutory requisition,all equities and implied liabilities are excluded.id.quoting cascade school dist.lewis school,holding that a statute requiring school board approval for the enforcement of a contractual arrangement between school districts barred implied contracts and liabilities.
pennsylvania courts follow the general rule that the pennsylvania commonwealth court articulated in hazleton 
if the party can produce solid proof of the majority approval of the contract,then it may maintain a claim for damages under that contract if the party fails to satisfy this burden of proof,there can be no recovery against the school district,even on claims of quantum meruit 
at citations omitted.while not reaching the issue of whether section applies to implied contracts,the supreme court of pennsylvania has interpreted the requirements of section as mandatory.to permit contracts to be entered into and expenditures made without compliance with the provisions of the act would defeat every object the legislature had in mind in inserting them.yoder luzerne twp.sch,pa holding that section barred a claim for expenses in excess of the authorized contract,even though they were incurred at the direction of school directors.we therefore conclude that the supreme court of pennsylvania would apply section to bar claims arising from implied contracts.
this interpretation is consistent with the plain meaning and policy of the statute.section applies to contracts of any kind.stat.ann.this,we find,includes contracts implied by law.since the statute adoption,the supreme court of pennsylvania has maintained a strict interpretation,which serves to preserve precious money reserved for public education.finding that section covers implied contracts conforms with the general policy of the statute as articulated by the supreme court of pennsylvania 
this statute is a valuable one,intended to compel the expression of each individual member of the school board on a subject in the public education,and this for the very purpose of preventing jobbery,and the exercise of a power,in the conduct of our common schools we are,therefore,not inclined to permit the abrogation of its force and efficiency by a weak construction designed to meet a particular case.
mullen bd.of sch.dirs.of dubois area sch,quotation marks and citation omitted.we may safely predict that the supreme court of pennsylvania would apply section to bar unjust enrichment claims,for we are unaware of any other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.sheridan,at citations omitted.
finding that section applies to claims for unjust enrichment,we must apply it to the facts.section requires school board approval for any services valued above or any subsequent modifications of a contract that would increase the school district indebtedness under the contract.hazleton,a d at.it is undisputed that the school reform commission did not authorize the claimed by wayne moving.therefore,wayne moving claim of unjust enrichment is barred by section.
the district court held that even if section applies to implied contracts,the school district is equitably estopped from relying upon it.under pennsylvania law,equitable estoppel consists of three elements misleading words,conduct,or silence by the party against whom the estoppel is asserted unambiguous proof of reasonable reliance upon the misrepresentation by the party asserting estoppel and the lack of a duty to inquire on the party asserting the estoppel.chester extended care ctr.pennsylvania dep t of pub.welfare.we disagree with the district court and hold that wayne moving has failed to demonstrate the necessary elements of equitable estoppel.
we must first determine whether equitable estoppel can be applied against the commonwealth of pennsylvania or its subdivisions.the district court correctly stated that equitable estoppel can be so applied,even where doing so would violate a statute or ordinance,such as section.wayne moving,wl,at s
