background 
pignataro began working for the port authority as a helicopter pilot in and retired in.the port authority hired chase in and promoted him to helicopter pilot in.because the port authority classified helicopter pilots as professional employees under the flsa,both pignataro and chase were deemed exempt from the overtime provisions of the flsa.in april,pignataro and chase filed a complaint in the district court alleging that they were denied proper overtime pay under the flsa for the previous three years.
on february,the district court held that helicopter pilots are not professional employees under the flsa and granted summary judgment in favor of pignataro and chase on the issue of liability only.on march,the port authority appealed this ruling,but we dismissed the appeal on february,because the district court order was not final.on august,the district court entered a monetary judgment in favor of pignataro and chase,awarding pignataro in unpaid overtime wages plus in prejudgment interest totaling and awarding chase in unpaid overtime wages plus in prejudgment interest totaling.concluding that the port authority violation of the flsa was not willful,the district court award was based on two years of damages,instead of three.

the mandates that if an employee works more than forty hours per week,he must be compensated for overtime hours at a rate at least times the employee regular rate.a.employees who work in a professional capacity,however,are exempt from this rule.a exemptions from the flsa are to be narrowly construed against the employer,and the employer has the burden of establishing an exemption.guthrie lady jane collieries,cir.whether helicopter pilots are exempt professionals is a mixed question of law and fact we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and exercise plenary review over its interpretation and application of the exemption.reich gateway press,cir.
the applicable exemption from the flsa urged here encompasses employees who are determined to be members of the learned professions,as defined by and.an employee status as a learned professional is determined by his or her duties and salary.in order to qualify as a learned professional an employee primary duties must consist of 
w ork requiring knowledge of an advance sic type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction and study,as distinguished from a general academic education and from an apprenticeship,and from training in the performance of routine mental,manual,or physical processes.

while there are additional requirements for learned professional status,namely receipt of compensation exceeding or more per week and duties requiring the exercise of discretion we concern ourselves initially with whether port authority helicopter pilots satisfy the requirements under a.see e.we thus consider what advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction entails,and then examine whether pignataro and chase primary duties required such advanced knowledge.
advanced knowledge is knowledge which can not be attained at the high school level,b,and which has been obtained through prolonged study.the learned professional exemption is available for professions where,in the vast majority of cases,the employee is required to have specific academic training.d.the exemption does not apply to occupations in which the bulk of the employees have acquired their skill by experience.id.an advanced academic degree is a standard if not universal prequisite sic and is,in fact,the best prima facie evidence of professional training.e.the requirement that the employee knowledge be from a field of science or learning serves to distinguish the professions from the mechanical arts where in some instances the knowledge is of a fairly advanced type,but not in a field of science or learning.c.examples of professions included in the learned professional exemption are the fields of law,medicine,nursing,accounting,actuarial computation,engineering,architecture,teaching,various types of physical,chemical,and biological sciences,including pharmacy.e.
although a college or other specific degree may not be per se required to qualify as a learned professional,it is clear that employees must possess knowledge and skill which can not be attained at the high school level and which has been obtained through prolonged study.b.furthermore,some type of degree is required,as opposed to skill acquired through experience.e.
we next examine whether the training and study pignataro and chase were required to complete constitute advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.in order to qualify for their jobs,port authority helicopter pilots must fulfill the following requirements log hours of flying time in helicopters earn a commercial helicopter pilot certificate with a helicopter instrument rating earn a federal aviation administration faa second class medical certificate have knowledge of faa rules and regulations governing helicopter flights and earn a high school diploma or ged.app.in order to earn a commercial certificate,applicants must already hold a private pilot certificate and pass both a knowledge and practical test.the port authority sends helicopter pilots to florida for a training,twice each year.
none of the certifications that helicopter pilots are required to have are academic degrees.helicopter pilots are not required to spend a significant amount of time in a classroom in order to earn their all of the instruction takes place in the air.logging hours,instruction,and passing practical and written tests do not qualify as a prolonged course of specialized instruction and study.while the port authority is correct that helicopter pilots have specialized knowledge and unique skills port authority br,this is not sufficient to qualify under the learned professional exemption because pilots knowledge and skills were acquired through experience and supervised training as opposed to intellectual,academic instruction.the district court reasoned that pilots flight certificates require specialized instruction beyond a high school education,but do not constitute advanced academic degrees.thus,the district court determined that helicopter pilots are merely highly trained technicians and therefore do not qualify as professional employees under the flsa.app.citing martin penn line serv.we agree and conclude that port authority helicopter pilots work does not require advanced knowledge that is customarily acquired from a prolonged course of specialized instruction.we therefore do not reach the issues of whether pignataro and chase were s
