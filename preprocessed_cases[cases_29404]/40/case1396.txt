the commonwealth of virginia,through its alcoholic beverage control board the board,regulates advertisements for alcohol.in this action,educational media company at virginia tech the collegiate times and the cavalier daily,the cavalier daily collectively,the college newspapers argue that two of the board regulations restricting alcohol advertisements.admin.code a b violate their first amendment rights.the district court granted the college newspapers motion for summary judgment,declared both provisions facially unconstitutional,and permanently enjoined their enforcement.on appeal,the board challenges only the court invalidation of b.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse and remand.
we review the district court order granting summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the board.hill lockheed martin logistics,cir.the board,a subsidiary of the department of virginia alcoholic beverage control,is charged with regulating the importation and distribution of alcohol within the commonwealth of virginia.see ann.to carry out this duty,the board has the authority to promulgate reasonable regulations.ann.a.
the board exercises its authority in various ways to fight illegal and abusive drinking on college campuses in the commonwealth.for example,the board prohibits various types of advertisements for alcohol in any college student publication,which it defines as any college or university publication that is prepared,edited,or published primarily by its students sanctioned as a curricular or extracurricular activity and distributed or intended to be distributed primarily to persons under years of age.admin.code b.qualifying publications may not print advertisements for beer,wine,or mixed beverages unless the ads are in reference to a dining establishment.id.these exempted alcohol advertisements may not refer to brand or price,but they may use five approved words and phrases,including alcohol beverage control,beer,wine,mixed beverages,cocktails,or any combination of these words.id.
in addition to this advertising ban,the board publishes educational pamphlets on the dangers of underage and binge drinking on college campuses,targeted at both underage students and their parents.further,the board enforces its regulations by carefully allocating its limited number of officers to target big events that are likely to gather college students,and the board gives grants to colleges and college communities to supplement these targeted efforts.
the collegiate times is a newspaper at virginia polytechnic institute and state university,and the cavalier daily is a newspaper at the university of virginia.the newspapers rely on advertisement revenue to operate,and because of the ban embodied in b,each loses approximately a year in advertising revenue 
the college newspapers filed a complaint,alleging that b violates their first amendment rights.the college newspapers mounted both facial and challenges to b.for relief,the college newspapers sought a declaration that b is unconstitutional and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement.after both sides moved for summary judgment,the district court declared b facially unconstitutional as an invalid ban on commercial speech subsequently,the court permanently enjoined the enforcement of b.the board now appeals.
the board argues that the district court erred by determining that b facially violates the first amendment both parties agree that to determine whether a regulatory burden on commercial speech violates the first amendment,we apply the test set forth in central hudson gas electric public service commission of new york.
under central hudson,we must first consider whether the commercial speech is protected by the first amendment.if it is,the government must then assert a substantial interest to justify its regulation.we must then decide whether the regulation directly advances the government interest and whether the regulation is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.id.this test applies to both facial and challenges.see,posadas de puerto rico tourism of puerto rico,facial challenge greater new orleans broad.ass n,united states,challenge.however,the type of challenge to a or the state burden of proof.
a facial challenge to an ordinance restricting commercial speech may be resolved as a question of law when the government meets the burden placed on it by central hudson.penn advertising of baltimore,schmoke,cir,vacated on other grounds,penn advertising of baltimore,schmoke.the government may meet this burden by reference to the challenged regulation and its legislative history.id.at.therefore,a court considers the facial constitutionality of a regulation without regard to its impact on the plaintiff asserting the facial challenge id.
we first consider whether the first amendment protects the commercial speech in this case.to qualify for first amendment protection,commercial speech must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.central hudson,at.the board argues that b only regulates commercial speech concerning unlawful activity because it only applies to student newspapers which are distributed or intended to be distributed primarily to persons under years of age,b,and in virginia,it is illegal to sell alcohol to anyone under.ann.
we have recognized that advertisements for otherwise concern lawful activity where the audience comprises both underage and members.see,west virginia ass of club owners and fraternal serv.musgrave,cir video lottery ads in retail stores,schmoke,cir i alcohol advertisements in public,vacated on other grounds,schmoke.on its face,b does not restrict commercial speech solely distributed to underage students rather,it applies to commercial speech that,though primarily intended for underage students,also reaches readers.therefore,the commercial speech regulated by b concerns lawful activity.
further,because this is a facial,challenge,w e assume that the speech is not misleading because the board has not provided evidence that the speech is actually misleading,and there is no evidence that the advertising restrictions were enacted to prevent the dissemination of misleading information.musgrave,at.the district court,therefore,properly found that b restricts commercial speech protected by the first amendment.
next,we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.central hudson,at.the board contends that it has a substantial interest in combating the serious problem of underage drinking and abusive drinking by college students.the college newspapers do not dispute that this interest is substantial.see appellee br.therefore,like the district court,we find the board interest to be substantial.
we next consider whether the advertising ban directly and materially advances the government substantial interest.musgrave,at internal citation and quotation omitted.to determine whether this prong is satisfied we focus on the relationship between the state interests and the advertising ban.central hudson,at.this relationship,or link,need not be proven by empirical evidence rather,it may be supported by history,consensus,and simple common sense.lorillard tobacco reilly,quoting florida bar went for it.however,the link is insufficient if it is irrational,contrary to specific data,or rooted in speculation or conjecture.musgrave,at.
the board asserts that history,consensus,and common sense support the link between advertising bans in college newspapers and a decrease in demand for alcohol among college students.the board cites judicial decisions recognizing this general link and argues that,here,this link is extraordinarily strong because college newspapers,a targeted form of media bearing the name of the college,attract more attention among college students than other forms of mass media.the board also notes that,given the amount of money alcohol vendors spend on advertisement,it is illogical to think that alcohol ads do not increase demand.the college newspapers counter by arguing that there is no evidence that alcohol advertising bans in college publications decrease demand among college students and a ban on alcohol advertising in college publications is ineffective because college students see ads for alcohol in various other forms of media the district court agreed with the college newspapers.
we,however,find the link between b and decreasing demand for alcohol by college students to be amply supported by the record,and the district court erred by finding otherwise.though the correlation between advertising and demand alone is insufficient to justify advertising bans in every situation,musgrave,at,here it is strengthened because college student publications primarily target college students and play an inimitable role on campus.see the college publication is where college students are looking to find out what going on in their college community,what happening.this link is also supported by the fact that alcohol vendors want to advertise in college student publications.it is counterintuitive for alcohol vendors to spend their money on advertisements in newspapers with relatively limited circulation,directed primarily at college students,if they believed that these ads would not increase demand by college students.the college newspapers fail to provide evidence to specifically contradict this link or to recognize the distinction between ads in mass media and those in targeted local media.
the district court,therefore,erred by finding that this link did not satisfy central hudson third prong.even though this link is established,we must still decide whether b satisfies central hudson fourth prong.
under central hudson fourth prong,commercial speech restrictions must be narrowly drawn.central hudson,at.the restrictions do not need to be the least restrictive means possible,but they do need to have a reasonable fit with the government fit that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served.musgrave,at quoting greater new orleans,at.further,the state must consider alternatives to regulating speech to achieve its ends.musgrave,at.where a state has a comprehensive scheme to serve its interest,limitations on commercial speech should complement alternatives,not serve as substitutes for them.see id.at.
here,b is narrowly tailored to serve the board interest of establishing a comprehensive scheme attacking the problem of underage and dangerous drinking by college students.section b is not a complete ban on alcohol advertising in college newspapers.first,it only prohibits certain types of alcohol advertisements.in fact,it allows restaurants to inform readers about the presence and type of alcohol they serve.second,the restriction only applies to college student publications campus publications targeted at students under.it does not,on its face,affect all possible student publications on campus.therefore,b is sufficiently narrow.
further,the board not only considered related mechanisms to serve its interest,it actually implemented them through education and enforcement programs.section b complements these alternatives.within the board attack on underage and abusive drinking,b constitutes an additional prevention mechanism.without it,either education or enforcement efforts would have to be increased,and given the board limited resources,b is a prevention method that properly complements their related efforts.
the college newspapers argue that b is not the least restrictive means to serve the board interest because there are other,more effective ways to fight underage and abusive drinking without restricting speech.however,b does not necessarily need to be the single best disposition,but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served.musgrave,at quoting greater new orleans,at.the board has shown that b is an integral,reasonable fit to serve its interests.the possible existence of more effective methods does not undermine b,especially in light of its role in a comprehensive scheme to fight underage and abusive drinking.the district court,therefore,erred by finding b to be overly broad.
on its face,the board ban on alcoholic advertisements in college student publications passes muster under central hudson.the district court,therefore,erred in finding otherwise.
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court order granting summary judgment,vacate its permanent injunction,and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded 
i respectfully dissent.
preliminarily,i observe that the regulation,properly construed,does not apply to these newspapers.t he parties agree that a majority of the readership of the college newspapers is over the age of,ante at,and the undisputed statistical evidence in the record supports that agreement.more than half of the students at these universities are over the age of,as of course are most faculty and staff.given that a majority of the readership is over the age of,these college newspapers are not distributed or intended to be distributed primarily to persons under years of age,as required to be subject to the strictures of.admin.code b.this case could be resolved on that ground without reaching the broader constitutional question.see ashwander term.valley,brandeis,concurring the court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record,if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of.see also thompson greene,cir quoting ashwander.however,both the district court and the majority reach and address the constitutional question,and so i do as well 
on the merits of the constitutional issue,i think we should affirm.to satisfy the requirement that the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted,central hudson gas public serv.comm of new york,the government must demonstrate that the challenged law alleviate s the cited harms to a material degree,florida bar went for it,citation omitted see also greater new orleans broad.ass n,united states,pitt news pappert,cir.this burden is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture.edenfield fane,lorillard tobacco reilly,pitt news,at.it is likewise not enough if a law provides only ineffective or remote support for the government purposes,edenfield,at quoting central hudson,at,or if there is little chance that the law will advance the state goal,lorillard,at.see also pitt news,at.meeting this burden is critical otherwise,a state could with ease restrict commercial speech in the service of other objectives that could not themselves justify a burden on commercial expression.rubin coors brewing,quoting edenfield,at see also pitt news,at.in sum,the burden is on the government,and the record here supports the district court finding that the government failed to carry its burden 
i am persuaded by an opinion from the third circuit dealing with similar facts.pitt news pappert written by alito invalidated a pennsylvania statute that banned advertisers from paying for the dissemination of alcoholic beverage advertising by communications media affiliated with a university,college,or other educational institution.at.pitt news ruled that the pennsylvania statute founder ed on the third and fourth prongs of the central hudson test.id.at.finding that the third prong of the central hudson test had not been met,the third circuit observed that the commonwealth of pennsylvania had not carried its burden of showing that the statute had the effect of greatly reducing the quantity of alcoholic beverage ads viewed by underage and abusive drinkers on the pitt campus id.the court found that the pennsylvania statute applied 
only to advertising in a very narrow sector of the media,media associated with educational institutions,and the commonwealth has not pointed to any evidence that eliminating ads in this narrow sector will do any good.even if pitt students do not see alcoholic beverage ads in the pitt news,they will still be exposed to a torrent of beer ads on television and the radio,and they will still see alcoholic beverage ads in other publications,including the other free weekly pittsburgh papers that are displayed on campus together with the pitt news.the suggestion that the elimination of alcoholic beverage ads from the pitt news and other publications connected with the university will slacken the demand for alcohol by pitt students is counterintuitive and unsupported by any evidence that the commonwealth has called to our attention.
here,as in pitt news,the commonwealth relies on nothing more than speculation and conjecture.id.at.under the third prong of a central hudson analysis,i disagree with the finding that the link between b and decreasing demand for alcohol by college students is amply supported by the record.ante at.the evidence in the record indicates such a link is speculative,at best nor am i persuaded by the fact that alcohol vendors want to advertise in college student publications and that alcohol vendors would not spend their money on advertisements in college student publications if they believed that these ads would not increase demand by college students.ante at.the board justification for the regulation is not to reduce general demand by college students,a significant number of whom are of legal age to imbibe,but to reduce underage and abusive drinking among college students.appellants br.at emphasis added.the regulation not only impermissibly infringes upon the constitutional rights of adults with the result of limiting the adult readership to receiving only speech that the commonwealth deems appropriate for persons under the age of,it also infringes upon the rights of those readers who are not yet,who nonetheless have a protected interest in receiving truthful,information about a lawful product that they will soon have the legal right to consume.and of course the advertisers have the right to communicate such information.
as for the fourth prong under central hudson,i acknowledge that b contains exemptions that permit restaurants to advertise the presence and type of alcohol they serve.ante at.indeed,the poor fit between the regulation and the commonwealth asserted goal is belied by what b permits.lorillard,at greater new orleans,at west virginia ass of club owners and fraternal serv.musgrave,cir pitt news,at.although the regulation prohibits advertising of prices,brands of alcohol,and names of specialty drinks,it allows promotions of beer,wine,and mixed beverages to appear in the very same newspapers that are allegedly targeted at students under.ante at.it is inconsistent to maintain that a regulation that permits advertisements for beer night or mixed drink night in reference to a dining establishment forms a reasonable fit with the goal of curbing underage or excessive drinking merely because it forbids advertisements for keg delivery,mojito night,or the blacksburg wine festival.indeed,the supreme court has pointed to this sort of internal inconsistency in striking down advertising regulations under the third prong of a central hudson analysis.see greater new orleans,at observing that a ban on broadcasting lottery information was so pierced by exemptions and inconsistencies that the government can not hope to exonerate it.coors brewing,at the government anecdotal evidence and educated guesses do not overcome the irrationality of the regulatory scheme,which prohibited alcohol content information in labeling but not in advertising.an attempt to rationalize these inconsistencies,defending them on the ground that the regulation is not a complete ban on alcohol advertising in college newspapers,ante at emphasis added,may state an accurate observation however,the statement is wholly unresponsive to the requirements of central hudson.it fails to disguise the fact that there is no empirical support for banning one type of advertisement but not the other.
i disagree with the finding that b is sufficiently narrow because it applies to campus publications targeted at students under and does not,on its face,affect all possible student publications on campus.ante at.while the latter observation may be true,the former is not.there is no evidence that these newspapers are targeted at students under.the record reveals that the majority of the readership of these newspapers is of legal age to drink.accordingly,under the fourth step of the central hudson test,the regulation here,like the pennsylvania statute in pitt news,is not a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective,lorillard,at quotations omitted,given that it is both severely,pitt news,at observing that more than of pitt students and more than of the total university population is over the legal drinking age.
true,the regulation need not be the single best disposition,but only one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served.musgrave,at.however,a commercial speech restriction must be a necessary as opposed to merely convenient means of achieving the commonwealth interests,and the costs and benefits associated with the restriction must be carefully calculated.musgrave,at citations omitted emphasis added.here,the scope of b,and its impact on protected commercial speech,are far out of proportion to the interest served,and the record indicates that the commonwealth can seek to combat underage and abusive drinking by other means that are far more direct and that do not affect the first amendment.pitt news,at.in short,the advertising ban here offers only ineffective or remote support,not a direct means,to combat underage and abusive drinking.central hudson,at edenfield,at pitt news,at.
in my view,the regulation can not withstand constitutional scrutiny under central hudson.it is objectionable that the commonwealth rationale for the regulation applies only to underage and abusive drinking,while the regulation itself applies much more broadly.in free speech cases,it is dangerous and unwise to sustain broad regulations for narrow reasons.central hudson confirms this reasoning,recognizing that a regulation restricting commercial speech must be narrowly drawn.at citation omitted.section b fails to directly advance the governmental interest asserted and is more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.central hudson,at.i would therefore affirm the judgment below.
the district court determined that both college newspapers were college student publications as defined by b.however,the parties agree that a majority of the readership of the college newspapers is over the age of.though this concession appears to preclude the college newspapers from qualifying as college student publications,in a challenge,the college newspapers need only demonstrate a credible threat of prosecution under the statute or regulation.virginia soc y for human life,fec,cir quoting babbitt united farm workers union.here,an alcoholic beverage control compliance officer specifically advised the collegiate times that they would violate b if they published a specific alcohol advertisement,and the chief operating officer and secretary to the board of the department of alcoholic beverage control opined that both college newspapers would qualify as college student publications.therefore,regardless of whether b applies to these college newspapers,they have a sufficient credible fear of prosecution under this regulation.
the district court did not reach the college newspapers alternative arguments that b violates the first amendment because,it unconstitutionally restricts commercial speech under central hudson gas public serv.comm of new york,and on its face and,it unconstitutionally discriminates against a particular segment of the media under pitt news pappert,cir.though the college newspapers reiterate these alternative arguments on appeal,we decline to address them in the first instance.
the board also argues that the district court erred because it entertained a facial challenge to b.although there is judicial disfavor of facial challenges,there is no proscription on such challenges.see washington state grange washington state republican party,discussing the problems with facial challenges without banning their use west virginia ass n of club owners and fraternal serv.musgrave,cir same.
the appeal before us is based solely on a facial challenge to b.the dissent,like the district court,blurs the distinction between a facial and an challenge.for example,both the dissent and the district court opinion rely on pitt news which is
