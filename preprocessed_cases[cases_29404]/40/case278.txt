background 
relevant facts 
because we are reviewing a summary judgment order granted in favor of the defendants,we evaluate the record in the light most favorable to,and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of,the nonmoving party,in this case schubert.feliciano de la cruz el conquistador resort country club,cir.we thus relate the facts with this standard in mind.
schubert is a prominent criminal defense attorney who has worked in springfield,massachusetts for approximately thirty years.on july,officer stern,seated in his patrol car near the springfield courthouse,observed schubert walking toward the courthouse.the location is considered a area.schubert was dressed in a suit with an unbuttoned jacket and was carrying a briefcase.stern noted that schubert was also carrying a handgun in a holster.despite the very hot weather that day,schubert was wearing his suit jacket,apparently in order to conceal the handgun however,he had the jacket unbuttoned,which allowed the officer to see the weapon.according to stern,several also noticed schubert gun and alerted the officer to the firearm by waving and pointing.however,a subsequent investigation of the incident by the police department produced no witnesses or other proof of stern allegation regarding the.
on schubert account of the events,once stern noticed schubert partially concealed weapon,the officer leaped from his cruiser in a dynamic and explosive manner,with his gun.stern then pointed his weapon at schubert face.the officer ordered schubert to stop and put his hands in the air.schubert complied.when asked if he had a weapon,schubert responded that he did and that he had a license to carry.while still pointing his gun at schubert,stern reached inside schubert jacket and removed the weapon from its holster.stern then walked backward toward his cruiser,set his gun down,and removed the clip and chambered round from schubert gun.schubert replied in the negative when stern asked if he was carrying any other weapons.stern then frisked schubert and asked him for his license to carry.schubert produced his class a gun license,which also indicated that schubert was an attorney.he also handed over his driver license.
stern ordered schubert to stay where he was,in the street in front of the police cruiser,and stern took the gun,ammunition and licenses and got into his cruiser.the officer verified schubert driver license and attempted to verify the validity of his gun license.in schubert version of the facts,schubert stayed in front of the cruiser for several minutes,then moved to ask stern if he could stand in the shade because it was a hot day stern denied the request.shortly thereafter stern escorted schubert into the back of the cruiser.inside the vehicle,stern partially mirandized schubert,see miranda arizona,d,mentioned the possibility of a criminal charge,and told schubert that he stern was the only person allowed to carry a weapon on his beat.
stern continued to attempt to verify the validity of schubert weapons license,but because massachusetts lacked a centralized database containing such information,the officer soon realized that the inquiry could take a significant amount of time.thus,about five minutes after moving schubert into the cruiser,stern told schubert that he was free to go,but that schubert would have to retrieve his gun and gun license from the springfield police department.the entire stop took about ten minutes.
on july,schubert filed a citizen complaint against stern for his conduct on july.as a result of the report,the springfield police commissioner recommended that stern be retrained on massachusetts firearms law but found no specific wrongdoing on officer stern part and did not recommend disciplinary action.

ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.we evaluate the record in the light most favorable to the party,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of schubert.see feliciano de la cruz,at.we will uphold a district court order granting summary judgment if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
fourth amendment claim 
schubert primarily contends that stern lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him and that the scope of the stop was not reasonably related to the officer original purpose.schubert also argues that there are unresolved material facts that preclude summary judgment,that the district court failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to schubert,and that the opinion below was unsupported by any evidence other than the court philosophical views about gun control.
the fourth amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.see const.amend.iv.when police conduct rises to the level of an arrest it is a seizure that requires probable cause under the warrant clause of the fourth amendment.see terry ohio,d.there are,however,certain encounters between police and private citizens,called terry stops,that fall short of the intrusiveness of a full arrest.these encounters require necessarily swift action predicated upon the observations of the officer on the beat.id.when conducting a terry stop,a police officer may briefly detain an individual for questioning if the officer has reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot.united states sokolow,d quoting terry,at.see also united states wright,cir.
in determining whether a terry stop is justified,our inquiry involves two steps,first,whether the officer action was justified at its inception,and second,whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.terry,at.the initial stop requires reasonable suspicion,which must be rooted in a particularized and objective basis for suspecting illegal conduct on the part of the person stopped.wright,at quoting ornelas united states,d.the particularity requirement is satisfied by a finding grounded in specific and articulable facts.united states espinoza,cir quoting united states hensley,d.the objective component requires courts to focus not on what the officer himself believed but,rather,on what a reasonable officer in his position would have thought.id.
the initial stop 
schubert argues that stern was unjustified in stopping him initially because stern did not have an articulable suspicion,based on the totality of the circumstances,to detain schubert.we disagree.stern had an articulable,objective basis for his reasonable suspicion that schubert may have been engaged in criminal activity the officer observed schubert walking toward the springfield courthouse carrying a gun.this simple,undisputed fact provided a sufficient basis for stern concern that schubert may have been about to commit a serious criminal act,or
