pat godin,the former principal of the fort elementary school in machiasport,maine,brought suit against the machiasport school department board of directors machiasport and school union in march,alleging a violation of her due process rights under.she also sued three individual school system employees who had separately stated in meetings with officials their views that godin had acted abusively toward students at the school.plaintiff brought claims that these allegations were defamatory and led the school system to terminate her employment the school system says her job was terminated due to budgetary shortfalls.
many states have enacted special statutory protections for individuals,like the individual school system employees in this case,named as defendants as a result of the exercise of their constitutional rights to petition the government.these slapp strategic litigation against public participation laws provide such defendants with procedural and substantive defenses meant to prevent meritless suits from imposing significant litigation costs and chilling protected speech.the two federal appellate courts that have addressed whether they must enforce these state statutes in federal proceedings have concluded that they must.see henry lake charles am.press,llc,cir united states ex rel.newsham lockheed missiles space,cir.see also metabolife int l,wornick,cir limiting application of one provision where information was within exclusive control of the defendant.this question,here as it applies to maine statute,is one of first impression for this court,and lies at the center of this appeal.we hold the maine statute must be applied.
basic background facts set the stage.shortly after godin began working as a teacher and principal at the fort elementary school in august,machiasport began receiving complaints from other employees concerning her conduct toward students,including complaints from the three individual defendants,patty schencks,joleen nicely,and donna metta machiasport conducted an investigation of godin conduct in may.the june,investigation report concluded that the allegations that godin conduct was abusive and inappropriate were not supported.
two days after the report was issued,godin received notice from the superintendent of machiasport schools that her employment contract,which would have expired in,was being terminated due to budgetary constraints caused by significant subsidy loss.godin was told that her position would be filled by a teaching principal,which occurred on august.
on march,godin brought suit in federal court,asserting a federal claim under against the union and machiasport,and a number of state claims,including claims against the individual defendants for interference with advantageous contractual relationships and defamation 
the individual defendants filed a special motion to dismiss under maine statute,which creates a special process by which a defendant may move to dismiss any claim that arises from the defendant exercise of the right of petition under either the united states constitution or the constitution of maine.tit,section.godin does not dispute that her claims against the individual defendants are based on conduct that falls within the statute broad definition of a party exercise of its right of petition.tit.
the statute provides that once a defendant brings such a special motion to dismiss and demonstrates that the claims in question are based on the defendant petitioning activity,the court shall advance the motion so that it may be heard and determined with as little delay as possible.id.the court shall grant the special motion unless the party against whom the special motion is made shows that the moving party exercise of its right of petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and that the moving party acts caused actual injury to the responding party.id.in assessing whether to grant the special motion,the court shall consider the pleading and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.id.a court may order discovery specific to the section motion for good cause shown.id.evidence considered in reviewing a special motion to dismiss should be viewed in the light most favorable to the moving party because the responding party bears the burden of proof when the statute applies.morse,webster,me.
the district court denied the individual defendants special motion under section,holding that section conflicts with.and and so does not apply in federal court.
this interlocutory appeal raises issues of first impression within this circuit,namely whether,under the collateral order doctrine,this court has appellate jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal from an order denying a special motion to dismiss brought under section on the basis that section can not be reconciled with federal procedure and whether section applies in federal court proceedings.we hold on the facts here that we have appellate jurisdiction and that the district court erred in not applying maine statute.tit.we reverse and remand for further proceedings,including proceedings under section.
we address two preliminary jurisdictional issues whether federal jurisdiction exists over the claims against the individual defendants even though no federal claim has been brought against them,and whether this court has appellate jurisdiction over the individual defendants interlocutory appeal by virtue of the collateral order doctrine.
federal jurisdiction the supplemental jurisdiction doctrine 
although the parties have not questioned jurisdiction over the claims at issue,a court has an obligation to inquire sua sponte into its subject matter jurisdiction,and to proceed no further if such jurisdiction is wanting.in re recticel foam,cir.
in her complaint,godin asserts federal question jurisdiction pursuant to et as to the claims against the school system,and that there exists a common nucleus of operative facts between the state claims and her federal claims sufficient to establish supplemental jurisdiction under.
with certain exceptions not applicable here,a federal court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims that are so related to claims in the action within a court original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.a.while it might be questioned whether godin claims that her job termination was caused by defamatory comments from the individual defendants arise out of the same transaction as her federal claim that the schools did not afford due process in reaching the termination decision,that is not the test.see global naps,verizon new england,cir no supreme court case had ever established the same test as the boundary of article iii requirement.citing united mine workers of america gibbs.we conclude it would not offend the constitution to assert supplemental jurisdiction over godin claims accordingly,supplemental jurisdiction exists over godin claims under a.
appellate jurisdiction the collateral order doctrine 
godin objects that we lack appellate jurisdiction,arguing that the order denying application of section does not meet the requirements of the collateral order doctrine.the burden of establishing jurisdiction rests with the party who asserts its existence,here the three individual defendants.campbell dynamics gov t,cir.
the collateral order doctrine allows courts to hear appeals from judgments that are not complete and final if they fall in that small class which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.puerto rico,cir quoting cohen beneficial indus.loan.for the collateral order doctrine to apply,the interlocutory order must present a conclusive decision,distinct from the merits of the action,on an important issue,which would effectively be unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.awuah coverall am,cir see also will hallock.
three federal circuit decisions hold there is appellate jurisdiction over an order denying an motion to dismiss,hilton hallmark cards,cir,henry,at,and batzel smith,cir,while one,also from the ninth circuit,holds to the contrary,see englert macdonnell,cir.
the issue here is narrower and concerned only with the immediate appealability of an order that a state statute does not apply at all to federal court proceedings due to federal rules and.we defer to another day resolution of the question of whether an order addressed to the merits of a ruling under an statute is immediately appealable.
we have appellate jurisdiction.first,the order conclusively decides that relief under maine section is unavailable to the individual defendants.the relevant inquiry for collateral order doctrine purposes is whether the order is conclusive as to the disputed question,not the action as a whole.will,at quoting puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy.
second,the issue of whether a defendant can utilize section in federal court is distinct from the merits of godin action.the legal issue before us is not so intertwined with factual issues as to make it highly unlikely to affect,or even be consequential to,anyone aside from the parties.puerto ven quarry,cir.
third,this appeal raises an important issue of law because the issue raised is weightier than the societal interests advanced by the ordinary operation of final judgment principles.id.quoting gill gulfstream park racing ass,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the seminal supreme court case of cohen beneficial industrial loan itself involved an interlocutory appeal from a district court determination that a state statute was not applicable to a claim brought in federal court at.the cohen court permitted interlocutory review,and in so doing,carved out the collateral order doctrine.likewise,the parallel question of whether this state statute applies to a claim brought in federal court qualifies as too important to be denied review.id.
finally,the order appealed from would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.it is relevant,but not conclusive,that the maine supreme court interpretation of section has led it to permit interlocutory appeals of orders denying special motions to dismiss in its own courts,because a failure to grant review of these decisions at this stage would impose additional litigation costs on defendants,the very harm the statute seeks to avoid,and would result in a loss of defendants substantial rights.schelling lindell,me see also maietta,wainwright,me discussing purpose of section.
that is relevant not because state law determines the availability of appellate review does rather because lawmakers wanted to protect speakers from the trial itself rather than merely from liability.batzel,at see also englert,at whether state statute provides for interlocutory appeals is significant to whether interlocutory appeals should be permitted in federal courts there is a crucial distinction between a right not to be tried and a right whose remedy requires the dismissal of charges.midland asphalt united states,quoting united states hollywood motor car,internal quotation marks omitted.we conclude that the order at issue here involves an asserted right the legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial.lauro lines chasser,u,quoting midland asphalt,at quotation mark omitted.
the district court order rests on a determination of law,which we review de novo.see levin dalva,cir.it is often said that a federal court sitting in diversity applies the state substantive law and the federal procedural rules.see gasperini ctr.for humanities,erie thompson,hoyos telecorp,cir servicios comerciales andinos,general del caribe,cir at the same time,there is what we have called an enduring line between substance and procedure.united states poland,cir.what are matters of substance and what are matters of procedure is difficult to distinguish,and the two are not mutually exclusive categories.shady grove orthopedic,allstate ins,stevens,concurring.
here,the issue falls into the special category concerning the relationship between the federal rules of civil procedure and a state statute that governs both procedure and substance in the state courts.the issue is whether federal rules of civil procedure b and preclude application of section in federal court.this is not the classic erie question.compare erie,with hanna plumer.
until the last several decades,federal courts addressing similar issues posed the relevant question,as articulated in walker armco steel,as whether there was a direct conflict between a state law and a federal rule of civil procedure.id.at.that is no longer the initial question.see stewart,ricoh,in getting at the potential rub in the relationship between a federal rule of procedure and the state law,courts now ask if the federal rule is sufficiently broad to control the issue before the court.shady grove.at stevens,j,concurring quoting walker,at.if so,then the federal rule must be given effect despite the existence of competing state law so long as the rule complies with the rules enabling act,id.
we conclude that neither.b nor,on a straightforward reading of its language,was meant to control the particular issues under section before the district court.given this result we do not reach the next level question as to whether rules b and comply with the rules enabling act.
our conclusion that rules particularly rule b and do not control section proceedings does not end the analysis.if a federal rule is not so broad as to control the issues raised,a federal court might nonetheless decline to apply state law if so declining would better advance the dual aims of erie discouragement of and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws.hanna,at see also shady grove.at walker,at.as to this prong of the analysis,we hold that the dual purposes of erie are best served by enforcement of section in federal court.
federal rules of civil procedure and are not sufficiently broad to control section proceedings 
the test of whether a federal rule is sufficiently broad to control the issue before the court,walker,at,was most recently examined by the supreme court in shady grove.the question presented was whether a new york rule,b,which prevents parties from bringing class action lawsuits on claims seeking the minimum measure of recovery imposed by statute,was preempted by.in diversity cases.writing for a five member majority,justice scalia concluded that,because b attempts to answer the same question as rule,namely,the categorical question of when a class action may be brought,b could not be applied to bar class actions in federal diversity cases,so long as rule complies with the rules enabling act.id.at.
joined only by three other justices,justice scalia went on to reason that rule validity under the rules enabling act depends entirely on whether it really regulate s procedure,which he concluded it did.id.at plurality opinion quoting sibbach wilson.this conclusion was reached without any inquiry into whether b was procedural or substantive,as in his view that question makes no difference for rules enabling act purposes.id.at.
justice stevens joined the court narrow holding that rule was sufficiently broad to preempt b,and that rule complied with the rules enabling act.id.at stevens,concurring.but in a concurring opinion,joined in relevant part by four other justices,he held that whether a federal rule is valid under the rules enabling act depends not on the federal rule alone,but also on the nature of the state rule it seeks to displace.id.at.the critical question is not whether the state law at issue takes the form of what is traditionally described as substantive or procedural,but rather whether the state law actually is part of a state framework of substantive rights or remedies.id.at.justice stevens also noted that this inquiry under the rules enabling act may well bleed back into the inquiry of whether a federal rule is sufficiently broad to control the issue before the court.id.at.this is so because a federal rule can not govern a particular case in which the rule would displace a state law that is procedural in the ordinary use of the term but is so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it functions to define the scope of the right.id.to avoid such a result,the concurrence concludes,w hen a federal rule appears to abridge,enlarge,or modify a substantive right,federal courts must consider whether the rule can reasonably be interpreted to avoid that impermissible result.id.
the court fractured holding regarding when a federal rule is sufficiently broad to control an issue of state law is given content by other language used by the court.the concepts of congruence,difference,and direct or indirect conflict continue to play a role in the analysis.shady grove uses the language of potential conflict,compatible and collision with state law.id.at majority opinion.the plurality also characterizes the first step of the analysis as determining whether the federal and state rules can be reconciled because they answer different questions.id.at plurality opinion see also id.at stevens,concurring stating the first step of the analysis asks whether the federal rule leaves no room for the operation of seemingly conflicting state law.our own case law also provides guidance.see morel daimlerchrysler ag,cir asking whether the state rule is inconsistent gil de rebollo miami heat ass ns,cir asking about potential conflict.and we give the federal rules a literal reading.see walker,at.
we also take some guidance from history,which governs shareholder derivative suits,is not so broad as to cover some state bond requirements for such suits.cohen,u.at.but the class action rule is broad enough to preclude state prohibitions on certain class actions seeking penalties or statutory minimum damages.shady grove.at.it is also commonly accepted that in diversity cases state statutes of limitations apply guaranty trust york.and.c,governing the relation back of complaints,displaces an inconsistent state rule.morel,at.
applying these principles to the case before us,we conclude that.b which governs motions to dismiss on the pleadings,and,which governs motions for summary judgment,are not so broad as to cover the issues within the scope of section.to use the language of shady grove,rules and do not attempt to answer the same question,shady grove.at,nor do they address the same subject,id.at,as section.
federal rules b and are addressed to different but related.section on its face is not addressed to either of these procedures,which are general federal procedures governing all categories of cases.section is only addressed to special procedures for state claims based on a defendant petitioning activity.in contrast to the state statute in shady grove,section does not seek to displace the federal rules or have rules b and cease to function.morel,at.in addition,rules b and do not purport to apply only to suits challenging the defendants exercise of their constitutional petitioning rights.maine itself has general procedural rules which are the equivalents of.b and.see me.civ.me.civ.that fact further supports the view that maine has not created a substitute to the federal rules,but instead created a supplemental and substantive rule to provide added protections,beyond those in rules and,to defendants who are named as parties because of constitutional petitioning activities.
rule b serves to provide a mechanism to test the sufficiency of the complaint.see iqbal ashcroft.section,by contrast,provides a mechanism for a defendant to move to dismiss a claim on an entirely different basis that the claims in question rest on the defendant protected petitioning conduct and that the plaintiff can not meet the special rules maine has created to protect such petitioning activity against lawsuits.
the federal summary judgment rule,rule,creates a process for parties to secure judgment before trial on the basis that there are no disputed material issues of fact,and as a matter of law,one party is entitled to judgment.inherent in rule is that a evaluation of material factual disputes is not required.but section serves the entirely distinct function of protecting those specific defendants that have been targeted with litigation on the basis of their protected speech.when applicable,section requires a court to consider whether the defendant conduct had a reasonable basis in fact or law,and whether that conduct caused actual injury.can not be said to control those issues.
section has both substantive and procedural aspects.one of the substantive aspects of section shifts the burden to plaintiff to defeat the special motion.section also determines the scope of plaintiff burden,requiring plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant activity was without reasonable factual support,and was without an arguable basis in law.schelling,at quoting.tit.further,section substantively alters the type of harm is,plaintiff must show the defendant conduct resulted in actual injury to the plaintiff.id.quoting.tit,
neither.b nor.determines which party bears the burden of proof on a created cause of action.see,coll pb diagnostic,cir.and it is long settled that the allocation of burden of proof is substantive in nature and controlled by state law.palmer hoffman,am.title ins.fin,cir.
further,section provides substantive legal defenses to defendants and alters what plaintiffs must prove to prevail.it is not the province of either rule or rule to supply substantive defenses or the elements of plaintiffs proof to causes of action,either state or federal 
because section is so intertwined with a state right or remedy that it functions to define the scope of the right,it can not be displaced by rule b or rule.shady grove.at stevens,concurring.further,if rules b and were thought to preempt application of all of section,a serious question might be raised under the rules enabling act.id.in light of our conclusion that section is not displaced,we need not reach this issue.
given that neither.b nor.is so broad as to encompass the special section proceedings,we might go no further.we do acknowledge the district court concern about some differences in the mechanics,particularly as to the record on which the motion is evaluated.whether the procedures outlined in section will in fact depart from those of rule and rule will depend on the particulars in a given case of the claim and defense.some section motions,like rule b motions will be resolved on the pleadings.in other cases,section will permit courts to look beyond the pleadings to affidavits and materials of record,as rule does.in this way,some section motions,depending on the particulars of a case,will be resolved just as summary judgment motions under.are.
godin emphasizes that section has the potential in a particular case to give the individual defendants a dispositive ruling without affording discovery,thus bringing section in conflict with.metabolife,at.godin has not shown any actual conflict.while section provides that discovery proceedings are stayed upon the filing of a special motion to dismiss,the statute also provides that a court may,upon good cause shown,order that specific discovery be conducted.tit.the maine statute,in imposing on the opponent of the motion the burden of justifying discovery,is consistent with the allocation of burdens under rule d,formerly rule f if a federal court would allow discovery under.d then,in our view,that would constitute good cause under the maine statute.
the limiting effect that section has on discovery is not materially different from the effect of rule proceedings and,in some instances,rule proceedings.neither rule nor rule of the federal rules of procedure purport to be so broad as to preclude additional mechanisms meant to curtail litigation through the modification of pleading standards.the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,stat,is a federal version of such an additional mechanism to the federal rules,meant to apply to a discrete category of cases.designed to curb perceived abuses of the b private action,the pslra created a higher standard for pleading scienter in any b claim tellabs,makor issues rights.we recognize that the fact that congress may create special p
