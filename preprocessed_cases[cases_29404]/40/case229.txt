on petition for review of an order 
petitioners sokrat nako,his wife kozet filipi,and his son kristi,albanian nationals,petition for review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia,which upheld an immigration judge ij denial of their request for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.the ij denied their petition,inter alia,because even assuming nako had established a fear of future persecution based on past political persecution before he left albania in,circumstances in albania since had so fundamentally changed that this fear was no longer.the bia affirmed the ij ruling denying asylum and withholding of removal solely on this ground it also affirmed the ij conclusion that petitioners were ineligible for cat protection.we affirm the bia findings and deny the petition.
on april,sokrat and kristi nako arrived in boston,massachusetts on visitor visas.on july,kozet filipi joined them,entering through new york,new york under the visa waiver program vwp.on october,weeks before his visa expired,sokrat nako filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection,claiming he had suffered past persecution in albania because of his political beliefs.
four years later,on january,the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings against filipi as a vwp violator,which she did not challenge.on april,dhs initiated removal proceedings against sokrat and kristi.sokrat and kristi conceded removability and on december,sokrat filed an amended asylum application with an ij,claiming his wife and son as derivative beneficiaries and again requesting asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection 
on december,at a hearing before the ij,nako testified that he had suffered past political persecution by the socialist party in albania,and feared future persecution,because of his membership in the albanian democratic party.he submitted newspaper articles,a state department country report from,and an affidavit from an albania expert as to a different albanian applicant for asylum discussing current political conditions to support these claims we summarize the evidence nako presented to the ij as follows.
nako was born in albania in and lived in the city of durrës during the events in question.from until the fall of the communist regime in the early,nako and his family had faced persecution by the communist regime because of his brother political agitation and nako membership in a democratic group trying to overthrow the regime.nako admitted he had not really lived in albania since december,but returned there about twice a year.
the socialist party came to power in albania in,by which point nako was a member of the opposing democratic party.on october,nako planned to participate in a democratic party demonstration in durrës to denounce the socialist party,but socialist party adversaries began looking for him and beat his relatives in order to intimidate him.that same day,nako fled to italy.
nako returned to durrës in december to participate in a demonstration.on december,the democratic party organized a protest to denounce the socialist party undemocratic practices.nako was singled out by special police forces and arrested because he was on the front lines of the demonstration.while detained,he was beaten with clubs and punched and kicked for six hours.he was warned not to try to overthrow the regime and was released.he did not seek medical treatment.the next morning,he gave an interview to the local press denouncing the socialist regime and again fled to italy.nako briefly returned to albania on april,and left italy for the united states on april.
nako acknowledged that the democratic party currently controls albania,but said he nonetheless still feared persecution by the socialist party.he said that the democratic party parliamentary majority over the socialist party was too slim to effectively rule the country or to protect him from persecution in cities like durrës where the socialists won the local elections and his persecutors remained in power.
the ij denied nako application in an oral decision at the end of the december,hearing.the ij deemed nako credible,but found he had not established a fear of future persecution and was not entitled to asylum or withholding of removal because he had repeatedly returned to albania after his move to italy,demonstrating an apparent lack of fear of future persecution.
the ij also concluded that even assuming nako had suffered past persecution and received the presumption of a fear of future persecution,b,this presumption had been rebutted.nako had not shown a fear of future persecution based significantly in part on the fact that there ha ve been compelling changes in the government of albania.the ij supported this conclusion by citing details from the state department country report on human rights practices and profile of asylum claims and country conditions for albania the most recent reports.these reports indicated that there were no major outbreaks of political violence in albania since,that peaceful elections had been held in,that the leader of the democratic party had become prime minister,that the democratic party controlled parliament with of seats,and that the political parties had ceased abuse or coercion of political opponents.the reports provided no evidence of present systemic political persecution in albania.because nako had not met the lesser burden for asylum,his claim for withholding of removal necessarily failed.the ij also denied cat protection after finding that nako had failed to show a likelihood he would be tortured in albania,and ordered petitioners removed to albania.
on august,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij denial of asylum on the basis of changed country conditions in albania.the bia rejected nako claim on appeal that the ij failed to give sufficient weight to record evidence of country conditions,finding that the state department country report and asylum profile were probative evidence of changed conditions.the bia affirmed the ij rejection of withholding of removal and also affirmed the denial of cat protection because nako had not shown he would likely be tortured in albania.
when,as here,the bia adopts and affirms part of the ij ruling and further justifies the ij conclusions,we review both the bia and ij opinions.weng holder,cir.
an alien eligibility for asylum depends on satisfying his burden to show that he is a refugee,b a b,meaning that he has suffered past persecution or has a fear of future persecution on the basis of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.anacassus holder,cir quoting decky holder,cir see also a a.if the applicant carries his burden of showing past persecution,he shall also be presumed to have a fear of persecution on the basis of the original claim.b.
the government can overcome this presumption by showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that t here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution in the applicant country of nationality.id.b i a.the government must present more than generalized evidence,but a country report that demonstrates fundamental changes in the specific circumstances that form the basis of a petitioner presumptive fear of future persecution may be sufficient,in and of itself,to rebut that presumption.chreng gonzales,cir quoting gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
whether such a change in country conditions has occurred is a question of fact we review under the deferential substantial evidence standard,asking only whether any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.bollanos gonzales,cir quoting ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,substantial evidence supported the bia and ij conclusion that fundamental changes in the albanian political situation since,when nako was last in albania,rebutted the presumption that nako had a fear of future persecution by his socialist party adversaries.the bia and ij considered nako claim of political persecution in the specific context of his m
