opinion of the court 
section of title of the united states code makes it a crime to threaten to assault,kidnap,or murder an official whose killing would be a crime under of that title.a b.section,in turn,makes it a crime to kill any officer or employee of the united states or of any agency in any branch of the united states government.this case requires us to determine whether incorporates by reference all individuals covered by any employee of any agency in any branch of the federal instead,by using the term official,incorporates only some limited subset of those individuals.
in march,michael bankoff was convicted of threatening two employees of the social security administration ssa in violation of,as charged in counts two and three of the indictment.the district court granted a judgment of acquittal on count three,concluding that the employee in ssa claims representative did not qualify as an official because she performed only routine and subordinate functions.the court denied bankoff motion for a judgment of acquittal on count two,concluding that the employee in ssa operations supervisor qualified as an official because she supervised persons who had the authority to adjudicate claims on behalf of the federal government.
though bankoff is not the first defendant successfully prosecuted under for threatening a federal employee,we are the first federal appellate court faced with the statutory interpretation issue presented here.we hold that incorporates by reference all persons covered by,and,accordingly,that applies to threats against federal employee s whose killing would be a crime under.because applies to both of the employees bankoff threatened,we affirm the district court denial of a judgment of acquittal on count two,vacate its grant of a judgment of acquittal on count three,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
a.the offense conduct 
in,bankoff began receiving social security disability benefits.in a series of letters sent to bankoff from december through may,the ssa informed him that it had overpaid in benefits to him and that he was required to repay that amount.
ssa claims adjuster daniel sphabmixy was assigned to bankoff case in late.bankoff called sphabmixy several times to dispute the overpayment.after reviewing bankoff file,sphabmixy determined that bankoff was responsible for the error,and had failed to provide sufficient information regarding his inability to repay the amount overpaid to him.accordingly,sphabmixy denied bankoff request to waive repayment.
on february,bankoff called sphabmixy to complain about the denial of the waiver.bankoff was loud and profane,and told sphabmixy that he was going to come to the office and kick the shit out of him.bankoff also left two voicemails for sphabmixy that were threatening in nature.
sphabmixy alerted his operations supervisor susan security personnel about bankoff threats.tonik,in turn,notified the federal protective service.bankoff called tonik later in the day on february to apologize for his phone call to sphabmixy,but again contested the overpayment issue.
bankoff scheduled a meeting for march,with an ssa claims representative regarding the overpayment issue.however,bankoff called tonik the morning of march and cancelled the meeting.he told tonik that he wanted everything resolved over the phone,and again was angry,loud,profane,and,according to tonik,out of control.tonik told bankoff that she was unable to schedule a telephone conference with the assigned claims representative that day.
following this conversation,bankoff left a voicemail on tonik telephone,in which he shouted 
s omebody ought to spit in that bitch face,she does know how to talk to people.she thinks i a child,i a grown up i will smack the shit out of that bitch.i take the little misdemeanor charge.what are they gon na do,fine me 
tonik became very worried and very scared after listening to this message,and feared bankoff threat was real.
bankoff also spoke with ssa claims representative crystal robinson several times on march.in one of these conversations,bankoff complained about tonik and told robinson that he would come to the office,take the gun away from the pig up front,and slap every woman in the place.
bankoff motion to dismiss the indictment 
in april,a federal grand jury returned a indictment charging bankoff with threatening employees of the ssa,in violation of.section provides in pertinent part 
whoever threatens to assault,kidnap,or murder,a united states official,a united states judge,a federal law enforcement officer,or an official whose killing would be a crime under,with intent to impede,intimidate,or interfere with such official,judge,or law enforcement officer while engaged in the performance of official duties,or with intent to retaliate against such official,judge,or law enforcement officer on account of the performance of official duties,shall be punished as provided in subsection b.
a emphasis added.
bankoff moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his alleged,tonik,and not qualify as official s whose killing would be a crime under.relying on united states fenton,d the single reported decision by a federal court that addresses the meaning of the term official in argued that does not incorporate all persons protected by,but only officer s.see id.at reasoning that the terms official and officer are closely related and can only be construed to have the same meaning accordingly,bankoff argued that does not apply to threats made against employees like sphabmixy,tonik,and robinson.
the district court disagreed,concluding that the plain language of and,taken as a whole,indicates that official encompasses an officer or employee.it stated,however,that its conclusion regarding the definition of official was only preliminary,and it invited bankoff to raise the issue again at trial.the court thus denied bankoff motion.
c.the district court jury instructions 
near the end of trial,and despite its preliminary conclusion that applies to any officer or employee covered by,the district court proposed to instruct the jury that,in addition to finding beyond a reasonable doubt that sphabmixy,tonik,and robinson were officer s or employees whose killing would be a crime under,it must also find that they were federal officials.the court proposed to define official as a person 
authorized to exercise governmental functions and to make decisions on behalf of the government.an official is a person who is authorized to exercise his or her discretion in the performance of his or her governmental duties,as distinguished from an employee who performs routine and subordinate functions.
the government objected,arguing that the proposed instruction was inconsistent with the court conclusion in denying bankoff motion to dismiss the indictment that the term official in encompasses any officer or employee whose killing would be a crime under.the government presciently expressed concern that,following the conclusion of trial,bankoff would attempt to argue that the government had failed to prove that any of bankoff three victims were officials under the court proposed definition and seek a judgment of acquittal on that basis.
the district court recognized that it had modified its preliminary ruling.it nonetheless explained that it had 
a slight problem with the government expansive viewpoint.because if you say that the word official in by reference to officer or employee in incorporates by reference every employee,no matter how lowly they may be,i think that a leap.
the court gave one example to explain its concern a janitor employed by a federal agency,a person whom the court doubted would qualify in lay term s as an official.
after both sides rested at trial,the district court gave the instruction it had proposed including its definition of an official.the jury found bankoff guilty of threatening tonik and robinson counts two and three,but acquitted him of threatening sphabmixy count one.
bankoff motion for a judgment of acquittal 
following the verdict,bankoff moved for a judgment of acquittal on the counts charging him with threatening tonik and robinson,arguing that the trial evidence was insufficient to prove that they were officials within the meaning of.see.c.the district court denied the motion as to tonik,reasoning that she was an operations supervisor who oversaw the daily operation of the supplemental security income program in the local field office and supervised claims representatives who had the authority to adjudicate claims on behalf of the federal government.as such,the court determined there was sufficient evidence that tonik made decisions on behalf of the government and therefore was a federal official.
the district court granted the motion as to robinson because her testimony as to her job duties d id not indicate that she made decisions on behalf of the government.robinson did not have the authority to hire or supervise other employees,and her usual job duties included answering the telephones.the court thus concluded that robinson was not an official and,in light of that conclusion,declined to reach bankoff other two the evidence was insufficient to prove that he made a true threat against robinson,or acted with the specific intent of interfering with or retaliating against robinson for performing her official duties.
bankoff requests to proceed pro se 
on several occasions prior to trial,bankoff told the district court that he wished to represent himself during trial.he reiterated this request during a final pretrial hearing in march.the court conducted an extensive colloquy with bankoff in accordance with our precedent,see united states peppers,cir,advised him of the risks of representing himself,and strongly advised him against doing so.it also advised bankoff that his counsel would remain as standby counsel and would be available to take over the trial if bankoff changed his mind,but stressed that he would not be allowed to switch back and forth with counsel during trial.at the end of this colloquy,the court granted bankoff request to proceed pro se.
before the final pretrial conference concluded,bankoff changed his mind.during a conversation regarding jury instructions,the district court again suggested that it was a bad idea for bankoff to represent himself 
the court i do think that,with the limited education that you have of a you a bright fellow,you know,and want to state that on the record.you have a good vocabulary.you articulate.you understand my questions.and,however bright you are,you just do think you prepared to defend yourself as well as your lawyers can.
bankoff i think you right,your honor.
the court all right.
bankoff i think changed my mind.i think think i 
the court well,you do have to make a decision today.you ought to sleep on this and talk to your lawyer some more.
bankoff well,i spoke to them,and i was thinking about it a while,and think that they they my attorney rimmer did very well today.i think she did real good.my other attorney,mchugh,sometimes,he did good sometimes,there was a couple of things think i i stick with my team,your honor.
i changed my mind,and i sorry to trouble the court with these,you know,ups and downs 
the court all right.
bankoff fluctuations,whatever 
despite bankoff statements that he no longer wished to proceed pro se,the court informed him that if he want ed to represent himself next monday the first day of trial,it would let him do it,but it a very bad idea.
trial began the following monday,and neither bankoff nor his counsel raised the issue of prior to jury selection or opening statements.however,bankoff repeatedly interrupted the prosecutor opening statement with argumentative objections,and,after the prosecutor concluded,bankoff demanded to give the opening statement for the defense.the court informed bankoff that it would not permit him to represent himself that day,but would address his objections at the end of the day after the jury had been released.one witness for the government sphabmixy testified that day,and bankoff counsel conducted the.
after the jury was dismissed,the district court held an conference with the parties.bankoff denied he had ever withdrawn his request to proceed pro se,and complained that he had not been permitted to sphabmixy.the court again advised bankoff that he could not have it both ways,and asked him if he wanted to represent himself for the rest of trial.bankoff declared that it was too late,and that he was just gon na have to let his attorney go forward from now.
but on tuesday morning bankoff again demanded to proceed pro se.the district court ruled that his counsel would finish the of sphabmixy.once cross was completed,however,the court permitted bankoff to represent himself.he the government remaining witnesses tonik,robinson,and federal protective services special agent jesse kunkle,and the court also allowed bankoff to sphabmixy after the government rested.
bankoff chose to present a defense,calling his father and a psychiatrist to testify on his behalf.bankoff father was unable to answer some of his son questions after becoming emotional,and the district bankoff standby counsel to finish the direct examination.
at the close of trial,bankoff counsel gave the closing statement for the defense after bankoff was removed from the courtroom following an angry,profane,and lengthy outburst which occurred outside of the jury presence.the district court informed the jury that bankoff had elected by his words and conduct to not be present for the conclusion of summations.the court nonetheless took care to instruct the jury that it was not to use bankoff words or his conduct during the trial for any purpose in its deliberations.
as noted,bankoff was convicted on two of the three counts and the district court overturned one of them,leaving only the conviction for threatening tonik count two.the court then sentenced bankoff to months imprisonment,which represented a upward variance from the advisory guidelines range of months.this timely appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
bankoff argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the count charging him with threatening tonik count two the government the court grant of a judgment of acquittal on the count charging bankoff with threatening robinson count three.in addition,bankoff contends that the court deprived him of his right of in violation of the sixth amendment 
we conclude that the district court erred in granting a judgment of acquittal as to robinson,and thus vacate the court judgment on that count.we affirm the court denial of a judgment of acquittal as to tonik,but on a different ground.finally,we reject bankoff sixth amendment claim.
bankoff motion for a judgment of acquittal 
to determine whether the district court erred in its rulings on bankoff motion for a judgment of acquittal,we first interpret.we have plenary review over a district court interpretation of a statute,united states introcaso,cir,as well as its grant or denial of a judgment of acquittal based on sufficiency of the evidence,united states starnes,cir.
the text of 
courts in applying criminal laws generally must follow the plain and unambiguous meaning of the statutory language.united states albertini.however,the meaning of statutory language,plain or not,depends on context,king vincent,and thus is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil,see also beecham united states,the plain meaning that we seek to discern is the plain meaning of the whole statute,not of isolated sentences.kokoszka belford,when interpreting a statute,the court will not look merely to a particular clause in which general words may be used,but will take in connection with it the whole statute internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in that light,though we presume that congress expressed its legislative intent through the ordinary meaning of the words it chose to use,united states knox,cir,t he circumstances of particular legislation may persuade a court that congress did not intend words of common meaning to have their literal effect,watt alaska.
bankoff argument in support of his interpretation of is straightforward.he contends that,because the terms official and employee have different ordinary meanings,congress could not have intended that apply to threats against employees whose killing would be a crime under by referring to threats against official s whose killing would be a crime under.a b.see also webster third new int l dictionary employee means one employed by another,usu ally in a position below the executive level and usu ally for wages id.at official means a person authorized to act for a government,corporation,or organization.though bankoff argument is not without surface appeal,we reject it.
section prohibits threats against four categories of individuals united states official s,united states judge s,federal law enforcement officer s,and official s whose killing would be a crime under includes specific definitions for only the first three.united states official a term that would encompass a wide class of persons if construed consistent with its ordinary defined narrowly to include only the president,vice president,vice,a member of congress,a of congress,a member of the executive branch who is the head of a department listed in,or the director of the central intelligence agency.c.by contrast,a federal law enforcement officer is defined more broadly than its ordinary meaning to include any officer,agent,or employee of the united states authorized by law or by a government agency to engage in or supervise the prevention,detection,investigation,or prosecution of any violation of federal criminal law.id.c.
in this context,it appears to us that congress intended terms like official and officer to have a special meaning in that was not the same as their ordinary,dictionary definitions.as noted,itself defines a federal law enforcement officer a term bankoff contends is synonymous with official for purposes of the to including federal employee s authorized to engage in or supervise the prevention,detection,investigation,or prosecution of any violation of federal criminal law.id.emphasis added.
nor is unusual in this regard indeed,other sections of the criminal code specifically define the term official to include employees.for example,the federal bribery statute defines public official to include a 
member of congress,delegate,or resident commissioner,either before or after such official has qualified,or an officer or employee or person acting for or on behalf of the united states,or any department,agency or branch of government thereof,including the district of columbia,in any official function,under or by authority of any such department,agency,or branch of government,or a juror.
a emphasis added.similarly,the statute prohibiting the murder or manslaughter of foreign officials defines a foreign official to include 
any person of a foreign nationality who is duly notified to the united states as an officer or employee of a foreign government or international organization,and who is in the united states on official business,and any member of his family whose presence in the united states is in connection with the presence of such officer or employee.
b b emphasis added.
finally,we believe it especially significant that defines the first three categories of covered persons but provides no definition for the fourth category.this strongly suggests that congress intended for itself to define that category by incorporating it by reference into.stenberg carhart,when a statute defines a term,a court must follow that definition,even if it varies from that term ordinary meaning.
notwithstanding this statutory context,bankoff asks us to compare with of title,which makes it a crime to forcibly assault,resist,oppose,impede,intimidate,or interfere with any person designated in section of this title while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties.a emphasis added.bankoff argues that,h ad congress intended to cover the exact same class of victims as,it would have employed the exact same language which it used in,would refer to any person designated in instead of an official whose killing would be a crime under appellant reply br.at.
we are not persuaded.the different language used to incorporate is readily explained by unique statutory history.both and originate from a act t o provide punishment for killing or assaulting f ederal officers,stat.section stems from of the act flows from,which forbade forcible resistance or interference with,or assault upon,any person designated in section hereof.stat,see united states feola.section assumed its current form in when it was as a separate section of title,stat.see feola,at,and in that section it appears that congress simply retained the original language used in the act,a person designated.
in any event,that congress used different language to incorporate in different statutes that were codified nearly four decades apart in,and in,stat.does not,standing alone,demonstrate that it used the term official as opposed to person in with the intention of limiting its scope and though congress could have used a term other than official to achieve the same result,its choice makes sense when is viewed in context,given both its title i nfluencing,impeding,or retaliating against a federal official by threatening or injuring a family member and the kinds of threats to which it applies,those made to retaliate against such an official on account of the performance of official duties.emphases added.
the text of 
this interpretation of is confirmed by an examination of the version of that was in force when was enacted in.as noted,originates from of the act,and,in its original form,made it a crime to kill seven types of federal officers while they were engaged in the performance of their official duties,or on account of the performance of their official duties.that section was separately codified as in,stat,and in the decades that followed congress greatly expanded the categories of persons protected by that provision.feola,at.by when was enacted,applied to any officer or employee of,among many federal agencies and departments,the secret service,the drug enforcement administration,the veterans administration now the department of veterans affairs,the department of agriculture,the federal depository insurance corporation,the federal communications commission,and the national aeronautics and space administration and in addition to officer s or employee s of such agencies and departments,also covered,among others,any agent of the customs or of the internal revenue,any member of the united states capitol police,and any member of the coast guard.emphasis added.congress did not shorten this list until years after it enacted it amended to refer simply to any officer or employee of the united states or of any agency in any branch of the united states government.one suspects that the queue of requests for additional inclusions had grown too long.
this statutory context confirms our conclusion that congress used official in as a general term to incorporate by reference all the officers,employees,members,and agents of the federal departments and agencies listed in.by doing so,congress avoided the need to restate that lengthy list in itself.see,hassett welch,where one statute adopts the particular provisions of another by a specific and descriptive reference,the effect is the same as though the statute or provisions adopted had been incorporated bodily into the adopting statute.internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also norman singer shambie singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction when a reference is made to a specific section of a statute,that part of the statute is applied as though written into the reference statute.moreover,we think it implausible that congress used the term official as a limitation on the persons enumerated in,yet declined to define that term or provide any indication as to how courts or,presumably,juries were to determine which of the enumerated employees,officers,members,and agents listed in also qualify as officials.
in sum,we conclude that when reference to an official whose killing would be a crime under is read in context,its meaning is plain official is not used as a term of limitation,but as a general term that incorporates by reference all the individuals protected under,both officer s and employee s.
the legislative history 
even were we to lay aside the plain language of and consult its legislative history as a course marker,it would not aid bankoff.albertini,at.he argues that the legislative history indicates that congress was concerned with high policymaking,judicial and law enforcement officers,but that that legislative concern did not extend to federal employees in general.appellant br.at quoting fenton,d at.he relies on the senate report that accompanies,which begins 
section is a new provision designed to protect the close relatives of certain high level officials,such as the president,members of congress,cabinet officers,and federal judges,as well as federal law enforcement officers 
the committee believes that serious crimes against family members of high level federal officials,federal judges,and federal law enforcement officers,which are committed because of their relatives jobs are,generally speaking,proper matters of federal concern.clearly it is a proper federal function to respond to terrorists and other criminals who would seek to influence the making of federal policies and interfere with the administration of justice by attacking close relatives of those entrusted with these tasks.
at emphases added.
this argument falls short.protecting the family of such high policymaking officials was undoubtedly an important and probably the primary purpose of the statute.however,we decline to draw from this the negative inference that bankoff urges,that because congress was primarily concerned with protecting policy makers,it must not have intended for to protect mere employees.see,united states turkette,that the legislative history forcefully supports a major purpose of the statute,but does not address the statute scope regarding the issue at hand,does not compel the negative inference that the statute does not also have other purposes and thus scopes.
moreover,this excerpt from the conference report appears to address only the first three categories of individuals protected by united states officials,united states judges,and federal law enforcement officers.a later statement in the conference report specifically addresses the fourth category of persons covered by 
it should be noted that the new section covers attacks on family members of all the persons listed in as well as on family members of other law enforcement officers not there listed.included in this latter category would be,for example,the inspectors general and their staffs,and department of justice strike force attorneys.
at emphases added.even assuming that the conference report use of persons instead of officials was a stray choice of words,fenton,d at,its reference to all the persons listed in comports with our conclusion that congress intended to incorporate by reference all the individuals listed in and thus avoid restating that list in itself 
in sum,even were we required to consult legislative history for,it is consistent with our conclusion that congress did not use official as a limitation on the categories of individuals protected by.
we hold that applies to all persons,be they officer s or employee s,whose killing would be a crime under.we thus conclude that the district court erred in ruling that an individual does not qualify as an official within the meaning of unless he or she is authorized to make decisions on behalf of the government.this dispute over the correct interpretation of is the sole basis on which bankoff challenges the district court denial of a judgment of acquittal on count two the threats made against tonik.accordingly,we affirm the court denial of a judgment of acquittal on that count,as we have no dispute that tonik qualifies as an employee whose killing would be a crime under.
like tonik,it is undisputed that robinson qualifies as a federal employee whose killing would be a crime under.accordingly,we conclude the district court erred in granting a judgment of acquittal on count three.however,bankoff sought a judgment of acquittal on that count on two additional the evidence was insufficient to prove that he made a true threat against robinson,or acted with the specific intent to impede,intimidate,or interfere with robinson while she was engaged in the performance of her official duties,or to retaliate against her on account of the performance of h er official duties.a.the district court did not reach those arguments,and neither bankoff nor the government addresses them in each briefing.we decline to consider them in the first instance,and thus remand for the district court to do so.gov t of the charleswell,cir.
sixth amendment claim 
bankoff argues that the district court violated his sixth amendment right to represent himself when the court denied his requests to give the opening statement for the defense,and the government first witness sphabmixy.the government argues that there was no constitutional deprivation because bankoff request was untimely,having been made after trial began and after bankoff had already withdrawn his request to proceed pro se mere days before trial.
the sixth amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to represent themselves at trial.faretta california.the right of and the right to counsel are two faces of the same coin,in that the waiver of one right constitutes a correlative assertion of the other.united states conder,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.however,because criminal defendants will likely fare better with the assistance of counsel than without,a defendant will be permitted to represent himself only when he knowingly and intelligently relinquishes his right to counsel.faretta,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
we have established three requirements that must be met before a defendant may be allowed to proceed pro se he must assert his desire to proceed pro se clearly and unequivocally the court must inquire thoroughly to satisfy itself that the request is knowing and intelligent and the court must assure itself that the defendant is competent to stand trial.peppers,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.our review over a district court findings regarding these requirements is plenary.see united states goldberg,cir.
