background 
evelyn cruz was hired on february,as legal consultant v,a trust position,by the puerto rico department of labor cruz was appointed to this position by the new progressive party npp administration in power in puerto rico at the time.
in december or january,at cruz request,the central office for labor and personnel matters reclassified her position as director of the bureau of legal affairs,a career position.cruz thereafter occupied the career position of director of the bureau of legal affairs.in this job,she performed the same functions she had performed as a trust employee.the npp was still in power at the time of this change.furthermore,in,implemented a qualification plan,as a result of which cruz status as a career employee was certified and confirmed.
on november,general elections were held in puerto rico,and governor sila maría calderón of the popular democratic party pdp was elected.in january,rivera was appointed by governor calderón as the new secretary of labor of the commonwealth and remained as such until june.
although cruz had occupied the career position of director of the bureau of legal affairs since late or early,she claims that her life at changed dramatically after the pdp victory in and the installation of rivera as the head of.in particular,she states that she began to experience discrimination at the hands of her colleagues.for example,she claims that rivera and luis piñot,one of her supervisors,continuously harassed her by requesting a series of complicated but useless reports to be completed in short periods of time.they consistently raised questions about her whereabouts,and piñot restricted her to a specific work schedule.furthermore,personnel from rivera office,instead of interacting with her,simply ignored her presence and authority as head of the bureau of legal affairs.
cruz states that the most significant change came when rivera assistant secretary for human resources,gladys,suddenly concluded,after cruz had already served in the same position for more than four years,that cruz change in classification from a trust to a career employee was null and void given the fact that it was not preceded by the competition process required for career positions.on august,because it had been determined that cruz employment was null and void,rivera,without any sort of hearing,removed cruz from her position as director of the bureau of legal affairs 
as a result of her termination,cruz,on july,filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico seeking compensatory and punitive damages and reinstatement to her prior position.she alleged violation of her rights under the first and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.specifically,she claimed that her political affiliation with the npp,which was known to rivera and the other defendants she named,all of whom were affiliated with the pdp,was the reason that she was terminated.
on january,rivera filed a motion for summary judgment,requesting dismissal on the grounds a that cruz failed to show that she was the subject of political discrimination b that cruz was not entitled to monetary damages from rivera in his official capacity c that cruz right to due process under the first and fourteenth amendments was not violated given her failure to demonstrate the existence of a cognizable property interest a legitimate claim of entitlement in continued employment d that rivera was not liable under the respondeat superior doctrine and e that rivera was entitled to qualified immunity given that he had sufficient grounds to believe cruz employment was null and void.
on february,cruz filed a response in opposition to the summary judgment motion,alleging that she had established her case for political discrimination and violation of rights under the first and fourteenth amendments and that rivera actions were not protected by qualified immunity.
on april,the district court found that cruz was not entitled to monetary damages from rivera in his official capacity as a result of eleventh amendment immunity.however,the court denied the remainder of rivera motion,stating that disputed factual issues still remained and therefore summary judgment could not be granted.in particular,the court noted,first,that contrary to rivera argument that cruz failed to show that her political affiliation was a motivating factor behind her termination,cruz had put forward specific allegations which,if proved at trial,may be probative of discriminatory animus and suffice for the purpose of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.second,in assessing rivera proffered justification for cruz cruz was fired solely because of the nullity of her appointment,not as the result of any political court noted that it was unable to weigh the import of the qualification plan ratification which allegedly confirmed cruz career status since neither party discussed the qualification plan in depth.the court also noted that rivera neither conceded nor denied that cruz satisfied each of the requirements in laws ann.tit,under which an employee may be reclassified as a career employee without being subject to the normal competitive process this particular deficiency,making it unclear whether cruz career appointment violated the puerto rico personnel act,led the court to decline to enter summary judgment on both cruz first amendment and due process claims.third,with regard to rivera claim of qualified immunity,the court noted that there was a disputed factual issue as to whether rivera actions were motivated by cruz political affiliation 
on may,rivera filed a notice of interlocutory appeal,contesting the district court denial of his summary judgment motion.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,rivera rehashes the same arguments he made before the district court in support of his summary judgment motion.for example,he argues that cruz failed to bring forth evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude a that the decision to remove her from her employment was somehow related to her political affiliation b that she had a cognizable property interest in continued employment and c that rivera was liable under the respondeat superior doctrine.although these claims may be meritorious,we clearly have no jurisdiction to address them.orders of the district court denying pretrial motions for summary judgment typically are not appealable at the time they are entered.díaz martínez,cir.such orders are not final decisions in the sense required by conferring appellate jurisdiction over final decisions of the district courts.see,cir.
one of rivera arguments,however,gives us reason to,the argument that the court erred in not finding that he was entitled to qualified immunity for his actions.this presents a more difficult jurisdictional question,as the denial of a claim of qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage is,in limited instances,subject to an interlocutory appeal.as we wrote in díaz,where a defendant seeks the shelter of qualified immunity by means of a pretrial motion and the court denies the requested relief,a different result sometimes obtains.díaz,at.more specifically,if the pretrial rejection of the qualified immunity defense is based on a purely legal ground,then the denial may be challenged through an interlocutory appeal.dwan city of boston,cir.what can not be appealed is a district court rejection of the defense based on the court determination that the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.johnson jones,d see also,at,cir 
to determine,then,whether or not we have jurisdiction to consider rivera qualified immunity claim,we must examine the grounds upon which the district court,in its order denying summary judgment,rejected rivera qualified immunity argument.the district laying out the trifurcated inquiry for determining whether qualified immunity is available to a particular defendant under,see
