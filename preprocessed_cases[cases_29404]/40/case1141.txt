opinion of the court 
this case comes on before this court on an appeal from an order of the district court entered october,dismissing a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b.merando united states,civ,wl.the action arose in the aftermath of a tragedy when on august,a tree in the delaware water gap national recreation area fell onto a roadway and crushed a passing car driven by janine noyes in which kathleen merando and her old daughter kaylyn merando were passengers.merando and kaylyn were killed instantly.anton merando,merando husband and kaylyn father,filed this action alleging that the government negligently pruned and failed to find and remove the hazardous tree.but the district court dismissed the case as it concluded that the discretionary function exception to the federal tort claims act deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction and thus immunized the government from suit.we will affirm.
facts and procedural history 
the delaware water gap national recreation area park occupies acres in new jersey and pennsylvania along the delaware river.the park primarily is forested land accessed by miles of roadways,miles of trails,and several streams.the developed areas include campgrounds,boat launch areas,visitor centers,picnic areas,historic sites,and parking lots.the pennsylvania side of the park contains more of the developed attractions and thus more people visit it than visit the new jersey side which does not have developed beaches,boat launches,or visitor centers.the national park service,an agency within the department of the interior,manages the park.
on august,noyes was driving her car southerly on route on the new jersey side of the park with kathleen and kaylyn merando as passengers.noyes drove the car by a foot tall red oak tree that was about six yards off the road.the government took title to the land where the oak tree was situated in and to the roadway itself in.the tree natural growth caused it to lean with its branches extending over the roadway.more than ten years before the tragedy here,an unknown person wielding a chainsaw had topped and delimbed the tree,leaving it standing in a y shape with no bark or branches and with the dead tree pole leaning toward the roadway.as their car passed nearby the tree fell and crushed the car instantly killing merando and kaylyn.
on july,anton merando filed his complaint in the district court which he amended on august.he originally sued the united states of america,sussex county,walpack township,public service electric and gas,jersey central power and light,john does,and xyz corps.but except for the united states of america all are no longer parties to this case.
merando alleged that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the federal tort claims act ftca,b.in count one of his amended complaint,he alleged that the government as well as all the other defendants negligently pruned the tree causing it to die and eventually collapse,killing the decedents.in count two,he alleged that the tree constituted a hazardous and extremely dangerous condition of which the government and all the other defendants knew or should have known and that all the defendants negligently failed to act to remove the tree,killing the decedents.in count three,he alleged that the decedents sustained severe injuries resulting in pain and suffering that continued until their deaths.
the government moved to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of the discretionary function exception to the ftca,and on october,the district court granted the motion.while the government also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim,arguing that the new jersey landowners liability act,stat.ann.to west,barred the action,inasmuch as the district court found that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction,it did not address that motion.
on october,merando filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over the final order of the district court pursuant to and exercise plenary review over application of the ftca discretionary function exception.see mitchell united states,cir.we resolve the question of whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction by this opinion.
iii.discussion 
a.the discretionary function exception 
the united states of america,as a sovereign,is immune from suit unless it consents to be sued.united states mitchell,d citing united states sherwood.nevertheless,under the ftca,the united states has waived its sovereign immunity for 
claims for money damages for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.

the ftca carves out a discretionary function exception,however,which provides that the government can not be sued for any claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.a.the plaintiff,here merando,bears the burden of demonstrating that his claims fall within the scope of the ftca waiver of government immunity,in re orthopedic bone screw prod.liab,cir,but t he united states has the burden of proving the applicability of the discretionary function exception.cestonaro united states,cir quoting union fire ins.united states,cir.
the discretionary function exception marks the boundary between congress willingness to impose tort liability upon the united states and its desire to protect certain governmental activities from exposure to suit by private individuals.united states empresa de viacao aerea rio grandense varig airlines,d.the exception purpose is to prevent judicial of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,economic,and political policy through the medium of an action in tort.id.at.at.
courts make inquiries to determine whether the discretionary function exception applies in any particular case.united states gaubert,d.first,a court must determine whether the act giving rise to the alleged injury and thus the suit involves an element of judgment or choice.id.at.at quoting berkovitz united states,d.the requirement of judgment or choice is not satisfied if a federal statute,regulation,or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow,because the employee has no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.id.quoting berkovitz,at.at see also mitchell united states,at cestonaro,at.the supreme court has stated 
i f a regulation mandates particular conduct,and the employee obeys the direction,the government will be protected because the action will be deemed in furtherance of the policies which led to the promulgation of the regulation.if the employee violates the mandatory regulation,there will be no shelter from liability because there is no room for choice and the action will be contrary to policy.on the other hand,if a regulation allows the employee discretion,the very existence of the regulation creates a strong presumption that a discretionary act authorized by the regulation involves consideration of the same policies which led to the promulgation of the regulations.

second,even if the challenged conduct involves an element of judgment,the court must determine whether that judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.id.at.at.
because the purpose of the exception is to prevent judicial of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,economic,and political policy through the medium of an action in tort,when properly construed,the exception protects only governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy.
id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the focus of the inquiry is not on the agent subjective intent in exercising the discretion conferred by the statute or regulation,but on the nature of the actions taken and on whether they are susceptible to policy analysis.id.at.at see also mitchell,at cestonaro,at serv.united states,cir.
b.the challenged government conduct 
before we can make the gaubert inquiry to determine whether the discretionary function exception immunizes the government from a suit based on its conduct,we must identify the conduct at issue.cestonaro,at.merando contends that the conduct for purposes of the discretionary function exception analysis is twofold first,that the park service roads and maintenance crews negligently topped the tree without removing it and second,that the crews negligently failed to find and remove the topped tree.he contends that the discretionary function exception does not apply here because the park service unwritten hazardous tree management plan mandated the crews never to top trees but rather to identify and remove hazardous trees as they drove the roads of the park.
on the other hand the government contends that the conduct at issue is the park service decisions that comprise its hazardous tree management plan and its execution of that plan.
to aid us in our analysis,we review autery united states,a case that is remarkably similar to this case.cir see also rosebush united states,cir relying on autery in determining what conduct was at issue when plaintiffs sued the government for negligently failing to maintain fire pit at campground.in autery,a black locust tree fell on a passing car in the great smokey mountain national park,killing one passenger and injuring another.at.at the time of the accident,the park service had an unwritten policy to make every reasonable effort within the constraints of budget,manpower,and equipment available to detect,document,remove,and prevent tree hazards.id.at.to implement this policy,park service personnel initially conducted visual inspections from trucks driven along the road.any tree that appeared hazardous was then inspected more closely.id.in the autery situation park service personnel received information regarding the risks posed by black locust trees in the park.after a bench trial,the district court found that the government had negligently failed to devise,implement and follow an appropriate tree hazard management plan properly maintain the national park area properly inspect the trees in the national park in the area where the accident occurred and identify and remove the hazardous trees which fell and struck the victims.id.at.
on appeal,the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit confronted the question of identifying the conduct at issue for purposes of a discretionary function exception analysis.the government argued that the conduct was the government decision to establish and implement a tree inspection program,while the plaintiffs contended that the conduct was the park failure to carry out the mandates of its then existing policy of identifying and eliminating known hazardous trees.id.at quotation marks omitted.the district court had held that the inquiry is whether the park service officials had discretion under their tree hazard management plan to remove hazardous trees.id.
the court of appeals,however,stated 
the government focus on the decision to establish a tree inspection plan is too broad as plaintiffs concede,the government had the discretion to adopt or not adopt a plan at all.the more important question is whether any statute,regulation or agency guideline specifically provided that if a tree inspection plan were developed,it would have to include particular inspection procedures.
id.footnote omitted.the court continued 
plaintiffs and the district court focus,on the other hand,is too narrow.the particular inquiries posed by plaintiffs and the district court are based on misinterpretations of the law.plaintiffs support their contention that the discretionary function exception does not apply to the manner in which park personnel administered the inspection plan by relying on fifth circuit cases that had held that the government was not protected when it was performing an operational function.the supreme court squarely rejected this proposed distinction in gaubert,ruling that the fifth circuit erred in holding that the discretionary function exception does not reach decisions made at the operational or management level.gaubert,at.at.discretionary conduct is not confined to the policy or planning level.see also varig airlines,at.at i t is the nature of the conduct,rather than the status of the actor,that governs whether the discretionary function exception applies in a given case.
id.at internal citations,quotation marks and footnote partially omitted.the court added 
the district court inquiry,on the other hand,by asking whether the park officials had discretion to remove hazardous trees,begs the question.the tree inspection program was designed to identify which trees were hazardous.whether park personnel had discretion in executing that plan is the relevant issue.the district court analysis appears to collapse the question of whether the park service was negligent into the discretionary function inquiry.that is,after finding that the park service had knowledge of the danger of black locust trees,the district court imposed a reasonableness requirement on the government conduct.
id.at.the court concluded 
it is the governing administrative policy,not the park service knowledge of danger,however,that determines whether certain conduct is mandatory for purposes of the discretionary function exception.the ftca expressly provides that the exception applies to policy judgments,even to those constituting abuse of discretion.therefore,the relevant inquiry here is whether controlling statutes,regulations and administrative policies mandated that the park service inspect for hazardous trees in a specific manner.if not,then the park officials decision to employ a particular inspection its execution of that protected by the discretionary function exception.
id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.ultimately,the court of appeals held that the discretionary function exception immunized the government from a lawsuit based on the decisions park service personnel made in designing and implementing the park unwritten tree inspection program,and thus the court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
merando presents an argument that is very similar to the plaintiffs argument and the district court decision in autery.he contends that the conduct at issue is the government alleged failure properly to prune,find,and remove the hazardous tree.
merando allegation that the government negligently pruned the tree causing it to decay and collapse implies that it was the government that topped the tree.but this allegation is unsupportable because merando has not shown that the government in any way was involved in the topping of the tree either by consenting to its topping or actually topping it itself.in reaching this conclusion,we recognize,of course,that the government took title to the site of the tree in.moreover,we realize that merando contends in his brief that according to the evidence the tree was topped during the years after the national parks service took title to it in,therefore suggesting that it controlled the tree when the unknown person topped it.appellant br.at.
we can not,however,draw any inference from this chronology of events as it can not be inferred that,against government policy not to top trees,it was the government that topped the tree or that it consented to its topping merely because it may have owned the land on which the tree was situated when the unknown person topped it.after all,in merando answers to interrogatories he tells us that i t is understood from documents which have been produced in discovery that the county of sussex retained responsibility for tree trimming and clearance even after jurisdiction for the county road was transferred to the united states of america in,app.at,thus suggesting that sussex county topped the tree.on the other hand,in an uncontested motion for summary judgment sussex county asserted that t he identity of the company or individuals who topped the tree is unknown but that the tree was topped presumably by a power company.furthermore,there would be no basis to infer that the government consented to the topping of the tree or actually topped it merely because the tree was situated in a acre park at a location that it may have owned when the unknown person topped the tree.clearly,too many different entities had access to the tree to permit a trier of the fact to draw that inference.
in sum,there is simply neither direct evidence nor evidence from which an inference can be drawn that the government topped the tree and this absence of evidence as a factual matter eliminates from this case merando claim that park service personnel violated a mandatory policy not to top trees 
accordingly,we only will analyze the other aspect of merando claim his challenge to the government alleged negligent failure to find and remove the tree.merando argues that the park service crews did not have discretion not to find and remove the hazardous tree.like the district court decision in autery,however,merando argument begs the question.the park service designed its hazardous tree management plan,which we detail below,to identify which trees were hazardous.the relevant issue here is whether the park service had discretion in formulating and executing that plan.
merando claims regarding the government alleged negligent failure to find and remove the tree essentially are a challenge to the park service plan for finding and managing hazardous trees.the park service plan and its execution of that plan constitutes the conduct at issue for purposes of the discretionary function exception analysis.like the plaintiffs argument in autery,merando focus on the actions of the park service crews simply is too narrow.the relevant inquiry is whether the controlling statutes,regulations,and administrative policies mandate that the park service locate and manage hazardous trees in any specific manner.if not,the park service decisions as to the precise manner in which to do so,and its execution of those decisions,clearly fall within the discretionary function exception to the government tort liability.see also varig airlines,at.at discretionary function exception protects both government decision to airplanes for compliance with safety regulations and execution of those by government personnel.
whether the discretionary function exception immunizes the government from a lawsuit based on its conduct 
now that we have identified the government conduct at issue in this case,we determine whether the discretionary function exception immunizes it from a lawsuit based on that conduct.in this inquiry we first must decide whether a statute,regulation,or policy required the park service to locate and manage hazardous trees in any specific manner,or whether the government actions were discretionary because they involved an element of judgment or choice.gaubert,at.at.
the national park service was established to 
promote and regulate the use of the federal areas known as national parks,monuments,and reservations by such means and measures as conform to the fundamental purpose of the said parks,monuments,and reservations,which purpose is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.
the park service specific mission for the delaware water gap national recreation area is to maintain the property for public outdoor recreation use and enjoyment by the people of the united states and for preservation of the scenic,scientific,and historic features contributing to public enjoyment of such lands and waters.
in the administration of the park,the secretary of the interior may utilize such statutory authorities relating to areas of the national park system and such statutory authorities otherwise available to him for the conservation,management,or disposal of vegetative,mineral,or fish or wildlife resources as he deems appropriate.moreover,the secretary 
shall adopt and implement a land and water use management plan,which shall include specific provision for,in order of priority public outdoor recreation benefits preservation of scenic,scientific,and historic features contributing to public enjoyment such utilization of natural resources as in the judgment of the secretary of the interior is consistent with,and does not significantly impair,public recreation and protection of scenic,scientific,and historic features contributing to public enjoyment.
the park service management policies manual sets out its visitor safety policy 
the saving of human life will take precedence over all other management actions as the park service strives to protect human life and provide for visits.the service will do this within the constraints of the organic act.the very imposed by the organic act is that discretionary management activities may be undertaken only to the extent that they will not impair park resources and values when practicable,and consistent with congressionally designated purposes and mandates,the service will reduce or remove known hazards and apply other appropriate measures,including closures,guarding,signing,or other forms of education.in doing so,the service preferred actions will be those that have the least impact on park resources and values 
these management policies do not impose visitor safety prescriptions.the means by which public safety concerns are to be addressed is left to the discretion of superintendents and other at the park level,who must work within the limits of funding and staffing.
app.at.significantly,nothing in the statutes or policies mandates how the government should locate or deal with hazardous trees.
in addition to these statutes and policies,the park service issued a document entitled natural resources management guidelines,containing a hazardous tree section that provides the foundation for each park to implement its own hazardous tree management plan,and also to provide a general scheme for such plans.app.at.this section states in pertinent part 
the following guidance may be used in developing a park plan.each plan must be tailored to a park particular requirements according to vegetation type s,type of visitor use areas,frequency of visitation,and other factors.
periodically,any trees which stand within falling distance of public use areas and which might pose a hazard to the public or significant property should be systematically inspected for flaws.the form and frequency of routine inspection or surveillance will depend on the type of visitor use areas which will be defined later.the constraints of manpower available to a park may not permit periodic inspection of all pertinent areas frequency of inspection as called for in the hazardous tree management plan becomes a local issue keyed to the nature of the park and visitor use.
any tree denoted as hazardous should be promptly cared for,using the best arboricultural techniques,to eliminate the hazardous status of the tree.if it can not be made safe,or if the effort to make it safe would be too costly in terms of manpower or dollars,then the tree may be removed.
deliberate visual inspections of transportation corridors should include all trees that could affect the roadway.areas that may be screened or otherwise difficult to view from the road should be given a inspection.inspections may not catch all flaws in the trees along roadways.however,it is generally recognized that it may not be realistically possible to walk by all trees along miles of roadways,and under these conditions a documented inspection should be considered satisfactory.
the explicitly state that they may be used do not mandate any particular methods of hazardous tree identification or removal.instead,they make suggestions that park officials are free to accept or reject.thus,according to park superintendent john donahue,although the
