campaigning for public office sometimes has the feel of a contact sport,with candidates,political organizations,and others trading rhetorical jabs and attacks in hopes of landing a knockout blow at the polls.it is not for the or the,to use two apropos clichés.see monitor patriot roy.and because political speech is the of democracy,see eu cnty.democratic cent,d,the first to the states via the public figures from recovering damages under state defamation laws unless they show that the defamer acted with actual malice,see new york times sullivan,d,legalese that might suggest ill will or evil motive to the uninitiated but really means knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth,see masson new yorker magazine,d cases define reckless disregard variously as a defamer having serious doubts about a statement falsity,or actually having a high degree of awareness of probable falsity,or suspecting falsity and purposefully not just negligently avoiding the truth.harte hanks commc n,connaughton,d quoting amant thompson,d,and garrison louisiana,d,respectively.
all this makes it quite obvious that defamation law does not require that combatants for public office act like neutrals,treating everyone evenhandedly and always taking the high road.quite the contrary.provided that they do not act with actual malice,they can badmouth their opponents,hammering them with unfair and attacks remember,speaking out on political issues,especially criticizing public officials and hopefuls for public office,is a core freedom protected by the first amendment and probably presents the strongest case for applying the new york times rule.see id.at.and absent actual malice,more speech,not damages,is the right against superheated or false rhetoric.see id.at.
today appeal targeting speech critical of a candidate performance in public office and challenging the dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim brings these principles into bold relief.finding no reversible error in the judge careful opinion,we affirm.the story follows.
how it all began 
having lost his bid for a maine senate seat in,democratic politician james schatz brought this diversity suit governed,all agree,by maine law against a slew of defendants for defamation libel,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and publicly placing him in a false light.our case caption lists the complete cast of defendants.for simplicity sake,we follow the parties lead and refer to the defendants,collectively,as the rslc,which is short for the republican state leadership committee.
the gist of schatz operative complaint was that the rslc opposed his candidacy and supported his opponent with flyers,brochures,and radio and tv ads days before the election that conjured up imaginary wrongs that he had supposedly done as a selectman for the town of blue hill.he attached copies of the offending circulars to his complaint,and we quote from one of them,which is representative of the others emblazoned on the front are these words 
no rockets red glare,
no bursting in air.
thanks to jim schatz 
emphases removed.and on the back 
jim schatz voted to cancel the fireworks celebration for the fourth of it on a bad economy.
however,before canceling the show,schatz and the blue hill selectmen gave taxpayer dollars to a political organization.
it wrong for schatz to give your money to a political organization,and it was wrong for schatz to cancel your of july celebration.
on november,vote against jim schatz,because he wrong for maine.
emphases removed.
a footnote in the flyers references two newspaper articles as the source for these assertions,and schatz appended both items to his complaint too.the first,from the july,edition of the bangor daily news,chronicled the financial difficulties confronting maine towns in funding fireworks for the independence day celebration 
there will be no fireworks display in blue hill this fourth of july due to the poor economic climate,but business is booming elsewhere as municipalities and private groups have worked hard to raise funds to pay for the fire that lights up the nation birthday.
it continued 
for the past two years the hancock county town has fronted the money for the fireworks display for the fourth to remember celebration and paid the funds back through donations.there about in the account,but the selectmen and the fireworks committee opted not to spend the funds this year.
and it noted 
given the economy,we felt that in good conscience we could do it this year,said selectman jim schatz.we thought that to spend that much money on something that will light things up for a few seconds and then is gone was not the thing to do.unless we were sure we could pay the town back,we did want to pull the trigger on it this year.
the second piece,from the august,edition of the kennebec journal,highlighted how local communities are being asked to help roll back school consolidation.it started off 
starved for cash,the advocates pressing for a repeal of maine school district consolidation law are taking their fundraising appeal to the towns directly affected by the sweeping state mandate.
the maine coalition to save schools,which had on hand at the beginning of july,is seeking campaign contributions from municipalities that turned down district mergers or are unhappy with the consolidation arrangements their voters approved.
blue hill approved a contribution to the effort in january and more in july of last year.james schatz,a blue hill selectman and a state representative,said the town recently paid to the coalition as the last installment of a commitment.
and danforth and deer isle residents each approved taking out of town coffers to boost the effort in january and october of last year,respectively.
after noting monmouth selectmen do have the power to contribute town funds to a political cause,it informed 
while it legal for municipalities legislative bodies to dig into taxpayer funds to support political causes,the maine municipal association,the lobbying arm for maine cities and towns,advises against it.
expressing one view is one thing,association spokesman michael starn said.expending town funds to support their view is much more problematic.
a municipality should generally take a position of more fact gathering and factual dissemination,not advocacy as individual communities,starn said.
but municipal officials,he noted,are free to express their opinions on pending political matters,and a town legislative body can approve resolutions supporting or opposing particular causes.
you do have a responsibility as a government official to approach this whole advocacy thing in a very responsible way,starn said.
and,finally,it reported 
according to dick dyer,a repeal advocate,there no reason that ca involve committing town funds to advancing a political cause.
town officials make decisions all the time that are political in nature that involve spending taxpayers dollars,he said.
schatz,the blue hill selectman,acknowledged that questions come up when municipalities contribute to political causes.
but a lot of the rural,small schools have been hurt by consolidation,he said.if one were to examine the issue,it would seem appropriate to contribute to the repeal campaign.
getting back to the complaint,schatz alleged that the rslc had defamed him by falsely accusing him of a crime having lobbed words like wrong and misuse while denouncing him for working both to give taxpayer money to a political organization and to squelch the fireworks display,the rslc had smeared him as a stealer of public funds.eager to set things straight,schatz declared in his complaint that town voters had decided in january to make an contribution to the effort,though they apparently gave the selectmen the discretion to decide how much if any of the to spend.consistent with that vote,the selectmen paid the maine coalition to save schools coalition,for easy reading in three installments of varying amounts,schatz said,with the final payment coming the day before the independence day festivities.speaking of independence day,schatz alleged that he himself had voted in march to fund fireworks for that day but was outvoted by the town other two selectmen.he also said that these funding decisions the first,by the voters in january to kick into the repeal kitty the second,by the selectmen in march not to spring for fireworks,after he lost on that issue were totally unrelated.
schatz then used the words actual malice in his complaint,claiming that the rslc knew based on the two articles that its defamatory statements were false or was recklessly indifferent to whether they were false.and,on top of that,he accused the rslc of not bothering to confirm the truth of its assertions,faulting it for not doing anything to the articles accuracy.
how the case got here 
the rslc promptly moved to dismiss schatz complaint for failure to state a viable claim.see.b.faced with that filing,schatz dropped his claim and stated at a motion hearing that if his defamation claim failed so too would his claim.also importantly,schatz agreed that the coalition is a political organization,conceded that he was a public official for defamation purposes,and argued that the judge could identify actual malice by comparing what the newspapers said against what the flyers said.
after argument,the judge wrote a thoughtful opinion granting the rslc motion.even assuming that the rslc statements were false and smacked of gotcha politics of a juvenile sort,the judge still had serious doubts about whether they were defamatory under maine law doubts that he did not resolve because he concluded that schatz complaint did not plausibly allege that the rslc had acted with actual malice.see schatz,d at.unpersuaded,schatz appeals.
our analysis 
we give de novo review to a rule b dismissal,using the same criteria as the district judge.see,ocasio hernández fortuño burset,cir.ocasio hernández points the way to the proper handling of a motion to dismiss.step one isolate and ignore statements in the complaint that simply offer legal labels and conclusions or merely rehash elements.id.at discussing,among other cases,ashcroft iqbal,d,and bell atl.twombly,d.step two take the complaint,facts as true,drawing all reasonable inferences in the pleader favor,and see if they plausibly narrate a claim for relief.id.again,discussing iqbal and twombly,among others see also tambone,cir en banc.plausible,of course,means something more than merely possible,and gauging a pleaded situation plausibility is a job that compels us to draw on our judicial experience and common sense.iqbal.at.and in performing our review,we realize too that we can consider a implications from documents attached to or fairly incorporated into the complaint,b facts susceptible to judicial notice,and c concessions in plaintiff response to the motion to dismiss.arturet vélez reynolds tobacco,cir see also haley city of boston,cir.
like the district judge,we skip over whether schatz complaint plausibly alleges defamation and focus on whether it plausibly alleges actual malice given that this is the simplest way to pinpoint schatz problem.not so fast,schatz says,suggesting that courts can not take that tack.unfortunately for schatz,he cites no case for the point,and we are aware of none,so we need say no more about that.see rodríguez municipality of san juan,cir.but before we tangle with the issue,we need to clear away some underbrush.
schatz intimates that the rslc should get less first amendment protection than traditional members of the institutional press.again,though,he makes the point in passing,with no case analysis,which does not put the matter in play here.id.he also faults the judge for dismissing his complaint without giving him the chance to fire up the process and at least get to the stage.but to access discovery mechanisms,a plaintiff must first produce a complaint that passes the plausibility test that helps keep defendants from wasting time and money in discovery on largely groundless claims.see twombly,at quoting dura,broudo,d internal quotation marks omitted.and it does no good to suggest,as schatz seemingly does,that a judge can cast aside complaints just shy of a plausible entitlement to relief on summary judgment because the high cost of litigation can scare defendants into settling even a weak case judgment,a claim must have some degree of plausibility before the parties are put through their discovery paces.see id.at.
we turn our attention,then,back to whether schatz allegations plausibly support an claim.his complaint used buzzwords,contending that the rslc had knowledge that its statements were false or had serious doubts about their truth and a reckless disregard for whether they were false.but these are merely legal conclusions,which must be backed by facts.see,ocasio hernández,at.as for facts,the complaint alleged that the rslc had basically branded him a criminal,falsely charging him with working with his to wrong ly divert in taxpayer funds to a political organization and then voting to kill a fireworks celebration.the reality,at least according to his complaint,is that town residents had voted in january to contribute to the coalition and that he had voted in march to fund the fireworks display.from these allegations schatz further insists that the rslc had portrayed him in a sinister light by connecting the two funding decisions the one had nothing to do with the other and by referring to the coalition as a political organization rather than by its name leaving the impression that maybe his political organization had gotten the grand.given what the newspapers had reported,which,according to the complaint,were the rslc sole sources of information,the rslc knew the offending statements were false or made them recklessly without any regard for the so schatz argues.he also points out that his complaint alleged that the rslc did not launch any additional investigation to determine whether what it said was true.and,reaching the ultimate crescendo,he contends that the complaint allegations plausibly show that the rslc acted with actual malice.
we think just the opposite.after comparing what the rslc proclaimed with what the newspapers disclosed as everyone agrees we should,we conclude that none of schatz points,individually or collectively,can save the day for him.
let us start with schatz beef with the rslc labeling wrong a vote by him and his to hand to a political organization 
the kennebec journal story spotlighted how some consider funding like that to be inappropriate.yet it is all perfectly legal,the article pointed out.schatz himself essentially seconded these sentiments.yes,some people raise questions whenever a town contributes to a political cause,but it would seem to be appropriate to chip in town money to the campaign,he is quoted as saying.and a commonsense reading of that article suggests that words like inappropriate and wrong surely is one are not synonyms for criminal.
blue hill approved the contribution,the article added.but neither that tidbit nor anything else there identified blue hill voters as opposed to blue hill officials as the approvers.also,schatz concedes that he and his colleagues had discretion over whether to contribute any of the in the first place,meaning that they did play a leading role in handing the coalition.undaunted,schatz argues here that because the kennebec journal story said that residents in other towns had voted or needed to vote on the contribution question,one can infer that blue hill residents and not blue hill selectmen had to approve the appropriation too given that in the words of his brief maine residents generally know and maine law generally provides that selectmen can spend public funds only for purposes authorized by voters at a town meeting.this is a nonstarter,however the article said nothing about whether these supposed appropriation rules apply uniformly across the state and,more importantly,to blue hill also,at the risk of sounding like a broken record,even schatz admits that he and his selectmen compatriots had the freedom to decide whether to contribute any money at all.
while we are talking about concessions,schatz once again concedes that the coalition is indeed a political organization.and the inference that he asks us to draw that political organization was
