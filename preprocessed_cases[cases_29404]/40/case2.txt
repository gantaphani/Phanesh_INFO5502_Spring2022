respondent hyatt claims that he moved from california to nevada in,but petitioner franchise tax board of california,a state agency,claims that he actually moved in and thus owes california millions in taxes,penalties,and interest.hyatt filed suit in nevada state court,which had jurisdiction over california under nevada hall,seeking damages for california alleged abusive audit and investigation practices.after this court affirmed the nevada supreme court ruling that nevada courts,as a matter of comity,would immunize california to the same extent that nevada law would immunize its own agencies and officials,see franchise tax bd.of cal.hyatt,the case went to trial,where hyatt was awarded almost million in damages and fees.on appeal,california argued that the constitution full faith and credit clause,art.iv,required nevada to limit damages to,the maximum that nevada law would permit in a similar suit against its own officials.the nevada supreme court,however,affirmed million of the award and ordered a retrial on another damages issue,stating that the maximum would not apply on remand.
the court is equally divided on the question whether nevada hall should be overruled and thus affirms the nevada courts exercise of jurisdiction over california state agency.
the constitution does not permit nevada to apply a rule of nevada law that awards damages against california that are greater than it could award against nevada in similar circumstances.this conclusion is consistent with this court precedents.a statute is a public act within the meaning of the full faith and credit clause.while a state is not required to substitute for its own statute the statute of another state reflecting a conflicting and opposed policy,carroll lanza,a state decision to decline to apply another state statute on this ground must not embody a policy of hostility to the public acts of that other state,at.using this approach,the court found no violation of the clause in carroll lanza or in franchise tax bd.the first time this litigation was considered.by contrast,the rule of unlimited damages applied here is not only opposed to california law of complete immunity it is also inconsistent with the general principles of nevada immunity law,which limit damages awards to.nevada explained its departure from those general principles by describing california own system of controlling its agencies as an inadequate remedy for nevada citizens.a state that disregards its own ordinary legal principles on this ground employs a constitutionally impermissible policy of hostility to the public acts of a sister state.at.the nevada supreme court decision thereby lacks the healthy regard for california sovereign status that was the hallmark of its earlier decision.ibid.this holding does not indicate a return to a complex approach to conflicts of law under the full faith and credit clause.at.rather,nevada hostility toward california is clearly evident in its decision to devise a special,discriminatory damages rule that applies only to a sister state.

franchise tax board of california,petitioner gilbert hyatt 
on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of nevada 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
in nevada hall,this court held that one state here,nevada can open the doors of its courts to a private citizen lawsuit against another state here,california without the other state consent.in this case,a private citizen,a resident of nevada,has brought a suit in nevada courts against the franchise tax board of california,an agency of the state of california.the board has asked us to overrule hall and hold that the nevada courts lack jurisdiction to hear this lawsuit.the court is equally divided on this question,and we consequently affirm the nevada courts exercise of jurisdiction over california.see,exxon shipping baker,citing durant essex,wall.
california also asks us to reverse the nevada court decision insofar as it awards the private citizen greater damages than nevada law would permit a private citizen to obtain in a similar suit against nevada own agencies.we agree that nevada application of its damages law in this case reflects a special,and constitutionally forbidden,policy of hostility to the public acts of a sister state,namely,california,art.iv,full faith and credit clause franchise tax bd.of cal.hyatt,quoting carroll lanza.we set aside the nevada supreme court decision accordingly.
gilbert hyatt,the respondent here,moved from california to nevada in the early.he says that he moved to nevada in september.california franchise tax board,however,after an investigation and tax audit,claimed that hyatt moved to nevada later,in april,and that he consequently owed california more than million in taxes,associated penalties,and interest.
hyatt filed this lawsuit in nevada state court against california franchise tax board,a california state agency.hyatt sought damages for what he considered the board abusive audit and investigation practices,including rifling through his private mail,combing through his garbage,and examining private activities at his place of worship.see app.
california recognized that,under hall,the constitution permits nevada courts to assert jurisdiction over california despite california lack of consent.california nonetheless asked the nevada courts to dismiss the case on other constitutional grounds.california law,it pointed out,provided state agencies with immunity from lawsuits based upon actions taken during the course of collecting taxes.cal.govt.code ann.west see also west.it argued that the constitution full faith and credit clause required nevada to apply california sovereign immunity law to hyatt case.nevada supreme court,however,rejected california claim.it held that nevada courts,as a matter of comity,would immunize california where nevada law would similarly immunize its own agencies and officials,for actions taken in the performance of a discretionary function,but they would not immunize california where nevada law permitted actions against nevada agencies,say,for acts taken in bad faith or for intentional torts.app.to pet.for cert.in franchise tax bd.of cal.hyatt.we reviewed that decision,and we affirmed.franchise tax,supra,at.
on remand,the case went to trial.a jury found in hyatt favor and awarded him close to million in damages both compensatory and punitive and fees including attorney fees.california appealed.it argued that the trial court had not properly followed the nevada supreme court earlier decision.california explained that in a similar suit against similar nevada officials,nevada statutory law would limit damages to,and it argued that the constitution full faith and credit clause required nevada to limit damages similarly here.
the nevada supreme court accepted the premise that nevada statutes would impose a limit in a similar suit against its own officials.see,see also.stat.but the court rejected california conclusion.instead,while setting aside much of the damages award,it nonetheless affirmed million of the award earmarked as compensation for fraud,and it remanded for a retrial on the question of damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress.in doing so,it stated that damages awarded on remand are not subject to any statutory cap.at,at.the nevada supreme court explained its holding by stating that california efforts to control the actions of its own agencies were inadequate as applied to nevada own citizens.hence,nevada policy interest in providing adequate redress to nevada citizens wa s paramount to providing california a statutory cap on damages under comity.at,at.
california petitioned for certiorari.we agreed to decide two questions.first,whether to overrule hall.and,second,if we did not do so,whether the constitution permits nevada to award hyatt damages against a california state agency that are greater than those that nevada would award in a similar suit against its own state agencies.
in light of our affirmance of nevada exercise of jurisdiction over california state agency,we must consider the second question whether the constitution permits nevada to award damages against california agencies under nevada law that are greater than it could award against nevada agencies in similar circumstances.we conclude that it does not.the nevada supreme court has ignored both nevada typical rules of immunity and california statutes insofar as california statutes would prohibit a monetary recovery that is greater in amount than the maximum recovery that nevada law would permit in similar circumstances.instead,it has applied a special rule of law that evinces a policy of hostility toward california.franchise tax,supra,at quoting carroll lanza,supra,at.doing so violates the constitution requirement that full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts,records and judicial proceedings of every other state.art.iv.
the court precedents strongly support this conclusion.a statute is a public act within the meaning of the full faith and credit clause.see,carroll lanza,supra,at see also referring to t he acts of the legislature in the full faith and credit context.we have said that the clause does not require a state to substitute for its own statute,applicable to persons and events within it,the statute of another state reflecting a conflicting and opposed policy.carroll lanza,at.but when affirming a state decision to decline to apply another state statute on this ground,we have consistently emphasized that the state had not adopt ed any policy of hostility to the public acts of that other state,at.
in carroll lanza,the court considered a negligence action brought by a missouri worker in arkansas courts.we held that the arkansas courts need not apply a time limitation contained in missouri but not in arkansas workman compensation law,at.in doing so,we emphasized both that missouri law compared with arkansas law embodied a conflicting and opposed policy,and arkansas law did not embody any policy of hostility to the public acts of missouri.at.this second requirement was well established in earlier law.see,broderick rosner,new jersey may not enforce a jurisdictional statute that would permit enforcement of certain claims under new jersey law but deny the enforcement of similar,valid claims under new york law hughes fetter,invalidating a wisconsin statute that close d the doors of its courts to an illinois cause of action while permitting adjudication of similar wisconsin claims.
we followed this same approach when we considered the litigation now before us for the first time.see franchise tax,at.nevada had permitted hyatt to sue california in nevada courts.see,at citing hall,at.nevada courts recognized that california law of complete immunity would prevent any recovery in this case.the nevada supreme court consequently did not apply california law.it applied nevada law instead.we upheld that decision as consistent with the full faith and credit clause.but in doing so,we emphasized both that the clause does not require one state to apply another state law that violates its own legitimate public policy,franchise tax,supra,at citing hall,supra,at,and nevada choice of law did not exhibi t a policy of hostility to the public acts of a sister state.franchise tax,supra,at quoting carroll lanza,supra,at.rather,nevada had evinced a healthy regard for california sovereign status,we said,by relying on the contours of nevada own sovereign immunity from suit as a benchmark for its analysis.franchise tax,supra,at.
the nevada decision before us embodies a critical departure from its earlier approach.nevada has not applied the principles of nevada law ordinarily applicable to suits against nevada own agencies.rather,it has applied a special rule of law applicable only in lawsuits against its sister states,such as california.with respect to damages awards greater than,the ordinary principles of nevada law do not conflic t with california law,for both laws would grant immunity.carroll lanza,at.similarly,in respect to such amounts,the polic ies underlying california law and nevada usual approach are not opposed they are consistent,at.
but that is not so in respect to nevada special rule.that rule,allowing damages awards greater than,is not only opposed to california law,it is also inconsistent with the general principles of nevada immunity law,see franchise tax,supra,at.the nevada supreme court explained its departure from those general principles by describing california system of controlling its own agencies as failing to provide adequate recourse to nevada citizens,at,at.it expressed concerns about the fact that california agencies operat e outside the systems of legislative control,administrative oversight,and public accountability that nevada applies to its own agencies.ibid.quoting faulkner university of,so.such an explanation,which amounts to little more than a conclusory statement disparaging california own legislative,judicial,and administrative controls,can not justify the application of a special and discriminatory rule.rather,viewed through a full faith and credit lens,a state that disregards its own ordinary legal principles on this ground is hostile to another state.a constitutional rule that would permit this kind of discriminatory hostility is likely to cause chaotic interference by some states into the internal,legislative affairs of others.imagine,for example,that many or all states enacted such discriminatory,special laws,and justified them on the sole basis that in their view a sister state law provided inadequate protection to their citizens.would each affected sister state have to change its own laws entirely,in order to respond to the new special laws enacted by every other state it is difficult to reconcile such a system of special and discriminatory rules with the constitution vision of individual and equally dignified states.in light of the constitutional equality among the states,coyle smith,nevada has not offered sufficient policy considerations to justify the application of a special rule of nevada law that discriminates against its sister states,carroll lanza,supra,at.in our view,nevada rule lacks the healthy regard for california sovereign status that was the hallmark of its earlier decision,and it reflects a constitutionally impermissible policy of hostility to the public acts of a sister state.franchise tax,supra,at quoting carroll lanza,supra,at.
in so holding we need not,and do not,intend to return to a complex approach to conflicts of law under the full faith and credit clause.franchise tax,at.long ago this court efforts to apply that kind of analysis led to results that seemed to differ depending,for example,upon whether the case involved commercial law,a shareholders action,insurance claims,or workman compensation statutes.see,bradford light clapper,carroll lanza,supra,at frankfurter,dissenting listing,and trying to classify,nearly cases.we have since abandoned that approach,and we continue to recognize that a state need not substitute the statutes of other states for its own statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it is competent to legislate.franchise tax,supra,at quoting pacific employers ins.industrial accident comm n.but here,we can safely conclude that,in devising a special and hostile rule for california,nevada has not sensitively applied principles of comity with a healthy regard for california sovereign status.franchise tax,supra,at see thomas washington gas light,plurality opinion clause seeks to prevent parochial entrenchment on the interests of other states allstate ins.hague,and stevens,concurring in judgment clause is properly brought to bear when a state choice of law threatens the federal interest in national unity by unjustifia
