opinion of the court 
shirley edwards filed suit against her employer,cornell and son,cornell,and supervisors,scott cornell and melissa closterman,claiming that she was terminated in violation of section of the employee retirement income security act of erisa and state common law after complaining to management about alleged erisa violations.the defendants filed a rule b motion to dismiss,and the district court granted the motion,holding that edwards complaints were not part of an inquiry or proceeding and thus not protected under section.on appeal,we are presented with a single issue of first impression for this court whether the provision of section of erisa,protects an employee unsolicited internal complaints to management.four federal courts of appeals have ruled on this issue the fifth and ninth circuits have held in the affirmative,and the second and fourth circuits have held in the negative.we agree with the latter,and hold that unsolicited internal complaints are not protected.
defendant cornell is a company that provides commercial and residential construction services.in march,cornell hired plaintiff edwards to serve as its director of human resources and to establish a human resources department.defendant cornell,an cornell executive,oversaw the terms and conditions of edwards employment,and defendant closterman,who managed the company daily operations,acted as edwards supervisor.edwards was employed by cornell for a total of nearly three years.as an employee,edwards participated in the company group health insurance plan,which was governed by erisa.
edwards claims that she discovered,during the last weeks of her employment,that cornell was engaged in several erisa violations the company was allegedly administering the group health plan on a discriminatory basis,misrepresenting to some employees the cost of group health coverage in an effort to dissuade employees from opting into benefits,and enrolling in its erisa plans by providing false social security numbers and other fraudulent information to insurance carriers.edwards alleges that she objected to complained to cornell management about these erisa violations and was terminated on or around february,as a result.app.at.according to edwards,closterman was directly responsible for her termination,and cornell participated.
on march,edwards filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against cornell,cornell,and closterman,asserting an claim under section of erisa and common law wrongful discharge.on may,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that edwards had not engaged in a protected activity under section.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss on july.after examining the circuit split on this issue,the district court determined that the second circuit analysis in nicolaou horizon media,cir per curiam,was persuasive and held that edwards failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because her alleged objections complaints to management were not part of an inquiry or proceeding 
plaintiff does not allege that anyone requested information from her or initiated contact with her in any way regarding the alleged erisa violations.nor does she allege that she was involved in any type of formal or informal gathering of information.she states merely that she objected to or complained about certain conduct by defendants.
app.at citations omitted.having dismissed edwards erisa claim,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over edwards state law claim for wrongful discharge.
edwards timely appealed,and the secretary of labor filed a brief as amicus curiae in support of edwards position.

the sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in holding that unsolicited internal complaints are not protected activities under the provision of section of erisa,we will affirm.
background 
erisa is a comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.shaw delta air lines,d.the statute imposes participation,funding,and vesting requirements on pension plans.it also sets various uniform standards,including rules concerning reporting,disclosure,and fiduciary responsibility,for both pension and welfare plans.id.at.as part of this system,congress included various safeguards to preclude abuse and to completely secure the rights and expectations brought into being by this landmark reform legislation.mcclendon,d quoting,at.one such safeguard is erisa or whistleblower provision,which provides as follows 
it shall be unlawful for any person to discharge,fine,suspend,expel,or discriminate against any person because he has given information or has testified or is about to testify in any inquiry or proceeding relating to this chapter or the welfare and pension plans disclosure act.
put simply,the purpose of the provision is to proscribe interference with rights protected by erisa,at.
b.the circuit split 
the federal courts of appeals are split on whether section encompasses unsolicited internal complaints.the fifth and ninth circuits have held in the affirmative,see anderson data,cir,and hashimoto bank of hawaii,cir,while the second and fourth circuits have held in the negative,see nicolaou,and king marriott int l,cir.
the ninth and fifth circuits were the first circuits to consider the issue.in each case,the plaintiff employee filed a complaint under state law alleging wrongful discharge for complaining to supervisors about alleged erisa violations hashimoto,at anderson,at.finding that section of erisa already provided employees with a remedy,the ninth circuit held that the employee state law claim was completely preempted by erisa and remanded the case to allow the state claim to be as a federal cause of action.hashimoto,at.the court explained that the failure of section to protect internal complaints would,in practice,inhibit the effectiveness of the provision 
the normal first step in giving information or testifying in any way that might tempt an employer to discharge one would be to present the problem first to the responsible managers of the erisa plan.if one is then discharged for raising the problem,the process of giving information or testifying is interrupted at its start the anticipatory discharge discourages the whistle blower before the whistle is blown.
id.at.shortly thereafter,the fifth circuit arrived at the same conclusion in anderson,holding that a state law claim for wrongful discharge was preempted by erisa in part because the cause of action would conflict with the enforcement provisions of a and of erisa.at.the court further explained,in broad terms,the employee claim falls squarely within the ambit of erisa,which addresses discharges for exercising erisa rights or for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of erisa rights,as well as discharges for providing information or testimony relating to erisa.id.quotations and citations omitted.
faced with the same issue,the fourth circuit has since drawn the opposite conclusion,holding that an employee state law wrongful discharge claim is not preempted by erisa because section does not protect unsolicited internal complaints.king,at.focusing on the proper scope of the phrase inquiry or proceeding,the court analogized section to the provision in the fair labor standards act flsa 
in the instant case,as well,the use of the phrase testified or is about to testify does suggest that the phrase inquir ies or proceeding s referenced in section is limited to the legal or administrative,or at least to something more formal than written or oral complaints made to a supervisor.the phrase given information does no more than insure that even the provision of information such as incriminating documents in an inquiry or proceeding would be covered.and,here as well,the provision in section is much narrower than the equivalent in title vii.
id.at first and second alterations in original footnote supplied.the fourth circuit found that the ninth and fifth circuit decisions in hashimoto and anderson,respectively,were not persuasive.according to the court,the ninth circuit in hashimoto improperly reject ed the most compelling interpretation of the statutory language for a fair interpretation,and the fifth circuit in anderson merely recited section without even addressing the facial inapplicability of section to complaints.id.at.
the sole federal court of appeals to address this issue in the context that we are presented with an employee actually brings suit under section of erisa the second circuit in nicolaou.at.unlike the fourth circuit in king,the second circuit found that section of erisa is unambiguously broader in scope than its counterpart in the flsa.id.at.nevertheless,the court held that unsolicited internal complaints are not protected activities.first,the court explained that internal complaints could not fall under the term proceeding because proceeding refers to the progression of a lawsuit or other business before a court,agency,or other official body.id.at.second,the court held that,for an internal complaint to constitute an inquiry,the employee would need to demonstrate that she was contacted to meet with management in order to give information about the alleged erisa violation.id.in other words,the employee complaint would need to have been solicited 
c.the plain meaning of section 
we begin our analysis of erisa provision with an examination of erisa statutory language because absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.wolk unum life ins.of,cir quoting kaiser aluminum chem.bonjorno,d other quotations and citations omitted.therefore,the first step is to determine whether section has a plain and unambiguous meaning.dobrek phelan,cir.words or provisions are ambiguous when they are reasonably susceptible of different interpretations.id.at quoting passenger atchison topeka santa fe ry,d.if there is an ambiguity,we look to the surrounding words and provisions and also to the words in context.id.
to reiterate,section of erisa provides as follows 
it shall be unlawful for any person to discharge,fine,suspend,expel,or discriminate against any person because he has given information or has testified or is about to testify in any inquiry or proceeding relating to this chapter or the welfare and pension plans disclosure act.
since edwards has undoubtedly given information by objecting complaining to management,at issue in this appeal is whether or not edwards did so in any inquiry or proceeding.the secretary of labor argues,in its brief as amicus curiae,that b roadly but naturally construed,any inquiry or proceeding encompasses plan participants complaints to management or plan officials about wrongdoing,and the process by which that information is considered,however informal.secretary br.at.we disagree.
an inquiry is generally defined as a request for information.black law dictionary ed.here,edwards does not allege that anyone approached her requesting information regarding a potential erisa violation.rather,she made her complaint voluntarily,of her own accord.under these circumstances,the information that edwards relayed to management was not part of an inquiry under the term plain meaning.
on appeal,edwards argues that her objections complaints were themselves the inquiry.we disagree.edwards complaints were statements regarding potential erisa violations,not questions seeking information.furthermore,because protects employees that have given information,not employees that have received information,a plain reading of the provision indicates that inquiry includes only inquiries made of an employee,not inquiries made by an employee.the fact that edwards complaints may have eventually culminat ed in an inquiry,see secretary br.at,underscores the fact that the complaints themselves,without more,do not constitute an inquiry.
neither is edwards conduct encompassed by the term proceeding.a proceeding is commonly defined as t he regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit or the procedural means for seeking redress from a tribunal or agency.black law dictionary ed.here,there is no suggestion that any such formal action has occurred 
in so holding,we follow the fourth circuit opinion in king.as the king court noted,even beyond the plain meaning of inquiry and proceeding,the phrase testified or is about to testify implies that the phrase inquiry or proceeding is limited to more formal actions.see king,at.not all statutes are so limited.in drafting,congress could have used broad language similar to that present in the provision in section a of title vii,which extends broad protection to employees that have opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by title vii.a.congress declined to do so,and,like the court in king,we find this choice to be persuasive.see king,at.finally,we agree with the fourth circuit that the ninth and fifth circuit opinions in hashimoto and anderson,respectively,are not compelling.neither court examined the statutory language of section in detail the fifth circuit gave the issue cursory treatment,see anderson,at,and the ninth circuit appeared to focus its analysis on the adoption of a fair interpretation,see hashimoto,at.see also king,at.
edwards and the secretary argue that we should give section a broader reading because erisa is a remedial statute.this connection is lacking.although erisa should be liberally construed in favor of protecting the participants in employee benefit plans,see iue pension fund barker williamson,cir,this does not entitle us to ignore clear statutory language.see wolk,at a bsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,erisa statutory language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.quotations and citations omitted.if section were ambiguous,we would construe the provision in favor of plan participants.however,as discussed above,we find the provision plain meaning to be clear.
likewise,edwards and the secretary argue that section deserves a broader reading because the failure to protect unsolicited internal complaints would undermine the provision purpose,as it would permit an employer to terminate an employee upon the employee first notifying the employer of the erisa violation.edwards br.at.this contention must also fail.presented as we are with clear statuary language,we do not need to speculate as to congress intent.it suffices to note that,had congress been concerned with such a scenario,congress could have used broad language mirroring the provision of title vii.congress chose not to do so.
analogous third circuit precedent 
contrary to the assertions of edwards and the secretary,the conclusion that section of erisa does not protect unsolicited internal complaints does not conflict with our prior case law regarding statutes.edwards and the secretary cite two opinions to that effect brock richardson,cir,which addresses the scope of section a of the flsa,and passaic valley sewerage commissioners united states department of labor,cir,which addresses the scope of section a of the clean water act cwa.neither case is controlling here.
brock is distinguishable because it concerned a different issue in the context of a different statute.we examined in brock whether an employer mistaken belief that an employee has engaged in protected activity is sufficient to trigger application of the provision of the flsa,and held in the affirmative.at.we did not address whether section a of the flsa protects internal complaints.there is a circuit split on this issue,which we have not yet joined 
even if we had held in brock that internal complaints are protected under the flsa,that conclusion would not be dispositive here.section a of the flsa and section of erisa are not identical.section a of the flsa extends broadly to persons that have filed any complaint,without explicitly stating the level of formality required.a.section of erisa,in contrast,extends only to persons that have given information or testified in an inquiry or proceeding.the word complaint is not even used.therefore,the conclusion that internal complaints are protected under the flsa does not require a parallel conclusion under erisa distinct statutory language.
passaic valley provides a closer comparison.in passaic valley,we examined,as here,whether intracorporate complaints are protected under section a of the cwa.at.section a provides as follows 
no person shall fire,or in any other way discriminate against,or cause to be fired or discriminated against,any employee or any authorized representative of employees by reason of the fact that such employee or representative has filed,instituted,or caused to be filed or instituted any proceeding under this chapter,or has testified or is about to testify in any proceeding resulting from the administration or enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
a.we held in passaic valley that the term proceeding within section a is ambiguous the term may reasonably be invoked to encompass a range of complaint activity of varying degrees of formal legal status.at.accordingly,we gave chevron deference to the secretary of labor final decision and order and held that intracorporate allegations are protected under the cwa.id.at.
although it might appear so at first glance,passaic valley is not dispositive here for a couple of reasons,not the least of which is that passaic valley addresses section a of the cwa,not section of erisa.first,to preclude an expansive use of our holding,we did not state in passaic valley that the term proceeding is necessarily ambiguous in all provisions.rather,we expressly stated that the term proceeding is ambiguous within a of the clean water act.id.at emphasis added.in so holding,we avoided the rote application of passaic valley in other contexts,such as that of section of erisa.
second,we gave chevron deference in passaic valley to the secretary of labor reasonably permissive construction that all good faith intracorporate allegations are fully protected from retaliation under a.id.at.contrary to the secretary suggestion here,we do not likewise owe chevron deference to the secretary allegedly consistent reading of section.although the department of labor is the federal agency in charge of overseeing erisa,see mack boring parts meeker sharkey moffitt,actuarial consultants,cir,we do not apply chevron deference to agency litigat ion positions that are wholly unsupported by regulations,ruling,or administrative practice,bowen georgetown,d.in passaic valley,we relied on the secretary final decision and order.at.here,in contrast,the secretary has not pointed to any regulations,rulings,or other material in support of its position.
therefore,rather than base our holding on our prior case law regarding section a of the cwa,we will ground our decision in the plain meaning of section of erisa itself.
in summary,we agree with the fourth circuit decision in king that unsolicited internal complaints are not protected under section of erisa,based on a plain reading of that provision terms.we will accordingly affirm the order of the district court 
unlike the court,i conclude that erisa provision does indeed protect an employee unsolicited internal complaints to management.accordingly,i must respectfully dissent.
the majority is obviously correct that the statutory interpretation process must begin with the actual language of section.specifically,the statutory language at issue is generally regarded as conclusive,at least in the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary.see,wolk unum life ins.of,cir.i further agree with the majority that the first step is to determine whether section has a plain and unambiguous meaning.dobrek phelan,cir citing barnhart sigmon coal,d.i,however,believe that the statutory language used in this provision is ambiguous.in fact,as explained below,i find it highly doubtful that congress could have ever intended for its provision to apply in the manner suggested by the majority,in particular because the majority interpretation leaves totally unprotected a certain category of conduct as well as the employees who may engage in such conduct that this remedial statutory provision was enacted to protect in the first place.see,disabled in action of southeastern.transp,cir stating that we avoid constructions that produce odd or absurd results or that are inconsistent with common sense quoting public citizen dep t of justice,d singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction,at ed.
initially,the majority does acknowledge at least some of the broad considerations underlying erisa and its provision,but it generally fails to give these various considerations the weight they deserve.accordingly,the majority recognizes that erisa,as a remedial statute,should be liberally construed in favor of protecting the participants in employee benefit plans.iue pension fund barker williamson,cir citations omitted.it likewise states that erisa is a comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries,see,shaw delta air lines,d the statute imposes different standards and requirements with respect to the operation of the plans themselves id.at.congress similarly included various safeguards in order to deter abuse and to completely secure the rights and expectations brought into being by this landmark reform legislation,mcclendon,d quoting,at and section,designed to eliminate interference with the rights protected by erisa,represents one of these critical statutory safeguards,id.i further note that congress viewed this section as a crucial part of erisa because,without it,employers would be able to circumvent the provision of promised benefits.id.at.citing,at,at.in other words,this provision plays a very important and even essential role in the proper implementation of the whole erisa scheme because it actually helps to make erisa promises credible.rail employees ass atchison,topeka santa fe ry,d quoting heath varity,cir.
far from liberally construing this remedial legislation in favor of the very persons it was designed to protect,the majority adopts an ultimately unsustainable interpretation.at least at times,it appears to follow the very narrow approach adopted by the fourth circuit in king marriott international,cir,as opposed to the more moderate position taken by the second circuit in nicolaou horizon media,cir per curiam.however,even the second circuit disagreed with the fourth circuit belief that congress use of the phrase testify or about to testify dictates the conclusion that section protects those who engage in something more formal than written or oral complaints made to a supervisor.id.at quoting king,at.the nicolaou court quite properly read this reference to testimony language as wholly irrelevant to our understanding of the language given information in any inquiry or proceeding.id.
more broadly,i acknowledge that the fifth circuit did not examine this issue in any real detail in its ruling in anderson electronic data systems,cir.on the other hand,the majority itself quotes the ninth circuit reasonable and ultimately persuasive explanation for why it concluded in hashimoto bank of hawaii,cir,that section does,in fact,encompass internal workplace complaints.it bears repeating here 
the normal first step in giving information or testifying in any way that might tempt an employer to discharge one would be to present the problem first to the responsible managers of the erisa plan.if one is then discharged for raising the problem,the process of giving information or testifying is interrupted at its start the anticipatory discharg
