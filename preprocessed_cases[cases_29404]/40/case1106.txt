opinion of the court 
the freedom of information act foia,requires a federal agency to disclose certain documents within its possession.but foia exempts from mandatory disclosure records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,b c exemption c,and defines person to include an individual,partnership,corporation,association,or public or private organization other than an agency.human beings have such personal privacy.this case requires us to determine whether corporations do,as well.
at t,at t argued that the federal communications commission fcc could not lawfully release documents obtained during the course of an investigation into an alleged overcharging on the ground that disclosure would likely invade the company personal privacy.the fcc rejected at t argument and held that a corporation,as a matter of law,has no personal privacy in the first place.at t filed a petition for review.we will grant the petition and remand to the fcc for further proceedings.
at t participated in a federal program administered by the fcc,called,that was designed to increase schools access to advanced telecommunications technology.as part of the program,at t provided equipment and services to elementary and secondary schools,and then billed the government for the cost of the equipment and services.in august,at t discovered that it might have overcharged the government for certain work done for the new london,connecticut school district.at t voluntarily reported the matter to the fcc,and the fcc enforcement bureau bureau conducted an investigation.the two sides ultimately resolved the matter via a consent decree.
during the course of the investigation,the bureau ordered at t to produce,and the company did indeed produce,a range of documents related to its work with the new london schools.those documents included invoices,internal providing pricing and billing information for the work done in new london,responses to bureau interrogatories,names of employees involved in the allegedly improper billing,and at t own assessment of whether and to what extent the employees involved in the overcharging violated its internal code of conduct.
on april,comptel,a trade association representing some of at t competitors,submitted a foia request for a ll pleadings and correspondence contained in the bureau at t investigation file.appendix app.at t submitted a letter to the bureau opposing comptel request,arguing that the fcc collected the documents that at t produced for law enforcement purposes and therefore that the fcc regulations implementing foia exemptions prohibited disclosure.comptel submitted a reply letter.
on august,the bureau issued a rejecting at t argument that exemption c and the fcc regulations implementing that exemption prohibit disclosure.that exemption,the bureau held,does not apply to corporations because corporations lack personal privacy.at t filed an application requesting the fcc to review the bureau ruling.on september,the fcc issued an order denying the application and compelling disclosure,again on the ground that exemption c does not apply to corporations.
before addressing the merits,the fcc held that at t failed to comply with the fcc regulations in filing its application for review of the bureau order.generally,only a foia requester may file an application for the fcc to review the bureau resolution of that request.but,there is an exception.according to i,when a foia request for inspection of records submitted in confidence pursuant to d or is granted even if only in part,the submitter of the addition to the file an application for review.the fcc determined,however,that at t did not submit the material it provided to the fcc in confidence pursuant to either of those regulations,because at t failed to include with that material a request that the fcc treat that material as confidential.nevertheless,the fcc stated that it would,on its own motion,consider the merits of at t application for review.app.
the fcc then held that a corporation lacks personal privacy within the meaning of exemption c.it determined that fcc precedent supports this view,app.citing chadmoore commc n,fcc rcd,as does judicial precedent,app.citing dep t of justice reporters comm.for freedom of the press,d.post dep t of justice,cohen epa.the fcc also concluded that this interpretation accords with the exemption purpose to protect key players in an,witnesses,and law enforcement the literal embarrassment and danger that an individual might suffer,rather than from the more abstract impact that a corporation might suffer.app.the fcc stated that a corporation privacy interests in other as fourth amendment law and the discovery regime created by the federal rules of civil no bearing on whether a corporation has a privacy interest in the context of exemption c.app.
at t filed a petition for review of the fcc order,arguing that the fcc incorrectly interpreted exemption c to prevent a corporation from claiming a personal privacy interest.at t further argues that,should we interpret the statute to allow a corporation to claim a personal privacy interest,disclosure of at t documents is,as a matter of law,reasonably likely to constitute an unwarranted invasion of that interest.the fcc and comptel who entered this case as an intervenor oppose on the merits and also raise certain threshold issues.comptel argues that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over at t petition for review and therefore must dismiss.the fcc argues that we should deny the petition for review because at t failed to challenge the fcc determination that at t did not comply with certain procedural requirements during the administrative proceedings 
the fcc had jurisdiction to issue its order denying at t application for review.see i providing that the fcc may perform any and all acts,make such rules and regulations,and issue such orders,not inconsistent with the communications act of communications act,as may be necessary in the execution of its functions,c authorizing the fcc to adjudicate applications for review of order issued by delegated panel.comptel argues that we lack appellate jurisdiction.we disagree.
comptel asserts that because the administrative procedure act apa confers at t cause of action,and because provides jurisdiction to review an apa claim,the district courts have jurisdiction to hear at t petition for review.comptel acknowledges that gives the courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction over orders under the communications act within the meaning of a,but argues that the fcc order in this matter is not such an order.
comptel made this argument for the first time to this court in opposing at t petition for review which is the first time it could have made this argument.therefore,there is no decision on this issue to review,and we will address the issue in the first instance.
section provides that t he court s of appeals ha ve exclusive jurisdiction to enjoin,set aside,suspend in whole or in part,or to determine the validity of all final orders of the fcc made reviewable by section a of title.a final order of the fcc made reviewable by section a of title,is,with certain exceptions not relevant here,an order of the fcc under th e communications act a.thus,we have jurisdiction to review the fcc order adjudicating at t application for review if that order is an order under the communications act.
courts have consistently held that an order adjudicating an alleged violation of fcc regulations is an order under the communications act within the meaning of a.see,rocky mountain radar,fcc,cir holding that an order determining that a business violated fcc regulations governing the marketing of devices is an order under the communications act within the meaning of a maier fcc,cir holding that order determining that a broadcasting company did not violate fcc regulations governing personal attacks on news subjects is an order under the communications act within the meaning of a.
the fcc order that is the subject of at t petition f
