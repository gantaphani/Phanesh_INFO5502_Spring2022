the section program is a vast effort on the part of federal,state,and local authorities to provide decent,safe,and sanitary housing to families,the elderly,and the disabled.the program is administered by the department of housing and urban development hud in conjunction with state and local public housing agencies across the country.under the part of the program at issue here state and local agencies enter into housing assistance payments hap contracts with private landlords,and the landlords agree to make units available to section assisted households.the assisted households,in turn,pay percent of their monthly adjusted income to their landlords in rent the landlords receive the remainder of the rent from the relevant public housing agency and the public housing agencies are fully reimbursed by hud the payments from the state and local agencies to the section landlords are adjusted periodically according to guidelines promulgated by hud.
are five limited partnerships that own multifamily housing rental projects in southern and central maine.all of the partnerships have entered into hap contracts with the maine state housing authority mainehousing in order to participate in the section program.in december,the partnerships sued mainehousing in federal district court for breach of contract,alleging that mainehousing had wrongfully refused to grant them certain annual increases in their section payments although mainehousing has allowed some upward adjustments.mainehousing,while denying the plaintiffs allegations,impleaded hud as a defendant,arguing that if mainehousing had breached its contracts with the partnerships,then it had done so only at hud direction.all parties sought summary judgment a magistrate judge recommended judgment for mainehousing and hud on the grounds that no material breach of contract had occurred and the district court adopted the magistrate recommended decision.the partnerships appeal,and we affirm.
although this case ultimately turns on a narrow question of contract law,it arises in the context of a complex web of statutes and regulations governing federal housing aid.in,congress amended the new housing act to add the provision commonly known as section this provision authorized the hud secretary to enter into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies pursuant to which such agencies may enter into contracts to make assistance payments to owners of existing dwelling units.housing and community development act of,a,stat,codified as amended at b amending united states housing act of,stat.while these annual contributions contracts make reference to particular projects,the only parties to the annual contributions contracts are hud and the public housing agencies administering the section program.between and,hud and mainehousing entered into annual contributions contracts covering each of the five sites at issue in the present litigation.
the original section statute provided that rents paid to landlords at program sites would be adjusted on at least an annual basis to reflect changes in the fair market rentals established in the housing area for similar types and sizes of dwelling units or,if the secretary determines,on the basis of a reasonable formula.stat.at codified at c a.to guard against these rent adjustments producing a windfall for section landlords,the statute added the caveat that automatic adjustments shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units,as determined by the secretary.id.codified at c c.these statutory provisions remain in force today.
pursuant to section,hud publishes automatic annual adjustment factors for specific census regions and metropolitan areas that reflect changes in the consumer price index for rent and utilities over the previous year.see.hud regulations state that section rents should be calculated by multiplying the applicable annual adjustment factor for the appropriate census region or metropolitan area by the rent stipulated by contract for each unit.
hud has also drafted a standard form contract for state and local agencies to use when entering into agreements with section landlords.once hud and mainehousing had entered into annual contributions contracts covering the five sites in question,mainehousing entered into housing assistance payments contracts with owners of the five properties.the hap contracts varied in duration,with the longest providing for renewals over the course of years,until.all of the hap contracts contained a provision,section b,stating that each year,the contract rents shall be adjusted by applying the applicable automatic annual adjustment factor most recently published by the government.all of the contracts also included an overall limitation clause section d,which states that 
notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract,adjustments as provided in this section shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units,as determined by the housing authority provided,that this limitation shall not be construed to prohibit differences in rents between assisted and comparable unassisted units to the extent that such differences may have existed with respect to the initial contract rents.
at the outset of the section program existence,public housing agencies applied the automatic annual adjustment factors published by hud and granted regular rent increases to section landlords hud,for its part,funded these rent increases through its annual contributions to the public housing agencies.in the early,however,officials at hud became concerned that the automatic annual adjustments were pushing rents at some section sites well above the market rates for comparable unsubsidized units.in,when hud and a local housing authority sought to prevent an automatic annual adjustment from taking effect at a section site in bremerton,washington,the affected landlord filed a federal suit.the ninth circuit held that despite the overall limitation clause in the hap contract between the section landlord and the local housing agency the landlord was still entitled to automatic annual adjustments in rental payments.rainier view assocs.united states,cir,cert.denied,d.hud refused to apply the rainier view decision outside of the ninth circuit,and other courts disapproved of rainier view holding.see,carmichaels arbors assocs.united states,sheridan square united states,leased hous.ass united states.
with litigation over the hap contracts pending in various federal courts,congress passed a series of amendments addressing hud efforts to rein in rent increases.the first two of these amendments,enacted in and,clarified the process by which the hud secretary could deny automatic annual adjustments at section sites.under the amendments,hud or a public housing agency could deny an automatic annual adjustment at a section site by submitting a comparability study to the project owner at least sixty days before the annual adjustment was set to take effect.see housing and community development act of,c,stat,codified at c c department of housing and urban development reform act of,c,stat,same.
after the and amendments,section landlords in washington and california brought suit again,claiming that their hap contracts entitled them to automatic annual adjustments without regard to the results of comparability studies conducted by hud.the ninth circuit reiterated its holding in rainier view and rejected hud argument that an overall limitation provision in the contracts permitted hud to use market rates to cap rent adjustments.alpine ridge grp.kemp,cir citing rainier view,at.the supreme court granted certiorari and reversed the ninth circuit decision.as justice white wrote for a unanimous court,the contract language is plain that no project owner may claim entitlement to rent adjustments that materially exceed market rents for comparable units.cisneros alpine ridge,d.the alpine ridge court concluded that the overall limitation clause affords hud sufficient discretion to design and implement a method for ensuring that contract rents do not rise above market rates.id.
one year after the alpine ridge decision,congress amended the section statute to place further limits on automatic annual adjustments.the law provided,in pertinent part,that 
w here the maximum monthly rent to be adjusted using an annual adjustment factor exceeds the fair market rental for an existing dwelling unit in the market area,the secretary shall adjust the rent only to the extent that the owner demonstrates that the adjusted rent would not exceed the rent for an unassisted unit of similar quality,type,and age in the same market area,as determined by the secretary.

whereas the and amendments saddled hud with the burden of producing a comparability study whenever it sought to withhold an automatic adjustment,the amendment seemed to shift the onus onto landlords to demonstrate that adjusted rents would not exceed the market rent for comparable units.see greenleaf.hous.dev,c,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.hud addressed this apparent tension in with the promulgation of notice h,which provided state and local housing authorities with detailed guidelines for implementing the previous year statutory changes.notice h directed housing authorities to consult a document published annually by hud that lists fair market rents for different unit types on a regional basis where the rent for a section unit that would result from the automatic adjustment is higher than the corresponding fair market rent listed in the tables,notice h instructs the public housing authority to presume that the contract rent is.see dep t of hous.urban,notice h,see also dep t of hous.urban,notice h may,carrying forward notice h method,carrying forward notice h.
in promulgating notice h,hud was aware that most section sites were subject to the same standard form hap contracts,and hud was likewise aware that under the overall limitation clause in those contracts,section landlords were entitled to receive rents to the extent that such differences existed at the outset of their contracts.see notice h,at need to assure that the initial difference which existed in the initial contract rents is protected,as required by the hap contract.accordingly,notice h prescribed a formula for calculating this initial difference times the initial section contract rent.put differently,hud adopted an assumption that,from the outset,public housing agencies were paying section landlords percent more than the fair market rents for comparable units.
as long as the difference between the adjusted rent and the fair market rent is less than this initial difference,notice h allows state and local housing agencies to continue to grant rent increases based on the automatic annual adjustment factors.however,if the difference between the adjusted rent and the fair market rate rises to more than percent of the initial contract rent,notice h instructs housing authorities to deny further upward adjustments to section landlords.a section landlord can only escape from under this ceiling by submitting its own rent comparability study showing that,despite the discrepancy with hud published fair market rents,the section unit is actually underpriced relative to comparable unsubsidized units in the area.
up until the publication of notice h,mainehousing made rent adjustments at all five properties every year in accordance with the automatic annual adjustment factors published by hud.for the first decade after notice h was promulgated,mainehousing denied the landlords requests for further upward adjustments,citing the limitations imposed by the hud notice.in,all five landlords submitted rent comparability studies to mainehousing in an effort to show that the percent formula underestimated the initial difference at their sites.based on these studies,and at the urging of mainehousing,hud agreed to let the five landlords use an alternative method for calculating the initial differences at their sites.rents rose at all five sites in,with increases of up to per unit per year although the amount of the increase varied from unit to unit and site to site.rents at three of the five sites have remained at levels,while hud has allowed further upward adjustments at the two other sites in subsequent years.
despite the rent adjustments for all five sites and additional increases at two of the five sites in subsequent years,owners of the five sites filed a complaint against mainehousing in federal district court in december alleging three counts of breach of contract.before addressing the merits of the landlords complaint,we pause to consider whether the suit belongs in federal court at all.although none of the parties raise the issue on appeal,we have an obligation to inquire into our subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte.liu amerco,cir.
in their complaint,the plaintiffs invoke federal subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to,which grants district courts original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.yet their only claims are for breach of contract,and they appear to acknowledge that their claims arise under the laws of the state of maine.as a general rule,federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over state law actions where,as here,the plaintiffs and the defendant hail from the same state.see.universalist convention hildreth rogers,cir per curiam.federal courts allow an exception to this rule only in the rare instance where the contract is governed by state law but a federal issue is decisive to the dispute and the federal ingredient is sufficiently substantial to confer the arising under jurisdiction,commercial owners,cir.
the federal ingredient doctrine applies in a special and small category of cases where a claim necessarily raise s a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.gunn minton,d internal quotation marks omitted see also rosselló gonzález calderón serra,cir.the supreme court recently reaffirmed the doctrine vitality in grable sons metal products,darue engineering manufacturing,d.and although we have emphasized that federal ingredient jurisdiction should be applied with caution,metheny becker,cir internal quotation marks omitted,this is one of the few cases that fits squarely within the federal ingredient exception.
the dispute in this case involves a federal contractor implementation of a federal program the contracts at issue were drafted and approved by a federal agency and signed by a federal official and the plaintiffs allege that the contractor here,mainehousing was in breach of the agreement by following a guideline promulgated by a federal agency pursuant to a federal statute.singly,none of these federal ingredients a claim against a federal contractor an agreement drafted and approved by a federal agency a defense based on a federal statute or guideline would be sufficient to establish arising under jurisdiction.see,empire healthchoice,mcveigh,d louisville nashville mottley.lindy lynn,cir ippolito lutz,harris.yet the scope of federal ingredient jurisdiction is determined by the totality of the circumstances,not by a test.see grable,at.based on the totality of the circumstances,we find that the federal ingredients of the case predominate.
it is of particular significance here that f ederal jurisdiction is favored in cases that present a nearly pure issue of law that could be settled once and for all and thereafter would govern numerous cases.bender jordan,quoting empire healthchoice,at.alterations and some internal quotation marks omitted.we note that other section landlords have brought almost identical actions elsewhere the outcomes of the legal questions in these cases will dictate whether hud the public housing agencies that administer section must pay millions of dollars in additional rents to landlords,which in turn could require the agencies to scale back the scope of the section program.the issue is potentially so important to the success of the section program since on its resolution may turn the amount of housing actually we believe that congress,had it thought about the matter,would have wanted the question to be decided by federal courts applying a uniform principle.price pierce,cir posner,see also almond cap,cir first circuit is content to follow price pending further enlightenment from the supreme court.moreover,there is no discernable state interest in a state forum that would outweigh the federal interest in uniformity.see bender,at see also fishermen alliance,dep t of envtl,cir.

the merits issues that we must decide are whether the hap contracts allow mainehousing to invoke the overall limitation clause to limit payments to the plaintiffs and if so,whether mainehousing properly invoked the overall limitation by employing the notice h method to calculate the difference between the plaintiffs contract rents and those of comparable unassisted units we are the first federal appellate court to reach this question although some federal trial courts in other circuits have answered this question in the negative we ultimately take our guidance from the supreme court alpine ridge decision.there,a unanimous court concluded that the terms of the overall limitation clause which apply notwithstanding any other provisions of the hap contract override conflicting provisions of any other section.alpine ridge,at.that conclusion survives the amendment to the section statute and controls our analysis here.
as we have noted,the overall limitation clause allows mainehousing to withhold the annual adjustments in rental payments so long as mainehousing has determined that the adjustments would result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units.the one caveat is that the overall limitation clause preserves the landlord right to receive rental payments to the extent of the initial difference between the contract rent and the market rate.mainehousing argues that it has used the method set forth in notice h to determine that further automatic adjustments would result in material differences between contract rents and market rates.that method relies on the tables of fair market rents published annually by hud if the contract rent is higher than the corresponding fair market rent for comparable units in the region and if the difference is more than percent of the initial contract rent,then a section landlord can not receive a further rent increase unless the landlord can show based on at least three examples of unassisted housing in the same market area of similar age,type and quality that the resulting rent level after application of the automatic annual adjustment will still be below the market rate.notice h,at.
the landlords maintain that mainehousing never determined that automatic adjustments would result in material differences between contract rents and market rates because the verb determine means to reach a decision after thought and investigation,webster new world dictionary ed emphasis added,whereas mainehousing rotely applied the notice h formula without any independent inquiry.but to determine also means to ascertain definitely by calculation.oxford english dictionary online ed see also the american heritage dictionary college ed ascertain definitely,as after calculation.mainehousing certainly calculated that the adjusted rents at assisted units would rise above the fair market rents for comparable units,and it based this calculation on a formula and data.the landlords dictionary definitions do not convince us that mainehousing act of calculation was anything but a determination.
the landlords also argue that the fair market rents published by hud can not be used as a measure of the rents charged for comparable unassisted units.the landlords suggest that unassisted units are only comparable to section units if they are in a similar neighborhood and share other common characteristics such as size,age,physical configuration,amenities,and utilities.hud fair market rent figures,by contrast,are calculated on a or basis.hud reports rents for zero,one,two,three,and units in each area,but the fair market rent figures do not include a more breakdown by unit type.
mainehousing and hud counter that the fair market rent figures are designed to reflect the rent,including the cost of utilities except telephone,that must be paid in the market area to rent privately owned,existing,decent,safe and sanitary rental housing of modest nature with suitable amenities.b.the figures are adjusted to exclude public housing units,newly built units and substandard units.id.a.thus,the fair market rent figures do provide a basis for comparing rents at privately owned section sites to rents for other units in the general vicinity,taking account of unit quality,amenities,utilities,and to some extent age.since hud reports rents at the percentile in each county or metropolitan area,this means that contract rents will only be deemed for purposes of notice h if rents at the section site are more expensive than rents for four out of ten existing decent,safe,and sanitary units in the area with the same number of bedrooms,same ownership status,and roughly the same amenities.moreover,hud has established a procedural mechanism by which landlords can challenge the results of the notice h calculation by submitting an appraiser market rent estimates based on at least three comparable units showing that adjusted rents would be consistent with prevailing market rates.see notice h,at see also dep t of hous.urban,estimates of market rent by comparison form hud july.indeed,the plaintiffs all took advantage of this mechanism when they submitted their own comparability studies to mainehousing and hud in the mid,and hud responded by approving upward adjustments at all five sites.
ultimately,we need not decide whether the notice h method is the best way to calculate rents for comparable unassisted units under the hap contracts.the contracts construed by the supreme court in alpine ridge are in all relevant respects identical to the contracts at issue here,and consistent with alpine ridge,we read the overall limitation clause as expressly assign ing to the agency the determination of whether there exist material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units.see alpine ridge,at.thus,our role is not to determine de novo whether this calculation was correct.rather,our role is to determine whether the notice h method represents a reasonable means of making the comparison.accord carmichaels arbors.at under our interpretation of the hap contract,any reasonable means of ascertaining whether material differences in rents exist is authorized under the terms of the contract.leased hous.ass n.at the hap contracts do not contain any provision limiting hud to any particular methodology for making its comparability determination we have already explained that mainehousing reliance on the notice h method while not the same as the studies that the landlords seek still does incorporate important consi
