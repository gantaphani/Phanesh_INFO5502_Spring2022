relator barry rostholder relator filed this qui tam action under the false claims act fca,through,against his former employer,omnicare,and its affiliated companies.relator alleged that the defendants violated a series of food and drug administration fda safety regulations requiring that penicillin and drugs be packaged in complete isolation from one another,which violations resulted in a legal presumption of penicillin.according to relator,these contaminated drugs were not eligible for reimbursement by medicare and medicaid and,therefore,any claims presented to the government for reimbursement for these drugs were false under the fca.
the district court granted omnicare motion to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.because relator already had filed two amended complaints,the court denied any further leave to amend.upon our review,we hold that relator complaint failed to allege that the defendants made a false statement or that they acted with the necessary scienter.we also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relator request to file a third amended complaint.we therefore affirm the district court judgment.
omnicare provides certain pharmaceutical services to senior citizens through its drug repackaging and pharmacy facilities.as alleged in relator second amended complaint,omnicare owned heartland repack services,llc heartland,the drug repackaging operation at issue in this case located in toledo,ohio the toledo building.heartland repackaged drugs into convenient units for patient use.omnicare also operated hundreds of pharmacies nationwide,including a pharmacy that shared the toledo building with heartland.such pharmacies primarily served nursing homes owned by omnicare partner,health care resources.
although heartland repackaged drugs for distribution,the omnicare pharmacy that shared the toledo building processed penicillin products.the pharmacy and the repackaging operations were located in the toledo building,and were separated by rolling doors.within the building,employees of both the repackaging and pharmacy units shared break areas,entrances,and exits.the toledo building also had a single ventilation and system.
from until,relator,a licensed pharmacist,was employed at heartland.relator job responsibilities included overseeing repackaging,quality assurance,regulatory affairs,and wholesale and distribution.in,omnicare executive and relator supervisor,denis holmes,suggested that heartland begin repackaging penicillin products.relator informed holmes that any repackaging of penicillin drugs would constitute a violation of fda regulations requiring the separate processing of penicillin and products.
relator conducted further research regarding the fda penicillin isolation requirements and stated his conclusions in a memorandum that he provided to holmes.relator also contacted the pharmacy manager in the toledo building,who informed relator for the first time that the pharmacy frequently repackaged penicillin,despite sharing the building with heartland drug packaging operation the heartland facility.at holmes request,relator researched and recommended ways in which heartland could repackage penicillin in compliance with fda regulations.
in february,relator resigned from heartland due to his concerns about the facility quality control efforts.several months after his resignation,relator notified the fda of heartland improper repackaging practices.based on this information,fda investigators visited the heartland facility and were advised by employees that no penicillin was being repackaged in the repackaging division.based on these representations,the investigators left the heartland facility.
relator later participated in an interview with fda officials,during which h e described the specific details of the penicillin exposure at the heartland facility.in the summer of,the fda conducted another inspection of the heartland facility and discovered that penicillin was being repackaged in the toledo building.testing revealed the presence of penicillin throughout the building,including in the heartland facility.as a result,the fda issued a warning letter to omnicare the warning letter,outlining numerous violations of fda regulations,both related and unrelated to omnicare practices of handling penicillin.the warning letter explained that omnicare failure to adhere to the fda current good manufacturing practice regulations the cgmps caused the drugs to be adulterated.
rather than quarantining and conducting tests on its products,omnicare disposed of nearly million worth of inventory.according to the complaint,omnicare at that time had not recalled any of its drugs due to suspected penicillin contamination,nor had omnicare reimbursed the government for amounts already paid for the contaminated drugs.
in may,relator filed this action under the fca,a,a,and a and similar state statutes,against omnicare and its affiliated companies collectively,omnicare relator alleged that omnicare knowingly recklessly repackaged drugs at the toledo building in violation of applicable laws,including the cgmps,which rendered the drugs presumptively unsafe under the cgmps,and therefore adulterated and misbranded,and therefore not in their form,and thus ineligible for coverage under government programs.the government declined to intervene in the action.
the district court granted omnicare motion to dismiss,holding that relator had failed to allege that omnicare made a false statement to the government or engaged in fraudulent conduct.the court also held that relator had not adequately alleged the details of any false claims that had been submitted to the government for reimbursement.after the court denied relator motion for leave to amend his complaint,relator timely appealed.
before addressing the merits of relator arguments on appeal,we first consider omnicare assertion that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this action due to the public disclosure bar in the fca.we review this jurisdictional question de novo,and examine the district court jurisdictional findings of fact for clear error.ex rel.vuyyuru jadhav,cir ex rel.grayson advanced mgmt,cir see also gaines motor lines,klaussner furniture,cir noting our obligation to assure ourselves of our jurisdiction.
the version of the public disclosure bar in place at the time of the relevant provided 
a no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government general accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
b for purposes of this paragraph,original source means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.
e emphasis added.omnicare argues that the public disclosure bar divested the district court of jurisdiction because relator complaint is based upon the warning letter and omnicare form ks filed with the securities and exchange commission sec omnicare also asserts that relator is not an original source of the information in the complaint.we disagree with omnicare arguments.
under this court precedent,a qui tam action is based upon publicly disclosed allegations only if the qui tam plaintiff allegations were actually derived from the public disclosure itself.ex rel.wilson graham cnty.soil water conservation,cir,rev on other grounds by,d emphasis in original.a qui tam action will not be barred if the plaintiff claims are similar or even identical to the publicly disclosed allegations,so long as the plaintiff had independent knowledge of the facts and did not derive his allegations from the public disclosure itself.id.
we conclude that relator fca complaint was not based upon the warning letter or sec filings,d
