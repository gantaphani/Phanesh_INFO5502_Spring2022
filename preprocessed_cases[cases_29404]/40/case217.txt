buntha ly,a native and citizen of cambodia,seeks review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia,which upheld an immigration judge ij denial of his request for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.we deny ly petition.
ly entered the united states on a tourist visa on april,and did not leave when his visa expired on october.on november,ly filed an application for asylum.more than three years later,on february,the department of homeland security initiated removal proceedings against ly,who conceded removability and sought asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.
ly testified in support of his application at a hearing on may.he also provided documentary evidence to corroborate his account.we briefly summarize ly testimony,which the ij found credible.
ly was born in cambodia in.in november,when ly was eighteen years old,two police officers stopped him on the way to school and forcibly conscripted him into the cambodian military.ly served for eight years and achieved the rank of second lieutenant.he left the military in,following the dissolution of his unit.for the next two years,he worked a variety of jobs.
in,ly joined the national united front for a neutral,peaceful,cooperative,and independent cambodia funcinpec.as a party member,he made,posted,and distributed signs and flyers.he also solicited campaign donations.his activities were supervised by general ho sok,a senior funcinpec member.
on may,funcinpec won the national election.however,the rival cambodian people party cpp,led by a man named hun sen,refused to yield power and threatened civil war.the two parties ultimately agreed to a arrangement.
following the election,ho sok,now a government official,hired ly as a police officer and assigned him to the department unit as a second lieutenant.the police force included members of both funcinpec and the cpp.ly reported to both ho sok and general uno hinko,a cpp member.when he accepted his job as a police officer,ly knew the work was dangerous and that he risked personal harm.
in,acting on ho sok orders,ly led a team of thirty police and military officers to confiscate about kilograms of marijuana that was being shipped by a man named mong rithy.rithy was a prominent cpp member and a close friend of hun after the marijuana had been seized,rithy denied that it was his,claiming it instead belonged to a funcinpec member.rithy also made death threats against the officers who had participated in the seizure.the incident created further tension between funcinpec and the cpp.
in early july,hun sen successfully led a violent cpp coup against funcinpec.during the conflict,ho sok disappeared ly believes he was killed by the cpp.
ly was one of many funcinpec members in the police department who did not report for duty for one month after the coup.he returned to work after hun sen newly appointed prime minister,a senior funcinpec official,assured funcinpec members that they could safely resume their duties.
in,the cpp won the national election.however,funcinpec officials continued to serve in the government.ly remained an active funcinpec member.
on june,ly was ordered to confiscate about kilograms of opium and arrest the individuals smuggling it,who were affiliated with hun the seized opium was stored in the unit office for a long time.under pressure from international supporters of cambodia efforts,general heng pao,a cpp official and close associate of hun sen,publicly pledged to burn the opium.heng pao instead burned a fake box and sold the opium for profit.
ly learned of heng pao deception and investigated the opium sale,with help from his friend and fellow officer,savoeun sar.the two uncovered information about heng pao buyer.but heng pao heard about ly and sar inquiries and warned them to stay quiet about their discovery.despite heng pao warning,the details of the opium sale were eventually leaked to the public.
some time after the leak,heng pao arranged for sar to be dispatched to investigate an incident report.upon arrival,sar was fatally shot by two unknown individuals,who planted opium on his motorcycle.after sar death,heng pao accused sar of having been a drug dealer.
ly feared that he would suffer the same fate as sar.he believed heng pao and the ccp were determined to eliminate all funcinpec members from the unit.on february,ly received word from a friend that heng pao was planning to kill him like he had killed sar.ly moved his wife and two children to his home in the countryside and stopped going to work.in april,he fled cambodia and traveled to the united states.ly family remained in cambodia.
at some point after ly departure,two police officers came to his family home.the officers were looking for ly son,who had allegedly caused some injury to hun the officers insisted that ly son appear in court or pay for pain and suffering.when ly wife said she did not have the money,the officers hit her.
the officers noticed a photograph of ly in his police uniform hanging on the wall.they asked who the man in the photograph was,and ly wife replied that it was her husband,who had moved to the united states.the officers said they were looking for him.ly wife ultimately paid the officers,after which they left,insisting that she had two weeks to pay them an additional.after this incident,ly family relocated to a village on the border.
ly documentary evidence included,among other materials,a photograph of ly in his police uniform,photographs of sar corpse,a letter from a funcinpec official confirming ly party membership and warning that ly faced danger if he returned to cambodia,an affidavit from ly wife,and ly identification cards from the military,the police department,and funcinpec.ly also provided information and media reports on conditions in cambodia.
the ij found ly testimony credible but denied his petition because ly had failed to establish a nexus between his fears and one of the five statutorily protected grounds.see a a.the ij found that ly fears were solely a product of his having conduct ed himself honorably as an honest police officer in the past and potentially being in the future victimized or perhaps even killed by corrupt police officers and criminals in the country of cambodia.the ij held that the failure of ly asylum claim meant he could not satisfy the more exacting requirements for withholding of removal and rejected ly application for cat relief,since ly had not claimed he would be tortured in cambodia.
the bia affirmed the ij denial of ly application for asylum and withholding of removal.the bia concluded that ly fears were not related to a protected ground,citing the absence of any evidence that the threats ly received were even in part motivated by his political opinion.it found that ly was instead likely threatened to discourage him from reporting the actions of corrupt police officers.the bia also rejected ly argument that he had a fear of future persecution on the basis of his membership in the social group former police officers.
the bia further agreed with the ij determination regarding ly ineligibility for withholding of removal and noted that he had failed to appeal the ij denial of cat relief.
