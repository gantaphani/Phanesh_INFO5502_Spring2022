under the fair labor standards act,et,employers and unions may agree through collective bargaining to exclude any time spent in changing clothes at the beginning or end of each workday from compensable work time.o.in this case,we are asked to determine whether the donning and doffing of protective gear at a poultry processing plant constitutes changing clothes within the meaning of section o.we conclude that it does.consequently,the employer and union here they currently donning and doffing from compensable work time.
our holding,of course,does not mean that employees should not be paid for time spent donning and doffing protective gear.instead,it simply recognizes that the purpose of section o is to leave this issue to the process.employers and unions are free to determine for themselves how much compensable time should be allocated and for what activities of changing clothes.this sort of determination has classically been grist for the mill of collective bargaining,and congress ensured that employers and unions could keep it that way by enacting section o.
allen family foods,the company is engaged in the business of processing poultry.it operates several plants,including one in harbeson,delaware that employs approximately people.a production line conveys poultry through this plant for processing and then packaging for eventual distribution.
the employees who work on the production line are required to wear the following items safety,shoes,a united states department of agriculture usda required smock,a usda required plastic apron,safety glasses,ear plugs,a bump cap,a hair net,usda required rubber gloves,sleeves,and arm shields.the company commonly refers to these items as either protective gear or personal protective equipment.
at the beginning of each workday,production employees must don these items.they typically do so in the plant locker room or as they walk from the locker room to the production area.once they enter that area,they sanitize their gear by dipping their gloves into a tank,splashing the liquid solution onto their aprons,and stepping through a footbath.after ward,they take their places along the production line and begin the task of processing poultry.
each day,the employees receive a lunch break,during which no chickens are placed on the production line.employees are free to leave the production area when the last chicken passes their stations but are expected to be back when the first new chicken arrives.during the lunch break,they typically take off their gloves and aprons,wash up,and then walk to the cafeteria.upon returning to the production area,they put these items back on and then sanitize them before resuming work.at the end of each workday,the employees are not required to go through a particular routine.but they typically rinse and doff their gear before leaving the plant.
the company has a practice of paying these employees on the basis of line time.that is,it pays them for time spent processing chickens on the production line it does not pay them for time spent donning and doffing protective gear,walking to and from the production area,or washing their gear before or after work.employees also do not receive compensation during the lunch break.
donning and doffing time has been the subject of collective bargaining at the harbeson plant.in,united food and commercial workers local,which represents most of the production employees at the plant,proposed that its members be paid for twelve minutes of donning and doffing time per day.the company and the union did not agree to that proposal,however.
in january,three production employees filed a collective action against the company under b of the fair labor standards act flsa.they were joined by approximately current and former production workers who opted in to the action collectively the employees.the employees claimed,among other things,that the company had violated the flsa by not compensating them for time spent donning and doffing their protective gear.
after discovery,the company moved for summary judgment.its primary argument was that its pay practices were permissible under o of the flsa,which allows employers and unions to exclude any time spent in changing clothes at the beginning or end of each workday from compensable work time.in response,the employees sought,by cross motion for partial summary judgment,a holding that section o did not bar their suit.the main issue of contention was whether donning and doffing protective gear constituted changing clothes within the meaning of the section.
adopting the eleventh circuit analysis in anderson cagle,cir,cert.denied,d,the district court held that the donning and doffing of the protective gear was changing clothes.accordingly,it entered summary judgment for the company.the employees now appeal.
we begin with a brief overview of the relevant statutory provisions.the flsa guarantees covered employees a mini mum hourly wage for their work and entitles them to one and times their regular wage for overtime.a recurrent question under the act has been when the compensable workday begins and ends.the question often arises where,as here,employees perform some tasks before productive work begins.
the flsa does not define work or workweek.but two statutory provisions do bear directly on the question of when the compensable workday begins.the first is section of the act,which amends the flsa.it provides,among other things,that employers are not required to pay their employees for activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to the principal activities for which they are employed,unless the employer agrees to do so.a,b.under this provision,activities like changing clothes and washing which are performed before or after the regular work shift are ordinarily considered preliminary or postliminary activities and are therefore excluded from compensable work time by default.steiner mitchell.changing clothes and washing are not so excluded,however,if they are an integral and indispensible part of an employee principal activities.id.at.
the second is section o of the flsa.this section provides 
hours determining for the purposes of the minimum wage and overtime provisions of this title the hours for which an employee is employed,there shall be excluded any time spent in changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end of each workday which was excluded from measured working time during the week involved by the express terms of or by custom or practice under a bona fide agreement applicable to the particular employee.
o emphasis added.
while these two provisions both bear on whether changing clothes and washing count as part of the compensable workday,they operate in different yet interrelated ways.as the supreme court has noted,section o clear implication is that clothes changing and washing,which are otherwise a part of the principal activity under the act,may be expressly excluded from coverage by agreement.steiner,at.that is,even if changing clothes and washing are integral and indispensible and therefore not excluded from work time by default under the act,an employer and union may nonetheless opt out by excluding such time under their agreement.see livadas bradshaw,d describing section o as an opt out provision.
in this case,either provision could potentially exclude the time that the employees spend donning and doffing.it is an open question in this circuit whether donning and doffing protective gear is a preliminary or postliminary activity or integral and indispensible to the principal activity of poultry processing.if it is the former,then time spent on the activity is excluded by default under the act.the district court did not reach that question,however,and we need not do so here.for whatever the applicability of the act exclusion,the time spent on these activities may be excluded from the compensable workday if section o applies.
section o applies to donning and doffing of protective gear at the beginning and end of each day if two conditions are met.first,these activities must constitute changing clothes within the meaning of the statute.second,time spent on these activities must be excluded from the wo
