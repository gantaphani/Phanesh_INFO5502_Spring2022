albion francis,a former federal employee,appeals the district court dismissal,pursuant to.b,of the employment discrimination claim he attempted to bring under the religious freedom restoration act.the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over francis claim of religious discrimination because any such claim must be brought under title vii of the civil rights act of.the district court also held that the action must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because francis failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under title vii.see c.
we disagree with the district court finding that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction.it had federal question subject matter jurisdiction under.however,because we may affirm a result reached by a district court on different reasons,as long as the record supports the judgment,brumfield sanders,cir citation omitted,we will affirm as a dismissal under.b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted 
as we explained in robinson dalton,cir 
although the district court in this case described its preliminary evaluation as jurisdictional,this court has previously determined that questions of whether a plaintiff has timely exhausted the administrative remedies in title vii actions are in the nature of statutes of limitation.they do not affect the district court subject matter jurisdiction.moreover,in title vii cases courts are permitted in certain limited circumstances to equitably toll filing requirements,even if there has been a complete failure to file,which necessarily precludes characterizing such requirements as jurisdictional.
it follows that the motion to dismiss should have been treated under rule b.

factual background 
in,congress enacted the aviation and transportation security act,stat,creating a federal workforce to screen passengers and cargo at the nation commercial airports.am.fed of gov t employees loy.pursuant to the authority contained in that act,the transportation security administration tsa assumed responsibility for security screening in the nation commercial airports 
in october,tsa hired albion francis as a security screener at the henry rohlsen airport in croix,virgin islands.francis is an male who wears his hair in dreadlocks,which he declares to be an important expression of his sincerely held religious beliefs.
all new tsa employees are required to undergo forty hours of classroom training and sixty hours of training.on october,tsa new transportation screeners in the virgin islands,including francis,began their training at the rohlsen airport.prior to administering the oath of employment to the screeners,deputy federal security director lawrence londer told the new screeners that they were part of a uniformed service and were therefore subject to the mandatory grooming policy that tsa had established for its uniformed employees.londer stated that if this policy presented a problem to anyone,should not take the oath of employment.he then administered the oath of employment to those present,including francis.
at an orientation session approximately one week later,tsa screening manager steven betz noticed that three screeners,including francis,had hairstyles that did not conform to the agency grooming policy,and he informed them that they had to conform to that policy.
francis alleges that he informed betz that he would not cut his dreadlocks,and told him that the refusal to cut his dreadlocks was based on his religious beliefs.francis further alleges that betz then ordered him to sign a separation agreement,terminating his employment.thereafter,francis filed the instant suit in the district court.
ii.district court proceedings 
francis asserts a cause of action for religious discrimination under the religious freedom restoration act rfra.he named as defendants norman mineta,the of transportation the department of transportation the tsa and the united states.the complaint alleges that tsa fired him because he refused to comply with tsa grooming policy.it also alleges that the grooming policy,as applied to him,violates rfra because it substantially burdens his sincerely held religious beliefs without furthering any compelling governmental interest 
the government moved to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction under.b.the government argued that title vii of the civil rights act of is the exclusive remedy for asserting claims of federal employment discrimination.the government also argued that the suit should be dismissed because francis had not exhausted his administrative remedies.
in granting the government motion to dismiss,the district court held that the comprehensive and exclusive remedial scheme of title vii precludes francis attempt to obtain redress under rfra.the district court also agreed that francis was required to administratively exhaust his claim as provided in title vii.this appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
as noted above,francis claims that his dreadlocks have religious significance and that tsa grooming policy substantially burdens his free exercise of religion because it forces him to remove the dreadlocks despite their religious significance.francis argues that the policy can not be applied to him under rfra unless the government can demonstrate that it furthers a compelling governmental interest.he relies upon the following provisions of rfra 
free exercise of religion protected 
a in general 
government shall not substantially burden a person exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,except as provided in subsection b of this section.
b exception 
government may substantially burden a person exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person 
is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and 
is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
francis also claims that the plain text of rfra clearly gives him and other federal employees a right to sue under the statute.he points to two subsections to support his claim b stating that one of the purposes of rfra is to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government.and c a person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.standing to assert a claim or defense under this section shall be governed by the general rules of standing under article iii of the constitution.
we can best respond to francis reliance on rfra by reiterating the background of that statute.in adams comm r of internal revenue,we explained i n enacting rfra,congress specifically announced its intent to restore the compelling interest test set forth in sherbert verner and wisconsin yoder and to guarantee its application in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened,cir quoting b.
under the compelling interest test,the supreme court had traditionally held that laws that substantially burden the free exercise of religion must be supported by a compelling interest to survive scrutiny under the first amendment.however,in,the supreme court decided employment,dep t of human res.smith,d.there,the supreme court held that the free exercise clause did not require oregon to exempt the sacramental ingestion of peyote by members of the native american church from oregon criminal drug laws.id.at.the court concluded that such generally applicable laws may be applied to religious exercise even in the absence of a compelling governmental interest.id.at.congress responded by enacting rfra.
enacted in,rfra applies to all federal law and the implementation of that law,whether statutory or otherwise,adopted both before and after the passage of rfra.a.despite the apparent limitless scope of rfra,congress was careful to circumscribe its reach.accordingly,in a section captioned other areas of law are unaffected,the senate report on rfra states a lthough the purpose of this act is only to overturn the supreme court decision in smith,co
