consolidation coal company consolidation appeals from the benefits review board the board decision affirming an administrative law judge the alj decision and order that consolidation must pay daniel smith smith or claimant benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca or the act,for an injury he suffered while working for consolidation.consolidation argues that the board erred in affirming the alj because smith did not satisfy the test under the status of the injured individual and the situs of the injury.maher terminals,office of workers comp.programs,cir.for the reasons explained below,we find that the lhwca covers smith injury.smith satisfies the test.we shall affirm the board decision.
background 
smith was a diesel mechanic for consolidation at robena preparation plant facility robena,where he worked in a maintenance garage.robena is located in greensboro,pennsylvania,adjacent to the monongahela river.consolidation prepares and processes coal at robena.also,it receives raw coal from barges,moves the coal by conveyor belts through the processing plant,loads the processed coal back onto barges,or stockpiles and ships the coal later.clean coal is also occasionally stockpiled beside the river rather than loaded directly onto the barges.coal is then dropped into a machine called a hopper and goes to the river tipple and into the barges smith testified that,at robena,he worked on any equipment that ran on fuel.relying on documentary and testimonial evidence,the alj found that smith did not work on vessels or components of vessels,and records showed that the virtual entirety of his work was as a mechanic performing repairs on terex machines and other heavy equipment.app.at.
the robena facility covers approximately seven hundred acres.the garage where smith injury occurred is approximately one hundred yards from the edge of the monongahela river.the garage is adjacent to the stockpiled coal,and to four quonset huts,where steel cables,used as barge running lines,are stored.the garage is also located approximately one hundred fifty feet from the hopper.
on june,smith was injured while repairing a terex machine that had become disabled while loading coal into the hopper belt,which was adjacent to the garage.he shoveled coal out of the terex onto the belt and brought the terex to the garage for repairs.while using a sledgehammer to remove rusted hinge pins from the terex,smith injured his back.
as a result of the injury,smith had back surgery and has not returned to work.he received benefits under pennsylvania workers compensation law.on may,smith filed a claim for benefits under a of the act.on march,the parties requested by joint motion that the issue of jurisdiction be bifurcated from all other issues in the case.id.the alj granted that request on march,and held a formal hearing on the issue of jurisdiction on march,in pittsburgh,pennsylvania.
in his decision and order,the alj determined that smith was eligible for compensation under the act.specifically,the alj held that smith satisfied both the status and situs aspects of the jurisdictional test.
first,the alj decided that smith was a maritime employee,and thus had status under,stating 
i find that the evidence of record establishes that claimant was responsible for servicing mobile equipment,including terex machines,which were used to load coal from operations on land to barges.claimant stated,and darrell smith smith supervisor confirmed,that terexes were used,in part,to load coal into the hopper,from which coal goes into the river tipple and directly onto barges.the supreme court has held that a person engaged in some portion of loading is as much an integral part of the process of loading and unloading as a person who participates in the entire process.pfeiffer,ford.the third circuit concluded that activities are indeed maritime if they are an integral or essential part of the chain of events leading up to the loading,unloading,or building of any vessel,rock,cir.further,it is reasonable to conclude that a cessation of barge loading of robena would occur if a mechanic such as claimant did not service heavy equipment at the facility used,in part,in the loading process.thus,claimant work is an integral or essential part of the chain of events ensuring that the loading process proceeds as employer business requires.
app.at.the alj also determined that smith was injured on a covered situs under the act.the alj reasoned that the garage was essential to the unloading of coal from vessels,was located within and around essential elements that comprise the loading process,and provided a site for repairs on equipment active in the loading process.additionally,the alj noted that the terex machine broke down in the midst of loading coal onto the belt,and was squarely within robena loading or unloading area at the time.as a result of these findings,the alj decided that t he geography and function of the garage were sufficiently related to navigable waters such that claimant established he was injured on a covered situs.id.at.
consolidation filed a notice of appeal with the board on december,and submitted a brief in support of its appeal on february.on september,the board issued a decision and order affirming the alj.
before the board,consolidation first contended that smith lacked status because the terex is not used primarily to load coal,and smith repairs other equipment as well.id.at.the board found that these uncontested facts were not dispositive,because it read the supreme court decision in chesapeake and ohio ry.schwalb,to hold that a claimant contribution to the loading process need not be constant.id.citing schwalb,at.further,the board held that the alj rationally found that interruption of barge loading at the robena facility would occur if a mechanic did not service the heavy equipment used in the loading process.accordingly,the alj properly concluded that smith work repairing the terex machine is integral to the loading process.id.at internal citations omitted.
additionally,the board found that substantial evidence supports the alj finding that smith spent at least some of his time in indisputably maritime work as this repair work was a regular part of smith job.id.quoting maher,at.
the board also affirmed the alj decision that smith injury occurred on a covered situs specifically,the alj ruled that the garage was a covered situs.in so ruling,the board recognized that this circuit has not addressed whether a situs where an employer maintains and repairs equipment used in both its and its plant operations,such as the robena garage where smith was injured,is an adjoining area under c of the act.the board relied on statutory construction and authority from the united states courts of appeal for the first,fifth,and ninth circuits.the board rejected consolidation contention that a of the act mandates that the site of an injury must be specifically used for loading,unloading,repairing,dismantling,or building a vessel to constitute an adjoining area.app.at.rather,the board found that because the garage had both a functional and geographical nexus to the loading site on the river,it was a covered situs under the act.
on november,consolidation filed a timely petition for review in this court seeking reversal of the board decision.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we exercise jurisdiction over this matter,pursuant to c,which gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction to review final orders of the benefits review board,rock,cir.we review the board decision to determine whether the board acted in conformance with applicable law and within its proper scope of review.id.citation omitted.the board is bound by the alj factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence.kowalchick,office of workers comp.programs,cir.in reviewing the board decision,we must therefore independently review the record and decide whether the alj findings are supported by substantial evidence.id.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla,and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.
because the board does not administer the lhwca,our review of its interpretation of the act is essentially plenary but we will respect the board interpretation if it is reasonable.maher,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
iii.analysis 
consolidation argues that the board erred in affirming the alj decision that smith met both the situs and status tests under the act based on our review of the record,we conclude that the board acted in conformance with applicable law and the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence.we find that smith injury placed him within the ambit of the act status and situs requirements.
consolidation argues that smith does not meet the act status requirement.it contends that his work as a mechanic was not integral to the loading and unloading process,and that when he was injured,while repairing the terex,he was neither engaged in the loading or unloading of ships,nor was he performing duties integrally connected with the loading or unloading process at the river edge.
with regard to status,of the act states that a covered employee must be a person engaged in maritime employment,including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations,and any including a ship repairman,shipbuilder,and,but such term does not include certain enumerated categories of employees under.schwalb,at.
maritime employment within the meaning of expressly includes the specified occupations but obviously is not limited to those callings.id.at citing herb welding,gray.in schwalb,the supreme court held that covered activities included those of employees who are injured while maintaining or repairing equipment essential to the loading or unloading process id.at.there,the court upheld coverage for three employees,two of whom were responsible for ordinary janitorial services in addition to cleaning spilled coal from loading equipment to prevent it from malfunctioning.it found that s omeone who repairs or maintains a piece of loading equipment is just as vital to and an integral part of the loading process as the operator of the equipment.id.additionally,the court held that i t is irrelevant that an employee contribution to the loading process is not continuous or that repair or maintenance is not always needed.id.the determinative consideration is that the ship loading process could not continue unless the machinery that claimant worked on was operating properly.id.at.
we reject consolidation argument that smith fails to meet the status requirement.first,the fact that smith did not repair the terex at river edge,a requirement that consolidation apparently reads into the status test,is not dispositive.as the supreme court has indicated,the purpose of the test is to cover those workers on the situs who are involved in the essential elements of loading and unloading.herb welding,at.additionally,pursuant to the test articulated by the supreme court in schwalb,we have held that l activity occurring within the section situs should be deemed maritime only if it is an integral or essential part of the chain of events leading up to the loading,unloading,or building of a vessel.rock,at.thus,although smith work was,because the alj found his work to be integral or essential to robena loading or unloading operations,he met the act status requirements.app.at.
we also reject consolidation argument that the alj had no basis for finding that smith work was so integral or essential as to be covered by the act.in support of this argument consolidation contends that smith regular job as a mechanic included repair and maintenance of processing equipment that was not integral to the loading or unloading of coal.however,as the board held,covered employees include those whose contribution to the loading process,like smith,need not be continuous.see schwalb,at see also maher,at looking to the regular portion of overall tasks to which claimant could be assigned and whether he spends at least some of his time in indisputably longshoring operations.
the alj found,based on testimony from claimant and his supervisor,darrell smith,that claimant was responsible for servicing mobile equipment including terexes.he also found that the terex is used,at least in part,to load stockpiled coal into the hopper,which transfers the coal to a conveyor belt,which then transfers the coal to a barge on the river.consolidation does not challenge the alj finding that the terex was used at times to load processed coal ultimately deposited onto barges.the board,relying on schwalb,properly found the terex function to move coal was not a disqualifying factor.
this aspect of claimant employment creates a sufficient nexus to the loading and unloading of cargo,unlike the work of the employee in rock,who is the focus of consolidation argument.see,at insufficient nexus found where claimant,a courtesy van driver,may have occasionally transported longshoremen within employer maritime facility,but job description did not include this responsibility.the testimonial evidence above supports the alj conclusion that claimant responsibilities were integral to the loading or unloading of coal.
the alj further relied on claimant and darrell smith evidence in concluding that a cessation of barge loading at robena would eventually occur if a mechanic like claimant did not service heavy equipment used in the loading process.the board affirmed the alj decision,finding immediate cessation of loading was not disqualifying because it could eventually happen because we find that the alj relied on substantial evidence in determining that smith repair work was essential to,and an integral part of,the chain of events ensuring the continuation of the loading or unloading process,we find this conclusion reasonable as well.
consolidation next argues that that board situs determination was incorrect.the situs requirement concerns the location where a claimant seeking coverage under the act suffered his or her injury.consolidation contends that smith was not injured on a covered situs because the garage in which he was injured was not an adjoining area customarily used by consolidation for the loading,unloading,repairing,dismantling,or building of vessels.consolidation posits that the language of a makes clear that a site qualifies as an adjoining area under the provision only if it is used for those enumerated purposes.section a states 
except as otherwise provided in this section,compensation shall be payable under this chapter in respect of disability or death of an employee,but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the united states including any adjoining pier,wharf,dry dock,terminal,building way,marine railway,or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading,unloading,repairing,dismantling,or building a vessel.
a.because smith was not actually on navigable water or on a pier,wharf,dry dock,terminal,building way,or marine railway at the time of his injury,the determinative question is whether the garage in which smith injury occurred is an adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading,unloading,repairing,dismantling,or building a vessel.id.
the alj found that the garage was yards from a navigable waterway and that it was neither an area used by consolidation for loading or unloading coal,nor was it used for repairing,dismantling,or building vessels.app.at.rather,it was used for the repair of equipment essential to the loading and unloading of coal from vessels.id.therefore,we must determine whether the garage constitutes an adjoining area under a and whether the garage,a site used for the repair of equipment essential to the loading and unloading of coal from vessels,is a covered situs under a.
adjoining area 
although consolidation argument focuses on the alj finding with respect to the usage part of the situs test,it also argues that the alj conclusion leads to a definition of adjoining area far more expansive than that contemplated by the act.before,the act limited coverage to workers only for injuries occurring on navigable waters.schwalb,at.the situs test therefore drew a sharp line between injuries sustained over water and those suffe
