during the summer of,plaintiffs southern blasting services,and piedmont drilling blasting,set up operations in wilkes county,north carolina.southern blasting purchases hmta class explosives and has them hauled to its magazine site in wilkes county,where they are stored until sold to industrial customers.southern blasting has also expressed an interest in manufacturing explosives at its site,but it has not yet done so.piedmont drilling conducts blasting operations by drilling holes in rock formations,loading the holes with explosives,and detonating the explosives to loosen or remove the rock.
shortly after plaintiffs established their explosives businesses in the county,citizens began to voice objections to their operations.on september,approximately county residents attended the meeting of the wilkes county board of commissioners to express their views.and the board was presented with a petition containing signatures opposing explosives operations in the county.due to safety concerns and this public outcry,the board voted unanimously to have a committee draft ordinances that would establish both a permit system and a comprehensive set of regulations for the operation of explosives businesses.
on june,after several months of work by the appointed committee,the board unanimously adopted the wilkes county explosive materials permitting ordinance.the permitting ordinance required applicants to obtain a permit from the county fire marshal prior to possessing,storing,selling,transporting,or otherwise dealing in explosive materials in wilkes county.in addition,the permitting ordinance provided that only businesses operating in the county on the day the ordinance was adopted could apply for a permit.and the ordinance gave ultimate authority to the fire marshal.see permitting ordinance art.vi.however,the application process included a public hearing and consultation with the federal bureau of alcohol,tobacco firearms batf,the county planning department,the county health department,the county building inspections department,and the board.see permitting ordinance art.vi e.further,the permitting ordinance specifically excluded ammunition or firearms dealers licensed under federal or state law from its requirements.see permitting ordinance art.v,vi a.
on august,the board also unanimously enacted the wilkes county explosive materials ordinance the regulatory ordinance,which became effective on december,after the necessary approval was obtained from the north carolina building code council.this ordinance addressed the storage and use of explosives in the county.specifically,the regulatory ordinance restricted the manufacture of explosives,required installation of security measures at storage locations,set limits on the quantity of stored explosives,and established penalties for violations.see regulatory ordinance art.vi,vii.like the permitting ordinance,the regulatory ordinance excluded the possession,transportation,storage,and use of small arms ammunition from its scope.see regulatory ordinance art.
plaintiffs did not apply for a permit under the permitting ordinance.instead,plaintiffs initiated this action,alleging that the permitting and regulatory ordinances were preempted by federal law,were invalid under north carolina law,and violated their due process rights.plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the ordinances.the district court concluded that both the permitting and regulatory ordinances were valid and granted summary judgment to the county and the fire marshal.see blasting,wilkes county,d.
the district court held that plaintiffs preemption claim failed because congress did not intend to occupy the field of explosives regulation and plaintiffs had failed to show a direct and positive conflict between the ordinances and any federal law.id.at.the court also concluded that the ordinances and their enabling statute,were valid under article ii,of the north carolina constitution,which prevents the north carolina general assembly from promulgating certain acts of less than statewide application.the court found that granted authority to regulate explosive substances uniformly to all north carolina counties in conformance with article ii.id.at.
the district court next rejected plaintiffs substantive due process claim,finding that the ordinances were a valid exercise of the county police power and were rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.id.at.finally,because plaintiffs had not even applied for a permit,the district court concluded that they lacked standing to assert a procedural due process challenge to the ordinances.id.at.plaintiffs appeal.
we begin by considering plaintiffs preemption claim.it is that the supremacy clause invalidates state laws that interfere with,or are contrary to,federal law.hillsborough county automated med,d quoting gibbons ogden,wheat.the supreme court has repeatedly held that state laws can be preempted by federal regulations as well as by federal statutes and that for the purposes of the supremacy clause,the constitutionality of local ordinances is analyzed in the same way as that of statewide laws.hillsborough,at.citing cases.
yet c onsideration under the supremacy clause starts with the basic assumption that congress did not intend to displace state law.maryland louisiana,d.this presumption is strongest when congress legislates in a field which the states have traditionally occupied.medtronic,lohr,d internal quotation omitted.states have long possessed primary responsibility in our federal system for protecting the health and safety of their citizens.id.at.indeed,courts start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.id.at.quoting rice santa fe elevator.
nevertheless,there are several ways in which federal law may supersede state or local law.first,congress may expressly preempt such laws.see,hillsborough,at.second,in the absence of express preemptive language,congress intent to preempt state law may be implied when federal law so thoroughly occupies a legislative field as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it.cipollone liggett group,d internal quotations omitted.finally,preemption will also be implied if state or local law actually conflicts with federal law.such a conflict occurs when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.hillsborough,at.internal quotations omitted.
plaintiffs claim that federal law regulating the manufacture,distribution,and storage of explosive materials preempts the county permitting and regulatory ordinances.they maintain that the county ordinances are superseded because of the exhaustive nature of federal law in the explosives field,and because various provisions of the ordinances are in direct and positive conflict with federal regulations.
the federal law governing explosive materials is codified at.section,entitled effect on state law,provides 
no provision of this chapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the congress to occupy the field in which such provision operates to the exclusion of the law of any state on the same subject matter,unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such provision and the law of the state so that the two can not be reconciled or consistently stand together.
this statutory language makes clear that congress did not intend to occupy the field of licensing and regulating explosives operations.in preemption analysis,t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone.retail clerks int l ass n,local schermerhorn,d.here congress has stated in the clearest of terms that it was not preempting local efforts to regulate the explosives industry,absent a direct and positive conflict with the federal standards.in fact,as the district court recognized,is designed to limit the preemptive scope of the federal law and expressly disclaims any intent to occupy the field.blasting,d at 
contrary to plaintiffs assertions,the comprehensiveness of federal law in the explosives area does not override this clear expression of congressional intent in.the supreme court has noted that contemporary issues often require intricate and complex responses from the congress,but without congress necessarily intending its enactment as the exclusive means of meeting the problem.hillsborough,at.internal quotation omitted.this is especially true in a case such as this one where wilkes county acted pursuant to its traditional police powers.indeed,the court will seldom infer,solely from the comprehensiveness of federal regulations,an intent to preempt in its entirety a field related to health and safety.id.at.
congress desire not to preempt state and local efforts to regulate explosive materials is unsurprising given the fact that conditions in states and localities vary greatly.for example,local governments may determine that the use or storage of explosives is particularly dangerous due to population density or the proximity of explosives to schools,nursing homes,or residential areas.congress did not intend to preempt democratic responses to such local conditions and concerns.instead,by allowing state and federal regulations to coexist,congress was fostering the values of federalism and recognizing the historic primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety.medtronic,at.plaintiffs on the other hand,ask this court to cut the democratic process short by declaring the county ordinances void and unenforceable.
we are similarly unpersuaded by plaintiffs argument that the county ordinances are invalid because they are in direct and positive conflict with the federal law governing explosive materials.the direct and positive conflict language in simply restates the principle that state law is superseded in cases of an actual conflict with federal law such that compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility.hillsborough,at.internal quotation omitted.indeed,explains that in order for a direct and positive conflict to exist,the state and federal laws must be such that they can not be reconciled or consistently stand together.
to support their argument that a direct conflict is present in this case,plaintiffs point to numerous provisions of the county permitting and regulatory ordinances that impose more stringent requirements than those contained in the federal regulations.for example,unlike the federal regulations,the permitting ordinance requires a permit applicant to submit a detailed history of all past and present operations,detailed written information on the applicant financial ability,and an estimated schedule of all activities and operations the applicant plans to conduct.see permitting ordinance art.vi c.
however,a state or locality imposition of additional requirements above a federal minimum is unlikely to create a direct and positive conflict with federal law.rather,a conflict is more likely to occur when a state or locality provides that compliance with a federal standard is not mandated,or when compliance with federal law actually results in a violation of local law.here,even though the county ordinances are strict,they do not create a situation where the ordinances and the federal law can not be reconciled or consistently stand together.
the batf,which is authorized to issue regulations to administer the federal explosives laws,has stated that a federal license to import,manufacture,or deal in explosive materials does not exempt a licensee from state and local requirements.indeed,a federal license confers no right or privilege to conduct business or operations,including storage,contrary to state or other law.and a federal licensee is not immune from punishment for conducting an explosive materials business or operations in violation of the provisions of any state or other law.id.further,batf has explained that w here a situation arises that state or local requirements are more stringent than the federal,the more stringent requirement must be followed.law and regulations,atf p at june.
moreover,batf actually examined the county permitting and regulatory ordinances and stated in a letter that while the ordinances contain some provisions which are more stringent than those contained in,it does not appear that compliance with the wilkes county ordinances would result in a violation of.to the contrary,compliance with the more stringent requirements of the county ordinances actually helps to assure compliance with the federal requirements.
we also reject plaintiffs argument that the ordinances can not be reconciled with federal law because the regulatory ordinance prevents licensed companies from expanding,and because the permitting ordinance prevents new companies from establishing explosives operations in the county.see regulatory ordinance art.vi c permitting ordinance art.vi j.nothing in the federal explosives statute or regulations prevents localities from regulating or even limiting the number of explosives operations in their midst.the fact that federal law regulates the operations of explosives companies does not imply that congress intended to stop a locality from going further to reduce their risks.this is especially true in light of the strong language in explaining that no provision of the federal explosives law shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the congress to occupy the field in which such provision operates to the exclusion of the law of any state on the same subject matter.
we next turn to plaintiffs claim that the county ordinances and their enabling statute are invalid under the north carolina constitution.the permitting and regulatory ordinances were enacted pursuant to,which states that a county may by ordinance regulate,restrict,or prohibit the sale,possession,storage,use or conveyance of any explosive,corrosive,inflammable,or radioactive substance.plaintiffs contend that both and the county ordinances are invalid under article ii,of the north carolina constitution because they affect trade or business but do not have statewide application.
we note at the outset that a federal court should be exceedingly cautious about invalidating a state statute or a local ordinance under a state constitution.like most states,north carolina recognizes a presumption in favor of the constitutionality of a state statute.gardner city of reidsville.in order for an act of the general assembly to be declared unconstitutional under the north carolina constitution,it must be plainly and clearly the case.if there is any reasonable doubt,it will be resolved in favor of the lawful exercise of the general assembly powers,town of emerald isle state,internal quotation omitted.
