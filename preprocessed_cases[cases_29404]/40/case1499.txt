warren county,virginia sheriff deputies william smoot,michael beatty,troy oakes,george lewis,and harry ferguson collectively,appellants appeal a district court order denying their motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds in an action brought by mary short,individually and as a representative of the estate of her husband,thomas lee short.short action alleges that appellants acted with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk that short would commit suicide while detained in the warren county jail.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
in reviewing an order denying summary judgment based on qualified immunity,we accept as true the facts that the district court concluded may be reasonably inferred from the record when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see prince george county,cir.thus,for purposes of resolving this appeal,we assume the following facts 
o n january,thomas lee short was arrested and jailed for assault and battery of his wife,in violation of a september protective order that prohibited short from having any contact with her,from committing acts of family abuse,and from drinking alcoholic beverages.after his release on january,short went to the blue ridge motel in front royal,virginia,and began drinking heavily.around,short called his wife,mary short,and told her that he was planning to kill himself.short,concerned that her husband would carry out his threat,called the warren county sheriff office to request that they check the local bridges.that office advised her to call the front royal town police,which she did.
soon after calling his wife,short also called his daughter,linda good,to tell her that he wanted to die,and to ask if she could come pick him up.when she arrived at the motel,good found her father so drunk that she decided it would be better to let him sleep and return the next morning.short called his wife again at and repeated his threat to kill himself.he also called his daughter,who told him she would pick him up at noon the next day.
before she returned to the hotel,good spoke with short,and they decided to have short arrested again for violating the september protective order,believing that this course of action would keep him from harming himself.short went to the magistrate office to file a criminal complaint and the magistrate issued a warrant for short arrest.the magistrate then contacted the front royal town police and told the officer that short was basically a drunk,that he was intoxicated,and that he had called his wife threatening to kill himself.the officer,sergeant clint keller,went to the short residence,arrested short,and transported him to the warren county jail.
sergeant keller took short before the magistrate,who issued an order remanding short to custody until he could appear in warren county general district court the next day.sergeant keller then turned short over to the deputies on duty at the jail.defendants smoot,beatty,oakes,and lewis were in the jail monitor room,where sergeant keller advised them that short had been arrested for violation of a protective order,that he was drunk,and that he had been calling his wife threatening to kill himself.
the warren county jail policy and procedures manual,in effect on january,addressed proper treatment of potentially suicidal inmates.the manual required custodial officers to remove all potential tools such as sheets,blankets,and shoelaces,to conduct inmate checks at random intervals,at least twice per hour,and to make reports of any unusual occurrences.the defendant deputies also received training in treatment of potentially suicidal inmates.if the deputies were aware that the inmate was suicidal,they were instructed to remove his clothing,place him in a suicide smock,call mental health services,and conduct checks at intervals.
when an intoxicated inmate was brought to the jail,deputies would attempt to process him.if the inmate was unable to give a medical history,then the typical practice was to place the intoxicated inmate in the jail sick cell,separate from the general population,to sober up,and also to remove all items that could be used for purposes.
despite sergeant keller statement that short had threatened to kill himself,the deputies never removed short clothing and shoelaces or called for a mental health evaluation.sergeant smoot took him from the booking area to the bathroom and then to the sick cell,where he removed short belt.several hours later,smoot heard banging coming from the sick room.he asked short if he was all right,and short responded that he was fine.he did not apprise the other deputies of the disturbance,nor did he make a report of an unusual occurrence.deputy lewis checked on short twice,at approximately and both times short was lying in bed with a sheet over him and appeared to be asleep.deputy oakes also checked on short around,and observed that he was asleep.
sergeant smoot and deputies lewis,oakes,and beatty shifts ended at and defendants deputies ferguson,kensy,and seal arrived.no one in the departing shift informed the incoming deputies that short had threatened to kill himself the incoming deputies were only aware that an intoxicated detainee had been brought in and placed in the sick room.
the warren county jail used surveillance cameras to monitor inmate activity.there were a number of television screens that displayed images from these cameras in the jail monitor room.during the evening shift,deputy ferguson,the,was in the monitor room from approximately to,and was responsible for observing monitors as well as answering the telephone and admitting any visitors.he acknowledged that he was aware that an inmate was in the sick cell on the evening of january,and that he observed the monitor showing activity in the sick cell.he left the monitor room for a short time at approximately to respond to an inmate waving a towel at the camera.deputy seal was not working in the monitor room.he made rounds of the cells at approximately,and again between and seal did not check on the sick cell where short was housed,believing that it was unoccupied.deputy kensy was in the jail records room filing from to.he passed through the monitor room for a few minutes,but was not present at the jail between and.
the court has reviewed the videotape taken from the surveillance camera that recorded short activity in the sick room on january.between approximately and,short removed the laces from his shoes,tied them together,and climbed from his bed to the bars of his cell.he tied the shoelaces to the bars and tested their strength.he then tied the laces around his neck.short repeated this process a number of times,alternating between climbing on the bars and sitting on his bed for several minutes at a time.at approximately,short again climbed from his bed to the bars of his cell,placed the noose around his neck,and hung himself.it was not until approximately,when deputy seal escorted a new detainee to the sick room,that the deputies discovered short body.

short subsequently brought this action against appellants,deputies kensy and seal,and warren county sheriff daniel mceathron,pursuant to west,contending that the officers violated her husband rights under the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the eighth amendment by exhibiting deliberate indifference to the substantial risk that he would commit suicide.after the district court dismissed sheriff mceathron from the action,all remaining defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court denied the motion as to deputies smoot,beatty,oakes,and lewis the officers,concluding that the forecasted evidence permitted the reasonable inference that the conduct of the officers constituted deliberate indifference because the officers all were aware of the risk that short would commit suicide yet failed to follow jail procedure or even take the simple precaution of warning the next shift that short was at risk.the court also denied the motion as to deputy ferguson,concluding that the forecasted evidence supported the inference that he exhibited deliberate indifference because he actually witnessed fergus
