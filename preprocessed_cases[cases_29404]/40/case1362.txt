in september,philip benham,sheryl chandler,and operation save america collectively,the plaintiffs,initiated this u.action in the western district of north carolina,seeking injunctive relief and damages from the city of charlotte and two of its officials,keith parker and emily westbrook collectively,the city.the plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that two charlotte ordinances contravene,inter alia,the free speech clause of the first amendment and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.following discovery,the city moved for summary judgment on all aspects of the complaint and,on january,the district court granted the motion.see benham city of charlotte,d the opinion.the plaintiffs have appealed the court summary judgment ruling.as explained below,because the plaintiffs are unable to sustain their burden of demonstrating that they suffered a cognizable injury,we vacate the judgment and remand for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.
in january,the plaintiffs sought to obtain a permit to conduct an event at independence square plaza in downtown charlotte to speak about the supreme court roe wade decision.those events provide the background for these proceedings,and we begin with an overview of the bifurcated legal framework that governs public gatherings in charlotte.one ordinance applies to public assembl ies,see charlotte city code to the public assembly ordinance,and a separate ordinance applies to picket s,see id.to the picketing ordinance.the public assembly ordinance defines a public assembly as 
a festival or demonstration which is reasonably anticipated to obstruct the normal flow of traffic upon any public street and that is collected together in one place and 
a festival on the old city hall lawn,the government center plaza,or in marshall park,polk park,independence square plaza,arequipa park or any other park.
id.as used in the public assembly ordinance,a festival is a concert,fair,exhibit,promotion,community event,block party,or similar event.id.a demonstration is a public display of sentiment for or against a person or a cause,including protesting.id.
a group seeking to conduct a public assembly including a demonstration anticipated to obstruct street apply for and obtain a permit before the event takes place.charlotte city code a.the public assembly ordinance spells out several reasons for which a permit may be denied.see id.c.if a permit official denies an application,the permit applicant may appeal,and an appeals official is obliged to conduct a hearing.id.f.if the denial of the permit application is upheld on appeal,the applicant is entitled to appeal to the superior court of mecklenburg county.id.
pursuant to the picketing ordinance,a picket is defined as 
a public display or demonstration of sentiment for or against a person or cause,including protesting which may include the distribution of leaflets or handbills,the display of signs and any oral communication or speech,which may involve an effort to persuade or influence,including all expressive and symbolic conduct,whether active or passive.
charlotte city code.a group seeking to conduct a picket may hold the event by right,without the prior issuance of a permit.id.a.picketing ordinarily may be conducted on public sidewalks,independence square plaza,or any other park,and shall not be conducted on the portion of the public roadway used primarily for vehicular traffic.id.picketing may not,however,be conducted in certain parks in charlotte,including independence square plaza,during a festival that has been permitted at that particular property or when that property has been otherwise reserved for private use.id.b.
the foregoing legal framework operates in practice as follows.first,an event must be characterized as a festival or a demonstration.if the event is a festival,the organizer must obtain a public assembly permit before holding the event.if the event is a demonstration,it may proceed without a prior permit unless either the space has been reserved under b,or the event is reasonably anticipated to obstruct the normal flow of traffic upon any public street under.when the event would so interfere with traffic,the event organizers must apply for and obtain a permit beforehand.the bottom line,then,is that a demonstration is regulated as a public assembly for which the prior issuance of a permit is it will interfere with traffic,but a demonstration is treated as a picket if it will not interfere with traffic.
the plaintiffs submitted their application for a public assembly permit on december,identifying the event as the roe vs wade memorial and stating that it was to be held on monday,january,between and,at trade street tryon street in front of bronze disc sculpture.dist.ecf in its opinion,the district court observed that this area is known as independence square plaza,and that it is located in the very center of uptown charlotte.benham,d at.the permit application stated that the roe vs wade memorial would not involve any street closures,and advised that the event would not involve the sale of alcoholic beverages or food,the provision of portable toilets,or the charging of admission or vendor fees.dist.ecf.the permit application described the event as evangelical,gospel proclamation,praise worship band,local christian pastors speaking,mothers give testimony,call to repentance,with a temporary stage for musical entertainment.id.the application estimated that there would be an attendance of,based on a reference to previous years attendance,id,even though plaintiff philip benham and the other event organizers had not previously applied for a public assembly permit in charlotte.benham,d at.
on december,permit official and defendant emily westbrook informed the plaintiffs that she could not accept and process their application for a public assembly permit for the roe vs wade memorial.dist.ecf.she explained that,w hile the public assembly ordinance provides for permitting of festivals at independence square plaza,it does not contemplate permitting demonstrations at that location.instead demonstrations at independence square plaza are covered by the city picketing ordinance.id.westbrook letter explained further that,because the event would be a demonstration,would be held at a park,and was not anticipated to interfere with traffic,it could be held by right under the picketing ordinance,which does not require a permit.id the plaintiffs promptly appealed westbrook decision to appeals official and defendant keith parker,who conducted a hearing on january.parker upheld westbrook decision,ruling that she had properly deemed the proposed event a demonstration that may be held from to on monday,february,at independence square plaza without the need for a permit other than an amplified noise permit pursuant to charlotte city code section a should the organizers wish to use amplification devices.dist.ecf.the plaintiffs did not seek review of parker appellate ruling,and held their event as scheduled on january.there were no arrests made in connection with the event,although the authorities issued two noise warnings.
seven months later,on september,this civil action was filed in the western district of north carolina,alleging that the city had violated the plaintiffs free speech and free exercise rights,and had impinged their due process and equal protection guarantees,as secured by the constitutions of north carolina and the united states.the plaintiffs no longer pursue separate free exercise or due process claims,or separate state claims the three claims presently pursued are that the public assembly ordinance is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad on its face,the denial of the plaintiffs application for a public assembly permit violated their free speech and equal protection rights,and the public assembly ordinance,as it interacts with the picketing ordinance,unconstitutionally burdens expressive assembly by favoring commercial and recreational assembly,thus contravening the plaintiffs free speech and equal protection rights.
discovery was conducted,and the city thereafter moved for summary judgment on all the claims.the district court heard argument on that motion and,by its opinion of january,awarded summary judgment to the city on the merits.the opinion specified that there is no evidence in the record that any speech or expressive conduct was inhibited by the lack of a public assembly permit.benham,d at.
on february,the plaintiffs noted this appeal.they allege that we possess jurisdiction under.none of the initial appellate briefs,however,discussed whether or how the plaintiffs possess standing to sue.on november,prior to oral argument,we requested supplemental briefs from the parties on the issue of standing.those briefs were promptly submitted and the standing issue was explored with counsel at argument.we briefly summarize those portions of the record pertinent to the standing issue.
the plaintiffs allege in the complaint,inter alia,that they have in the past,and concretely,earnestly,and immediately desire in the immediate future,to share their message through assemblies on sidewalks and in parks in charlotte,that the enforcement of the public assembly and picketing ordinances has impaired and continues to impair their ability to express their message,id.at that both ordinances are unconstitutionally overbroad and vague,id.at,that t he future chilling of plaintiffs rights is an absolute certainty until an injunction is issued,id.at and that t he past chilling of plaintiffs rights to freedom of speech has caused plaintiffs to forfeit their rights thereby causing plaintiffs to suffer actual and nominal damages,id.at.for relief,the complaint seeks both declaratory and injunctive relief,plus damages.
in the course of discovery,the parties took depositions of plaintiff benham and several charlotte officials.of particular relevance to the standing issue is benham deposition testimony.when counsel for the city asked benham whether he had planned the roe vs wade memorial and whether he had some vision of what it would look like ahead of time,benham responded affirmatively.dist.ecf.benham also acknowledged that the event took place.when asked,in hindsight,looking at what actually transpired at the event,was it consistent with what you had envisioned ahead of time,the plaintiffs lawyer,nelson,objected on the ground that the inquiry calls for speculation.id.nelson denied that he was instructing benham not to answer the question,and benham was asked the same question for a second time.nelson then reiterated his objection,at which point benham interjected,i stand on that,to which he added,i ca speculate on that.id.at no time in the the district court or in this the plaintiffs asserted that the planning or execution of the event would have been any different had they received a permit.
the issue of standing to sue is a legal question that we assess de novo.see white tail park,stroube,cir.when a question of standing is apparent,but was not raised or addressed in the lower court,it is our responsibility to raise and decide the issue sua sponte.see constantine rectors visitors of george mason,cir.if we conclude that the plaintiffs lack of standing deprived the district court of jurisdiction,we have jurisdiction on appeal,not of the merits but merely for the purpose of correcting the error of the lower court in entertaining the suit.stephens cnty.of albemarle,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if an appellate court determines that the district court lacked jurisdiction,vacatur of the district court ruling,along with a remand with instructions to dismiss,is the appropriate disposition.see walters edgar,cir.
we inquiry with the question of whether the plaintiffs possess standing to pursue this action.see steel citizens for a better env t.standing to sue is one aspect of the mandate that an action must present a case or controversy under article iii of the constitution.see,allen wright.the doctrines state fundamental limits on federal judicial power in our system of government,and standing to sue is perhaps the most important of these doctrines.id.at.
the supreme court has explained that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.lujan defenders of wildlife.a claimant must demonstrate an injury in fact a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,such that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant actions and a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the first in the one that concerns us here,and a proper assessment thereof requires us to decide whether the plaintiffs have adduce d facts demonstrating that they have suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest,white tail park,stroube,cir internal quotation marks omitted,that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,rather than conjectural or hypothetical,lujan,at internal quotation marks omitted.
although the assertion of a facial challenge to an ordinance based on the first amendment may warrant some relaxation of the prudential rule that a claimant may assert her own rights only,the claimant must nevertheless satisfy the requirement grounded in article iii.see virginia am.booksellers ass n.it is axiomatic that the article iii standing requirements apply to all actions in the federal courts the fact that the claimant may assert facial vagueness and overbreadth challenges does not alter this aspect of federal jurisprudence.see harrell.bar,cir vagueness peterson telecomms.info,cir overbreadth.
a first amendment injury in fact may take several forms when a permitting system is at issue.at the most basic level,the denial of a permit to engage in expressive activity altogether constitutes a first amendment injury.see city of lakewood plain dealer pub.another readily cognizable first amendment injury occurs when a regulation reduces the size of a speaker audience.stroube,at.similarly,the denial of a particular opportunity to express one views may create a cognizable claim despite the fact that other venues and opportunities are available.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a municipal ordinance that interferes with a group need to plan the substance and placement of its message is another example of a cognizable injury.soc y for human life,fec,cir.
an additional cognizable injury under the first amendment is,which occurs when a claimant is chilled from exercising her right to free expression.harrell,at internal quotation marks omitted.we have recognized that,to demonstrate injury in fact,it is sufficient to show that one first amendment activities ha ve been chilled.smith frye,cir internal quotation marks omitted.s ubjective or speculative accounts of such a chilling effect,however,are not sufficient.laird tatum.any chilling effect must be objectively reasonable.zanders swanson,cir.nevertheless,a claimant need not show she ceased those activities altogether to demonstrate an injury in fact.smith,at internal quotation marks omitted.government action will be sufficiently chilling when it is likely to deter a person of ordinary firmness from the exercise of first amendment rights.constantine rectors visitors of george mason,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
before proceeding to an analysis of the standing to sue question,we will also explore some procedural issues that can arise when standing is at issue.the supreme court decision in havens realty coleman,a case from this particularly instructive.there,the court considered a fair housing act claim where the plaintiffs alleged that an apartment complex racial steering practices had resulted in the deprivation of the benefits of interracial association.id.at.the defendants contended that the plaintiffs had suffered no distinct and palpable injury because they did not demonstrate how the asserted steering practices may have affected the particular neighborhoods in which the plaintiffs resided.id.at.the district court dismissed the case before any discovery was undertaken.see id.at.the supreme court agreed with us that the dismissal was premature because,in the absence of further factual development,one could not say as a matter of law that no injury could be proved.id.at the court recognized that the extreme generality of the complaint makes it impossible to say that
