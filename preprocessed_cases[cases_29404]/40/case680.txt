this is the second of two opinions in which we consider a constitutional challenge to certain provisions of connecticut campaign finance reform act cfra.
as we describe in our first opinion,the cfra was enacted in as a comprehensive effort to bring about campaign finance reform in connecticut.in our first opinion,which we file separately,we consider a challenge to the citizens election program cep,a part of the cfra that provides public funds to candidates running for state office.see green party of garfield,l,cir.july.we consider here a challenge to provisions of the cfra that ban campaign contributions and the solicitation of campaign contributions by state contractors,lobbyists,and their families.
following for summary judgment,the united states district court for the district of connecticut stefan underhill,judge determined that each of the challenged provisions was consistent with the first amendment.see green party of garfield,d green party i.we affirm part of that decision,as we hold that the cfra comports with the first amendment insofar as it bans contributions by state contractors,prospective state contractors,the principals of contractors and prospective state contractors and the spouses and dependent children of those individuals.
we also reverse part of the district court decision,as we hold that the cfra violates the first amendment insofar as it bans contributions by lobbyists and their families and insofar as it prohibits contractors,lobbyists,and their families from soliciting contributions on behalf of candidates.
background 
we first describe the history of the cfra.we then outline the challenged provisions and briefly recount the procedural history of this action.
i.the history of the cfra 
in our first opinion addressing the cfra,we summarized the history of the statute 
the cfra was passed in response to several corruption scandals in connecticut.see green party of garfield,d,green party ii.the most widely publicized of the scandals involved connecticut former governor,john rowland.in,rowland was accused of accepting over worth of gifts and services from state contractors,including vacations,flights on a private jet,and renovations to his lake cottage.rowland accepted the gifts,it was alleged,in exchange for assisting the contractors in securing lucrative state contracts.rowland resigned amidst the allegations,and in pleaded with two aides and several federal charges in connection with the scandal.rowland was fined and sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison.see id.at.
sadly,the ignominy of public corruption was not limited to rowland.as the district court discussed in detail,the rowland scandal was but one of the many corruption scandals involving elected officials in state and local government that helped earn the state the nickname corrupticut.see id.at cataloging the scandals see also id.at discussing the decline of the reputation of connecticut state government.
it was in the wake of those scandals that connecticut lawmakers resolved to enact expansive campaign finance reforms.id.at.in the summer of,governor jodi rell established the campaign finance reform working group the working group,a collection of six state representatives and six state senators who were charged with drafting a new campaign finance reform law.after holding televised hearings for three months,the working group proposed an expansive bill,much of which would be incorporated into the final version of the cfra.see id.at.
in the fall of,governor rell called a special session of the general assembly for the sole purpose of considering the working group proposed bill.after a month of debate,the general assembly passed the cfra,and governor rell signed it into law.see id.at.as the district court set forth in detail,several contemporaneous statements from general assembly members,as well as governor rell,explain that the cfra was passed to combat actual and perceived corruption in state government.id.at.
green party,l,at,at.
ii.the challenged provisions 
the cfra is a and complex statute,and plaintiffs challenge only parts of the law.put succinctly,the challenged provisions of the cfra prohibit state contractors and certain lobbyists from making campaign contributions to candidates for state office and soliciting campaign contributions on behalf of candidates for state office.violations of those prohibitions are punishable by civil penalties and criminal sanctions.see.j,a.
contribution bans 
first,the cfra prohibits state contractors and lobbyists from making campaign contributions to candidates for state office.see.g,g a b.
the cfra ban on contractor contributions applies to any person,business entity or nonprofit organization that enters into a state contract.id.g d.it also applies to any prospective contractor to any principal of a contractor or prospective contractor and to the spouse or dependent child of a contractor,a prospective contractor,or a principal of a contractor or prospective contractor.id.g.we discuss these terms in detail below.
in addition,the ban on contractor contributions is what might be called branch specific.if the contract in question is with or from a state agency in the executive branch,the contractor may contribute to a candidate for the general assembly but not to a candidate for an executive office,a candidate for governor,lieutenant governor,attorney general,state comptroller,secretary of the state or state treasurer.id.g a.if the contract in question is with or from the general assembly,the contractor may contribute to a candidate for an executive office but not to a candidate for the general assembly.id.g b nonetheless,any holder,or principal of a holder of a valid prequalification certificate,such a certification being required in order to bid or perform work on certain,projects,is precluded from contributing to candidates for either branch of government.id.g a b.further,all individuals and entities covered by the contractor ban are prohibited from contributing to any state or town p arty committee.id.
the cfra ban on lobbyist contributions applies to any communicator lobbyist,defined a as someone compensated for lobbying over the threshold amount of in any calendar year,green party i,d at quoting state elections enforcement commission seec declaratory ruling,at,and b as a lobbyist who communicates directly or solicits others to communicate with an official or his staff in the legislative or executive branch of government or in a agency for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative action.v.the ban on lobbyist contributions also applies to the spouse or dependent child of a communicator lobbyist.see id.g applying the ban to the immediate family of a communicator lobbyist id.defining i mmediate family as the spouse or a dependent child of an individual 
solicitation bans 
the cfra also prohibits contractors and lobbyists from solicit ing campaign contributions on behalf of candidates for state office.see.h,g a b.
like the cfra ban on contributions,the ban on the solicitation of contributions applies not only to current state contractors,but also to any prospective contractor to any principal of a contractor or prospective contractor and to the spouse or dependent child of a contractor,a prospective contractor,or a principal of a contractor or prospective contractor.id.g the solicitation ban also applies to any communicator lobbyists and to the spouse or dependent child of such a lobbyist.id,h 
the term solicit is defined by statute to include,among other things,requesting that a contribution be made,participating in any activities for a candidate,and bundling contributions for a candidate.id.excluded from the statutory definition of solicit is,among other things,making a contribution that is otherwise permitted under this chapter and informing any person of a position taken by a candidate.id 
the cfra is administered and interpreted by a state agency known as the state elections enforcement commission seec.the seec has issued a declaratory ruling that clarifies the scope of the cfra solicitation ban.according to the seec,a contractor or lobbyist may,consistent with the cfra solicitation ban,engage in a number of political activities for example,a contractor or lobbyist may v olunteer for a candidate political campaign,e xpress support for a candidate,r un for office,or b e the spouse or dependent child of someone running for office.green party i,d at quoting seec declaratory ruling,at.
iii.this action 
plaintiffs brought this action in claiming that certain provisions of the cfra violated the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.plaintiffs also claimed that the challenged provisions violated the connecticut constitution.
a.the parties 
we described the parties to this action in our first opinion

our first opinion addresses counts one,two,and three.this opinion addresses count four.plaintiffs have not pursued count five in these appeals thus we do not address it.
proceedings in the district court 
the district court disposed of plaintiffs claims by means of two separate judgments.first,following for summary judgment,the court granted summary judgment to defendants on count four,holding that the cfra contribution and solicitation bans did not violate the first amendment.see green party i,d.the court evaluated each of the challenged provisions under the closely drawn standard,see fed.election comm beaumont,and held that in light of connecticut recent corruption scandals,each aspect of the contribution and solicitation bans were closely drawn to the state sufficiently important state interest of preventing actual and perceived corruption,green party i,d at.
on february,the district court entered a partial final judgment for defendants with respect to count four.see.b.plaintiffs filed a timely appeal of that partial final judgment,which we address in this opinion.
the court then held a bench trial and,on september,entered a judgment in plaintiffs favor with respect to counts one,two,and three.see green party of garfield green party ii,d.defendants filed a timely appeal of the district court september,judgment cir.docket l,which we address in our first,separately filed opinion.
discussion 
we conduct a de novo review of a district court decision to grant summary judgment.see,jeffreys city of,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
i.the cfra contribution bans 
we first consider whether the provisions of the cfra that prohibit state contractors,lobbyists,and associated individuals from making campaign contributions to candidates for state office violate the first amendment.
a.the standard for evaluating the cfra contribution bans 
in a long line cases beginning with buckley valeo,the supreme court has distinguished laws restricting campaign expenditures and speech from laws restricting campaign contributions.the court has determined that laws limiting campaign expenditures and speech impose significantly more severe restrictions on protected freedoms of political expression and association than do laws limiting campaign contributions.id.at.as a result,the court has evaluated laws limiting campaign expenditures and speech under the strict scrutiny standard,which requires the government to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.citizens united fed.election comm n,quotation marks omitted.
for laws limiting campaign contributions,by contrast,the court has conducted a relatively complaisant review under the first amendment.beaumont,at.such laws,the court has concluded,are merely marginal speech restrictions,since contributions lie closer to the edges than to the core of political expression.id.thus,instead of requiring contribution regulations to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest,a law limiting contributions passes muster if it satisfies the lesser demand of being closely drawn to match a sufficiently important interest.id.at quoting nixon shrink.gov t pac,some quotation marks omitted see also buckley,at.
the court has always applied that lower referred to as the closely drawn evaluate first amendment challenges to laws restricting campaign contributions.see,randall sorrell,plurality opinion mcconnell fed.election comm n,overruled in part on other grounds by citizens united.at beaumont,at.the court has applied the closely drawn standard even when the law in question imposed an outright ban on contributions.in beaumont,for instance,the court applied the closely drawn standard in upholding a federal law that banned all campaign contributions made by corporations.see id.at.
although the court jurisprudence may be in a state of flux especially with regard to laws regulating corporations,beaumont and other cases applying the closely drawn standard to contribution limits remain good law.indeed,in the recent citizens united case,the court overruled two of its precedents and struck down a federal law banning independent campaign expenditures by corporations,but it explicitly declined to reconsider its precedents involving campaign contributions by corporations to candidates for elected office.see.at citizens united has not made direct contributions to candidates,and it has not suggested that the court should reconsider whether contribution limits should be subjected to rigorous first amendment scrutiny.
we will,therefore,evaluate the contribution bans imposed by the cfra under the closely drawn standard.we will uphold the statutory bans against plaintiffs first amendment challenge only if they are closely drawn to achieve a sufficiently important government interest.beaumont,at quotation marks omitted.
in so doing,we reject plaintiffs argument that we must apply strict scrutiny because the provisions at issue here are bans,as opposed to mere limits.such an argument was explicitly rejected in beaumont which,as discussed above,remains binding precedent.see id.at.as beaumont concisely explained it is not that the difference between a ban and a limit is to be ignored it is just that the time to consider it is when applying scrutiny at the level selected,not in selecting the standard of review itself.id.accordingly,the closely drawn standard applies to the bans on contributions imposed by the cfra.as we discuss in greater detail below,however,the fact that the provisions impose outright not contributions is a factor we will consider when we apply scrutiny at the level selected and determine whether the provisions are,in fact,closely drawn to achieve the state interests.id.
b.the ban on contributions by contractors and associated individuals 
in assessing the cfra ban on contributions by contractors and associated individuals,we first determine whether the ban furthers a sufficiently important interest we then determine whether the ban is closely drawn to achieve that interest.see beaumont,at 
do the bans on contractor contributions further a sufficiently important interest 
as set forth above,the connecticut general assembly enacted the cfra ban on contractor contributions in response to a series of scandals in which contractors illegally offered bribes,and campaign contributions to state officials in exchange for contracts with the state.the ban was designed to combat both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption caused by contractor contributions.see green party i,d at.
such an anticorruption interest,see citizens united.at,has been recognized as a legitimate reason to restrict campaign contributions.beginning with buckley,the supreme court has repeatedly held that laws limiting campaign contributions can be justified by the government interest in addressing both the actuality and the appearance of corruption.at accord mcconnell,at our cases have made clear that the prevention of corruption or its appearance constitutes a sufficiently important interest to justify political contribution limits.
the record before us,moreover,shows that the general assembly had good reason to be concerned about both the actuality and the appearance of corruption involving contractors.connecticut recent corruption scandals showed that contributions by contractors could lead to corruption.and it took no great leap of reasoning to infer that those scandals created a strong appearance of impropriety in the transfer of any money between contractors and state or not the transfer involved an illegal quid pro quo.the scandals reached the highest state offices,leading to the resignation and eventual criminal conviction and imprisonment of the state governor.they were,as a result,covered extensively by local media and garnered the attention of national media outlets as well.see green party ii,d at providing examples of newspaper articles covering connecticut corruption scandals.thus,corruption spurred by state contractors became a salient political issue in connecticut,and there arose an appearance of impropriety with respect to all contractor contributions.see meadow decl.may,describing a public opinion poll in which of connecticut voters believed that campaign contributions governor rowland received influenced him in awarding government contracts.
accordingly,we conclude that the cfra ban on contractor contributions furthers sufficiently important government interests.see beaumont,at.there is sufficient evidence in the record of actual corruption stemming from contractor contributions,and in light of the widespread media coverage of connecticut recent corruption scandals,the general assembly also faced a manifest need to curtail the appearance of corruption created by contractor contributions.
are the bans on contractor contributions closely drawn to achieve the state interest 
the more difficult question,however,is whether each aspect of the cfra ban on contractor contributions is closely drawn to achieve the state anticorruption interest.see beaumont,at.we first describe the standard for determining whether a statute is closely drawn to achieve the state interest,and we then apply that standard to the provisions of the cfra banning contributions of state contractors,prospective state contractors,principals of state contractors,and the spouses and dependent children of state contractors.
a.the standard for determining whether a statute is closely drawn 
on only one occasion has the supreme court held that a contribution limit was not closely drawn to the government interests.in randall sorrell,the supreme court applied a multifactor test and struck down a vermont law that limited the amount of money that any single individual could contribute to a campaign for state office.see at.a plurality of the court found the law too restrictive because,among other things,its limits were so low that they prevent ed candidates from amassing the resources necessary for effective campaign advocacy.id.at,quoting buckley,at second alteration in randall.
the district court relied extensively on randall multifactor test in determining whether the cfra contribution bans were closely drawn to the asserted government interests.see green party i,d at.we disagree with that approach.randall addressed general contribution limits that applied to all citizens.the law in randall,for instance,prohibited any vermont resident from contributing more than to a candidate for governor.see at.thus randall multifactor test was concerned primarily with the effect the contribution limits would have on the electoral system as a whole.see,id.at c ontribution limits that are too low can harm the electoral process by preventing challengers from mounting effective campaigns against incumbent officeholders,thereby reducing democratic accountability.emphasis added.
here,however,plaintiffs are not challenging the provisions of the cfra that impose general contribution limits on all connecticut citizens.see generally.imposing,for instance,a limit of on any individual contributions to a gubernatorial campaign.rather,plaintiffs are challenging the provisions of the cfra that impose contribution bans on discrete groups of connecticut citizens.and unlike the situation in randall,there is no serious argument here that the challenged contribution bans will harm the electoral process by stifling candidates ability to raise sufficient campaign funds.see at.indeed,contributions by contractors and lobbyists have,in the past,made up only a small fraction of the total amount of money given as campaign contributions in connecticut.see green party i,d at.
accordingly,the first amendment inquiry in this case does not focus on the electoral process,for the issue is it was in the law in question prevent s candidates from amassing the resources necessary for effective campaign advocacy.randall,at quoting buckley,at second alteration in randall.we will not,therefore,look to randall multifactor test as a means of evaluating whether the cfra ban on contributions is closely drawn to the state interests.
the issue,instead,is whether the cfra contribution bans impermissibly infringe the first amendment rights of the discrete groups of citizens it,lobbyists,and associated individuals.to address that issue,we are required to examine how the cfra applies to the different groups of individuals it regulates and determine,in each case,whether the law is closely drawn to the state interest in combating corruption and the appearance of corruption.
the cfra ban on contractor contributions,in particular,applies not only to individuals who currently have contracts with the state,but also to prospective state contractors who seek but do not currently have state contracts.see.g e,a b.it also applies to any principal of an entity that has or is seeking contracts with the state,see id.g f,a b,and it applies to any spouse or dependent child of a covered individual,see id.g f v,g,a b.to survive first amendment scrutiny,the cfra contractor contribution bans must be closely drawn to the state anticorruption interest with respect to each of those groups of individuals.
current and prospective contractors 
the cfra applies to contributions made by any current state contractor,as well as any prospective state contractor,id.g a b,which is defined to include,in essence,any individual or entity that submits a response to a call for bids on state contracts,see id.g e.that aspect of the cfra is,without question,closely drawn to meet the state interest in combating corruption and the appearance of corruption.it is undisputed that nearly all of the corruption scandals that gave rise to the the scandal involving governor both current and prospective state contractors offering bribes in exchange for assistance in winning new state contracts.see green party i,d at.contributions by current and prospective state contractors,therefore,lie at the heart of the corruption problem in connecticut.
thus,insofar as it applies to campaign contributions made by both current and prospective state contractors,see.g d e,a b,the cfra is closely drawn and survives first amendment scrutiny.
principals of contractors 
if an artificial entity,rather than an individual,is awarded or seeks a state contract,the cfra bans contributions made by any principal of that entity see id.g f,a b.a principal is defined to include,among other things,any member of the entity board of directors any individual who has an ownership interest of five per cent or more in the entity,the president,treasurer or executive vice president of the entity and any officer or employee of either a business entity or a nonprofit organization who has managerial or discretionary responsibilities with respect to a state contract.
the definition of principal sweeps broadly and prevents a wide range of individuals from contributing to campaigns for state office.we have some doubts,therefore,as to whether the provision is indeed closely drawn to achieve the state anticorruption interest.
nonetheless,we are mindful of the teachings of the supreme court that we,as judges,can not consider each possible permutation of a law limiting contributions,and thus we can not determine with any degree of exactitude the precise restriction necessary to carry out the statute legitimate objectives.randall,at.moreover,in light of the troubling episodes involving state contractors in connecticut recent history,we are reluctant to the judgment of the general assembly when it defines which individuals associated with an artificial entity are likely to attempt to exert improper influence over a state official.
we will,therefore,follow the ordinar y approach in evaluating the ban on principal contributions and defer to the legislature determination of such matters.id.the ban on principals contributions strikes us as bordering on overboard,but the record shows that the dangers of corruption associated with contractor contributions are so significant in connecticut that the general assembly should be afforded leeway in its efforts to curb contractors influence on state lawmakers.
we thus conclude that,insofar as it applies to campaign contributions made by principals of state contractors or prospective state contractors,see.g f,a b,the cfra is closely drawn and withstands first amendment scrutiny.
spouses and children of contractors 
the cfra not only bans contributions by contractors,prospective contractors,and the principal of any contractor or prospective contractor it also bans contributions by the spouse or dependent child of any of those covered individuals.see.g f v,g,a b.defendants do not attempt to justify the ban on contributions by arguing that a contractor family members will themselves attempt to exert improper influence over a state official.see appellees br.that is for good reason,as there is no record evidence to suggest that the spouses or dependent children of state contractors have been in any way involved in connecticut recent corruption scandals or,for that matter,any other corruption scandals of which the parties have made us aware.rather,defendants attempt to justify the ban on contributions by arguing that it is a reasonable measure to avoid circumvention of the prohibition of contributions by contractors.id.at.that is,defendants argue that contractors and other covered individuals will avoid the cfra ban on contractor contributions by siphoning their improper contributions through their spouses and children.
the supreme court has recognized that,in regulating campaign contributions,the legislature must be given room to anticipate and respond to concerns about circumvention of regulations designed to protect the integrity of the political process.mcconnell,at see also beaumont,at.nonetheless,the court has struck down provisions where the government has put forward only scant evidence of a particular form of evasion.mcconnell,at.
here,the record in support of the ban on contributions by contractors spouses and dependent children is by no means overwhelming.there is little direct evidence suggesting that contractors will use their spouses or children to circumvent the cfra contribution bans.nevertheless,the recent corruption scandals in connecticut have shown that contractors are willing to resort to varied forms of misconduct to secure contracts with the state.that,we think,is far more than the scant evidence required by mcconnel.see id.
in light of the recent corruption scandals,therefore,the general assembly must be given room to anticipate and respond to concerns about the circumvention of the bans on contractor contributions.id.at.indeed,were we to affirm the ban on contributions by contractors but strike down the ban on contributions by their family members,we would invite the very circumvention that the general assembly was trying to prevent.
thus,we conclude that the cfra ban on contributions by contractors spouses and dependent children,see.g f v,g,a b,is closely drawn to avoid the circumvention of the ban on contractor contributions.
e.a ban as opposed to a limit 
finally,we consider the fact that the cfra imposes an outright a mere contributions made by contractors,prospective contractors,and their principals.that fact,as discussed above,does not require us to review the law under the strict scrutiny standard.but we must nevertheless determine whether an outright ban on contractor contributions is closely drawn to the state anticorruption interest.see beaumont,at it is not that the difference between a ban and a limit is to be ignored it is just that the time to consider it is when applying scrutiny at the level selected,not in selecting the standard of review itself.
the majority of campaign laws reviewed by the supreme other involved limits on contributions,not bans.see,randall,at nixon,at cal.med.ass fed.election comm n,buckley,at.the court has,however,upheld the longstanding federal ban on direct corporate contributions.beaumont,at.that is enough to demonstrate that laws banning contributions by a discrete group are not unconstitutional per se.
yet a ban is a drastic measure.a limit on contributions causes some constitutional damage,as it restrict s one aspect of the contributor freedom of political association.randall,at quoting buckley,at emphasis added.but a ban on contributions causes considerably more constitutional damage,as it wholly extinguishes that aspect of the contributor freedom of political association.a limit,moreover,leaves intact the contributor right to make the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution.id.at quoting buckley,at.but a ban infringes that constitutional right,as it precludes the symbolic expression that comes with a small contribution.
there are,therefore,undoubtedly many situations in which a strict contribution opposed to an outright contribution adequately achieve the government objectives.in those situations it will be difficult for the government to establish that a contribution ban is closely drawn to its asserted interests.instead,such a ban risks being struck down as unconstitutionally overbroad.
here,for example,a opposed to a likely be sufficient to address the general assembly interest in addressing actual corruption.if,for example,the cfra were to allow contractors to make small contributions say,per election to state officials,it is unlikely that a contractor could exert any influence over an official with the promise of such a modest sum.yet such a limit would not wholly extinguish a contractor associational rights,and it would allow the contractor to make the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution.id.at quoting buckley,at.thus,if the state only interest in this case were combating actual corruption,the cfra outright ban on contractor contributions would likely be held overbroad.
combating actual corruption,however,is not the state only interest here the cfra is also meant to address the appearance of corruption caused by contractor contributions.see green party i,d at.as discussed above,connecticut recent corruption scandals were widely publicized,and corruption involving state contractors became a major political issue in connecticut in recent years.see subsection.e,ante.a limit on contractor contributions would have partially addressed the perception of corruption created by those incidents,but such a limit still would have allowed some money to flow from contractors to state officials.even if small contractor contributions would have been unlikely to influence state officials,those contributions could have still given rise to the appearance that contractors are able to exert improper influence on state officials.
the cfra ban on contractor contributions,by contrast,unequivocally addresses the perception of corruption brought about by connecticut recent scandals.by totally shutting off the flow of money from contractors to state officials,it eliminates any notion that contractors can influence state officials by donating to their campaigns.thus,although the cfra ban on contractor contributions is a drastic measure,it is an appropriate response to a specific series of incidents that have created a strong appearance of corruption with respect to all contractor contributions.
we hold,as a result,that in light of connecticut recent experience with corruption scandals involving state contractors,the cfra imposition of an outright ban on contributions by contractors,prospective contractors,and their principals,see.g,is closely drawn to the state interest in combating the appearance of corruption.
b.the ban on contributions by lobbyists and their families 
the cfra ban on contributions by lobbyists presents markedly different considerations than the cfra ban on contributions by contractors.the distinction centers on the fact that the recent corruption scandals in connecticut in no way involved lobbyists.see,green party i,d at l obbyists ha ve not been directly linked to the scandals,which primarily involved state contractors offering bribes in exchange for preferential treatment emphasis added.
as a restriction on campaign contributions,not campaign expenditures,we review the cfra ban on lobbyists contributions under the closely drawn standard.see beaumont,at subsection,ante.we will uphold the ban against plaintiffs first amendment challenge only if it is closely drawn to achieve sufficiently important government interests.beaumont,at.
defendants seek to justify the ban on lobbyist contributions as necessary to combat both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption.we decline to decide whether those interests are sufficiently important in this context,see,for e ven assuming,arguendo,the government advances an important interest,mcconnell,at,the cfra ban on lobbyist contributions is not closely drawn to the asserted interests.
as set forth above,see subsection.e,ante,an outright ban on contributions is a drastic measure that substantially infringes one aspect of the contributor freedom of political association.randall,at quoting buckley,at.as opposed to a contribution limit,which merely restricts those first amendment freedoms,see,a contribution ban utterly eliminates an individual right to express his or her support for a candidate by contributing money to the candidate cause.indeed,a contribution ban cuts off even the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a small contribution.id.at quoting buckley,at.thus,if the state interests in this case can be achieved by means of a limit on lobbyist contributions,rather than a ban,the ban should be struck down for failing to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms,buckley,at 
we have upheld the cfra ban on contractor contributions because the recent corruption scandals in connecticut have created an appearance of corruption with respect to all exchanges of money between state contractors and candidates for state office.we have held that an outright ban on contractor contributions was justified,closely drawn to meet the state anticorruption interest because even a severe limit on contractor contributions would allow a small flow of contributions between contractors and candidates and would,as a result,likely give rise to an appearance of corruption.
the situation is different with lobbyists.the recent corruption scandals had nothing to do with lobbyists,see green party i,d at,and thus there is insufficient evidence to infer that all contributions made by state lobbyists give rise to an appearance of corruption.plaintiffs have submitted some evidence suggesting that many members of the public generally distrust lobbyists and the special attention they are believed to receive from elected officials.see,meadow decl.but as the supreme court has recently clarified,the anticorruption interest recognized by buckley and other cases is limited to quid pro quo corruption and does not encompass efforts to limit f avoritism and influence or the appearance of influence or access.citizens united.at quotation marks omitted.the fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that these officials are corrupt,and favoritism and influence are un avoidable in representative politics.id.at quotation marks omitted.influence and access,moreover,are not sinister in nature.some influence,such as wise counsel from a trusted if that advisor is a enhance the effectiveness of our representative government.
accordingly,there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that all lobbyist contributions give rise to an appearance of corruption,and the evidence demonstrating that lobbyist contributions give rise to an appearance of influence,see,meadow decl,has no bearing on whether the cfra ban on lobbyist contributions is closely drawn to the state anticorruption interest.we conclude,as a result,that on this record,a limit on lobbyist contributions would adequately address the state interest in combating corruption and the appearance of corruption on the part of lobbyists the cfra ban on lobbyist contributions,therefore,is not closely drawn to achieve the state anticorruption interest.thus,we hold that the cfra ban on lobbyist contributions.g,violates the first amendment 
ii.the cfra solicitation bans 
as set forth above,the cfra prohibits contractors and lobbyists from solicit ing contributions on behalf of candidates for state office.see.h,g.that prohibition applies to current state contractors,prospective state contractors,and the principals of current and prospective state contractors,as well as to the spouses and dependent children of covered lobbyists and contractors.see id,h,g f.
unlike laws limiting contributions,which present marginal speech restrictions that lie closer to the edges than to the core of political expression,beaumont,at quotation marks omitted,a limit on the solicitation of otherwise permissible contributions prohibits exactly the kind of expressive activity that lies at the first amendment core.that is because the solicitation of contributions involves solicit contributions on behalf of a candidate is to make a statement you should support this candidate,not only at the polls but with a financial contribution.whatever may be said about whether money is speech,see,davis fed.election comm n,stevens,dissenting in part,speech is speech,even if it is speech about money,see,bates state bar of,o ur cases long have protected speech even though it is in the form of a solicitation to pay or contribute money.speech uttered during a campaign for political office,moreover,requires the fullest and most urgent application of the protections set forth in the first amendment.citizens united.at quoting eu county democratic cent,quotation marks omitted.
thus,the cfra provisions banning the solicitation of contributions are l aws that burden political speech and are,as a result,subject to strict scrutiny,which requires the government to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.id.quoting fed.election comm.right to life,opinion of roberts,
the state attempts to justify the cfra solicitation bans,like the cfra contribution bans,as a means to combat corruption and the appearance of corruption.although the anticorruption interest has been held sufficiently important to justify restrictions on contributions,see,mcconnell,at buckley,at,in reviewing limits on campaign expenditures under the strict scrutiny standard,the supreme court has consistently held that the anticorruption interest is not a compelling government interest,see,citizens united.at striking down a restriction on corporate independent expenditures buckley,at striking down a different restriction on independent expenditures.
as we observed above,moreover,w hen buckley identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption,that interest was limited to quid pro quo corruption.citizens united.at.it is easy to see how a large contribution can be given to secure a political quid pro quo from current and potential office holders.buckley,at.that is the hallmark of corruption dollars for political favors.fed.election comm conservative political action.it is far more difficult to see how an individual might secure a political favor by recommending that another person make a campaign contribution,if for no other reason than that the third person must exercise his own free will to make a contribution.
nevertheless,the district court upheld the cfra solicitation bans based primarily upon its finding that contractors and lobbyists could exert improper influence over state officials by bundling campaign contributions made by their clients or employees.green party i,d at.the threat posed by bundling is that contractors and lobbyists will promise to deliver large numbers of coordinated contributions to a state official in exchange for political favors.a prospective state contractor,for instance,might promise to organize a large fundraising event in exchange for a candidate assistance in securing a lucrative state contract.
there are good reasons to think that the threat of bundling does not provide a compelling justification for the solicitation bans,especially with regard to lobbyists.but even assuming,without deciding,that the threat of bundling makes the interest compelling in this context,the cfra ban on solicitations is by no means narrowly tailored to address that threat.
in order to narrowly tailor a law to address a problem,the government must curtail speech only to the degree necessary to meet the particular problem at hand,and the government must avoid infringing on speech that does not pose the danger that has prompted regulation.fed.election comm.citizens for life.the government must prove that there is no less restrictive alternative to the law in question,for i f a less restrictive alternative would serve the government purpose,the legislature must use that alternative.united states playboy entm t group.
here,the state has not met its burden to show that the cfra solicitation ban is narrowly tailored to address the problem posed by bundling,for the ban prohibits a wide range of activity unrelated to bundling,and there are several less restrictive alternatives that would more directly address the perceived bundling threat.for one thing,the cfra prohibits solicitation efforts that could not possibly be deemed bundling.a state contractor,for instance,is prohibited under the cfra from advising his mother about whether she should contribute to a particular gubernatorial candidate.a less restrictive alternative to address the problem of bundling would be to ban only efforts to solicit example,a ban on state contractors organizing fundraising events of a certain size.
in addition,the problem with bundling,according to the district court,is that lobbyists will bundle contributions by their clients and state contractors will bundle contributions from their many employees and subcontractors.green party i,d at.if that is the case,then a less restrictive means to address the bundling problem would be simply to ban lobbyists from soliciting contributions from their clients and contractors from soliciting contributions from their employees and subcontractors.the cfra,however,bans all solicitation efforts by lobbyists and those not directed at clients,employees,or subcontractors.
finally,insofar as the cfra solicitation ban was intended to combat corruption and the appearance of corruption caused by bundling,the state has not adequately explained why it could not simply outlaw bundling itself.indeed,the cfra currently defines the term solicit to include,among other things,bundling contributions,see,and the seec has issued a decision that defines the term bundling,see green party i,d at citing seec declaratory ruling,at.the problem is that,in addition to banning bundling,the cfra also bans many other activities that often do not involve bundling.see.broadly defining solicit to include,among other things,requesting that a contribution be made and serving as deputy treasurer of a political committee.
we are not,of course,called upon here to determine the constitutionality of other,hypothetical laws.our conclusion is only that less restrictive alternatives exist,and thus the state has not met its burden of showing that the cfra solicitation ban is narrowly tailored.we hold,therefore,that on this record,the cfra bans on the solicitation of contributions,see.h,g,violate the first amendment.
iii.remaining claims 
in addition to their first amendment claims,plaintiffs have asserted claims under the equal protection clause and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,as well as under the connecticut constitution.
the equal protection and due process claims,asserted only by the association of connecticut lobbyists and barry williams,challenge provisions of the cfra that we have struck down under the first,the cfra ban on lobbyist contributions and the solicitation of contributions by lobbyists.thus we need not address those claims.
with respect to the claims under the connecticut constitution,we agree with the district court that there is no indication in connecticut case law that the connecticut constitution provide s broader protection than the federal constitutional rights at issue here.green party i,d at.thus,insofar as we have held that certain provisions of the cfra are consistent with the first amendment,the connecticut constitution provides no additional the first challenging the cfra.insofar as we have held that certain provisions of the cfra violate the first amendment,it is unnecessary for us to we expressly decline to those provisions also violate the connecticut constitution.
iv.the severability of the unconstitutional provisions and the appropriate injunctive relief 
we have held that two aspects of the cfra violate the first amendment the ban on lobbyist contributions and the ban on the solicitation of contributions.the question arises,therefore,whether those provisions are severable from the cfra or whether the entire cfra must be struck down along with the unconstitutional provisions.the district court did not consider the severability issue because it held that each of the challenged provisions was constitutional.
in our first opinion,published today,which addressed plaintiffs challenge to the cfra citizen election program cep,we remanded the cause to the district court to determine in the first instance whether certain unconstitutional provisions of the cep were severable.we specifically instructed the district court to examine the meaning of of the general statutes of connecticut in connection with its ruling on the severability issue 
we adopt that same approach here and remand to the district court to determine whether the unconstitutional provisions of the cfra addressed in this opinion are severable from the remainder of the law.in so doing the district court should examine the relevancy,if any,of.after the district court has ruled on the severability issue,it should then enter appropriate injunctive relief in light of our holdings in this opinion.
conclusion 
in summary,we hold as follows 
the cfra bans on contributions by state contractors,lobbyists,and associated individuals,see.g,g a b,are marginal speech restrictions that withstand scrutiny under the first amendment if they are closely drawn to match a sufficiently important government interest.fed.election comm beaumont,quotation marks omitted.
the cfra ban on contractor contributions,see.g a b,is consistent with the first amendment.the ban furthers sufficiently important government interests,beaumont,at quotation marks omitted,in that it addresses both the actuality and the appearance of corruption involving state contractors,see buckley valeo.it is also closely drawn to achieve those interests.beaumont,at quotation marks omitted.with respect to the ban on contractor contributions,therefore,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants.
the cfra ban on lobbyist contributions.g,violates the first amendment.although an outright ban on contractor contributions can be justified as a means to address the appearance of corruption caused by connecticut recent corruption scandals,those scandals did not involve lobbyists and thus do not provide sufficient justification for an outright ban on lobbyist contributions.rather,even assuming,without deciding,that the state anticorruption interest is sufficiently important in this context,an outright ban on lobbyist opposed to a mere limit on lobbyist not closely drawn to achieve the state interest.see beaumont,at.with respect to the ban on lobbyist contributions,therefore,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants and instruct the court to grant summary judgment to plaintiffs.
the cfra ban on the solicitation of contributions,see.h,g a b,is a law that burden s political speech and is,as a result,subject to strict scrutiny,citizens united fed.election comm n.the law will be upheld only if the state prove s that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.id.quotation marks omitted.
under the strict scrutiny standard,the cfra solicitation ban,see.h,g a b,violates the first amendment.even assuming,without deciding,that the state has a compelling interest in preventing contractors and lobbyists from bundling contributions,the state has failed to establish that the cfra solicitation ban is narrowly tailored to meet that interest because the law prohibits numerous activities unrelated to bundling.with respect to the solicitation ban,therefore,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants and instruct the court to grant summary judgment to plaintiffs.
we need not address plaintiffs equal protection and due process claims,for they challenge provisions of the cfra that we have struck down under the first,the cfra ban on lobbyist contributions and the solicitation of contributions by lobbyists.
insofar as we have upheld certain provisions of the cfra under the first amendment,we likewise uphold those provisions under the connecticut constitution,which provides no additional the first challenging the provisions in question.insofar as we have held that certain provisions of the cfra violate the first amendment,it is unnecessary for us to we expressly decline to those provisions also violate the connecticut constitution.
we remand the cause to the district court a to determine,in the first instance,whether the unconstitutional provisions of the cfra are severable from the remainder of the statute b to grant appropriate injunctive relief in light of our holdings in this opinion and the district court resolution of the severability issue on remand and c to conduct any further proceedings,consistent with this opinion,that may be required.
the february,partial judgment of the district court on count four of this action is affirmed in part and reversed in part as set forth in sections through of this conclusion.the cause is remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with the instructions set forth in section of this conclusion.
recognizing that an election has been scheduled for november,and given the importance of this case to ongoing campaigns for state office,we request that the district court act expeditiously in considering the issues presented for decision on remand.
