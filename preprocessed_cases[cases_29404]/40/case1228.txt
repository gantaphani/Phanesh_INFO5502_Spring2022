opinion of the court 
appellants and,parents of,brought this action against the ramsey board of education the board and individual employees of the board,appellees herein,alleging violations of the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.they now appeal a decision of the united states district court for the district of new jersey granting summary judgment to appellees and denying it to them.we will affirm.
background 
is the focus of this case.he is a young boy,born december,who before the age of three presented a static encephalopathy of prenatal but uncertain etiology coupled with behaviors,which was suggestive but not diagnostic of an autistic spectrum disorder.his physician alternatively posited a diagnosis of speech and language dysfunction involving both receptive and expressive language.id.appellants,in the words of the administrative law judge alj,have been commendably dedicated to learning about their son disabilities and pursuing the best educational and related services available.they provided their son with early therapeutic services,such as speech,occupational,and physical therapy.in addition,in the fall of,before turned three,appellants enrolled him in preschool programs at the pinnacle learning center,the ct center,and jcc on the palisades.
when became eligible for special education and related services under the idea upon turning three,appellants continued to be actively involved in the process of determining how best to proceed with his education.indeed,both before and after his third birthday,a child study team cst held a series of meetings with and without his parents for the purposes of determining his eligibility for special education and related services and developing an individualized education program iep for him.appellants br.at.the dispute in this case arises out of appellants disagreement with the cst assessment of what educational setting and related services would be appropriate for their son.as is,sadly,seen so often in cases brought under the idea,this case,from the outset,has been both difficult and emotionally charged.
the ramsey cst received opinions from a number of professionals regarding the proper placement for laurie podd,a classroom teacher at a mainstream preschool where spent time prior to his third birthday,believed he was progressing on pace an early enrichment teacher of,brenda brawer,believed in november of that would benefit from the educational and social experiences which could be provided in a typical preschool if he was accompanied by a shadow trained in behavioral intervention.developmental pediatrician,debra seltzer,also opined that he would benefit most from daily contact with typically developing peer role models in a supportive,nurturing environment.a preschool handicapped class would therefore not provide the most appropriate educational setting for id.his speech therapist joined those advocating for an integrated preschool program.in light of these opinions,appellants sought to have continue in the pinnacle program with a shadow.
the cst,however,advocated for a segregated placement.in support of that position,appellees point to the assessments conducted by social worker stacy mcdonough,psychologist stacie greenberg,and learning disabilities and case manager joan moore.the consensus of that group,in the opinion of mcdonough,was that would benefit most from a preschool setting that utilizes a more approach and incorporates both language and frequent refocusing in order to continue to develop age appropriate skills for attention and communication.the group was also concerned that his schedule of services and activities arranged by appellants was too burdensome for him.on december,moore,on behalf of the cst,circulated an iep providing for a half day at the hubbard school,a class of children with disabilities run by ramsey with supplemental,related services infused into the day.
appellants rejected that proposal,believing that could continue to succeed and develop in a mainstream classroom setting and would benefit from modeling the mainstream student population.they also were not satisfied with the providers of the supplemental services offered by ramsey.in light of that rejection,the cst met without appellants on january,and subsequently sent appellants a revised iep.although the opinions of outside experts were included in the revised iep,the recommendations were materially the same.the iep did,however,note appellants desired placement and the cst anticipat ion that an integrated preschool may be appropriate in september.appellants again rejected the iep,opting to continue education in the programs in which he was already enrolled and provide additional services through private professionals.
despite their collective opinion,appellees endeavored,in light of appellants wishes,to find a spot for in an integrated classroom for that spring.they discovered that a program in garfield,new jersey,had an opening.garfield,however,rejected,believing he was not yet ready for its program appellees continued to attempt to resolve their differences with appellants and ramsey director of special services,fredericka shpetner,secured a spot for in an integrated classroom in park ridge starting in september.that placement was included in an iep presented to appellants on july.although pleased with the placement,appellants were not completely satisfied.they believed that the provision of supplemental services was inadequate because they could not be confident of the qualifications of the unnamed providers.appellants also believed that the goals included within the iep did not adequately account for the gains had made during the spring consequently,while accepting the park ridge program,appellants made their own plans for the provision of supplemental services.
ii.legal framework 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court exercised jurisdiction under,and we have jurisdiction under.
when deciding an idea case,the district court applies a modified version of de novo review and is required to give due weight to the factual findings of the alj.see sch.dist.of the city of newark,cir see also board of educ.rowley,d shore regional high sch.bd.of educ,cir describing the district court burden as unusual insofar as it must make its own findings by a preponderance of the evidence but must also afford due weight to the alj determination on review,we of course exercise plenary review with respect to the question whether the district court applied the correct legal standards under the idea,but we review the district court factual findings for clear error.shore regional,at citations omitted see id.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when,after reviewing the evidence,the court of appeals is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.citation omitted.
the idea implements the congressional determination that i mproving educational results for children with disabilities is an essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity,full participation,independent living,and economic for individuals with disabilities.c.to that end,the statute requires,in relevant part,that states receiving federal funding under the statute must have in effect policies and procedures to ensure that a free appropriate public education is available to all children with disabilities a a.an individualized education program,or an individualized family service plan must be developed,reviewed and revised for each child with a disability a.the education of disabled students must t o the maximum extent appropriate be provided with children who are not disabled.a a s pecial classes,separate schooling,or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services can not be achieved satisfactorily.
when a state fails to provide a free appropriate public education fape,it must reimburse parents for resulting private school costs.see kingwood township bd.of,cir citing school committee of the town of burlington dep t of educ.of commonwealth of,d.a fape is an education specially designed to meet the unique needs of the handicapped child,supported by such services as are necessary to permit the child to benefit from the instruction.rowley,at.the education provided must be sufficient to confer some educational benefit upon the handicapped child,although the state is not required to maximize the potential of handicapped children.kingwood township,at citations omitted.at one time,we only required that a child iep offer more than a trivial or de minimis educational benefit,oberti bd.of educ.of borough of clementon sch,cir more recently,however,we have squarely held that the provision of merely more than a trivial educational benefit does not meet the meaningful benefit requirement of polk central susquehanna intermediate unit,cir.kingwood township,at quoting ridgewood bd.of educ,cir.
the mainstreaming component of the idea require s that a disabled child be placed in the least restrictive environment lre that will provide him with a meaningful educational benefit.kingwood township,at.to that end,disabled children shall be,to the greatest extent possible,satisfactorily educate d together with children who are not disabled,in the same school the disabled child would attend if the child were not disabled.carlisle area sch.scott,cir.to determine whether a state is complying with the lre requirement,we first ask whether education in the regular classroom,with the use of supplementary aids and services,can be achieved satisfactorily.oberti,at citation omitted.to enable us to answer that question,we consider the steps the school district has taken to accommodate the child in a regular classroom the child ability to receive an educational benefit from regular education and the effect the disabled child presence has on the regular classroom.kingwood township,at.
a word about the first and second factors.in considering the former,a court must determine whether the school district provides a continuum of alternative placements to meet the needs of handicapped children a.this continuum must include the whole range of supplemental aids and services.oberti,at quotations and citation omitted.the second factor entails a comparison between the benefits of a mainstream placement and a special education classroom.see id.the court will have to rely heavily in this regard on the testimony of educational experts.the unique benefits that will accrue to the child in a mainstream classroom also must be considered.id.at.thus,a determination that a child with disabilities might make greater academic progress in a segregated,special education class may not warrant excluding that child from a regular classroom environment.id.at.if a court finds that a child can not be satisfactorily educated in a regular classroom,it must then determine whether the school has mainstreamed the child to the maximum extent appropriate,whether the school has made efforts to include the child in school programs with nondisabled children whenever possible.id.at citation omitted.
we have noted that the mainstreaming issue is a difficult one in light of the apparent tension within the act between the strong preference for mainstreaming and the requirement that schools provide individualized programs tailored to the specific needs of each disabled child.id.at citations omitted.as we advised in oberti 
the key to resolving this tension appears to lie in the school proper use of supplementary aids and services,which may enable the school to educate a child with disabilities for a majority of the time within a regular classroom,while at the same time addressing that child unique educational needs.
id.citation omitted.in sum,a court determines,through a comparison of educational opportunities supported by expert testimony,whether the child can be satisfactorily educated in a regular classroom with supplemental services.if it finds that the child can not be satisfactorily educated in that manner,the court must consider whether the school attempted to mainstream the child to the maximum extent possible.
burden of proof 
we have always placed the burden of demonstrating compliance with the idea on the school district.see kingwood township,at oberti,at.while this appeal was pending,however,the supreme court held that the burden of proof in an administrative hearing challenging an iep is properly placed upon the party seeking relief.schaffer weast,d.the schaffer court declined to address the issue of whether a state could,by statute,place the burden exclusively upon the school district.id.new jersey has no such statute.nevertheless,appellants contend that the rule in lascari bd.of,where the supreme court of new jersey placed the burden on the school district regardless of which party sought relief,is unaffected by schaffer.appellants thus attempt to avoid the application of schaffer by arguing that it does not provide the rule of law in new jersey.appellants letter br.
that argument is unavailing.the court in schaffer saw no reason to depart from the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.at,leaving for another day whether a state can overcome that rule by statute.lascari addressed that very question where,in the absence of a federal or state statutory provision providing otherwise,should the burden of proof rest when the appropriateness of an iep is challenged citing state and federal statutory and regulatory schemes implementing not the idea,but its precursor,the lascari court determined that placing the burden upon the school district was most appropriate.see lascari,at.schaffer rejected that conclusion.because this case is brought solely under the idea and arises in a state lacking a statutory or regulatory provision purporting to define the burden of proof in administrative hearings assessing ieps,schaffer controls 
appellants would also have us limit the holding in schaffer to the fape aspect of the analysis.although,to be sure,the facts in schaffer implicated only the fape analysis,the supreme court made it quite clear that its holding applied to the appropriateness of the iep as a whole.appellants quote limiting language we hold no more than we must to resolve the case at hand,schaffer.at arguing that the decision does not reach the lre analysis.the court holding,which directly followed the quoted language,however,vitiates that attempt the burden of proof in an administrative hearing challenging an iep is properly placed upon the party seeking relief.id.emphasis added.it would be unreasonable for us to limit that holding to a single aspect of an iep,where the question framed by the court and the answer it provided,do not so constrict the reach of its decision 
consequently,appellants bear the burden of proof when challenging the appropriateness of the relevant ieps.in the proceedings before both the alj and the district court,the burden was placed upon appellees and,in both proceedings,appellees prevailed.what may have been a close case is,in the wake of schaffer,no longer so.as we discuss below,appellants have not carried their burden on the question of the appropriateness of the relevant ieps.
iii.analysis 
appellants contend that their son was denied a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment due to an invalid assessment of his individual needs and pursuant to an overarching policy against the integration of disabled students.the alj,after holding a hearing,rejected these contentions in a lengthy and extraordinarily thorough opinion,and the district court affirmed.
spring iep 
the central questions in the proceedings before the alj and the district court were whether the board carried its burden of demonstrating that in the spring of could not be satisfactorily educated in the regular classroom,with supplementary aids and support services,oberti,at,and whether he was,to the maximum extent appropriate,educated with nondisabled students.both the alj and district court,having placed the burden on the board,found that it had done so.
appellants contend that the district court improperly affirmed the alj conflati
