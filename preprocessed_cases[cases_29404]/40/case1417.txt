in april,stacia kerns instituted this lawsuit against the united states under the federal tort claims act the ftca,b,based on the alleged negligence of government employee debra scott.in her complaint,kerns alleged that scott,acting within the scope of her employment,had negligently caused an automobile accident in maryland that resulted in the death of kerns husband,dennis gregory kerns,the decedent.on february,the district court dismissed the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see kerns united states,d the opinion.by way of this appeal,kerns challenges the dismissal of her ftca claim.as explained below,we vacate and remand.
at the time of the accident,scott was a contract employee of the army reserve regional readiness command,working for the office of the family readiness program director in coraopolis,pennsylvania on may,scott was ordered to provide a briefing during a volunteer training conference concerning aid and assistance to military families.the conference was to be held at a radisson hotel in annapolis,maryland,beginning at on saturday,june.that friday,june,scott drove her personal car to the pittsburgh airport and flew to international thurgood marshall airport bwi at the government expense.at approximately,scott landed at bwi and rented a vehicle at the airport.using her personal credit card,she paid a government weekend rate for a rental.shortly after,she departed bwi the radisson hotel time was 
scott first drove from bwi to the nearby army post at fort meade,maryland,to shop at the fort meade px at approximately,scott left fort meade and headed eastbound on annapolis route toward annapolis.while making a turn,scott struck the decedent,who was riding a motorcycle westbound on the same road.the decedent was thrown to the highway and seriously injured he was promptly transported to a hospital trauma unit,but later died.it is undisputed,for our purposes,that scott was at fault.scott returned to pennsylvania the next day without completing the conference.
on april,kerns,as the personal representative of her husband estate and next friend of her children,filed her complaint in the district of maryland.on august,the government moved to dismiss under rule b,contending that there was no basis for subject matter jurisdiction under the ftca because scott was not acting within the scope of her employment with the government at the time of the accident.rather,according to the government,t he evidence was clear that scott rented the car on her own to visit personal friends.
the government submitted eight exhibits,including two affidavits,in support of its rule b motion to dismiss.the exhibits included the following 
scott may,travel orders,which provided that she was to travel between pennsylvania and maryland by commercial plane and that rental car is not authorized.the orders were silent on how scott was to proceed from the airport to the hotel in annapolis.
travel voucher records,dated july,and august,showing that scott sought and received reimbursement for vehicle mileage between coraopolis and the pittsburgh airport,as well as per diem and other expenses.the records suggest that scott neither requested nor received reimbursement for the rental car involved in the accident.
an affidavit from barbara wilson,scott supervisor at the time of the accident.wilson attested that she too had travelled to annapolis,although not with scott.wilson stated that she was not certain what scott was doing at the time of the accident,but that the conference had not yet begun,and scott was not performing any duties related to the conference or army business at the time of the accident.according to the affidavit,wilson was informed by scott,prior to the conference,that she planned to rent a car and visit friends at fort meade during the conference weekend.id.
an affidavit from thomas cannon,a colleague who flew to baltimore with scott.cannon attested that scott rented a vehicle when we left bwi airport,and she told me she was going to use the car to visit some friends in the area that evening.like wilson,however,cannon was not certain what scott was doing at the time of the accident.id.
on august,kerns submitted a memorandum in opposition to the government motion to dismiss,requesting the district court to authorize relevant discovery proceedings.kerns maintained that the record had not been sufficiently developed because the exhibits submitted by the government failed to disprove that scott was acting within the scope of her employment at the time of the collison,in that the exhibits did not provide any specific information about what scott was doing at that time including any statement from scott herself.kerns pointed out,for example,that although the wilson and cannon affidavits provide d hearsay accounts of conversations these individuals had with scott about a possible visit with a friend while in maryland to attend the conference,both specifically state that the affiants did not know what scott was doing or where she was going at the time of the collision.id.at.furthermore,kerns asserted,m erely because scott was not reimbursed for her expenses related to the rental car did not conclusively establish that scott did not use the rental car for some portion of her responsibilities or even that scott duties did not require the rental car.id.at.indeed,the government provided no information about how the conference attendees got to the location of the conference from the airport.id.in these circumstances,kerns maintained,discovery was necessary to fully develop the record before the district court could properly issue any ruling on the government motion to dismiss.
on september,the government filed its reply memorandum on the rule b request.this submission included an august,affidavit from scott,prepared by the government in the wake of kerns opposition memorandum.scott attested that e mail instructions regarding travel to the conference stated that we could fly into bwi,drive our personal automobiles or take a rental car.scott further attested that,on june,while she was in the meade area on government orders,she went shopping at the ft meade px.id.at.according to scott,if she had not been on government orders to provide a briefing at the conference,she would not have been at ft meade at the time of the collision,and this collision would not have occurred.id.the affidavit did not specify whether scott was shopping at the fort meade px for herself or her employer,and it did not address whether scott had also been visiting friends in the fort meade area.
in its reply memorandum,the government failed to acknowledge or address the contradiction between the notation in scott may,travel orders specifying that rental car is not authorized,and scott averment that e mail instructions identified a rental car as a permissible mode of travel,id.at.instead,the government asserted that kerns could point to no set of facts that would demonstrate that the united states authorized scott to use the rental car to travel to meade the evening before the conference in annapolis was to begin.id.at.the government did acknowledge scott apparent stating in her affidavit that she would not have been at fort meade but for the establish that she was acting within the scope of her employment at the time of the accident.the government insisted,however,that whether scott was visiting friends at fort meade or shopping at the px prior to the accident,she was performing no duties related to her employment or with her attendance at the conference.id.at 
on february,without any discovery having occurred,the district court granted the rule b motion to dismiss.in its opinion,the court concluded that,under maryland law,scott was not acting within the scope of her employment with the government at the time of the tragic accident.see kerns,d at.the court gave two reasons for its conclusion.first,it posited that scott was running personal errands at the time of the accident.the court observed that scott affidavit clearly states that the accident occurred soon after she finished shopping at the fort meade px,and that scott gives no indication that she was shopping for or on behalf of her employer.id.at.second,the court found that scott had rented the car on her own initiative for use in her personal time.the court noted that the travel orders apparently did not authorize a rental car,as evidenced by t he fact that scott did not request or receive reimbursement.id.the court thus ruled that it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the complaint.id.at.kerns filed a timely notice of appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
kerns primary contention on appeal is that the key jurisdictional scott was acting within the scope of her employment with the also an issue central to the merits of her ftca claim.she thus maintains that the district court should have assumed jurisdiction,proceeded to the merits of her ftca claim,and treated the government rule b dismissal motion as a rule request for summary judgment.kerns further asserts that,had the court applied the appropriate legal principles,it would have denied the motion and authorized discovery on the issue 
in resolving this appeal,we first ascertain the proper legal framework for resolving a rule b motion to dismiss,when the jurisdictional facts are inextricably intertwined with those central to the merits.we then assess whether,in the context of this ftca claim,the issue is an essential aspect of both the jurisdictional question and the merits,rendering dismissal under rule b inappropriate.
we have heretofore recognized that a defendant may challenge subject matter jurisdiction in one of two ways.see adams bain,cir.first,the defendant may contend that a complaint simply fails to allege facts upon which subject matter jurisdiction can be based.id.when a defendant makes a facial challenge to subject matter jurisdiction,the plaintiff,in effect,is afforded the same procedural protection as he would receive under a rule b consideration.id.in that situation,the facts alleged in the complaint are taken as true,and the motion must be denied if the complaint alleges sufficient facts to invoke subject matter jurisdiction.
in the alternative,the defendant can the government does here that the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint are not true.adams,at.the plaintiff in this latter situation is afforded less procedural protection if the defendant challenges the factual predicate of subject matter jurisdiction,a trial court may then go beyond the allegations of the complaint and in an evidentiary hearing determine if there are facts to support the jurisdictional allegations,without converting the motion to a summary judgment proceeding.id.emphasis added.in that situation,the presumption of truthfulness normally accorded a complaint allegations does not apply,and the district court is entitled to decide disputed issues of fact with respect to subject matter jurisdiction.
as we explained in adams,vesting a district court with the discretion to determine whether it possesses jurisdiction generally presents no problems.see at.but as judge sprouse cautioned in adams,where the jurisdictional facts are intertwined with the facts central to the merits of the dispute,a presumption of truthfulness should attach to the plaintiff allegations.id.in that situation,the defendant has challenged not only the court jurisdiction but also the existence of the plaintiff cause of action.a trial court should then afford the plaintiff the procedural as would apply were the plaintiff facing a direct attack on the merits.the fifth circuit has aptly described the underlying rationale for this approach 
n o purpose is served by indirectly arguing the merits in the context of federal jurisdiction.judicial economy is best promoted when the existence of a federal right is directly reached and,where no claim is found to exist,the case is dismissed on the merits.this refusal to treat indirect attacks on the merits as rule b motions provides,moreover,a greater level of protection to the plaintiff who in truth is facing a challenge to the validity of his claim the defendant is forced to proceed under rule b or rule both of which place greater restrictions on the district court discretion.
williamson tucker,cir.thus,when the jurisdictional facts and the facts central to a tort claim are inextricably intertwined,the trial court should ordinarily assume jurisdiction and proceed to the intertwined merits issues.see united states ex rel.vuyyuru jadhav,cir.as the supreme court has explained with respect to such situations,a trial court should dismiss under rule b only when the jurisdictional allegations are clearly immaterial,made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly unsubstantial and frivolous.bell hood.
in short,when a defendant asserts that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to support subject matter jurisdiction,the trial court must apply a standard patterned on rule b and assume the truthfulness of the facts alleged.on the other hand,when the defendant challenges the veracity of the facts underpinning subject matter jurisdiction,the trial court may go beyond the complaint,conduct evidentiary proceedings,and resolve the disputed jurisdictional facts.and when the jurisdictional facts are inextricably intertwined with those central to the merits,the court should resolve the relevant factual disputes only after appropriate discovery,unless the jurisdictional allegations are clearly immaterial or wholly unsubstantial and frivolous.see bell,at.
in this case,the government makes the second type of challenge,contending that kerns complaint included jurisdictional allegations that are not true.therefore,we must assess whether the jurisdictional facts are so intertwined with the merits that dismissal under rule b was inappropriate.
absent a statutory waiver,sovereign immunity shields the united states from a civil tort suit.see united states sherwood.when it enacted the ftca in,congress waived the sovereign immunity of the united states for certain torts committed by federal employees.fdic meyer,d.the ftca grants jurisdiction to the district courts only with respect to a certain category of claims.id.at.in order for a claim to fall within that limited category,it must be made 
against the united states,for money dam ages,for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
id.quoting b alterations in original.in other words,to establish subject matter jurisdiction,an ftca plaintiff bears the burden of establishing,inter alia,that the government employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment at the time of the accident.the issue is thus,on its face,a jurisdictional scott was acting outside the scope of her employment with the government,the district court lacks jurisdiction over kerns ftca claim.
meanwhile,the underlying cause of action in an ftca claim is derived from the applicable state law.an action under the ftca may only be maintained if the government would be liable as an individual under the law of the state where the negligent act occurred.see b.in maryland,an employer is liable for the tortious acts of its employee under the doctrine of respondeat superior,but only if the employee negligent acts were committed within the scope of employment.see oaks connors.thus,the issue is also an element of kerns ftca scott was acting outside the scope of her employment with the government,kerns can not satisfy an element of her negligence claim against the united states.
notwithstanding the overlap between the jurisdictional elements of the ftca and the requirements of a claim of respondeat superior liability under maryland law,the opinion concluded that the ftca jurisdictional issues arising under respondeat superior theories are normally quite distinct from the underlying merits of the case and thus would not usually present a serious problem for a court deciding a b motion.kerns,d at quotin
