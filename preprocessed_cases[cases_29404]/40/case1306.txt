appellants sandlands c d,llc sandlands and express disposal service,llc eds contest the validity of horry county flow control ordinance,which prohibits disposal of waste generated in horry county at any site other than a designated publicly owned landfill.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of horry county,and appellants challenge its determination that the ordinance violates neither the commerce clause nor the equal protection clause.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
horry county occupies the northernmost coastal section of south carolina.because of its coastline,large geographic size,seasonal population changes,and high water table,landfill waste disposal has been expensive and difficult.see horry,ordinance.consequently,in the county council established the horry county solid waste authority,swa,a nonprofit corporation,to manage the county solid waste.id.although the swa is a separate legal entity,horry county maintains power over it in multiple ways approving its budget,large capital expenditures,and real estate transactions appointing its board of directors wielding approval authority over all bylaw amendments and requiring that the horry county treasurer hold all its funds and issue its checks.furthermore,the irs categorizes the swa as a governmental unit or affiliate of a governmental unit.on appeal,it is undisputed that the swa is a public entity.
the swa owns and operates two landfills one for municipal solid waste and one for construction and demolition c d waste and a recycling facility in horry county.in addition,the swa sponsors educational programs on recycling and runs a green power facility that harnesses the methane gas emitted by landfills to generate electricity.the swa charges haulers and others who use its landfills tipping fees based on the tonnage of trash deposited.these fees,which are standard in the industry,provide revenue to fund swa operations.haulers who recycle a specified percentage of the waste they collect pay a reduced tipping fee through an recycling incentive program.
on march,the horry county council enacted ordinance flow control ordinance or ordinance to create a plan for solid waste disposal.horry,ordinance.the final version of the flow control ordinance,as amended on april,provides 
the county hereby designates the disposal facilities operated by the swa public owned facilities designated by the swa for the acceptance or disposal of acceptable waste.the dumping or depositing by any person at any place other than at the designated facilities of any acceptable waste generated within the county is prohibited.
id.by requiring that all acceptable waste be disposed of at swa or other designated public landfills,the ordinance aims to conserve resources,prevent pollution,and protect the public health,safety,and.id.it also ensures the swa a revenue stream from the tipping fees haulers must pay to deliver waste.
to effect its objectives,the ordinance sets out a detailed regulatory and enforcement framework.it defines the term acceptable waste as ordinary household,municipal,institutional,commercial and industrial solid waste excluding recyclables as well as hazardous waste,sewage,agricultural waste,biomedical waste,and certain types of nuclear waste.id,defining acceptable and unacceptable waste,excluding recyclables.it also sets out rules and licensing requirements for waste haulers.id.
the flow control ordinance has been largely successful in ensuring that waste generated in horry county is deposited at an approved landfill within the county.according to the south carolina solid waste management annual reports from,and,an swa facility processed out of tons,or over of the waste generated in the county during those years.
the remaining tons of waste were taken to four landfills outside of the county the georgetown county landfill,the berkeley county w s landfill,the oakridge landfill,and the richland landfill.horry county and georgetown county have an intergovernmental agreement,predating the enactment of the flow control ordinance,under which waste collected near the counties shared border may be taken to the other county landfills.according to the swa,much of the waste taken to the other landfills was not acceptable waste under the flow control other words,it was waste,such as the hazardous material asbestos,that the swa landfills can not process.horry county also acknowledged that some waste may have been removed from the county without the swa knowledge or consent.
the enactment of the flow control ordinance altered the local economy of waste management.for example,sandlands,which operates a private landfill for c d waste in neighboring marion county,south carolina,saw a significant decrease in its business.because the sandlands landfill is located only two miles from the horry county border,a significant portion of the waste deposited there used to originate in horry county.the ordinance now prohibits haulers from bringing horry county waste to the sandlands landfill in order to take advantage of its lower tipping fees.sandlands has since struggled financially because of its inability to replace the revenue stream lost as a result of the ordinance.
eds operates a waste hauling service in southeastern north carolina and northeastern south carolina.prior to the passage of the flow control ordinance,eds transported waste from horry county to the sandlands landfill and received certain benefits as a result,such as increased hours of access and special,lower tipping fees.eds has been issued at least seventeen citations for violating the flow control ordinance.
as an alternate business strategy,sandlands attempted to open a facility to process recovered at its marion county site,where it would have sorted general c d debris into recyclable materials and waste.when sandlands requested permission from horry county to remove mixed c d debris for this purpose,a representative from the horry county attorney office responded,d ebris from a construction site that simply contains materials that have not yet been separated is still solid waste and is subject to the requirements of the ordinance.at.no company has been allowed to take mixed waste generated in horry county outside of the county,although two other companies extract recoverable materials from acceptable waste at small transfer stations within horry county.
appellants brought an action for declaratory judgment,damages,and injunctive relief in south carolina state court,which horry county removed to federal court.among other claims,appellants argued that the flow control ordinance violates the equal protection clauses of the united states and south carolina constitutions,the commerce clause of the united states constitution,and the contract clauses of the united states and south carolina constitutions after a hearing,the district court granted horry county motion for summary judgment as to each of the causes of action.this appeal followed.
appellants contest the district court rulings on the validity of the flow control ordinance under the commerce clause and equal protection clause of the constitution as to the dormant commerce clause,appellants argue that the district court erred by failing to analyze whether the flow control ordinance is facially discriminatory,by misapplying the test laid out in pike bruce church,and by ignoring genuine disputes of material fact at the stage.as to the equal protection clause,appellants contend that summary judgment is not appropriate because there remain genuine disputes of material fact regarding whether private companies are subject to differential treatment under the flow control ordinance.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.building graphics,lennar,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute of material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
appellants first argue that the flow control ordinance violates the commerce clause of the constitution,which gives congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.const.art.i,cl.the supreme
