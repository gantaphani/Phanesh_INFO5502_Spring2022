michael gagliardi lost his position on the merrimack valley workforce investment board board in lawrence,massachusetts,when the board was dissolved for failure to achieve the required state certification.he brought suit under claiming that michael sullivan,lawrence mayor mayor sullivan,along with the city of lawrence itself city and three state officials,were responsible for the board dissolution and his consequent dismissal,and that such conduct amounted to a violation of his first and fourteenth amendment rights.the three state officials moved to dismiss gagliardi claim for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted,see.b,and the district court granted the motion with respect to all five defendants.gagliardi appeals this dismissal,but only with respect to mayor sullivan and the city.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
since the district court dismissed gagliardi complaint pursuant to rule b,we assume the truth of the facts therein.sanchez ramos,cir see also ruiz bally total fitness holding,cir.we draw our recounting of the relevant facts from the complaint and the documents annexed to it or fairly incorporated within it.see wetmore macdonald,page,schatz,fletcher,llc,cir.
the board was a nonprofit corporation established pursuant to the workforce investment act.its duties included determining how to allocate federal,state,and local funds to occupational training in lawrence and surrounding communities,establishing workforce development policy,and assisting in overseeing two career centers in the lawrence area.during the relevant period,mayor sullivan served as the board chief elected official.among mayor sullivan duties as chief elected official was to appoint members to the board.see id.c a.
the workforce investment act requires that local boards be certified by the governor of the state every two years,based on certain specified criteria.see id.c.during the relevant period,mitt romney governor romney delegated responsibility for certifying workforce investment boards,along with receiving and evaluating documents,to the massachusetts division of career services dcs,headed by susan lawler commissioner lawler.dcs was a subunit of the massachusetts department of workforce development dwd,headed by ranch kimball secretary kimball dcs conditionally certified gagliardi board sometime in pending the fulfillment of certain criteria.
at a certain point,the board became concerned with the way mayor sullivan was using grant money subject to the board jurisdiction.it set up a task force,which in the summer of uncovered a covert fund of some million which mayor sullivan was using for his own purposes.the board produced a report exposing the existence of the fund and criticizing mayor sullivan use of board funds in general.
in the meantime,the board was having problems obtaining its biennial certification from dcs.it had submitted a certification package sometime in,but dcs stated that it would not certify the board until mayor sullivan had completed certain tasks which he failed to do throughout.dcs cited this failure as a reason for its inability to grant full certification to the board.
in september,the city acknowledged that the board had compiled all the certification documents within its purview,but that there were a few items that remain ed which were dependent on city of lawrence decisions.soon thereafter,gagliardi and the board chair disclosed mayor sullivan inaction to a local newspaper,which published an article on the matter on september.according to gagliardi complaint,this publicity infuriated mayor sullivan brother,kevin sullivan,who purportedly threatened to use his influence with the state to cause the board to be decertified.
on october,commissioner lawler informed the board that,due to its continued conditionally certified status,it was no longer authorized to undertake workforce development business,and would be confined to whatever business was necessary to rectify outstanding certification issues.mayor sullivan put attorney william diadamo in charge of compiling and presenting a final certification package to dcs.apparently as part of this package,diadamo drafted a new set of board bylaws which,inter alia,would give mayor sullivan the power to dismiss board members at will.the board chair refused to go along with the termination provision,claiming it was inconsistent with the workforce investment act.gagliardi claims that,in response to this refusal,diadamo father said he had powerful allies in ranch kimball office,who would decertify the board on a moment notice.
according to the complaint,at some point in november,mayor sullivan met at a secret location with four dcs dwd officials.at the end of the meeting,the mayor announced that he had disbanded the board.mayor sullivan and dcs took the position that the board had to be dissolved because of its failure to submit a complete certification package,and mayor sullivan expressed the view that conflicts among the board members had prevented it from functioning effectively.
procedure in the district court 
on march,gagliardi filed suit in the district court under,claiming that mayor sullivan,the city,commissioner lawler,secretary kimball,and governor romney had infringed his constitutional rights to free speech and procedural due process.he averred,inter alia,that t he board members were fired for performing an oversight function required by federal law,and that mayor sullivan and dcs conspired to destroy the board by interfering with the certification process.gagliardi sought,inter alia,a declaration that the termination of the board was unlawful,an injunction reinstating the board and requiring mayor sullivan to assist it in achieving certification,and compensatory and punitive damages.
governor romney,secretary kimball,and commissioner lawler moved jointly under rule b to dismiss gagliardi complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.neither mayor sullivan nor the city joined the motion.at the hearing on the motion,counsel for governor romney,secretary kimball,and commissioner lawler presented arguments,as did counsel for gagliardi counsel for mayor sullivan and the city was in attendance,but made no submissions and acknowledged that he was not obviously participating substantively in the discussions the district court dismissed all of gagliardi federal only against governor romney,secretary kimball,and commissioner lawler,but also against mayor sullivan and the remanded the state claims to massachusetts court 
procedure on appeal 
gagliardi appealed the dismissal of his complaint,only with respect to mayor sullivan,the city,and commissioner lawler.commissioner lawler filed a response brief mayor sullivan and the city did not,and did not appear for oral argument.before oral argument,commissioner lawler and gagliardi moved pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure b to dismiss the appeal with respect to her.we granted the motion

free speech claim 
claims of retaliatory adverse employment action for the exercise of first amendment rights are cognizable under.see powell alexander,cir.to make out such a claim in the present circumstances,the facts in the complaint,considered together with the documents annexed to it or fairly incorporated within it,must establish that gagliardi speech was protected under the first amendment so as to shield him from adverse employment action in retaliation for such speech and that he suffered adverse employment action caused by mayor sullivan and the city.in addition,there is a third question concerned with causation,with whether the plaintiff can show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.curran cousins,cir the employer must,of course,have the opportunity to prove that it would have made the same decision regardless of the protected expression.id.citing healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.
read in the light most favorable to gagliardi and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor,the complaint cites two concrete instances of speech which allegedly provoked the retaliatory dissolution of the board.the first was in the summer of,when the board issued its report exposing the existence of mayor sullivan million covert fund.the second was the september,newspaper article in which gagliardi and the chair of the board exposed mayor sullivan persistent failure to perform the tasks necessary for the board to complete its certification package.neither allegation is sufficient to state a claim on which relief can be granted.
first,it is evident that neither mayor sullivan nor anyone else whose conduct may be imputed to the city was directly responsible for decertifying,and thus dissolving,the board.despite the occasional asseveration that mayor sullivan himself fired,terminated,or disbanded the thus fired or terminated its is clear that only the governor and those acting with authority delegated by him were empowered to certify or decertify workforce investment boards.see c.nowhere does gagliardi allege that governor romney delegated this authority to mayor sullivan or another lawrence city official.he instead admits that governor romney delegated it to dcs,and that it was commissioner lawler as head of dcs who oversaw the certification process,including by corresponding with the board on the steps still needed to achieve certification,and by ultimately deciding that the board could transact no further workforce development business until it submitted a complete and satisfactory certification package.according to the complaint,mayor sullivan did not announce the board dissolution until after he had met in secret with unnamed officials from dcs or from dwd,the state agency of which dcs formed part.we reject the complaint intimation that mayor sullivan somehow twisted the arm of these officials,during this meeting or elsewhere,to persuade them to decertify the board this allegation is conclusory and is not substantiated by reasonable inference from the facts.see dartmouth review,at the facts do not demonstrate that either mayor sullivan or any other lawrence city official made or directly compelled the state officials to make the decision to decertify.
second,gagliardi complaint,viewed in the light most favorable to him,can also be read as making an allegation of indirect causation between mayor sullivan and the decision to decertify.the board was decertified for failing to submit a complete certification package.while the board had,sometime in,turned in all the required documentation it could to dcs,it fell to mayor sullivan as chief elected official to undertake the remaining tasks necessary for certification.gagliardi argues that mayor sullivan deliberately refrained from undertaking these tasks in retaliation for the critical report,the newspaper article,or both.
yet even if gagliardi could manage to prove at trial a causal nexus between mayor sullivan deliberate inaction and the decision to decertify the that dcs would have certified the board but for mayor sullivan has failed to demonstrate that either instance of speech was a substantial or motivating factor behind the inaction.the complaint avers that the certification package was ready,with the exception of the tasks required of mayor sullivan,sometime in.according to the complaint,t hroughout,the mayor,through his inaction,prevented the certification process from being completed.these facts plainly indicate that mayor sullivan inaction began at least some months before the two instances of speech,which occurred respectively in the summer of and on september.the speech in question did not provoke mayor sullivan to abstain from undertaking his tasks such abstention long predated the speech and continued up to the board november decertification.see johnson louisiana,cir i f the who imposed the adverse employment action was not motivated by the speech,then the speech did not cause the adverse employment action.even if a causal link could be demonstrated between mayor sullivan inaction and the decision to decertify the board,gagliardi has failed to plead sufficient facts to show that his speech was a substantial or motivating factor behind mayor sullivan inaction.
accordingly,gagliardi has failed to state a plausible entitlement to relief on the free speech claim he has not alleged sufficient facts to demonstrate that mayor sullivan or the city directly caused the board decertification or that,if mayor sullivan indirectly caused the decertification through his inaction,that the speech in question was a substantial or motivating factor behind such inaction.no relief could therefore be granted on this claim if the case were to proceed to trial.
due process claim 
what we have said above allows us to dispose of gagliardi fourteenth amendment due process claim in short order.invoking cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d,gagliardi argues that he had a property interest in his position on the board,and that he was deprived of this interest without due process of law by not being told the reasons for the board dissolution and his consequent dismissal,or being given an opportunity to be heard.see negrón,cir plaintiff must exhibit a constitutionally protected interest in life,liberty,or property to state a valid claim for a violation of fourteenth amendment due process quoting centro médico del turabo,at id.property interests are created and defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.quoting,cir loudermill,at.notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential principle s of due process.
this claim appears to be a relic from a time when the state officials ostensibly responsible for the decision to decertify the romney,secretary kimball for dwd,and commissioner lawler for dcs were still defendants in this case.we need not reach the question of whether massachusetts law gave gagliardi a property interest in continued appointment to the board because he can not make out a due process claim even if he can show such an interest.this is so because neither mayor sullivan nor any other lawrence official was responsible for the decision to decertify the board,and they accordingly had no duty to provide gagliardi with notice or an opportunity to be heard.if anyone owed gagliardi such,a question we do not would have been governor romney,secretary kimball,
