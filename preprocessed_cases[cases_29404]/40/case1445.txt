in this action under title vii of the civil rights act of,mary buckley alleged a variety of race discrimination,sex discrimination,and retaliation claims stemming from her employment as a special agent with the drug enforcement administration the dea during a trial conducted in the eastern district of virginia in the fall of,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law to the government on buckley retaliation claim,and the jury found in favor of the government on all remaining claims.thereafter,buckley unsuccessfully sought a new trial on three grounds that the district court improperly restricted the introduction of evidence,relevant to buckley theory of retaliatory animus,regarding a separate,ongoing race discrimination action against the dea in which buckley was a class member relatedly,that the court erred in awarding judgment as a matter of law to the government on her retaliation claim and that the court wrongly refused to give an adverse inference instruction against the government for spoliation of evidence.buckley has appealed,and,as explained below,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
buckley,an woman,joined the dea as a special agent in and has now retired.during her career as a special agent,she held a variety of positions within the dea,including undercover,international,and supervisory posts.she also received awards for distinguished service and a series of performance appraisals rating her work for the dea as excellent.
in,a class as the segar litigation was filed in the district court for the district of columbia,alleging race discrimination by the dea against special agents,in contravention of title vii.the segar litigation was brought on behalf of,inter alia,all special agents currently serving with the dea including buckley.following a bench trial,the segar court determined,in,that the defendants had indeed discriminated against special agents in various ways,including reliance on subjective evaluations by supervisors to award promotions.see segar civiletti.thus,in,the court entered an order enjoining the defendants from discriminating against special agents in promotions and mandating implementation of a nondiscriminatory promotion system.see segar smith,wl,the segar order.
thereafter,in,the dea implemented a new system for special agent promotions to positions at the and grades.the new system relied on an evaluation process called the special agent promotion process the sapp.candidates scoring high on the sapp were placed on a best qualified list the bql.then,the supervisor over the vacancy in question could submit a short list to the dea career board comprised of ten senior dea officials of the top three candidates from the bql in order of preference.finally,the career board selected a special agent for the position,usually from the short list.
in,the plaintiffs in the segar litigation filed a motion for a compliance order,alleging that special agents continued to suffer from race discrimination under the new promotion system.in,the segar court granted the motion for a compliance order in part,enjoining use of the short list for promotions to and positions,pending a showing that its use could be validated as consistent with the dea obligations under title vii.see segar reno,the segar order when nearly managerial positions subsequently went unfilled,the parties entered into a joint by the temporary use of the short list for promotions to and positions,subject to certain terms and conditions.see segar reno,the segar interim order 
in the spring of,buckley,then a special agent assigned to the office of inspections in the dea inspection division,was temporarily promoted to senior inspector in the office of inspections internal review and audit section,a position buckley immediate supervisor was gloria woods,head of the office of inspections,and woods in turn reported to william brown,the acting chief inspector,head of the inspection division.in her temporary senior inspector position,buckley supervised the section responsible for coordinating reviews of the dea by the general accounting office the gao.
on june,a gao representative contacted the dea about conducting a study of the dea hiring,promotion,and discipline systems at the request of congresswoman eddie bernice johnson,a member of the congressional black caucus.cynthia ryan,chief counsel for the dea,informed the gao representative that the systems in question were already the subject of the ongoing and still very active segar litigation.buckley,woods,and brown were forwarded a copy of an email message from ryan recounting her conversation with the gao representative,during which the gao representative expressed,in the words of ryan,that she intended to recommend against initiating this gao investigation,because the gao avoids investigating an area which is the subject of current litigation.id.in an ensuing exchange by email,brown suggested there might be issues that the dea would need to look into in response to the gao inquiry.buckley then responded to brown,on june,as follows 
i do think there should be additional information in event the gao intended study has no reflections on the segar litigation that ryan mentioned.i think that if it does involve the congressional black caucus,their conclusion will be that dea is using stalling tactics or have something to hide.in my opinion,gao conclusion would have no bearing on any pending litigation.
id.at email.
thereafter,the gao asked to meet with dea representatives in order to gather more information for a response to congresswoman johnson request.on june,buckley sent the following email message to ryan and brown 
as you are probably already aware,gao has made a request for a meeting with selected dea staffers.the purpose of the meeting is to get an understanding of issues surrounding discrimination,hiring,promotions and disciplinary actions against black agents in dea.gao understands ryan position.however,gao is familiar with the whole situation,therefore needs to make a determination as to how gao can adequately address eddie bernice johnson request and,what aspects,if any,that gao can look into in order to address the congressional black caucus request.
email.email stated that p resent at this meeting will be,among others,representatives of the segar plaintiffs steering committee the equal employment opportunity monitoring committee,or eeomc,ryan,and several other specified dea officials.id.in addition to ryan and brown,email was sent to rosalynde fenner,head of the eeomc,and two more eeomc members.as such,ryan viewed email as an effort by buckley,acting on her own accord,to involve the eeomc in the initial meeting 
email closed by stating that t he meeting will take place friday,june,in in conference room on the floor west building.thanks.the email recipients were notified on june,however,that the june meeting with the gao had been cancelled.shortly thereafter,brown sent an email message to woods saying that he had heard from several people that the way this meeting was handled by mary buckley and her staff was and aggravating,in that t he meeting was agreed to and with an outside agency,committing dea participation at high levels without the courtesy of checking with them to see if the meeting agreed with their respective schedules.id.at.brown criticized email for constituting a directive to attend the scheduled meeting rather than a message of coordination regarding a proposed meeting.id.brown also admonished that o ur job in the inspection division is to facilitate contacts with outside agencies so that they can conduct their studies and audits.our job is not to direct participation or to mandate attendance at such meetings.id.
in july,the dea posted two position openings,vacancy the permanent position in which buckley was then temporarily serving and vacancy.buckley applied for each of the positions,and was among candidates on the bql for vacancy and candidates on the bql for vacancy.
as acting chief inspector,brown was responsible for creation of the short lists for vacancies in the inspection division.brown tasked woods with the creation of the short lists for vacancies and,and woods placed buckley on the short list for each,ranked first for vacancy and second for vacancy brown later informed woods,however,that william had been named chief inspector but was then serving as the dea acting deputy administrator and,thus,the chairman of the career board wanted buckley name removed from the short lists.brown and woods met with simpkins,who criticized buckley speaking,writing,and interpersonal skills.when woods became upset by his comments,simpkins suggested that woods and brown discuss the matter between themselves.in the subsequent conversation between woods and brown,woods defended buckley and asserted that she had done an outstanding job in her temporary post.brown nevertheless urged woods to remove buckley name from the short lists,expressing concern that the vacancies would remain unfilled in view of simpkins opposition to buckley candidacy.woods then removed buckley name from each of the short lists before submitting them to the career board.on august,the career board selected from the short lists an man for vacancy and a white man for vacancy 
a few days later,on august,brown sent a memorandum to woods,in which he criticized buckley performance during a july,interagency briefing presented by the office of inspections to,among others,simpkins and brown.brown wrote to woods that,
f ollowing the briefing,we had an opportunity to discuss the briefing with acting administrator simpkins.he expressed his displeasure to you with the briefing and was particularly dissatisfied with the apparent lack of understanding and knowledge exhibited by acting senior inspector buckley,as well as another briefer.after you left acting administrator simpkins office he directed me to document the shortcomings of the briefings to you in a memorandum.
brown acknowledged in the memorandum that buckley had not expected to serve as a briefer and thus had a limited opportunity to prepare.nevertheless,brown also expressed his and simpkins criticism of buckley,who was responsible for the program at issue in the briefing,for deferr ing repeatedly to subordinates when attempting to answer questions and for g iving the impression that she was not familiar with the subject matter.id.at.
that same day,august,buckley sent an email message to fenner,head of the eeomc,memorializing a discussion between buckley and simpkins about why buckley was denied a promotion.according to buckley,simpkins stated a lot of things,including that buckley was not the best of the best qualified.simpkins specifically cited buckley handling,via email,of the scheduling of the meeting,as well as her performance during the recent interagency briefing.in buckley view,t he bottom line was that simpkins was upset about the gao report that cindy ryan complained about,the gao impending study of the dea hiring,promotion,and discipline systems.id.
on august,buckley consulted with a dea equal employment opportunity eeo counselor about the dea failure to promote her.on august,buckley was among several and special agents notified that they were subject to being transferred from dea headquarters in northern virginia to a field office,as part of a regular agency transfer process.on october,buckley filed an internal eeo complaint with the department of justice,alleging that her removal from the short lists for vacancies and,as well as the threatened transfer from dea headquarters to a field office,were based on her race and sex and were retaliatory.on february,brown downgraded buckley annual performance rating from outstanding to acceptable.on april,buckley was permitted to amend her eeo complaint to contest the downgrading of her appraisal.in may,the career board with simpkins abstaining voted to transfer buckley to the miami field office 
on may,after exhausting her administrative remedies and being issued a letter,buckley initiated this action in the district of columbia.on march,she filed in that court an amended complaint alleging that the government contravened title vii by removing her from the short lists for vacancies and the failure to promote transferring her to the miami field office the geographic reassignment and downgrading her february performance appraisal the negative review.buckley asserted that each of these actions was racially and sexually discriminatory,as well as retaliatory.on march,the district of columbia court transferred buckley title vii claims to the eastern district of virginia on venue grounds.see buckley gonzales,the buckley transfer order 
buckley trial in the virginia district court commenced on october,during preliminary proceedings,the district court sought to clarify the theories underlying buckley title vii retaliation claims the court concluded that buckley could proceed on the premise that the government retaliated against her for having engaged in protected participation activities,with relation to both her internal eeo complaint and her involvement in the segar litigation.nevertheless,the court only reluctantly accepted buckley segar litigation theory that the government retaliatory with regard to the failure to prompted by buckley active participation in the ongoing segar litigation as compared to passive membership in the plaintiff class,including her effort,via email,to include the eeomc in the initial meeting.for support of this theory,buckley pointed to the pretrial deposition testimony of dea chief counsel ryan,revealing that she had shared her concerns about buckley email conduct with acting deputy administrator simpkins,a key decisionmaker with respect to buckley subsequent nonpromotion.see supra note.the district court permitted buckley to attempt to demonstrate that simpkins or another decisionmaker knew of and was motivated by her active participation in the segar litigation,though the court expressed doubt that buckley could demonstrate such a causal relationship between her protected activity and nonpromotion 
despite the district court belief that buckley faced difficulties in proving the segar litigation theory of retaliatory animus,the court limited the evidence that could be presented to the jury with respect to the segar litigation,invoking several provisions of the federal rules of evidence.the characterized the segar litigation as ancient history by the summer of,when the events complained of began,buckley not to name the segar litigation or describe its history,including any past findings of discrimination.rather,the court merely gave allowances that you may ask and you may say to the jury that you intend to show that the retaliatory conduct was based,in part,on her being active in ongoing litigation against the dea for race discrimination,and we deal with it in the federal rule of civil procedure stage.id.at.the court also permitted evidence on the requirements of the dea and promotion system and its purpose of ensuring equal opportunity,but barred mention that the promotion system was governed by the segar interim order.
finally during the preliminary proceedings,the district court denied buckley request for an adverse inference instruction against the government for spoliation of evidence.buckley request was based on the dea destruction of electronic documents including email messages,pursuant to routine internal procedures,from the time the government could reasonably anticipate this litigation until nearly two weeks after its discovery responses to buckley were due.in refusing the adverse inference instruction,the court ruled that buckley had failed to make a requisite showing of willful conduct,rather than mere negligence.the court also suggested that it was proper for the dea to continue its routine document recycling protocols since n o order was entered to the contrary,and cited buckley for her own negligence or inattention in failing to obtain such an order,id.at.additionally,the court indicated that an adverse inference instruction would be improper for the reason that buckley failed to identify any specific document or set of documents which someone says would typically have said something that the plaintiff now say s she should have an inference that it did say that.id.at.the court concluded that s imply an adverse inference that these documents would reflect adversely on defendant case paints with too broad a brush.so i going to deny the request for an adverse inference instruction.id.at.
following the preliminary trial proceedings,during buckley,dea chief counsel ryan was called as a witness and questioned within the limitations set forth by the district court.ryan testified about her concerns over buckley conflicting roles as the dea liaison for the gao study and as a plaintiff class member in the segar litigation referred to in front of the jury as,some active litigation.see.ryan testimony was similar to that given during her pretrial deposition.for example,ryan again testified at trial about sharing her concerns with acting deputy administrator simpkins.as compared to her deposition testimony,however,ryan trial testimony was appreciably as a result of the district court limitations on discussion of the segar litigation.during the government presentation,neither simpkins nor acting chief inspector brown testified to having any knowledge during the relevant time period that buckley was actively involved in the segar litigation.
before the case was submitted to the jury,the government made a motion,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,for judgment as a matter of law.the district court granted the government rule motion with respect to buckley retaliation claim.the court premised its ruling on,inter alia,the lack of a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find that the relevant decisionmakers simpkins and brown knew that buckley was an active participant in the segar litigation,rather than simply a passive member of the plaintiff class.the court rejected buckley reliance on ryan testimony to establish simpkins knowledge,characterizing that testimony as too slender a reed to permit the jury to speculate on whether simpkins knew that buckley was more than a member of the class.
thereafter,on november,the remaining failure to promote based on race vacancy only and sex vacancies and,and for retaliatory negative submitted to the jury.later that same day,the jury returned a verdict in the government favor,and the district court entered judgment against buckley.
on november,buckley filed a motion for a new trial,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.she contended,inter alia,that the district court had erred in limiting discussion at trial of the segar litigation,in granting rule judgment as a matter of law on her retaliation claim,and in refusing to give an adverse inference instruction against the government for spoliation of evidence.by order of december,the court denied buckley rule new trial motion.see buckley gonzales,the buckley order the court explained therein that it had properly limited discussion of the segar litigation at trial,because further information on the litigation was inadmissible under the federal rules of evidence.see id.at.next,the court concluded that it had appropriately granted the government rule motion on buckley retaliation claim,in that she failed to produce any evidence that ryan concerns over buckley conflicting roles as the dea liaison for the gao study and as a plaintiff class member in the segar litigation were communicated to the actual decisionmakers,and,thus,there was no evidence in the record to allow a reasonable jury to find the requisite causal connection between buckley active participation in the segar litigation and her nonpromotion.id.at.finally,the court reiterated its earlier ruling that buckley was not entitled to an adverse inference instruction against the government for spoliation of evidence,because she failed to show that the destruction of documents was a result of intentional conduct.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
buckley timely noted this appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
in this appeal,buckley contends that the district court erred in denying her a new trial on the three grounds discussed above the restriction of trial evidence with respect to the segar litigation the award of judgment as a matter of law to the government on her retaliation claim and the denial of her request for an adverse inference instruction against the government for spoliation of evidence.we review the court denial of buckley new trial motion,made pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,for abuse of discretion.see bryant aiken reg l med.ctrs,cir.on buckley rule motion,the court should have granted a new trial only if the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence,or is based on evidence which is false,or as buckley asserts with respect to the verdict in her trial will result in a miscarriage of justice.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we assess each of buckley asserted grounds for a new trial in turn.
first,buckley maintains that the district court improperly limited the trial evidence with respect to the details of the segar litigation.we review the court decision to exclude such evidence for abuse of discretion.see schultz capital int l,cir.by definition,the court abused its discretion if it made an error of law.see rzs holdings avv pdvsa petroleo,cir.the court evidentiary ruling,however,even if it constitutes an abuse of discretion,is reversible only if it affects buckley substantial rights.schultz,at citing.a.
as the district court explained during the preliminary trial proceedings and in the buckley order,it limited discussion of the segar litigation under multiple provisions of the federal rules of evidence rule defining r elevant evidence as evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence rule providing that e vidence which is not relevant is not admissible rule a generally prohibiting the admission of character evidence for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion rule b providing that e vidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith,but may be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident and rule allowing that,a lthough relevant,evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by,inter alia,the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury.
during the preliminary trial proceedings,the district court observed that buckley sought to introduce evidence regarding the segar litigation in order to establish an environment of discrimination within the dea.the court characterized this justification for admitting the evidence as nothing but another way of saying propensity.these people discriminated before,they are discriminating now.id.the court deemed such propensity evidence inadmissible,invoking rules,and a.by the buckley order,the court further observed that the segar litigation evidence was properly limited under rules and,explaining that 
the segar litigation,which began in,involved different decisionmakers whose racial animus can not be attributed to the decisionmakers here.thus,the facts or circumstances underlying segar are not relevant to the employment actions taken by this defendant against plaintiff.
buckley order.similarly,the court observed that,because buckley sought to introduce the prior bad acts of other to show defendant state of mind,the evidence is inadmissible under rule b.id.at.finally,with respect to the rule aspect of its ruling,the court determined that,even assuming the segar litigation was relevant to the defendant state of mind in this case,the potential unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues is manifest,and substantially outweighs any probative value of the segar litigation evidence.id.
apparently,the district court misunderstood the purpose for which buckley sought the admission of the segar litigation evidence.buckley did not,as the court believed,seek to use such evidence to establish either a general propensity to discriminate against employees within the dea,or a more specific racially discriminatory animus on the part of the decisionmakers in her case based on past discriminatory acts committed by other dea.rather,buckley intended to utilize the segar litigation evidence to demonstrate retaliatory animus,as she was required to do to prevail on her retaliation claims.specifically,buckley sought to show that the pendency of segar and the long history of its burden on dea weighed heavily on the minds of the principal,and that,ultimately,those failed to promote buckley because of her involvement in the litigation.br.of appellant.
buckley segar litigation the government retaliatory animus was prompted by,inter alia,her email invitation to the eeomc to attend the initial essential to her retaliation claim,and also relevant to her retaliation claim though that claim could also rely on the theory that the government animus stemmed from buckley internal eeo complaint.nevertheless,under the district court ruling on the segar litigation evidence,buckley was barred from presenting evidence,for example,of the segar plaintiffs various successes against the dea,from the initial findings of race discrimination to the series of injunctions controlling dea operations,including the segar interim order governing the very promotions at issue in this case.although buckley was permitted to introduce evidence on the requirements of the dea promotion system and its purpose of ensuring equal opportunity,she was prohibited from mentioning to the jury that the promotion system was governed by the segar interim order or in any way connected to the nebulous ongoing litigation against the dea in which she was involved.these restrictions on the segar litigation evidence foreclosed a coherent and compelling evidentiary account of the government alleged retaliation.by prohibit ing buckley from introducing evidence of the segar l itigation in all but the most sanitized terms,br.of appellant,the court prevented buckley from demonstrating why her participation in that litigation so rankled the relevant dea decisionmakers that they were provoked to retaliate against her.
we are constrained to conclude that the district court ruling on the segar litigation evidence constituted an error of law and,thus,an abuse of discretion.as buckley contends,retaliation claims like hers,which are 
based on retaliation for pursuing discrimination claims in the past,are inextricably linked to past acts of discrimination.because such evidence of prior bad acts speaks directly to the defendant motive or intent to retaliate,such evidence must be admitted if the plaintiff is to have any real chance of proving her retaliation claim.
br.of appellant see also,funai brownlee,d observing that retaliation plaintiff presented trial evidence supporting theory that employer developed retaliatory animus after she obtained temporary restraining order in separate court proceeding against for religious harassment fernandez shore orthopedic surgery sports,d noting that retaliation plaintiff testified at trial about being discharged shortly after entering conciliation agreement with employer on prior administrative charge of national origin discrimination.
viewed in the light of its real purpose of establishing retaliatory animus,the segar litigation evidence is unquestionably r elevant within the meaning of rule.moreover,such evidence of other wrongs or acts is admissible under rule b,which allows evidence of other wrongs for purposes such as proof of motive and intent.johnson hugo skateway,cir en banc approving trial court admission under rule b of prior consent order prohibiting defendant further race discrimination against patrons,because evidence that defendant failed to comply with terms of consent order was probative of motive and intent issues in plaintiff civil rights case see also mullen princess anne volunteer fire,cir relying on rules and b for proposition that t he use of racially offensive language by the decisionmaker is relevant as to whether racial animus was behind the membership decision,and was proper evidence for the jury to consider 
although rule b evidence is subject to the balancing analysis of rule,the potential importance of evidence showing state of mind is properly weighed in the balance.mullen,at.clearly,the critical importance of the segar litigation evidence to buckley proof of retaliatory animus is not outweighed much less substantially outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice.id.at rejecting rule unfair prejudice contention with respect to evidence of racial epithets on ground,inter alia,that t he epithets involved here are offensive precisely because they convey the idea of racial bigotry,and t he emotional reaction claimed to be unfairly prejudicial is thus closely tied to the requisite inquiry into state of mind.to the extent there is any danger of confusion of the issues,a limiting instruction could be utilized to caution the jury that the segar litigation evidence is to be considered only as evidence of retaliatory animus.johnson,at approving the district court efforts to minimize any prejudicial effect on the defendants by way of instructions to the jury mullen,at observing that t he district court might have issued a cautionary instruction to the effect that the racial statements were only to be considered on the question of discriminatory intent in mullen particular case,but the outright exclusion of the evidence was improper.accordingly,the district court erred as a matter of law in relying on the federal rules of evidence to limit the segar litigation evidence as it did.
furthermore,the trial court error in restricting the segar litigation evidence affected buckley substantial rights by rendering her unable to cogently demonstrate segar retaliatory animus.see taylor.union,cir en banc recognizing that evidentiary errors do not affect substantial rights,and thus are harmless,if reviewing court is able to say with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the errors quoting,inter alia,kotteakos united states.some internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original see also bank of montreal signet bank,cir concluding that trial court committed reversible error under kotteakos by excluding evidence of contract terms necessary to fraud claim defense,in that g iven the great importance of the contract to the proper development and evaluation of material elements of the cause of action,it was not harmless to exclude that evidence.moreover,we can not say that the district court evidentiary error did not permeate the trial,negatively affecting the presentation of buckley race and sex discrimination claims,as well as her retaliation claims.we therefore conclude that buckley is entitled to a new trial on the claims that were,and which should have been,submitted to the jury in the trial.see rice cmty.health ass n,cir a partial new trial may be granted only if it clearly appears that the issue to be retried is so distinct and separable from the others that a trial of it alone may be had without injustice.quoting gasoline prods.champlin refining.
next,buckley asserts that the district court erred in awarding judgment as a matter of law to the government,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,on her retaliation claim.we review de novo the court grant of the government rule motion,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to buckley,the nonmoving party,and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor.see a helping hand,llc balt.county,cir see also int l ground,mayor of ocean city,cir.we must affirm if a reasonable jury could only rule in favor of the government if reasonable minds could differ,we must reverse.a helping hand,at.
at trial,the district court awarded judgment as a matter of law to the government on the retaliation claim on the ground that the evidence relied on by buckley to demonstrate retaliatory,the testimony of dea chief counsel ryan that she shared her concerns over buckley email conduct with acting deputy administrator too slender a reed to permit the jury to speculate on whether simpkins,a key decisionmaker with respect to buckley subsequent nonpromotion,knew that she was more than a passive plaintiff class member in the segar litigation.thereafter,in the buckley order,the court stood by its ruling,explaining that buckley failed to produce any evidence that ryan concerns were communicated to the actual decisionmakers simpkins and acting chief inspector brown,and,thus,that there was no evidence in the record to allow a reasonable jury to find the requisite causal connection between buckley active participation in the segar litigation and her nonpromotion.buckley order.
we find the proposition that ryan testimony was insufficient to establish simpkins knowledge to be dubious at best.nevertheless,we also recognize that,to the extent ryan testimony and other trial evidence failed to adequately support buckley retaliation claim,it was seemingly because of the district court improper restriction on the segar litigation evidence,as discussed supra.accordingly,we conclude that the court erred in granting the government rule motion on the retaliation claim,and thus reinstate that claim to be retried with the claims submitted to the jury in the trial 
finally,buckley contends that the district court wrongly refused her request for an adverse inference instruction against the government for spoliation of evidence.we review the court jury instructions for abuse of discretion.see a helping hand,at.of course,a n error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion.see also rzs holdings,at.the judgment will be reversed for error in jury instructions,however,only if the error is determined to have been prejudicial,based on a review of the record as a whole.abraham county of greenville,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
buckley sought an adverse inference instruction against the government for spoliation of evidence,the dea destruction of electronic documents,pursuant to routine internal procedures,from the time the government could reasonably anticipate this litigation until nearly two weeks after its discovery responses to buckley were due.the primary ground for the district court denial of buckley in the court ruling during the preliminary trial proceedings,as well as in the buckley that buckley failed to demonstrate willful or intentional conduct,rather than mere negligence,on the part of the government.in so ruling,the court relied on,inter alia,the following statement from our decision in vodusek bayliner marine 
an adverse inference about a party consciousness of the weakness of his case can not be drawn merely from his negligent loss or destruction of evidence the inference requires a showing that the party knew the evidence was relevant to some issue at trial and that his willful conduct resulted in its loss or destruction.
the vodusek plaintiff had alleged negligence,products liability,and wrongful death claims following the death of her husband from injuries sustained in a boat explosion and fire.see at.in examining the boat to discover the cause of the explosion and fire,vodusek expert witness,together with vodusek two sons,employed destructive methods which rendered many portions of the boat useless for examination by the defendants and their experts.id.at.at the defendants request,the trial court then instructed the jury that it was permitted to assume that evidence made unavailable to the defendants by acts of plaintiff counsel or agents would have been unfavorable to the plaintiff theory in the case.id.internal quotation marks omitted.on appeal,vodusek contended that the court erred in instructing the jury on the spoliation issue,because there was no evidence on the necessary element of bad faith.id.in our opinion,however,w e reject ed the argument that bad faith is an essential element of the spoliation rule.id.at.rather,we concluded that 
when a proponent intentional but not necessarily bad faith conduct contributes to the loss or destruction of evidence,the trial court has discretion to pursue a wide range of responses both for the purpose of leveling the evidentiary playing field and for the purpose of sanctioning the improper conduct.the court may,inter alia,permit the jury to draw unfavorable inferences against the party responsible for the loss or destruction of the original evidence.an adverse inference about a party consciousness of the weakness of his case,however,can not be drawn merely from his negligent loss or destruction of evidence the inference requires a showing that the party knew the evidence was relevant to some issue at trial and that his willful conduct resulted in its loss or destruction.
id.internal citations omitted.applying this standard in vodusek,we determined that,because portions of the boat were permanently destroyed as part of the plaintiff expert deliberate investigative efforts even if vodusek and her expert did not act in bad faith the trial court had properly submitted the spoliation issue to the jury.id.at.
in its analysis of buckley request for an adverse inference instruction,the district court appears to have committed an error of law by equating the intentional conduct necessary for such an instruction with bad faith,thereby deeming faith conduct to be negligent conduct.the court did not acknowledge that the dea document destruction,though not conducted in bad faith,could yet be intentional,willful,or deliberate.see vodusek,at.nevertheless,because we already are remanding for a new trial on other grounds,we simply leave it to the district court to consider on with our discussion request for an adverse inference instruction.in the circumstances,we do not unnecessarily engage in our own assessment of whether an adverse inference instruction is warranted,or whether buckley was prejudiced by the court prior refusal to give such an instruction.
we note,however,that the district court raised two possible alternative grounds for its ruling during the preliminary trial failure of buckley to secure a court order prohibiting the dea destruction of documents,and the lack of specificity in her request for the adverse inference instruction.because the issue of whether buckley was obliged to obtain a court order to ensure dea document preservation is likely to resurface,we simply observe that even absent a court order t he duty to preserve material evidence arises not only during litigation but also extends to that period before the litigation when a party reasonably should know that the evidence may be relevant to anticipated litigation.silvestri motors,cir.by contrast,we need not comment on the issue of whether buckley initial instruction request lacked sufficient specificity.rather,the district court the opportunity a fresh look at this and other relevant issues on remand.
pursuant to the foregoing,we vacate the district court judgment in favor of the government,and remand for such further proceedings as may be appropriate on buckley retaliation claim and the claims submitted to the jury in the trial.
