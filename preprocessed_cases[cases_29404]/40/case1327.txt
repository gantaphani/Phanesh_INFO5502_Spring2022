jonathan blitz,his wife marla tuchinsky,and their minor child eb collectively,the plaintiffs appeal from the district court dismissal of their complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.in december,the plaintiffs initiated this proceeding in the middle district of north carolina against janet napolitano,as secretary of homeland security,and john pistole,as administrator of the transportation security administration together,the defendants,challenging the use of advanced imaging technology ait scanners and invasive at airport screening checkpoints in the united states.on september,the defendants secured dismissal of the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in the district court.see blitz napolitano,cv,the dismissal order as the district court recognized,of title vests exclusive jurisdiction in an appropriate court of appeals with respect to a challenge to an order issued by the administrator of the transportation security administration the tsa.
on appeal,the plaintiffs maintain that the district court erred in so ruling because the tsa standard operating procedures for checkpoint screening the checkpoint screening sop which includes ait scanners and passenger does not constitute an order under.alternatively,the plaintiffs say,conferral of exclusive jurisdiction in a court of appeals deprives them of due process and contravenes the separation of powers rooted in the constitution.as explained below,we reject the plaintiffs contentions and affirm.
the federal statutes relating to transportation and aviation are codified in title of the united states code.the provision at issue in this appeal is found at,which,for our purposes,has two aspects it authorizes the filing,in an appropriate court of appeals,of a petition for review of an order issued by the tsa administrator and it specifies that the court of appeals will possess exclusive jurisdiction to review the petition with this statutory predicate in mind,we turn to the pertinent factual and procedural background of these proceedings.
following the events of september,the tsa was created by statute and vested with the primary responsibility for security of air passenger traffic in this country.the tsa commenced its testing and evaluation of ait scanners in,and,in,congress appropriated funds for the tsa procurement and installation of such scanners and other explosives detection systems.on january,in response to an attempted christmas day bombing in detroit,the president directed the department of homeland security,as the tsa parent agency,to aggressively pursue the use of enhanced screening technology in aviation.to date,the tsa has approved two types of ait scanners for operational use at airports one utilizes backscatter technology the other uses radio waves.such modern technologies are able to detect anomalies underneath an air passenger clothing,including small threat items and explosive devices such as those concealed on the christmas day bomber.a passenger opting out of an ait scan is subjected to a.
according to the declaration of tsa administrator pistole the declaration,see,the tsa has adopted the checkpoint screening sop for use at all airports,but the details of those procedures have not been revealed publicly the declaration explained that,
in january,the tsa determined that ait should be deployed as part of its primary screening program.this decision is reflected in tsa standard operating procedures sop for checkpoint screening,which was most recently revised on september,and implemented on october.although the checkpoint screening sop is not public,it sets forth the mandatory procedures that passengers must follow in order for a passenger to enter the sterile area of the airport.i approve d the sop prior to its issuance and the sop constitutes tsa final agency decision requiring the use of ait machines and implementing their use as a part of tsa standard security screening procedures.
id.the declaration further explained that a passenger choosing to opt out of an ait scan will undergo a,and the checkpoint screening sop mandates how such a is conducted the checkpoint screening sop was not filed with the declaration because,as pistole averred therein,the specifics of the procedures constitute sensitive security information.see r 
the plaintiffs complaint of december,alleges that the tsa use of ait scanners and invasive is unconstitutional.according to the complaint,plaintiff tuchinsky has opted out of ait screenings on two occasions at raleigh durham international airport on each of those occasions,she was subjected to a that was highly invasive and humiliating.the complaint further alleges that ait scanners emit radiation that damages human dna and other cell components that the invasive and ait scanner emissions are especially harmful to children and that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if they are subjected to ait screenings or prior to travelling by air.finally,the complaint asserts that ait scanners produce a near photographic quality image of a passenger naked body,and that the defendants have misrepresented the health risks posed by ait scanners as well as the storage and data transfer capabilities thereof.
the complaint seeks a declaration from the district court that the tsa use of ait scanners and invasive violates the fourth amendment.the complaint also requests injunctive relief barring the defendants from subjecting the plaintiffs to either ait screenings or invasive unless and until they are permitted to challenge the constitutionality of those practices.
on february,the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to rule b,maintaining that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.the motion asserted that the checkpoint screening sop constitutes an order issued by the tsa administrator under,and that a challenge to the order can be pursued only in an appropriate court of appeals.the defendants relied on pistole declaration in support of their motion,but also offered to provide the checkpoint screening sop to the district court for in camera review.
on september,at the conclusion of a hearing on the rule b motion,and without having reviewed the checkpoint screening sop,the district court announced that it would grant the defendants dismissal request.noting that its ruling was without prejudice to the plaintiffs,the court observed that,therefore,blitz,i do believe you be in any way barred from,refiling,whether you choose to appeal my ruling or refile in the circuit court,i think you would be free to do that.four days thereafter,the court entered its dismissal order,expressly adopting the reasoning of the district court for the district of columbia in its dismissal of a similar case.see durso napolitano,d granting rule b motion and dismissing,on basis of,air passengers challenge to tsa implementation of ait scanners and,aff sub nom.roberts napolitano,app x.the plaintiffs have noticed a timely appeal of the judgment of dismissal,asserting appellate jurisdiction under.
because the complaint was dismissed without prejudice,we first assess the question of appellate jurisdiction.as a general proposition,a dismissal without prejudice by a district court is not an appealable order under if the plaintiff could save his action merely by amending his complaint.domino sugar sugar workers local union,cir.the significance of the domino sugar principle is that we must evaluate the particular grounds for dismissal before either permitting or prohibiting appeals from dismissals without prejudice.go computer,microsoft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as judge wilkinson has explained,t he test for finality is not whether the suit is dismissed with prejudice or without prejudice the test is whether the district court has finished with the case.id.quoting hill potter,cir.
we are satisfied that,in this situation,the dismissal order qualifies as a final decision properly appealable under.as explained heretofore,the district court concluded that the exclusive jurisdiction provision in required dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.and it is apparent that the court dismissed the complaint without prejudice in order to permit the plaintiffs,if they choose,to pursue relief by way of a petition for review in an appropriate court of appeals.put simply,the filing of an amended complaint could not have solved the plaintiffs jurisdictional problem in the district court.in these circumstances,we possess appellate jurisdiction under to review the propriety of the dismissal order.
we thus turn to the merits of the dismissal order,which we assess de novo.see velasco gov t of indonesia,cir.in their opening brief,the plaintiffs identify three issues for resolution 
a secret agency order,affecting fundamental rights promulgated unilaterally and internally,with no indicia of an administrative record,subject only to deferential review in the circuit courts is inconsistent with due process and separation of powers 
the checkpoint screening sop is not a final order under and 
the district court erred in making a dispositive decision in applying the jurisdictional limitation in,by finding a document the checkpoint screening sop to be a final order subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of appeals without first reviewing the actual document.
see br.of appellants.because the plaintiffs second and third issues are nonconstitutional in nature,we evaluate them before turning to the plaintiffs first,constitutional issue.see ashwander.valley.brandeis,concurring it is not the habit of the court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.internal quotation marks omitted.
we initially address whether the district court erred by applying to the checkpoint screening sop without reviewing the written procedures themselves.to establish error,the plaintiffs rely on kerns united states,cir.unfortunately for the plaintiffs,kerns simply recognized that when jurisdictional facts are inextricably intertwined with those facts central to the merits,the district court should resolve the relevant factual disputes only after appropriate discovery.id.at.the controlling jurisdictional fact in kerns whether an employee was acting within the scope of her employment for purposes of the federal tort claims act has no analog in this proceeding.that is,the issue of whether the checkpoint screening sop constitutes an order under is purely a legal question that can be readily resolved in the absence of discovery.
the plaintiffs persist,however,that judge ervin decision in city of alexandria helms,cir,supports the proposition that the record below was insufficient to support the district court conclusion that the checkpoint screening sop is a order.applying the statutory predecessor of to an order of the federal aviation administration the faa relating to aircraft flight patterns at washington national airport,city of alexandria explained that the faa order would be subject to review in a court of appeals if,inter alia,it were capable of review on the basis of an administrative record.id.at 
the defendants did not file an administrative record in the district court.they have,however,advised us that the tsa produced an extensive administrative record in a similar circuit case,electronic privacy information center united states department of homeland security,and represented that the tsa would submit the relevant administrative record if the plaintiffs file a petition in an appropriate court of appeals.in these circumstances,we have no trouble concluding that the checkpoint screening sop is capable of review on the basis of an administrative record.city of alexandria,at.
being satisfied that the record was sufficient to answer the jurisdictional question in the district court,we turn to the issue of whether the checkpoint screening sop constitutes an order subject to.the plaintiffs appear to contend that the application of is substantially limited that is,it applies only to orders issued by the tsa administrator after the completion of adjudicatory proceedings where affected persons have been accorded an opportunity to participate none of our sister circuits have adopted such a narrow view of,however,and the adoption of the plaintiffs interpretation would contravene the plain language of the statute and controlling precedent.
during the pendency of this appeal,the supreme court,in elgin department of treasury,d,rendered a decision that both parties deem relevant to our assessment of the scope of.the elgin court explained that,where congress simply channels judicial review of a constitutional claim to a particular court,the appropriate inquiry is whether congress intent to preclude district court jurisdiction is fairly discernible in the statutory scheme.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.to determine whether it is fairly discernible that congress intended to bar the district court from exercising jurisdiction in this proceeding,elgin directs us to examine the text,structure,and purpose of.in so doing,we have no reason to look beyond the plain text of the statute,in which congress clearly expressed its intention that any legal challenge to a order,including a proceeding like the one at bar,be brought in the first instance in a court of appeals.
our city of alexandria decision further established that,for an order to be subject to review in a court of appeals,it must represent the final disposition of the matter it addresses.see at.because the checkpoint screening sop implementation on october,conclusively settled the agency position with respect to the use of ait scanners and passenger,those procedures represent the tsa final disposition of the matter.accordingly,we are satisfied that the district court did not err in ruling that the checkpoint screening sop constitutes an order of the tsa administrator under 
there being no merit in the plaintiffs nonconstitutional issues,we move on to the question of whether the appellate review procedures mandated by are inconsistent with due process and separation of powers.on appeal,the plaintiffs focus on the theory that the provision of channeling review to the courts of appeals would,for several reasons,contravene their due process rights.in support of their theory,the plaintiffs offer little more than bald assertions that they can not be forced to litigate in the first instance in a court of appeals.
the plaintiffs due process argument faces numerous insurmountable hurdles.under article iii of the constitution,the district courts and the courts of appeals of the united states constitute those inferior courts which possess only the jurisdiction granted them by congress.see const.art.iii,the judicial power of the united states,shall be vested in one supreme court,and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish.in adopting,congress has spoken plainly and clearly that a court of appeals is to hear,in the first instance,a challenge to an order of the tsa administrator.indeed,we have no authority or power to decide otherwise.see cary curtis,how.observing that congress possess es the sole power of creating the inferior tribunals and of investing them with jurisdiction either limited,concurrent,or exclusive,and of withholding jurisdiction from them in the exact degrees and character which to congress may seem proper for the public good.
tellingly,the plaintiffs have presented us with no judicial authority for the proposition that or any provision channeling review to a particular court contravenes the constitution.indeed,we have consistently affirmed the propriety of such statutes where statutory and constitutional claims can be meaningfully addressed in the courts of appeals.see taxpayers union soc.sec,cir gte south,morrison,cir virginia united states,cir.in virginia united states,judge michael specifically rejected virginia contention that the commonwealth could not receive meaningful judicial review in a court of appeals unless it could develop a factual record in the district court.at quoting mcnary haitian refugee,d.as judge michael explained,meaningful review is available in a court of appeals because,inter alia,the statute permits us to remand for the development of whatever record we need to decide the issues before us on direct r
