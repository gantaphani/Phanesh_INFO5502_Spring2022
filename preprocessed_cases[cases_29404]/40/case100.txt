this appeal concerns the special requirements that policyholders,by federal law,must follow to recover their covered losses under flood insurance policies issued as part of the government national flood insurance program nfip.see mcgair am.bankers ins.of,cir.
plaintiff wayne decosta property in warwick,rhode island is insured by a standard flood insurance policy sfip issued by allstate insurance company allstate,a private insurer participating in the nfip.allstate issued decosta sfip on behalf of the federal emergency management agency fema,the agency that administers the nfip.decosta insured property was damaged by a flood,allstate promptly paid him for some claims,and he successfully sued allstate for what he said were the remaining unpaid covered losses.allstate appeals from the final judgment in favor of decosta.
on appeal,allstate argues that the court erred because decosta failure to comply with the sfip requirement that he timely file a proof of loss as to all of the damages sought bars recovery under his policy for those damages and requires dismissal.allstate argues,in addition,that the court erred when it invoked the sfip appraisal clause to resolve disputes not suited for appraisal.
we agree that decosta can not recover under the sfip because of his failure to comply with its requirements as to the sums sued on.we reverse and direct the district court to enter summary judgment in allstate favor.
background 
the parties agree on the following facts.a flood damaged decosta property on or about march,with sixteen to eighteen inches of water accumulated on the main floor of his house.his policy covers flood damage to the building,as well as damaged personal property.
decosta notified allstate of the flood damage,and allstate hired an independent adjuster,kim stevens,to assess decosta damages and process his claim.decosta also hired an adjuster to represent him in filing his claim for loss.stevens visited decosta property twice in april to assess the flood damages.after completing a report about decosta loss,stevens forwarded two forms to decosta on or about may,which listed the costs that stevens found to be covered.
a proof of loss is an insured official claim of damages,which states,inter alia,the amount of money that an insured is claiming under his flood insurance policy,accompanied by detailed information about the property and damages.flood ins.program,flood insurance claims handbook,available at hereinafter nfip handbook see pt,app.a,art.vii j.a copy of a model form is available online.importantly,the sfip requires the proof of loss to be signed and sworn by policyholders and filed within sixty days of the flood loss.pt,app.a,art.vii j.
as a matter of federal law,it is the policyholder responsibility to submit timely proofs of loss regardless of whether his insurer adjuster provides him with a form.id.while it is common for insurance adjusters to send policyholders forms,as stevens did,the policy explicitly warns policyholders that such adjusters furnish those forms as a matter of courtesy only.id.art.vii j nfip handbook at.
the first form that stevens sent decosta,and which decosta executed and filed,was for building damages of.the second was for recoverable depreciation of.on or about may,allstate received those two executed proofs of loss with the term undisputed handwritten on each by decosta.
in addition to submitting the two executed proofs of loss that were prepared by allstate,decosta also included a separate document from one of his adjusters,richard juchnik.that document estimated that decosta building damages were,which is about double the amount of damages included in the executed proofs of loss.that document was not from decosta,nor was it sworn or signed by him.
within days,by may,allstate had paid decosta.that amount is the total amount claimed in the two original executed forms for building damages.decosta accepted and cashed that check.
decosta adjuster sent allstate another estimate of building damages on june,that pointed out building damages that were not included in allstate forms and also disputed the valuation of some damages in those forms.as a result,a different allstate adjuster,yarri soteros,met with decosta and his adjuster on june,on allstate third visit to decosta property.
soteros notes from the site visit indicate that she disagreed with juchnik,decosta adjuster,as to the scope of damages that the sfip covered she concluded that decosta policy did not cover many of the items for which he sought compensation.at the site visit,juchnik informed soteros that he would appeal to fema if allstate denied coverage of various building repairs he listed 
the day after the site visit,soteros called an allstate agent to discuss the claim issues and partial denials for decosta claim for additional damages.soteros notes indicate that decosta claim remained pending while she awaited additional documentation from juchnik.between july and november of,soteros left at least messages for juchnik requesting that he submit additional documents that she needed to process decosta claim for supplemental damages.
while soteros received a couple of emails from juchnik in late september,she eventually transferred decosta claim to another adjuster on november,because she had not received all of the documents required to finish processing it.in,juchnik sent allstate a list covering the amount of loss for personal property.
allstate adjuster finished reviewing decosta claim for personal property loss,as well as his claim for additional building damages,and sent decosta two more forms in late november.the first was largely for damaged contents or personal property totaling however,of that amount covered additional building damages.the second was for recoverable depreciation of.
allstate received back from decosta those two executed proofs of loss on or about december,more than sixty days after the flood damaged decosta property at the end of march.those proofs of loss were untimely.see pt,app.a,art.vii j requiring policyholder to submit proof of loss within sixty days after flood.
allstate requested a waiver of the time limit for these two proofs of loss from fema on december.fema approved the waiver that same day,and allstate also paid the claimed in the second set of proofs of loss on december.this appeal concerns only claims for additional building damages decosta does not seek any further compensation for damaged personal property.
as a matter of law,a flood insurance claim is not payable until both the policyholder and insurer agree on the amount of damages and the insurer receives the policyholder complete,accurate,and signed proof of loss.nfip handbook at 
decosta acknowledges that his adjuster,juchnik,and allstate never agreed on the amount of building damages he was owed under the policy.what is clear is that allstate only sent decosta forms for the amount of damages to which it agreed decosta was entitled.these were the only documents that decosta submitted which met the requirements of a proof of loss.
because decosta believed he could recover around in building damages under the policy,but allstate paid him only about half that amount or decosta sued allstate in march for the difference 
district court proceedings 
decosta filed suit against allstate in rhode island superior court on march,alleging among other things that allstate actions constituted a breach of contract.allstate removed the case to the rhode island district court.decosta then sought an appraisal.
in opposing decosta motion to compel appraisal and in its own summary judgment motions,allstate made two arguments.first,decosta claim for additional recovery under the policy for building damages is barred because he failed to comply with the sfip requirement as to those damages.second,decosta could not invoke the sfip appraisal clause because the parties disagreed about the scope of damages covered under the sfip,not just the value of those damages.indeed,these themes were consistently sounded by allstate throughout the litigation,and decosta does not contend otherwise.
the district court rejected allstate arguments and granted decosta motion to compel appraisal,saying that it thought the parties dispute concerned the value of loss rather than what the policy covers.in so concluding,the district court ignored substantial evidence,including claim processing notes from allstate adjusters,which reveals the parties disagreement as to the scope of coverage under decosta policy.however,the district court retained jurisdiction to give allstate an opportunity to seek judicial determination of any overall coverage issue prior to the appraisal process.thereafter,the district court also denied allstate summary judgment motion and rejected its argument in one sentence,stating only that it finds that decosta timely filed the proof of loss as required by the policy.
the district court directed the parties to proceed to appraisal,ordering them to instruct the appraisal panel to separate in any award any damages alleged by allstate to be beyond the policy coverage so as to preserve such for later court review if necessary.
the three appraisers on the panel concluded that decosta building damages totaled.after deducting the that allstate had already paid decosta for building repairs,as well as other related costs,the final award came out to.allstate filed a second summary judgment motion and moved to strike the appraisal award.decosta moved to confirm that award.
the district court confirmed the appraisal award.although the appraisers signed memorandum stated that they would solely determine the actual cash cost of decosta property,thereby disclaiming any decision over policy coverage determinations,the district court found significant that the appraisers did not specifically separate any damages.the court rejected allstate argument that the appraisers implicitly made decisions about the scope of damages covered under the policy in violation of the sfip because the damages they included in their loss calculations were much broader than the type of damages included in allstate estimate.
the district court also denied allstate second summary judgment motion and stated in a footnote that allstate had waived its argument that decosta had not preserved his claim for additional damages by failing to comply with the sfip requirement b ecause allstate did pay on the allegedly improperly filed claim.notably,neither party argued that allstate had waived this requirement,nor does decosta so contend on appeal.in a final judgment,the district court ordered allstate to pay decosta the appraisal award of.allstate timely appealed.
this court reviews a denial of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.colon tracey,cir.neither party suggests that there are disputed material facts that would warrant remand.
strict compliance with the sfip proof of loss provision 
under the nfip,the federal government provides subsidized flood insurance to fill a gap in the private insurance market.see b.in administering the nfip,fema creates regulations that govern the process of adjusting,approving,and paying claims for flood loss.id.in,fema created the write your own wyo program by which private insurers,such as allstate,can and do issue flood insurance policies under the nfip.mcgair,at.these private insurers are often called wyo companies.see id.although fema can issue policies directly,currently about percent of the nfip flood insurance policies are issued by wyo companies.see mun.ass of usaa indem,cir.
fema has promulgated regulations under pt.that dictate the terms of the standard flood insurance policies,or sfips,which private insurers can issue on its behalf.mcgair,at.by regulation,wyo companies must issue identical sfips,and no provision of an sfip shall be altered,varied,or waived other than by the express written consent of the federal insurance administrator.id.quoting d internal quotation mark omitted.
under the sfip,the first step that policyholders must take to recover their loss from flood damages is give their insurer prompt written notice of that flood loss.pt,app.a,art.vii j.this initial notice provision is distinct from the requirement that policyholders timely submit a signed and sworn proof of loss.gowland aetna flood ins.program,cir compare pt,app.a,art.vii j,with id.art.vii j.
this dispute centers on whether decosta,as to the sums he seeks,complied with the sfip requirement,which states 
in case of a flood loss to insured property,you insured must 
within days after the loss,send us a proof of loss,which is your statement of the amount your are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you,and which furnishes us with the following information 
a.the date and time of loss 
b.a brief explanation of how the loss happened 
your interest for example,owner and the interest,if any,of others in the damaged property 
details of any other insurance that may cover the loss 
changes in title or occupancy of the covered property during the terms of the policy 
specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair estimates 
names of mortgages or anyone else having a lien,charge,or claim against the insured property 
details about who occupied any insured building at the time of loss and for what purpose and 
i.the inventory of damaged personal property described in above.
pt,app.a,art.vii j emphasis added.
notably,under the sfip,insurance companies can reject policyholders proofs of loss in favor of their own adjusters estimate of damages.id.art vii j.where there is disagreement about the amount of flood damages or coverage,the sfip allows policyholders to appeal to fema from any denial of their claims or to contest it in federal court.see id.pt,app.a,art.vii r.however,to invoke either procedure for review of the denial of a flood insurance claim,a policyholder must have first filed a timely and compliant proof of loss.see id.pt,app.a,art.vii r.
on appeal,the parties dispute whether decosta submissions to allstate complied with the sfip requirement such that he is eligible to both bring suit and recover under his policy.
allstate argues that under the sfip every dollar sought must be supported by a proof of loss.allstate paid decosta the amounts of money he claimed,signed,and swore to in four forms.in doing so it did not,and as a matter of law could not,waive the requirement of a timely proof of loss for additional sums sought.decosta failure to submit a signed proof of loss for the money he seeks to recover in this lawsuit bars his recovery.
decosta argues that he complied with his sfip when he submitted allstate forms as to the amounts paid,writing undisputed on each form,and simultaneously submitted a separate estimate from his adjuster,which listed total building damages of,albeit not signing and swearing to it.he claims that the submission of his adjuster estimate,along with the completed proofs of loss,preserv ed a claim for the value of loss in excess of the signed and sworn to in an executed form.this argument fails as a matter of law.
decosta sfip is not an ordinary insurance policy rather,his sfip provisions are also embodied in fema codified regulations,see mcgair,at,and interpretation of decosta sfip is a matter of federal law,id.at.the sfip states,you may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy.pt,app.a,art.vii r.we have already held that federal law mandates strict compliance with the sfip,including its requirement.mcgair,at.so have other circuits.see jacobson metro.prop.cas.ins,cir enforcing strict compliance with sfip in accordance with its sister circuits that have uniformly held that sfip requirement must be strictly construed and enforced.
a number of reasons compel strict compliance with the sfip terms even where a lesser form of compliance might suffice under state law governing other insurance disputes.as we have said,
the nfip is administered by fema and backed by the federal treasury,which is responsible for paying claims that exceed the revenue generated by premiums paid under policies issued pursuant to the program thus,when private companies in the wyo program issue sfips,they act as fiscal agents of the united states,but they are not general agents in essence,the insurance companies serve as administrators for the federal program.it is the g overnment,not the companies,that pays the claims.
mcgair,at second omission in original citations omitted quoting palmieri allstate ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also a establishing the national flood insurance fund,located in the treasury,to make payments required to carry out the nfip.
because the federal government is liable for claims brought under sfips issued by private insurers the constitution mandates strict compliance with the sfip.the supreme court has recognized that the appropriations clause prohibits the judiciary from awarding claims against the united states that are not authorized by statute.flick liberty mut.fire ins,cir citing office of personnel mgmt.richmond,see const.art.i,cl.no money shall be drawn from the treasury,but in consequence of appropriations made by law.
here,congress,through a valid act of delegation to fema,has authorized payment of flood insurance funds to only those claimants that submit a timely sworn proof of loss.flick,at.as a result,it would usurp congress exclusive power to appropriate money were federal courts to award an unauthorized money claim based on a theory of substantial compliance with the sfip requirement.id.at.
enforcing strict compliance with the sfip also arises from the doctrine of sovereign immunity.given that it is the government liability at stake in any suit against a wyo insurer,compliance with the provision serves as a condition precedent to a waiver by the federal government of its sovereign immunity.wagner,fed.emergency mgmt.agency,cir.as we have explained,i t has long been established that the government is not subject to suit without a waiver of sovereign immunity,and that any such waiver is to be strictly construed.progressive consumers fed.credit union united states,cir.where waiver depends on compliance with the terms of a federal insurance policy,it follows that the terms of that policy must also be strictly construed and enforced.see mancini redland ins,cir.
in phelps federal emergency management agency,cir,we upheld strict compliance with the sfip written requirement and refused to apply the equitable estoppel doctrine against the government although elements of traditional estoppel were plainly present.id.at.c onsiderations of sovereign immunity and constitutional grounds such as the potential for interference with the separation of governmental powers motivated our refusal to apply equitable estoppel against the government,no matter how compelling the circumstances.id.at.
the need for uniformity in federal law also supports strict construction of the sfip.such uniformity provides clarity to the numerous insurance companies issuing the bulk of insurance policies under the nfip,as well as the diverse jurisdictions inundated with flood insurance disputes in the aftermath of national disasters.insurance companies and policyholders need clear rules to ensure a fast response to policyholders claims after these disasters.relatedly,we noted in phelps that congress established the nfip because many factors made it uneconomical for private insurance companies to offer affordable flood insurance.at see also a,b.a rule of strict compliance avoid s disturbing the delicate balance,which fema has sought to strike,between the need to pay claims and the need to ensure the long term sustainability of the nfip in this economically fraught area.flick,at.
strictly construing the sfip provision,see mcgair,at,it is clear that decosta did not sign and swear to claiming on a proof of loss,as required.merely attaching his adjuster estimate of damages to two executed forms claiming a smaller amount does not comply.see pt,app.a,art.vii j.the law on this is clear,as we describe.
in mancini,an insurance company sent the mancinis a form documenting their flood damages under the sfip.at.the mancinis did not sign or notarize the proof of loss,but faxed it to their insurance company with a cover sheet that included a note with their names on the bottom.id.the insurance company conceded that the fax submission contained the relevant information but disputed whether it conformed to the sfip requirement of a statement of the amount claimed under the policy that is signed and sworn by the insured.id.at emphasis added.the eighth circuit held that the mancinis did not comply with the sfip provision,observing that their signature does not appear on a statement by the mancinis as to the amount they claimed under the policy.id.thus,they failed to sign and swear to the amount they sought to recover.
in evanoff standard fire insurance,cir,the sixth circuit adopted the eighth circuit reasoning in mancini.it held that a policyholder failed to comply with the sfip where he submitted all of the supporting documentation required in the provision,along with a letter that contained his signature.id.the evanoff court explained that the policyholder was required to do more than merely submit a set of figures together with a signed statement not rejecting or nullifying those figures.he had to submit a signed statement as to the amount claimed under the policy.he simply did not do so.id.at quoting mancini,at internal quotation mark omitted.
here,decosta signature on allstate two forms for building damages claims only the amounts listed in those forms.his policy made clear that these forms are provided only as a courtesy,warning policyholders that they are responsible for submitting a timely proof of loss if their insurer adjuster does not supply them with a form pt,app.a,art.vii j.
while the sfip does not require that a proof of loss follow any particular format,it define s a proof of loss as a statement of the insured,not of some third party,and it does require that the insured sign and swear to that statement.mancini,at.that was not done here as to the sums claimed in the litigation.see id.at i t is the insured,not the adjuster,who must swear to the proof of loss.pt,app.a,art.vii j requiring policyholders to use their own judgment concerning the amount of loss when completing the proof of loss.
at oral argument,decosta counsel explained that he was not arguing that equitable estoppel or waiver barred enforcement of the requirement.nor was he arguing that decosta substantially complied with the sfip.instead he asserted that the estimate claiming in damages from decosta adjuster satisfied the sfip requirement under a stringent,strict construction standard because it was contemporaneously submitted with two forms.he suggests this case is different from other cases finding noncompliance with the sfip provisions because the adjuster estimate of disputed damages accompanied timely,executed forms as to undisputed amounts.not so.it does not matter that the estimate from decosta adjuster was submitted at the same time and along with compliant forms claiming undisputed sums because,under the plain terms of the sfip,decosta still had to sign and swear to the amount in that estimate,which he did not do.
as counsel for allstate argued,the attestation serves the purpose of reducing fraud this is a conclusion drawn from the language of fema model form itself 
even if equitable considerations could play some role,we reject decosta plaint of lack of notice the fact that allstate provided decosta with two separate forms for building damages and the cost of related depreciation,if anything,should have put decosta on additional notice that he needed to sign and swear to every dollar he claimed under the sfip.
w here federal funds are implicated,the person seeking those funds is obligated to familiarize himself with the legal requirements for receipt of such funds.mcgair,at emphasis added quoting jacobson,at internal quotation marks omitted.other circuits enforcing strict compliance with the sfip have noted the supreme court mandate protection of the public fisc requires that those who seek public funds act with scrupulous regard for the requirements of the law.jacobson,at quoting heckler cmty.health servs.of crawford,internal quotation mark omitted.
thus,the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that decosta had filed a proof
