opinion of the court 
the question presented in this appeal is whether the federal communications excise tax set forth in a applies to telephone services that are priced based on a fixed,rate.based upon the plain language and structure of the statute,we conclude that it does not.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the taxpayer.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
taxpayer reese brothers,reese brothers purchased intrastate,interstate,and international telephone services reese services from lci,qwest,and mci collectively carriers from the third quarter of through the first quarter of.these carriers charged reese brothers a minute rate for calls and different minute rates for and international long distance calls.the carriers collected a federal communications excise tax from reese brothers and remitted it to the internal revenue service irs.
on november,reese brothers filed a claim with the irs,seeking a refund of for the excise taxes that the carriers collected and remitted between july,and june,it filed a second claim for a refund of on august,for taxes collected for july,and march.although the irs apparently received these claims,it did not respond to them,and reese brothers filed suit in federal court on may.reese brothers subsequently moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability and the government filed a for summary judgment.
reese brothers argued that,pursuant to b which defines toll telephone services as services for which there is a toll charge that varies in amount with the distance and elapsed transmission time of each individual communication the federal communications excise tax applied only to services for which the charges vary by both distance and elapsed time.because the charges for its services were based on a fixed rate,unrelated to distance,reese brothers claimed that the tax is inapplicable to the services provided by the carriers.
the government,by contrast,argued that the tax applies to charges that are based on either the distance or the elapsed time or both,and therefore,claimed that the reese services are taxable.the government also offered two alternative bases for imposing the excise tax on the reese services.first,the government suggested that if the reese services are not taxable under b,they should be considered toll telephone services under b,which defines such services as those which entitle the subscriber,upon payment of a periodic charge determined as a flat amount or upon the basis of total elapsed transmission time,to the privilege of an unlimited number of calls to or from an area outside of the local service area.second,it argued that in the event the reese services are not toll telephone services under any definition,they constitute local telephone services under a.
adopting the report and recommendation of a magistrate judge,the district court granted reese brothers motion with respect to liability and denied the government.the parties agreed to the amount of overpayment and the district court entered judgment on behalf of reese brothers in the amount of.the government now appeals.

iii.sections and of the internal revenue code 
section a of the internal revenue code provides for a tax on communications services.as defined by the code,communications services include local telephone service,toll telephone service,and teletypewriter exchange service.b.section defines these three services.in relevant part,that section states 
a local telephone service.for purposes of this subchapter,the term local telephone service means 
the access to a local telephone system,and the privilege of telephonic quality communication with substantially all persons having telephone or radio telephone stations constituting part of such local telephone system,and 
any facility or service provided in connection with a service described in paragraph.
the term local telephone service does not include any service which is a toll telephone service or a private communications service as defined in subsections b and d.
b toll telephone service.for purposes of this subchapter,the term toll telephone service means 
a telephonic quality communication for which a there is a toll charge which varies in amount with the distance and elapsed transmission time of each individual communication and b the charge is paid within the united states,and 
a service which entitles the subscriber,upon payment of a periodic charge determined as a flat amount or upon the basis of total elapsed transmission time,to the privilege of an unlimited number of telephonic communications to or from all or a substantial portion of the persons having telephone or radio telephone stations in a specified area which is outside the local telephone system area in which the station provided with this service is located.
c teletypewriter exchange purposes of this subchapter,the term teletypewriter exchange service means the access from a teletypewriter or other data station to the teletypewriter exchange system of which such station is a part,and the privilege of intercommunication by such station with substantially all persons having teletypewriter or other data stations constituting a part of the same teletypewriter exchange system,to which the subscriber is entitled upon payment of a charge or charges whether such charge or charges are determined as a flat periodic amount,on the basis of distance and elapsed transmission time,or in some other manner.the term teletypewriter exchange service does not include any service which is local telephone service as defined in subsection a.
the district court concluded that the reese services did not fall within any of the definitions set forth in.we agree.
the current definitions of local telephone service,toll telephone service,and teletypewriter exchange service were enacted by congress in as part of the excise tax reduction act,which,among other things,reduced the telephone tax from ten percent to three percent.see excise tax reduction act of,stat.at that time,american telephone and telegraph corporation at t had a monopoly on services in the united states.see pearce,app.at.it offered two types of telephone service mts and wide area telephone service wats as well as local and private line services.id.at.mts charges were based on the duration of the call,the distance that the call traveled,the time of day,and the day of the week.id.at.the distance portion of the rate was determined by reference to mileage bands,of which there were thirty id.charges for service which used a dedicated access line for example,numbers were based on a flat rate for unlimited calls.id.the definition of toll telephone service in replaced an earlier version which defined toll telephone service as a service for which there is a toll charge,and appears to reflect an effort by congress to conform the definition to the pricing methods then in place.compare excise tax reduction act of,stat,with excise tax technical changes act of,stat.
since then,however,at t has lost its monopoly status and billing methods have changed.pearce,app.at.as a general rule,charges for telephone calls now are based only on the duration of the call,though there remain some intrastate services which are priced based on distance as well as time.id.
on appeal,the government offers three arguments which,if accepted,would warrant reversal of the district court.the government first and primary contention is that the reese services are taxable under b as toll telephone services.in the alternative,the government argues that if the reese services are not taxable under b,they should be considered toll telephone services under b or local telephone services under a.
recently,four other courts of second,sixth,eleventh,and district of columbia considered the meaning of b.in each case,the court has rejected the same arguments that the government advances in this case.fortis,united states,wl,cir.april,per curiam officemax,united states,cir,r hrg en banc denied.lexis cir.march,am.bankers ins.group united states,cir passenger amtrak united states,we agree with the decisions reached by our sister circuits and will join them in ruling in favor of the taxpayer.
toll telephone services under section b 
toll telephone services are defined in b as services for which there is a toll charge that varies in amount with the distance and elapsed transmission time of each individual communication.b emphasis added.the government urges us to conclude that the phrase varies with distance and elapsed time is ambiguous and,based on the statute structure,purpose,and legislative history,encompasses the reese services.second,it argues that irs revenue ruling,wl,which construed similar communications as taxable toll telephone services under b,is entitled to deference under chevron usa,natural resources defense council,d,and united states mead,d.third,even if the ruling was not originally entitled to deference,the government argues that because congress reenacted b after revenue ruling was issued,it now has the force of law under the legislative reenactment doctrine.finally,the government suggests that even if the district court properly concluded that charges must be based on distance as well as elapsed time,distance was a factor in calculating the charges for the reese services to the extent that the rate varied depending on whether the call was intrastate,interstate,or international.
the meaning of the word and 
our role in interpreting a statute is to give effect to congress intent.rosenberg xm ventures,cir citations omitted.because we presume that congress intent is most clearly expressed in the text of the statute,we begin our analysis with an examination of the plain language of the relevant provision.id.section b provides that toll telephone services are those for which the amount varies by distance and time.the government we the word and can be either conjunctive or disjunctive.see,slodov united states,d concluding that the word and was used disjunctively in which imposed a tax penalty on a ny person required to collect,truthfully account for,and pay over any tax imposed by this title peacock lubbock compress,cir,cert.denied,d holding that and was disjunctive in the context of a statute that required an employer to pay overtime wages to employees engaged in the ginning and compressing of cotton.in fact,the word and is used to mean or within itself.as the sixth circuit explained 
section b requires that the toll charge vary in amount with distance and elapsed time of each individual communication and that the charge be paid within the united states.both sides of this and must be satisfied for the telephone service to be taxable at times,however,congress used the word differently.take it defines communications services as local telephone service,toll telephone service,and teletypewriter exchange service.no one doubts the disjunctive or cumulative nature of this usage because these definitions of the services in are generally mutually exclusive and because no service exists that can satisfy all three definitions at once.section likewise uses and to connect a list of alternative definitions found in b and b.here,too,no one contests that a toll charge which varies in amount with the distance and elapsed transmission time of each individual communication,can not simultaneously be a periodic charge determined as a flat amount or upon the basis of total elapsed transmission time for the privilege of an unlimited number of telephonic communications.
officemax,at.
the usual meaning of the word and,however,is conjunctive,and unless the context dictates otherwise,the and is presumed to be used in its ordinary sense am.bankers,at see also officemax,at citing in part crooks harrelson.webster third new international dictionary ed norman singer,statutes and statutory construction,at ed.the government argues that applying the ordinary definition of the word and would not make sense because congress could not possibly have meant to allow telephone companies to opt their customers out of the tax through nothing more than a change in billing methods.appellant br.at.applying the ordinary definition of the word and in b,however,does not lead to an anomalous or absurd result.in fact,such a reading is entirely consistent with at t billing practices in when congress adopted the definition 
the supreme court addressed and rejected an analogous argument in iselin united states.at issue in that case was a revenue act provision which imposed a tax on the sale of theater tickets sold at places other than a ticket box office.the amount of the tax was based on the difference between the established price at the ticket office and the actual sale price.the taxpayer,georgine iselin,as a stockholder in the producing company,held a license to a designated theater box and sold the license to use her box to of the season seventy performances.iselin argued that because the tickets she sold did not have an established price,they were not taxable under the revenue act.the government,by contrast,argued 
that congress clearly intended to tax all sales of tickets that there is in the section no indication of intention to exempt from the tax any sale of tickets or any resale at a profit that the receipts here taxed are in character substantially similar to those specifically described in paragraph that this general purpose of congress should be given effect,so as to reach any case within the aim of the legislation and the act should,therefore,be extended by construction to cover this case.
the iselin court rejected the government argument,declining to expand the statute reach.it explained 
it may be assumed that congress did not purpose to exempt from taxation this class of tickets.but the act contains no provision referring to tickets of the character here involved and there is no general provision in the act under which classes of tickets not enumerated are subjected to a tax.
id.likewise,in this case,the express language of the in its ordinary not include communications which are based only on elapsed time and whether they are interstate,intrastate,or international.following the supreme court analysis in iselin,we will therefore decline to extend the scope of b.
we also note that congress clearly understood how to draft a more expansive definition if it so chose.for example,in defining teletypewriter exchange service,congress did not limit the tax to services based on the billing method alone.rather,it imposed a tax on teletypewriter services whether such charge or charges are determined as a flat periodic amount,on the basis of distance and elapsed transmission time,or some other manner.c.had congress desired to tax toll telephone services based on a broader variety of billing methods,it could have so indicated.
reading the statute as a whole,we conclude that and is used in its conjunctive sense in b.accordingly,in order to be taxable under that provision,charges for telephone services must be based on both distance and elapsed transmission time.
the effect of revenue ruling 
the government also contends that revenue ruling,in which the irs determined that a satellite service for which charges were based on the elapsed time of the transmission alone nevertheless satisfied the definition of toll telephone service,is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,and united states mead,d.it therefore argues that the agency construction should dictate the outcome of this case.because we conclude that the language of b is plain,however,and that a conjunctive reading of the word and effects the unambiguous intent of congress,we need not defer to the interpretation in revenue ruling under chevron,nor consider the
