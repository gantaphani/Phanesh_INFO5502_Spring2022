this case arises from the termination of the,juan pagn coln,from his job as an assistant manager at a walgreens store in juana daz,puerto rico.although the parties disagree as to the reason for pagn termination,there is no dispute that he was fired after a absence from his job due to a medical condition that required one week of hospitalization and another week of recuperation.following pagn termination,he and his wife,ada renta bonilla,brought claims in federal district court against walgreens alleging that he was fired in retaliation for conduct protected by the family medical leave act fmla,that his termination was wrongful under puerto rico law and that the loss of pagn job caused renta to suffer emotional distress compensable under puerto rico law.after the district court granted summary judgment for walgreens on renta claim and the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the other puerto rico law claim,the fmla claim went to trial and a jury found in pagn favor,awarding compensatory damages.
on appeal,walgreens argues that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the fmla claim and that the district court erred in denying a federal rule of civil procedure e motion to amend the judgment.in turn,pagn and renta argue that the court erred in denying liquidated damages on the fmla claim and in granting walgreens summary judgment on renta puerto rico law claim.
for the reasons described below,we affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects,save its rejection of renta puerto rico law claim.that claim presents an important and unresolved issue of puerto rico law that we decline to address in the first instance.accordingly,we certify the question to the supreme court of puerto rico and reserve judgment on this particular issue pending its response.additionally,as a matter of first impression,we conclude that a backpay award under the fmla may include overtime compensation.

as we are called upon to review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict in favor of pagn.alvarado santos dep t of health,cir.
pagn hospitalization and discharge 
pagn began working for walgreens in september.by the time of his discharge in,he had been promoted to assistant manager of the walgreens store in juana daz.on may,pagn reported for work at,but shortly thereafter he began to experience chest pains,heart palpitations,and sweating.his symptoms worsened that morning,and during his break he went to the emergency room at a local hospital.already suffering from type ii diabetes,he was found to have high blood sugar and high blood pressure,and he asked hospital staff to contact his wife,renta.
when renta arrived,pagn asked her to contact edwin figueroa,the manager of the store at which he worked,and tell figueroa that he was in the hospital and unsure when he could return to work.she did so immediately after leaving the emergency room at approximately.she also called the store twice more that day to give updates on pagn condition and inform those at the store of his admission to the hospital.pagn was hospitalized from may to,and he underwent a cardiac catheterization surgical procedure on may.during his hospitalization,he was in contact with,including another assistant manager whom he told of his upcoming surgical procedure.
pagn was discharged from the hospital on may.that day,he went to the walgreens store at which he worked to pick up prescription medication and deliver a medical certificate explaining his absence.he met with assistant manager mariel coln,who was the most senior employee present at the time,and bookkeeper wanda santiago.during this meeting,he told coln that his doctors had ordered him to rest at home for one week and he presented the medical certificate to santiago,a fact verified by that day surveillance video footage from the store and stipulated by the parties at trial.however,figueroa,the store manager,testified that news of pagn hospitalization,recuperative rest,and delivery of the medical certificate was not communicated to him.
pagn termination 
after consultation with the walgreens district supervisor and corporate legal counsel,figueroa sent a letter dated may to pagn,stating that he had not heard from pagn and had no explanation for his extended absence.the letter asked that pagn contact walgreens management to determine his eligibility for disability leave,and stated that if he did not do so within hours there might be negative consequences for his job.pagn did not receive this letter until may well after the expiration of the hour deadline,and figueroa never called pagn or made any other attempt to get in touch with him.on may,having not heard from pagn,figueroa again consulted with the district supervisor and legal counsel,and the decision was made to terminate pagn employment with the understanding that he had abandoned his job.
unaware of this decision,pagn went to the store that same day to let others know that he was available to return to work the following day and to determine what his work schedule would be.he spoke with assistant manager ivelisse lpez,who agreed to speak with other managers and let pagn know when she learned of his schedule.after figueroa became aware of pagn visit,he asked lpez to contact pagn with instructions to come into the store to meet with him at the following day.when pagn came to work on may,figueroa told him that he was fired and asked him to return his keys to the store.figueroa offered no explanation for the termination.when pagn asked for one,figueroa simply told him to contact walgreens corporate offices.after trying unsuccessfully for several days to contact someone at walgreens corporate offices by phone,pagn went to the office in person and was able to meet with miriam daz of walgreens human resources department.daz was also unable to explain his termination,but she said that she would look into the matter and give pagn an answer.
upon realizing that pagn had documentation of his hospitalization and rest,figueroa,in consultation with the walgreens district manager and walgreens legal counsel,decided to reconsider his termination.on june,figueroa called pagn to ask him to come to the store to be interviewed.the next day,pagn met with figueroa and another walgreens employee and described to them the circumstances of his hospitalization and attempts to notify walgreens of his absence.after this meeting,figueroa attempted to verify pagn account by talking with the walgreens employees that pagn claimed that he or his wife had contacted.according to figueroa,at least one individual that pagn claimed his wife had contacted had no recollection of the call,and neither of the individuals that pagn met with on may recalled receiving a medical certificate from him.accordingly,figueroa concluded that pagn had lied to him during the investigation and,again in consultation with the district manager and legal counsel,figueroa decided to terminate pagn for his dishonesty a decision that walgreens insists was entirely independent of pagn hospitalization and related absence.accordingly,on june,pagn was notified that his termination was confirmed,but the basis was changed from his absence to his alleged dishonesty during the investigation.
procedural history 
shortly after his discharge,pagn and his wife filed a complaint against walgreens in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.they raised several claims,including retaliation under the fmla,wrongful termination in violation of puerto rico law,laws ann.tit,and damages under articles and of the puerto rico civil code,laws ann.tit.the district court granted summary judgment for walgreens on the article and claims,and the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their law claim during the course of the trial.accordingly,only the fmla claim was submitted to the jury.
at the close of evidence,walgreens moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,but the court denied the motion and submitted the case to the jury.the jury rendered a judgment in favor of pagn,awarding him in damages.sua sponte,the court ordered remittitur,reducing the award to to match pagn estimated lost wages including overtime and account for earnings at a new job that mitigated damages.the court also denied pagn request for additional liquidated damages under the fmla finally,the court considered dueling rule e motions to amend the judgment.it allowed pagn motion to grant prejudgment interest on the award,but denied walgreens motion seeking to eliminate or reduce the overtime pay included in the damages award.
on appeal,walgreens challenges the district court denial of its rule and e motions.with regard to the former,it argues that pagn presented insufficient evidence at trial to establish its liability under the fmla.on the latter,it argues that it is entitled to an amended judgment because back pay for overtime is not available under the fmla and,even if it is,the court award in this case is excessive.in turn,pagn and his wife have,arguing that the district court erred in denying their request for liquidated damages and in granting walgreens summary judgment on their article and claims.
rule motion for judgment as a matter of law 
legal framework 
we review the denial of a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.alvarado santos,at.in doing so,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and may reverse only if no reasonable person could have reached the conclusion arrived at by the jury.id.thus,our review is weighted toward preservation of the jury verdict because a verdict should be set aside only if the jury failed to reach the only result permitted by the evidence.analysis group,central,cir quoting quiles quiles henderson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the jury had to determine whether walgreens had retaliated against pagn for conduct protected by the fmla.we have previously explained that,among other things,the fmla prohibits retaliation against employees who take fmla leave.see colburn parker portland,cir.in particular,interpretive regulations provide that 
a n employer is prohibited from discriminating against employees or prospective employees who have used fmla leave.for example,employers can not use the taking of fmla leave as a negative factor in employment actions,such as hiring,promotions or disciplinary actions nor can fmla leave be counted under no fault attendance policies.
c see also colburn,at,noting that,although the fmla does not explicitly reference retaliation,such a prohibition is implicit in the statute and universally recognized.accordingly,a crucial component of an fmla retaliation claim is some animus or retaliatory motive on the part of the plaintiff employer that is connected to protected conduct.see colburn,at hodgens dynamics,cir.
thus,to make out a prima facie case of retaliation,a plaintiff must show that he availed himself of a protected right under the fmla,he was adversely affected by an employment decision,and there was a causal connection between the protected conduct and the adverse employment action.see orta castro merck,sharp dohme qumica,cir colburn,at.where the plaintiff provides no direct evidence of retaliation,we have relied on the framework established by the supreme court in mcdonnell douglas green.as we have explained,
u nder that framework,a plaintiff employee must carry the initial burden of coming forward with sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.if he does so,then the burden shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employee termination if the employer evidence creates a genuine issue of fact,the presumption of discrimination drops from the case,and the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of showing that the employer stated reason for terminating him was in fact a pretext for retaliating against him for having taken protected fmla leave.
hodgens,at quoting mcdonnell douglas,at.
denial of walgreens rule motion 
walgreens argues that it provided a valid reason for pagn termination and thus,under the mcdonnell douglas framework,it was pagn burden to show that this stated reason was in fact pretextual.according to walgreens,pagn failed to introduce sufficient evidence at trial to permit the jury to find that its stated reason for the termination was false and the real reason was retaliation.this argument is unpersuasive.
walgreens offered two rationales for pagn termination.initially,it determined that pagn had abandoned his job.after reconsidering its decision,it determined that pagn should be terminated because of his dishonesty during its investigation.even if we accept that each of these explanations was,on its face,a valid reason for pagn termination,there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to reject both rationales as pretext.
with regard to pagn supposed abandonment of his job,figueroa testified that after learning that pagn left work to go to the hospital on may,he heard nothing about pagn hospitalization,surgery,or recuperative rest until may.however,there was extensive evidence that pagn put his employer on notice of his condition,including evidence that he made repeated efforts to contact his employer on the day that he entered the hospital,was in contact with throughout his hospitalization,went to the store at which he was employed on the day of his discharge and told the most senior manager there that he would be out for another week,provided a certificate from his physician explaining his hospitalization and the need for recuperative rest,and made an effort to determine his work schedule on the day before his week of rest ended.
furthermore,the fact that figueroa may letter to pagn provided only hours to contact a walgreen manager,and was not mailed until it was too late for pagn to act within the deadline,is also suggestive of pretext.finally,the close temporal proximity between pagn leave and his termination suggests a causal connection between the two.while temporal proximity on its own is insufficient to establish pretext,it is relevant evidence that,combined with other facts,may support such a finding.see hodgens,at.the jury was entitled to rely on this evidence in aggregate to determine that,his testimony notwithstanding,figueroa was aware that pagn had not abandoned his job and that this explanation was pretextual.
walgreens second explanation that pagn was dishonest during its investigation is similarly susceptible to attack.although walgreens points to inconsistencies in pagn statements and one alleged attempt to persuade a to cover for him by giving the company a false statement this evidence did not compel a jury to find that dishonesty was the basis for his termination.importantly,walgreens presented evidence that the decision to terminate pagn for dishonesty was based,in large part,on pagn statement to figueroa that he gave a a medical certificate explaining his absence when he visited the store on may,and figueroa inability to find evidence of this on the security camera footage from that day.however,at trial,walgreens stipulated that the security camera footage does,in fact,show pagn giving a document to a,and no explanation is given for this discrepancy.
furthermore,walgreens argued that pagn initially said he handed the certificate to coln,the assistant manager he met with that day,when he actually gave it to santiago,the other employee present at the meeting.walgreens sees in this inconsistency proof of pagn dishonesty.but it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that this inconsistency was not proof of dishonesty.more importantly,on this evidence,a reasonable jury could conclude that walgreens explanation that pagn was dishonest was pretextual.
finally,walgreens shifting explanations also support the jury verdict.we have noted that o ne way to establish pretext is for the plaintiff to show that the employer gave different and arguably inconsistent explanations for taking the adverse employment action.mcdonough city of quincy,cir quoting dominguez cruz suttle caribe,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this case is an archetypal example of this phenomenon.here,pagn was initially given no explanation for his termination,despite repeated inquiries.by his own persistence,he eventually obtained an explanation that he was terminated because his supervisors had determined that he abandoned his job.subsequently,after it became clear that pagn could show that no such abandonment occurred,walgreens changed the basis for his termination to his supposed dishonesty during its investigation of his absence.the jury could reasonably have deemed these shifting explanations to be a red flag suggesting that walgreens decision to dismiss pagn was motivated by retaliatory animus.
in summary,for all of the reasons described,there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to conclude that walgreens explanations of its reasons for firing pagn were pretextual.walgreens was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law see alvarado santos,at.
rule e motion to amend the judgment 
in ordering remittitur,the court determined the amount of pagn lost wages,including in overtime pay.the court calculated the amount of overtime pay that pagn was due by estimating that he would have worked hours of overtime per week over the week period between his termination and the judgment.it obtained the hours per week figure by looking to the average of pagn weekly hours during the months prior to his termination,the period from january,until pagn termination in may,which was hours.however,the parties stipulated that during the month period prior to pagn termination he had worked an average of hours per week.thus,the court implicitly assumed that the average was more reliable than the month average for determining how much overtime pagn would have worked going forward if he had not been terminated.walgreens argues that the computation of lost compensation under the fmla should not include overtime pay,and that,even if it does,the district court should have used the lower estimate of overtime hours based on the month average rather than the average.
a district court resolution of a motion to amend the judgment is ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion.negrn almeda santiago,cir.however,abstract questions of law presented by such a motion are reviewed de novo.id.we have previously held that r eview of the legal principles used by the district court in determining the availability of back pay is de novo.johnson spencer press of,cir.
availability of overtime backpay under the fmla 
although we have not previously addressed the issue,we see no reason why overtime pay should not be included in an award of backpay under the fmla.the fmla provides that an employee may recover any wages,salary,employment benefits,or other compensation denied or lost by reason of the violation.a a i i.overtime certainly falls into the category of other compensation.this conclusion is consistent with the way in which damages are calculated for violations of other employment laws,as awards often include payment for overtime work that an employee would have performed but for her employer violation of employment laws.ricco potter,cir see also fryer fire safety,cir uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act,et alexander milwaukee,cir title vii of the civil rights act of,et local joint executive bd.of trust fund las vegas sands,cir worker adjustment retraining and notification act,et.
walgreens offers no authority for the proposition that backpay for overtime is categorically unavailable to a successful fmla plaintiff.contrary to its suggestion,the eighth circuit did not find in torson gemini,cir,that overtime backpay was categorically unavailable.instead,based on the facts of that case,it found that it was too speculative to award.id.at.accordingly,we decline to read such a limitation into the fmla where,first,the plain language of the statute suggests that backpay for overtime is available,and,second,such a limitation would be inconsistent with our treatment of violations of other employment laws.
the court estimate of pagn overtime 
whether overtime backpay is categorically available under the fmla is a question of pure law in contrast,our review of the amount of the district court award presents a factual question.accordingly,we review the court decision to calculate pagn backpay award using the estimate of overtime hours per week for clear error.see hernndez miranda empresas daz mass,cir.
as noted,the overtime hours per week estimate was based on the average of the number of overtime hours per week that pagn worked in before his termination.in its written decision denying walgreens rule e motion,the court explained that this figure was based on pay stubs admitted into evidence and pagn trial testimony.it also noted that walgreens had presented no evidence contrary to its finding that pagn had worked an average of hours per week in prior to his termination.this average included five months of data a reasonably large sample size and it was not clear error for the court to assume that this was a more accurate indicator of the number of overtime hours that pagn would have worked going forward than the month average suggested by walgreens.accordingly,we will not disturb the court calculation of the amount of backpay due pagn.
fmla liquidated damages 
after the jury rendered a verdict in favor of pagn,the court denied his request for liquidated damages.the fmla provides that in addition to lost wages,an employee shall recover 
an additional amount as liquidated damages equal to lost wages and interest,except that if an employer who has violated section of this title proves to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission which violated section was in good faith and that the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was not a violation of section of this title,such court may,in the discretion of the court,decline to award liquidated damages.
a iii.thus,an employer must prove both good faith and reasonable grounds to escape liquidated damages,and the decision of whether to award liquidated damages is left to the court.because the employer bears the burden of proof,the statute creates a strong presumption in favor of awarding liquidated damages.thom am.standard,cir.
considering pagn request for liquidated damages,the court found that,notwithstanding the jury verdict,walgreens acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds for its termination of pagn.in reaching this conclusion,the court explained that for purposes of the case,there two fact finders there the jury for the liability a nd then there the judge as a fact finder for purposes of the liquidated damages.it reasoned that pagn termination was a rookie mistake by figueroa,who had been a manager for only one month at the time.furthermore,the court looked to the letter sent to pagn,figueroa consultation with legal counsel,the company reconsideration of pagn termination,and the fact that pagn received pay for the two weeks he was out as evidence of walgreens good faith.
on appeal,pagn argues that the court did not have the discretion to deny liquidated damages given the jury verdict.he asserts that the jury necessarily found that walgreens did not act in good faith in terminating him and that the court was bound by this finding alternatively,pagn argues that the court improperly determined that walgreens acted in good faith and,furthermore,erroneously focused only on good faith,ignoring the second part of the analysis whether walgreens had reasonable grounds for believing pagn termination did not violate the fmla.
we will not entertain pagn argument that the district court lacked discretion in this case to deny him liquidated damages because the jury necessarily found that walgreens did not make its termination decision in good faith.pagn did not make this argument to the district court.in fact,he acknowledged to the court that he believed that it did have the discretion to make an independent determination of good faith,the jury verdict notwithstanding.at a hearing addressing the issue of liquidated damages,the court repeatedly emphasized that it understood there to be two fact finders and that it could make a finding of reasonable grounds to terminate,and it would not set aside the jury verdict but it would be for purposes of the liquidated damages provision that i make this finding.pagn did not object to this description of the court discretion.in fact,he stated that it has been our position that this ruling,whether or not you will accept defendant defense against liquidated damages,is something that is left to the sound discretion of the court.furthermore,in a motion,pagn explained his decision not to raise the liquidated damages issue by noting that the court decision on the employer affirmative defense to liquidated damages is discretionary in nature.the motion goes on to repeatedly emphasize that the district court has discretion to deny liquidated damages and never raises the concern that the necessary to deny liquidated damages is inconsistent with the jury verdict 
the motion also states that pagn decision not to contest the denial of liquidated damages should not be understood as a waiver of his right to bring up the matter on appeal.however,given pagn characterization of the court authority to award liquidated damages as discretionary,this reservation was plainly intended to cover only pagn ability to contest the merits of the court determination of good faith,not its discretion to make this finding.we will honor pagn reservation by taking up the second argument he raises that the court erred in finding that walgreens had reasonable grounds for believing pagn termination to be lawful.but pagn may not now raise the issue of the court ability to make that finding after having repeatedly acknowledged its discretion to do so.see united states taylor,cir absent extraordinary circumstances,it is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court,he may not unveil it in the court of appeals.internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,we turn to pagn second argument that,in denying liquidated damages,the district court improperly found that walgreens acted in good faith and erred by failing to consider whether walgreens had reasonable grounds for believing pagn termination to be lawful.we review the district court decision to deny liquidated damages for abuse of discretion.see chao hotel oasis,cir reviewing decision to award liquidated damages under the flsa however,we review the district court factual findings related to good faith and reasonableness for clear error.id.citing mclaughlin hogar san jos,cir.as we have explained,a clear error exists only if,after considering all the evidence,we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.united states brake,cir.
to establish good faith under the fmla,a defendant must show that it honestly intended to ascertain the dictates of the fmla and to act in conformance with it.thom,at quoting hite vermeer,cir see also barfield city health hosp,cir noting that good faith requires active steps to ascertain the dictates of the flsa and then act to comply with them internal quotation mark omitted.thus,an employer will be liable for liquidated damages where it either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute.chao,at quoting mclaughlin richland shoe.an employer may advance its good faith and reasonable grounds showings by demonstrating that it sought legal advice about its obligations under the fmla.see cooper fulton,cir finding no reasonable grounds for believing termination lawful where employer failed to seek legal advice hoffman prof l med.team,cir same.additionally,the fact that an employer met with an employee to determine eligibility for fmla leave may be indicative of good faith.see hoffman,at.
here,the transcript of the hearing on liquidated damages belies pagn assertion that the court did not consider whether walgreens had reasonable grounds for believing its actions to be lawful.in stating its decision,the court explained for purposes of this motion at this time,i understand walgreens acted with reasonable grounds.furthermore,although the evidence was mixed,the court finding of good faith and reasonable grounds was not so divorced from the evidence as to constitute clear error.
figueroa consulted with a walgreens attorney several times to understand the company legal obligations and obtain guidance in how to proceed.additionally,figueroa initial letter to pagn invited him to apply for disability leave.the company reconsidered its termination decision after pagn raised the issue with a human resources supervisor.perhaps most significantly,there was ample evidence of communications breakdowns at the juana daz store that prevented figueroa and the other managers who made the decision to terminate pagn from learning of the facts of his hospitalization and absence in a timely manner.for whatever reason,the medical certificate that pagn provided on may was not passed along to figueroa,nor was pagn notice that he would be absent for another week on recuperative rest.although it is undisputed that figueroa was aware of pagn initial visit to the emergency room,the court could rely on this evidence to conclude that he did not know of the full extent of pagn illness and was genuinely confused by pagn absence.
in short,given the high hurdle posed by the clear error standard,pagn challenge to the court findings is unavailing.see united states matos,cir noting that,although another may have differed,where a finding is plausible there is no clear error.
renta bonilla article claim 
as noted,pagn wife,ada renta bonilla,brought a claim in the same action under puerto rico article,laws ann.tit,article is puerto rico general tort statute,providing that a person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.id.the supreme court of puerto rico has held that,in certain circumstances,relatives of a person who has been the victim of workplace discrimination may bring claims under article to be compensated for any harm to them resulting from the discrimination.santini rivera serv.air.see also gonzlez figueroa penney,cir recognizing same.a relative article claim is derivative of the principal plaintiff claim in that it is premised on some harm to the principal plaintiff,and if the principal plaintiff claim fails,so too does the relative derivative claim.gonzlez figueroa,at citing maldonado rodrguez banco central,see also rivera centro mdico de turabo,cir the cause of action is derivative and depends on the viability of the underlying claim of the relative or loved one.article claims brought by family members often seek compensation for emotional harm,see rivera,at santini rivera,at,as did renta claim in this case 
the district court granted summary judgment for walgreens on renta article claim.it explained that both of pagn claims,brought under puerto rico law and the fmla,entitled a successful plaintiff to recover only monetary losses and not compensation for emotional distress.therefore,it reasoned,b ecause the statutes which pagn proceeds under do not provide for an award of general damages,his wife is unable to derive a claim for damages which he himself could not receive.the court noted that another federal district court had previously reached the same conclusion,but provided no other authority or explanation for its decision.on appeal,renta argues that this conclusion was contrary to our decision in gonzlez figueroa and that she was entitled to recover for her emotional distress.
as an initial matter,we note that the court was correct that a plaintiff may not recover damages for emotional distress under the fmla see nv.of human res.hibbs,t he cause of action under the fmla is a restricted one the damages recoverable are strictly defined and measured by actual monetary losses.thus,the question posed is whether the relative of an aggrieved employee may recover damages for emotional distress through a derivative article claim where the federal statute under which the aggrieved employee brings his claim does not permit recovery for emotional distress.
contrary to renta assertion,this question was not answered by our decision in gonzlez figueroa.that case presented similar facts the family members of an alleged victim of workplace discrimination brought claims under article seeking compensation for emotional distress and consequential damages.however,our analysis was limited to whether these claims were.at the outset,we explained that t his appeal requires us to consider the interplay between the statute of limitations and the maintenance of derivative tort claims brought by relatives of an age discrimination plaintiff,at,and our holding was limited to issues concerning the accrual and potential tolling of the relatives article claims,id.at.it is true that the vehicle for the principal plaintiff claim,the age discrimination in employment act,does not provide for emotional distress damages,see collazo nicholson,cir,but the issue of whether the plaintiffs were entitled to emotional distress damages in light of this fact was not before the court and was not addressed by the decision.accordingly,we will not treat gonzlez figueroa as having implicitly decided this issue of puerto rico law.
unfortunately,neither has the supreme court of puerto rico decided the issue in any translated case identified by the parties.in santini rivera,the court found that family members could bring an article claim in circumstances similar to those here and identified the elements of such a claim the relatives have allegedly suffered a compensable moral emotional harm the harm was caused by the employer discriminatory treatment of his employee in such a way that the impact of the discriminatory treatment received by the employee affects the relatives and causes them harm and the employer committed a tortious act.at.the court emphasized that the provision was based on general principles of tort liability,explaining that the concept of fault is infinitely embracing,as ample and embracing as human conduct is,id.at,and that it permitted recovery for moral emotional harm experienced by the persons related by blood ties or by affection and love to the victim or aggrieved party,id.at.
while santini rivera reading of article is broad,it is important to note that the principal claim from which the relatives claims derived was based on puerto rico general employment discrimination statute,stat.ann.tit,which itself permitted recovery for damages caused by emotional distress.the court did not address the question of whether article provides a vehicle for a family member to recover damages not available to the employee who suffered discrimination directly,nor have the parties identified any subsequent decision of the supreme court of puerto rico that has done so 
despite the broad reading of article provided by santini rivera,subsequent decisions of the united states district court for the district of puerto rico have not permitted family members to recover emotional distress damages through a derivative article claim when the statute under which the individual directly harmed brings his claim does not permit such damages.in barreto itt world directories,d,the court considered an article claim brought by the wife of an individual who alleged dismissal from his employment because of his military status in violation of the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of userra,and a similar puerto rico statute,laws ann.tit.reasoning that neither of these statutes permitted recovery of damages for emotional distress,the court dismissed the wife article claim.the court did not provide an extensive explanation of its decision,but simply noted that it would be ludicrous for plaintiff spouse to be entitled to greater benefits than plaintiff himself would be entitled to.id.at.subsequently,other decisions of the district court have reached the same conclusion regarding article claims derived from a violation of userra harming one relative.see rivera cartagena wal mart,d,quoting barreto and dismissing spouse article claim rivera melendez pfizer,d,citing barreto and dismissing derivative article claim brought by conjugal partnership.
however,these decisions by federal courts are not authoritative statements of puerto rico law,and,as far as we can tell,this question remains unresolved by the supreme court of puerto rico.in light of this uncertainty,we will not encroach on the prerogative of that court by resolving the question ourselves.see vanhaaren state farm mut.auto.ins,cir absent controlling state court precedent,a federal court sitting in diversity may certify a state law issue to the state highest court.of course,even in the absence of controlling precedent,certification would be inappropriate where state law is sufficiently clear to allow us to predict its course.ropes gray llp jalbert in re engage,cir.however,if the existing case law does not provide sufficient guidance to allow us reasonably to predict how the state courts would resolve the question,the prudent course is to certify the question to that court better suited to address the issue.id.at.
we faced a similar issue concerning the scope of article in muiz olivari stiefel laboratories,cir.in that case,a former employee and his wife filed a breach of contract suit against the former employer,and both the former employee and his wife sought damages for pain and suffering related to the breach of contract under article.the appeal required resolution of two unresolved issues of puerto rico law whether a plaintiff could recover damages for pain and suffering in a civil action for breach of contract that involved no claim of violation of or civil rights laws,and whether such a plaintiff family member,who is not a party to the contract,could recover pain and suffering damages.id.at.we decided that the best course was to certify the questions to the puerto rico supreme court.that is true here as well 
this issue as to the scope of article presents an important question of puerto rico law having broad implications on the availability of damages in a federal forum for plaintiffs in puerto rico.see in re engage,at finding certification appropriate where resolution of state law issues clearly ha s implications which go beyond these parties.on the one hand,vacating the decision of the district court and allowing renta claim to proceed extends article beyond the scope previously recognized by puerto rico courts.see hatch trail king indus,cir w e,as a federal court,have no warrant to extend state law.on the other hand,this is a question which recurs frequently and which would benefit from a definitive answer.for that reason,we choose to certify.
