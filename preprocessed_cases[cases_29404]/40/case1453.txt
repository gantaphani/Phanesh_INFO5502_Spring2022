joseph giarratano giarratano is a virginia state prisoner infected by hepatitis giarratano twice requested,at his own expense,that the red onion state prison,of the virginia department of corrections vdoc,provide him copies of the prison treatment protocols for inmates with hepatitis c so that he could make informed decisions about his health and to aid in any litigation arising from vdoc treatment of his condition.both times,vdoc denied giarratano requests.additionally,giarratano attempted to obtain the requested protocols through the virginia freedom of information act vfoia however,he was denied access because prisoners are specifically excluded from obtaining information under the act.giarratano alleges that he has never filed a frivolous request for information,and he is willing to pay the costs associated with obtaining the protocols.
giarratano brought his action against the director of the virginia department of corrections,gene johnson,challenging the constitutionality of the statutory exclusion of prisoners from making requests for public records under vfoia.in his complaint,giarratano raised three claims before the district court,both facial and challenges to the vfoia under the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment,as well as an challenge under the first amendment.
in dismissing the complaint,the district court ruled that the statutory exclusion of prisoners from making requests for public records under vfoia was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and that giarratano right of access to the courts was not violated.on appeal,giarratano argues that the vfoia prisoner exclusion violates the fourteenth amendment guarantee of equal protection,and that the court must determine whether prisoners are prone to filing frivolous vfoia requests at a higher rate than members of the general public.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
vfoia provides citizens the right of ready access to all public records held by the state and its officers and employees.see ann.the state may deny access to a public record only by invoking one of the narrowly drawn exemptions enumerated by the statute.to this end,section c excludes all persons incarcerated in any state,local,or federal correctional facility from enjoying any of the rights afforded under vfoia to make requests for public records.
giarratano alleges that the vfoia prisoner exclusion violates the fourteenth amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law,claiming that the court must make a determination in fact whether prisoners are prone to filing frivolous vfoia requests at a higher rate than members of the general public.giarratano additionally alleges that,as applied to him,vfoia prisoner exclusion violates his right of access to the courts under the first amendment and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.in support of this argument,giarratano represents that he has a clean history of never filing frivolous requests.
giarratano brought suit in the united states district court for the western district of virginia,challenging vfoia prisoner exclusion under the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment and under the first amendment.as in fisher king,cir,the district court analyzed the claim as both a facial challenge attacking the constitutionality of the statute in all situations and as an challenge,which consists of a challenge to the statute application only to the party before the court.
the district court granted vdoc motion to dismiss the giarratano claim,which sought to determine whether virginia statutory exclusion of prisoners from making foia requests is constitutional.see giarratano johnson,d.the court held that,on its face and as applied to giarratano individual request,the prisoner exclusion provision of vfoia was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
on appeal,giarratano seeks reversal of the district court rule b ruling in favor of the vdoc based upon giarratano failure to allege any facts that would indicate his rights had been violated.specifically,giarratano argues that although the vfoia prisoner exclusion had been in place for nearly ten years at the time of final disposition,the vdoc failed to show that prisoners are more prone to filing frivolous vfoia requests and that he should have been provided an opportunity to prove that prisoners do not make frivolous requests at a higher rate than members of the general public.according to giarratano,the only evidence relating to virginia prisoners vfoia filings is wholly in the possession of the vdoc and its employees accordingly,giarratano claims the only way to disprove the exclusion rationale would derive from the district court providing him with the opportunity to conduct discovery.
on appeal from an order granting a motion to dismiss filed under federal rule of civil procedure b,we review de novo and focus only on the legal sufficiency of the complaint.in conducting this review,we take the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,but we need not accept the legal conclusions drawn from the facts,and we need not accept as true unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions,or arguments.eastern shore,assocs,cir see also bass dupont de nemours,cir.additionally,the complaint must be dismissed if it does not allege enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d emphasis added.
our careful review of the record in this case reveals no reversible error.giarratano facial challenge to the vfoia prisoner exclusion rests on its violation of the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause,which states,in relevant part,that n o state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.const.amend.xiv.the clause requires that individuals be treated alike.city of cleburne cleburne living,d.
under an equal protection analysis,courts generally hold that legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.id.at.indeed,upon rational basis review,a classification in a statute such as vfoia comes before the court bearing a strong presumption of validity.see lyng automobile workers,d.in fact,l aws are presumed to be constitutional under the equal protection clause for the simple reason that classification is the very essence of the art of legislation.moss clark,cir citing city of cleburne,at.as such,the challenged classification need only be rationally related to a legitimate state interest unless it violates a fundamental right or is drawn upon a suspect classification such as race,religion,or gender.city of new orleans dukes,d.however,we do not recognize prisoners as a suspect class.roller gunn,cir.accordingly,we will review the vfoia prisoner exclusion under the rational basis standard.
under this deferential standard,the plaintiff bears the burden to negate every conceivable basis which might support the legislation.lehnhausen lake shore auto parts,d see mitchell comm r of the soc.sec,cir.further,the state has no obligation to produce evidence to support the rationality of the statute,which may be based on rational speculation unsupported by any evidence or empirical data.fcc beach,d.rather,a state does not violate the equal protection clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect.if the classification has some reasonable basis,it does not offend the constitution simply because the classification is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality.dandridge williams,d.indeed,a legislative choice is not subject to courtroom,and equal protection analysis is not a license for the courts to judge the wisdom,fairness,or logic of the legislative choices.fcc beach,at.
