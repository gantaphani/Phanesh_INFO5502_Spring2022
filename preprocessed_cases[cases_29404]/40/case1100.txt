opinion of the court 
this putative class action was brought by homebuyers who sought to recover statutory treble damages pursuant to section d of the real estate settlement procedures act of respa,codified at d.plaintiffs alleged that their private mortgage insurance premiums were channeled into an unlawful captive reinsurance arrangement essentially,a kickback by their mortgage lender,countrywide home loans countrywide,and its affiliated reinsurer,balboa reinsurance balboa,in violation of respa section a and section b,a b the thrust of their complaint was that,in enacting and amending section,congress bestowed upon the consumer the right to a real estate settlement free from unlawful kickbacks and unearned fees,and countrywide invasion of that statutory right,even without a resultant overcharge,was an for purposes of article iii standing.the district court disagreed and dismissed the complaint without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.we have jurisdiction over plaintiffs appeal under.
what is before us for decision turns on a question of statutory or does not the plain language of respa section indicate that congress created a private right of action without requiring an overcharge allegation we conclude that it does.accordingly,we will reverse the order of the district court.
background 
statutory background 
the focus of our attention in this appeal is respa section and,thus,we begin by setting forth its various subsections.section a prohibits any fee,kickback,or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding,oral or otherwise,that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person.a.section b prohibits unearned fees no person shall give and no person shall accept any portion,split,or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service other than for services actually performed.id.b.section c is a safe harbor provision for certain activities otherwise prohibited by section a and section b,including the provision of bona fide payment s for services actually performed.id.c.
congress charged the department of housing and urban development hud with the administration and enforcement of respa.id.d.to that end,hud can prescribe such rules and regulations and make such interpretations as may be necessary to achieve the purposes of the act.id.a.hud in the somewhat mysteriously titled regulation x are set forth at pt.
respa section has a penalties subsection,section d,that both prescribes criminal penalties for section violations,d,and authorizes hud,state attorneys general,and insurance commissioners to bring civil actions for injunctive relief.id.d.congress also authorized private actions against a person who violates section.as amended in,section d provides that a ny person or persons who violate the prohibition or limitations of this section shall be jointly and severally liable to the person or persons charged for the settlement service involved in the violation in an amount equal to three times the amount of any charge paid for such settlement service.id.d.it is this subsection of section that is the primary focus of our attention and the one we are called upon to construe.
plaintiffs obtained home mortgages from countrywide in and.because each plaintiff made a down payment of less than twenty percent,countrywide required that he or she obtain private mortgage insurance pmi plaintiffs alleged that countrywide referred them to mortgage insurers that would reinsure their pmi policies with balboa,a countrywide affiliate,pursuant to a captive reinsurance arrangement.
under a captive reinsurance arrangement,according to plaintiffs,the lender affiliate typically provides reinsurance to an unrelated primary mortgage insurer.that insurer and the reinsurer enter into an agreement under which the former pays the latter a portion of the borrower insurance premiums in return,the reinsurer assumes a portion of the primary insurer risk.reinsurance agreements generally fall into one of two categories.in a quota share agreement,the reinsurer bears a set percentage of all insured losses.in an excess loss agreement,the type of agreement at issue here,the primary insurer pays,and is solely responsible for,claims arising out of a given book of business up to a predetermined amount,after which the reinsurer is obligated to reimburse the primary insurer claims up to another predetermined amount above that band of reinsurance,the primary insurer is solely responsible for additional losses.
plaintiffs alleged that balboa did not assume risk commensurate with the amount of premiums it received from plaintiffs primary mortgage insurers.according to the complaint,balboa has collected over million in reinsurance premiums since and has paid nothing in claims.plaintiffs thus contended that the reinsurance premiums paid to balboa,countrywide affiliate,were kickbacks to countrywide by the primary insurer,in return for countrywide referral of pmi business to the primary insurer,thereby violating respa provision,section a.plaintiffs also alleged that,under this scheme,countrywide accepted a portion of the pmi premiums but provided no services in offered only sham reinsurance coverage,in violation of section b.as a result of this scheme,plaintiffs contended,they were overcharged for mortgage insurance.they maintained,however,that even if such practices did not result in same assumption we will make in resolving this were nonetheless entitled to settlements and,thus,the statutory damages set forth at section d.these arrangements,they argue,harm consumers,and harmed them,even in the absence of overcharges,by 
keeping premiums for pmi artificially inflated because a percentage of borrowers premiums are not actually being paid to cover actual risk,but are simply funding illegal kickbacks to lenders such as countrywide decreasing or,in fact,eliminating competition and choice among pmi providers which completely them from trying to earn more business through legitimate means such as price or product improvement and mak ing true disclosure of costs or potential conflicts of interest difficult or obfuscation of the same easier.
appellants br.at.
plaintiffs,we note,had yet another reason for pleading a violation of section without alleging a resultant overcharge.in pennsylvania,pmi providers are required to file their rates with the pennsylvania insurance department pid.see.stat.ann.a.once a rate is approved by the pid,the providers can not charge premiums that vary from that rate.plaintiffs do not dispute that they paid rates for mortgage insurance that were filed with and approved by the pid.accordingly,and viewed narrowly,whether or not a portion of their pmi premiums were repackaged as kickbacks to countrywide,plaintiffs paid the same premiums they would have paid had their policies not been reinsured.
procedural history 
countrywide moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing,inter alia,that plaintiffs monthly pmi premiums were filed with the pid and,therefore,per se reasonable under the filed rate doctrine.indeed,said countrywide,the very reason plaintiffs could not allege an overcharge was because,as pennsylvania residents,their pmi rates had been approved by the state.absent an overcharge allegation,countrywide argued,plaintiffs lacked standing to file suit under respa section,and lacked as well the requisite to establish article iii standing.countrywide also claimed that dismissal was warranted under respa safe harbor provision,section c,which excepts charges for settlement services,otherwise violative of section a or section b,that are reasonably related to the value of goods or services provided.c.
the district court granted countrywide motion to dismiss.it first noted that,because p laintiffs paid the only legal rate they could have paid for mortgage insurance in pennsylvania,and those rates were per se reasonable,plaintiffs lacked standing to allege that they paid an artificially inflated pmi rate.next,having considered whether plaintiffs nevertheless had standing to sue for statutory damages under respa without alleging pmi premium overcharges,the court concluded that section d c learly entitles persons who paid for any settlement service in violation of respa to receive damages equal to three times the amount of any charge paid for settlement services in violation of the statute.
the district court,however,went further.because the purpose of respa is to protect individuals from unnecessarily high settlement charges,it declined to construe respa damages provision as authorizing plaintiffs to sue for damages,where they have not been overcharged.quoting a.relying,in part,on the holding in carter realty,carter i,d,the court held that plaintiffs did not satisfy the requirement for article iii standing and,accordingly,dismissed the complaint without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.during the pendency of this appeal,the carter i opinion relied upon by the court was reversed by the court of appeals for the sixth circuit.see in re carter ii carter ii,cir concluding that an allegation that a settlement service provider violated section is an,meets the requirements of article iii,and is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.id.at.
ii.standard of review 
whether the order of the district court is more appropriately viewed as having dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to rule b,or for failure to state a claim pursuant to rule b,our standard of review is the same we accept as true plaintiffs material allegations,and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to them.see ballentine united states,cir setting forth standards of review for both rule b and b dismissals.
iii.discussion 
the overriding question before us is whether congress intended to create a private right of action for a consumer who alleges a violation of respa section in connection with his or her settlement,even if that violation does not result in a traditional,monetary injury in the form of an overcharge for settlement services.the resolution of that question requires interpretation of the relevant provisions of respa,most particularly section.countrywide does not seriously dispute that,if we answer that question in the affirmative,we will continue to call them plaintiffs on have alleged an sufficient for purposes of article iii standing.we thus turn to the parties statutory interpretation arguments before addressing any lingering concerns over article iii standing.see sierra club morton,d t he inquiry as to standing must begin with a determination of whether the statute in question authorizes review at the behest of the plaintiff.we will also briefly address countrywide argument under the filed rate doctrine.
statutory interpretation 
we begin,as we must,by examining the plain language of the statute.the role of the courts in interpreting a statute is to give effect to congress intent because it is presumed that congress expresses its intent through the ordinary meaning of its language,every exercise of statutory interpretation begins with an examination of the plain language of the statute.united states diallo,cir quoting rosenberg xm ventures,cir see also lamie united states,d w hen the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the test is not to enforce it according to its terms.
the plain language of respa section does not require plaintiffs to allege an overcharge.the best indication of congress intent in this regard is the method it prescribed for the calculation of statutory damages in section d.section a and section b proscribe specific types of abusive kickback and referral activities.see id.a b.section d,in turn,creates a private right of action for a consumer whereby a defendant is liable for violations of section a and section b to the person or persons charged for the settlement service involved in the violation in an amount equal to three times the amount of any charge paid for such settlement service.see id.d emphasis added.critically,none of these provisions contains the word overcharge or otherwise implies that the plaintiff must allege that he or she paid more than he or she otherwise would have paid see id.a,b,d.instead,damages are fixed at three times the total charge paid by the consumer in exchange for a settlement service,and not merely any overcharge.we agree with plaintiffs and the united states,intervening on plaintiffs behalf,that the provision of statutory damages based on the entire payment,not on an overcharge,is a certain indication that congress did not intend to require an overcharge to recover under section of respa.
despite the seemingly obvious meaning of section d,there is a split of district court authority.one line of cases holds that section d provides treble damages based on the amount of the overcharge paid for such settlement service,traditional compensatory damages another line of cases agrees with the reading we give section d that congress pegged damages as three times the total payment for an infected service,not just any resultant overcharge as one district court put it,it is plain from the grammar of the statute that the phrase involved in the violation modifies the immediately preceding term service to mean that defendants are liable for damages only with respect to the specific services that were provided in connect sic with the violation of the statute.berger prop.it found the statute not reasonably susceptible to the construction given in the carter i line of cases because those cases either fail to address the unambiguous text and grammar of the statute,unreasonably deconstruct the text to render its grammar irrelevant,or otherwise read absent words into its provisions.id.at.
in sum,it is clear to us that the plain,unambiguous language of section d indicates that damages are based on the settlement service amount with no requirement that there have been an overcharge we thus agree with the conclusion of the sixth circuit in carter ii that the ordinary definition of any indicates that charges are neither restricted to a particular type of charge such as an overcharge nor limited to a specific part.at citing definition from webster dictionary.in addition,the sixth circuit noted that the phrase such settlement services refers to the preceding phrase settlement services involved in the violation.id.citing d.as the united states explains,a single real estate closing may involve several different services,but the charge for each distinct service will not necessarily violate section.on this reading,with which we concur,a homebuyer is entitled to three times any charge paid,but only for the service connected to the kickback or.
district courts have also disagreed as to effect,if any,of the language of other provisions in respa on the interpretation of the language of section d.for instance,section prohibits a property seller from requiring the buyer to purchase title insurance from a particular title company.a.a section violation results in damages in an amount equal to three times all charges made for such title insurance.id.b emphasis added.the morales court,for example,comparing sections d and,concluded that where congress intended damages to be based on the entire amount of the settlement charge it used the words all charges.at.but by using the phrase any charge in section d and all charges made for such title insurance in section b,congress did not distinguish between the portion of a charge that is excessive and the entire charge.rather,in section b,congress recognized that there may be multiple charges for title insurance,some paid by the buyer and some by the seller.the measure of damages for a violation of section a is triple the amount of all title insurance charges combined,not merely the buyer or seller amount.thus,respa section has no bearing whatsoever on our interpretation of section d.
it can not seriously be contended that when congress sought to differentiate between all charges and a portion of those charges,it did not know how to do so.in section b,for example,congress differentiated between the overall charge for a settlement service and any portion,split,or percentage thereof that is not for services rendered.b.moreover,congress knew
