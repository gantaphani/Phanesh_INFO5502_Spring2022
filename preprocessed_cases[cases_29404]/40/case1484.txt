while executing a search warrant in a university of maryland,college park,dormitory during a drug raid,university police detective philip tou and other law enforcement officers mistakenly entered the wrong room and briefly detained the residents of that room,one of whom was rafael mazuz.upon realizing the mistake,the officers immediately released the residents and left the room.mazuz subsequently filed this lawsuit asserting a cause of action against tou under for violating his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure,unlawful arrest and detention,and the use of excessive force.mazuz also asserted an identical cause of action against tou under article of the maryland declaration of rights.tou moved for summary judgment on both causes of action arguing that no constitutional violation occurred and that he is entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion,and tou now appeals.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the district court order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
in may,mazuz was a student at the university of maryland,college park.mazuz and a roommate resided in room of ellicott hall,which is a university dormitory.tou was employed by the university police department and was assigned by the university to serve on a drug task force.in this capacity,tou conducted drug investigations on the university campus.tou had been employed by the university police department for several years,and he had obtained and executed over search warrants,many of which were for campus dormitory rooms.mazuz and tou did not know one another.
in early may,tou received information concerning the sale of illegal drugs on campus.tou investigation revealed that several of the students involved in this drug activity resided in ellicott hall.among other information,tou learned that in late april an armed robbery of drugs from a resident of ellicott hall room had occurred.tou also learned that one of the students involved in this drug activity had stated to an informant that he possessed a knife and intended to use it against any police officer who confronted him 
based on his investigation,tou subsequently applied for and obtained search warrants for ellicott hall rooms and,and arrest warrants for students residing in ellicott hall rooms and.before obtaining the warrants,tou visited the fifth floor of ellicott hall and observed the exterior of rooms,and.tou also confirmed with university officials the identity of the residents of these rooms.neither mazuz nor his roommate was a suspect in any of the drug activity,and the validity of the warrants is not at issue.
on may,tou prepared an operational plan for the execution of the arrest and search warrants on the fifth floor of ellicott hall.at approximately that evening,tou met with other officers at the university police station and planned for the raid.tou reviewed with the officers the information uncovered during his investigation and the floor plan for ellicott hall,and the officers were assigned specific duties for the raid.tou,along with one or more officers,was assigned to enter room.the officers then drove from the police station to ellicott hall.consistent with his normal practice to show warrants to suspects only after a scene has been secured,tou left the warrants in his vehicle when he arrived at ellicott hall.although tou was designated as the lead investigator,his immediate supervisor accompanied the officers on this raid.
the search warrant for room and presumably the other warrants authorized nighttime execution,and tou believed that the likelihood of finding evidence in the rooms was greater at night.at approximately,tou and seven or eight other officers entered ellicott hall and took an elevator to the fifth floor.the officers exited the elevator and proceeded down the hallway at a quick pace.from the officers location,room was halfway down the hall from the elevator on the right side,room was immediately past room,and rooms and were further down the hall on the left side.tou moved down the hall staying close to the wall on the right side so that other officers could pass him on the left side.the plan for the raid called for simultaneous entry into the three rooms.tou reached room ten to fifteen seconds after exiting the elevator.
the room numbers in ellicott hall are not located on the room doors.instead,they are located on the wall to the upper left of each doorway.tou was familiar with this numbering system,and he also had reviewed the warrant for room during the meeting.the warrant for room correctly described the location of the number for the room.
as tou approached room,which he understood was the room he was supposed to enter,he remained close to the wall.from this vantage point,tou could not view the room numbers on the wall until he was close to the rooms because the numbers were obstructed by the doorway frames.when tou viewed the number,he mistakenly associated it with the door to room,which was next to room.the number is between rooms and,but it is closer to the door for room.believing that room was in fact room,tou focused his attention on the door to room,and he and another officer moved into position on the sides of that door.at that time,the number was immediately above tou,but he did not see it.nothing in the record suggests that the actual doors of rooms and differ in any material respect.
tou knocked on the door to room and announced his presence for the purpose of executing a search warrant.tou then drew his weapon.mazuz and his roommate were in room,and mazuz was studying for an examination to be given the following morning.hearing the knock on the door and believing that another student was outside his room,mazuz opened the door to find tou firearm pointed directly at him.tou and one or more armed officers entered the room,loudly ordered mazuz and his roommate to get on the floor,and handcuffed them.tou was dressed in black battle dress uniform,which included a black,raid vest,and gun belt,and he had some form of clothing over his head or face.quite naturally,mazuz and his roommate were unnerved by the officers entry into their room,and they attempted to ascertain what was happening and to explain that a mistake had been made.the officers told them to shut up.the room was filled with shouting.
shortly after entering room,tou became aware that something was amiss.tou thus went into the hall and checked the room number.at that time,tou realized that the officers had mistakenly entered room rather than room,and he informed the other officers of this fact.the officers uncuffed mazuz and his roommate and went to room to execute the search warrant.the entire incident involving room lasted one to two minutes.although the officers pushed or shoved some of mazuz belongings near the doorway for a few seconds,they did not physically search mazuz,his roommate,or the room itself.
mazuz was understandably upset by this incident,and he therefore attempted without success to be excused from his examination the following morning.because of anxiety resulting from the incident,mazuz scored poorly on the examination consequently,he received a poor letter grade for the course.mazuz has since been diagnosed as suffering from stress disorder.
mazuz has presented a report from his expert witness,wendell france,who opined among other things that the execution of the search and seizure warrants at ellicott hall was a disjointed,poorly managed initiative,and that tou disregarded mazuz rights by failing to ensure a copy of the warrant was in hand to prevent the armed,forced entry of room.france specifically pointed to a state police policy that provides,in pertinent part,that when executing a search warrant t he entry team leader,along with the task supervisor,is responsible for reading the description of the location to be searched and compare the description to the location being entered.
for his part,tou testified during discovery that he had never seen this policy.tou also testified that the manner in which the warrant for room was executed is consistent with the normal practice of the drug task force.however,tou acknowledged that if he had compared the description in the warrant with the doorway immediately before he entered room he probably would not have entered that room.
as we have noted,mazuz has asserted a claim under,alleging that tou violated his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure,unlawful arrest and detention,and the use of excessive force.mazuz has also asserted an identical cause of action based on article of the maryland declaration of rights which,as we discuss below,is generally construed in pari materia with the fourth amendment.see fitzgerald state,
in moving for summary judgment,tou argued that the fourth amendment is violated only by unreasonable conduct and that his mistaken entry into mazuz room was reasonable under the circumstances.for this reason,tou contended that he did not violate the fourth amendment or article.tou further argued that he is entitled to qualified immunity on the cause of action because the law was not clearly established in that his actions violated the fourth amendment and because he acted in good faith.tou also argued that he is entitled to qualified immunity on the article claim because he did not act with malice or gross negligence.
describing the issue as a close call,the district court denied tou motion in an oral order.after recounting much of the evidence set forth above,the district court held that the law was clearly established in that a law enforcement officer could not enter a premises without proper authorization.therefore,the district court reasoned,the issue is really a question of whether analyzing the acts in question a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that what tou did was objectively unreasonable,and it answered this question in the affirmative 
the plaintiff argument is not unreasonable in the sense that tou had been there the week before and should have known better.he knew where the numbers were.he scoped it out to see exactly where they were.
he described the door in detail to get the warrant.he did not have the warrant with him when he came in that evening and indeed he says on deposition,that maybe if i had had that warrant in hand,i would have seen and not gone in.and i think that enough,frankly,to raise a question of material fact in this case.it squeaks by.
not to say that the plaintiff prevails in this case ultimately,but a jury will decide whether or not there was objective unreasonableness in this case.as i say,no issue of qualified immunity here really,because it is well established that one does enter into a premises where one does have a warrant.
so this is really a question of whether on these particular facts there was objectively reasonable or unreasonable behavior and a trier of fact could differ on that.so the motion as to count seven,which is the claim and the article state claim is denied.
quotation marks added.in making this ruling,the district court stated that it was unnecessary to rule specifically on mazuz claim of excessive force therefore,it expressly refrained from doing so.
on appeal,tou reiterates the arguments that he made in the district court.as we explain more fully below,we conclude that the district court erred in denying the summary judgment motion on the and article claims because the specific undisputed evidence in this case establishes as a matter of law that tou acted reasonably.
we begin with the claim,which is grounded on tou alleged violation of mazuz fourth amendment rights.the fourth amendment guarantees the right of the people to be secure in their persons and houses against unreasonable searches and seizures.the central concern of the fourth amendment is to protect liberty and privacy from arbitrary and oppressive interference by government officials.united states ortiz,d.under the fourth amendment,a search occurs when an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable is infringed,united states jacobsen,d,and a seizure occurs when,taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter,the police conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business,kaupp texas,d per curiam citations and internal punctuation omitted.
the fourth amendment does not proscribe all searches and seizures it merely proscribes those which are unreasonable.florida jimeno,d.whether a fourth amendment violation has occurred turns on an objective assessment of the officer actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time,and not on the officer actual state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken.maryland macon,d internal citation and punctuation omitted.this is a inquiry.ohio robinette,d.i n order to satisfy the reasonableness requirement of the fourth amendment,what is generally demanded of the many factual determinations that must regularly be made by agents of the government is not that they always be correct,but that they always be reasonable.illinois rodriguez,d.elaborating on this point,the court has stated because many situations which confront officers in the course of executing their duties are more or less ambiguous,room must be allowed for some mistakes on their part.but the mistakes must be those of reasonable men,acting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability.brinegar united states.
the purpose of is to deter state actors from using the badge of their authority to deprive individuals of their federally guaranteed rights and to provide relief to victims if such deterrence fails.wyatt cole,d.section allows a plaintiff to seek money damages from government officials who have violated his fourth amendment rights,wilson layne,d,but it does not purport to redress injuries resulting from reasonable mistakes,mclenagan karnes,cir.
in response to the claim,tou has asserted the defense of qualified immunity,which shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.when a government official asserts qualified immunity as a defense,the requisites of the defense must be considered in proper sequence.saucier katz,d.the threshold question that a court must first answer is whether the facts,when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,show that the official conduct violated a constitutional right.id.at.if no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established,there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.id.however,if a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established that is,whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at.
in reviewing the denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity,we accept as true the facts that the district court concluded may be reasonably inferred from the record when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.to the extent that the district court has not fully set forth the facts on which its decision is based,we assume the facts that may reasonably be inferred from the record when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.waterman batton,cir internal footnote and citations omitted 
applying the foregoing standard,we begin our analysis by answering the threshold question of whether the facts presented in the summary judgment record,when viewed in the light most favorable to mazuz,show that tou violated mazuz fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure,unlawful arrest and detention,or the use of excessive force.we believe that under the specific circumstances of this case this question must be answered in the negative.
the genesis of the alleged fourth amendment violations in this case,and the focus of the district court order,is tou entry into mazuz room.tou does not dispute that his entry into mazuz room constitutes a fourth amendment search,and it is undisputed that he did not have a warrant to enter this particular room.viewed in isolation,tou entry into mazuz room has the appearance of a fourth amendment violation because w ith few exceptions,the question whether a warrantless search of a home is reasonable and hence constitutional must be answered no.kyllo united states,d.however,relying primarily on hill california,d,and maryland garrison,d,tou contends that his entry into mazuz room was nonetheless reasonable because he had a valid warrant to enter room,and he simply made an honest mistake based on his observation and perception of the room number as the raid unfolded.we agree.
in hill,the police had probable cause to arrest a man named hill.when they arrived at hill apartment,they encountered a man named miller in the apartment.despite miller presentment of identification and protestation,the police believed in good faith that miller was hill,and they arrested him.during a search of hill apartment following miller arrest,police found contraband that was subsequently used against hill at a criminal trial.hill was convicted,and his conviction was upheld by the state courts.
the supreme court likewise sustained hill conviction.in doing so,the court rejected hill assertion that the arrest of miller which led to the search of hill apartment was invalid,holding that when the police have probable cause to arrest one party,and when they reasonably mistake a second party for the first party,then the arrest of the second party is a valid arrest.hill,at.citation omitted and internal punctuation altered.explaining this holding,the court stated 
the upshot was that the officers in good faith believed miller was hill and arrested him.they were quite wrong as it turned out,and subjective belief would not in itself justify either the arrest or the subsequent search.but sufficient probability,not certainty,is the touchstone of reasonableness under the fourth amendment and on the record before us the officers mistake was understandable and the arrest a reasonable response to the situation facing them at the time.
id.at.turning then to the validity of the search of hill apartment,the court also rejected hill assertion that the search was invalid regardless of the validity of miller arrest.after noting that there was probable cause to arrest hill and the police arrested miller in hill apartment,reasonably believing him to be hill,the court held that i n these circumstances the police were entitled to do what the law would have allowed them to do if miller had in fact been hill,that is,to search incident to arrest and to seize evidence of the crime the police had probable cause to believe hill had committed.id.at.
in garrison,the police obtained and executed a valid warrant to search the person of a man named mcwebb and the premises known as park avenue third floor apartment.at.when the police obtained and executed the warrant,they reasonably believed based on their investigation that there was only one apartment on the third floor of park avenue.there were,however,two apartments on the third floor one occupied by mcwebb and one occupied by garrison.before the police realized that there were two apartments on the third floor,they had entered garrison apartment and observed contraband.garrison was charged and convicted based on this contraband,but his conviction was reversed by the court of appeals of maryland based on the grounds that the search of his apartment and the seizure of the contraband was unconstitutional.in reaching this decision,the court relied on article and,because of the in pari materia construction,the fourth amendment.id.at.
applying fourth amendment principles,the supreme court reversed.after concluding that the warrant itself was valid,the court considered the question whether the execution of the warrant violated garrison constitutional right to be secure in his home.id.at.the court noted that although the purposes justifying a police search strictly limit the permissible extent of the search,there is also the need to allow some latitude for honest mistakes that are made by officers in the dangerous and difficult process of making arrests and executing search warrants.id.at.the court stated that its rationale in hill that an officer reasonable misidentification of a person does not invalidate a valid arrest is equally applicable to an officer reasonable failure to appreciate that a valid warrant describes too broadly the premises to be searched,and that the validity of the search of garrison apartment pursuant to a warrant authorizing the search of the entire third floor depends on whether the officers failure to realize the overbreadth of the warrant was objectively understandable and reasonable.id.at.the court concluded that it was objectively understandable and reasonable because the objective facts available to the officers at the time suggested no distinction between mcwebb apartment and the premises.id.at.notably,the court observed that the officers properly recognized that they were required to discontinue the search of garrison apartment as soon as they discovered that there were two separate units on the third floor and therefore were put on notice of the risk that they might be in a unit erroneously included within the terms of the warrant.at.
the material facts in this case are undisputed.tou had a valid warrant to enter and search room,which is immediately next door to mazuz room on the fifth floor of ellicott hall.before obtaining the warrant,tou visited ellicott hall to locate and identify room as well as the other two rooms that were under investigation,and he correctly identified room on the warrant application.on the night of the raid,tou reviewed with the other officers the plan for the raid and correctly identified room as the room he was to search.the plan called for simultaneous entry into three rooms on the fifth floor,and the officers had information that indicated that they could encounter armed resistance.as the raid unfolded,tou and a number of other officers moved quickly down the fifth floor hallway,and tou stayed close to the right wall in order to allow other officers to pass by on his left.during this entire time,tou correctly understood that he was to enter room.however,from his vantage point,tou mistakenly associated the room number which was on the wall between rooms and with the door to room,and in the quickly unfolding circumstances,he and other officers entered room.the officers were in mazuz room for a relatively brief period of time,and they left immediately upon realizing the mistake.
the district court concluded that these undisputed facts present a close jury question concerning the reasonableness of tou entry into mazuz room.however,given the need to allow some latitude for honest mistakes that are made by officers in the dangerous and difficult process of making arrests and executing search warrants,garrison,at,we believe that these specific undisputed facts establish as a matter of law that tou mistake was understandable and the search a reasonable response to the situation facing him at the time,hill,at.therefore,we hold that tou entry into mazuz,the search does not constitute a fourth amendment violation.
the district court grounded its contrary conclusion primarily on two factors.first,the district court noted that because tou had been on the fifth floor hallway before the raid and observed the exterior of rooms and,he should have known better on the night of the raid.second,the district court attached great significance to the fact that tou did not carry the warrant with him when he began the search,pointing out that tou acknowledged that he probably would not have entered mazuz room if he had carried the warrant and examined it while he was in the hallway.although there may be a certain superficial appeal to these observations,we do not believe that under the circumstances of this case they create an issue of whether tou acted reasonably for fourth amendment purposes.
regarding the former observation,we believe that the district court is implicitly penalizing tou for doing what appears to be a natu
