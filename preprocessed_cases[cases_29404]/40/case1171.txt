major frank matreale,a commissioned officer in the new jersey army national guard njang serving under orders issued pursuant to f brought suit in the superior court of new jersey against the new jersey department of military and veterans affairs njdmva,the overseer of the njang,to recover damages for retaliation under the new jersey law against discrimination njlad.the national guard of the united states intervened and the case was removed from state court to the united states district court for the district of new jersey.applying the doctrine of immunity first enunciated in feres united states,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the njdmva.
the issue before us is whether the feres doctrine of immunity bars a suit raising state law claims for damages for injuries arising from,or in the course of activity incident to,military service brought against a state national guard by a guardsman serving under title.we hold that it does and will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to b and.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over the district court grant of summary judgment and employ the same analysis required of the district court to determine whether there are any issues of material fact that would enable the nonmoving party to prevail.kay berry,taylor gifts,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.at the summary judgment stage,we view all evidence and consider all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to the party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
in july of,pursuant to an ongoing official investigation,matreale provided to kent milliken,his direct supervisor in the njang,a statement supporting a female guardsman accusation that she had been sexually harassed by an njang sergeant major.an inquiry ultimately concluded that the accuser in fact was sexually harassed.
matreale,contending that based on his role in the sexual harassment investigation,milliken and other njang officers subsequently engaged in a course of retaliation against him,including,inter alia,negative performance evaluations and other disciplinary measures based on accusations that he had engaged in an improper relationship with the female sexual harassment victim,sought redress in the suit referred to above.
the district court,in granting summary judgment in favor of the njdmva,found that matreale,serving under title,was a federal employee for immunity purposes and concluded that his state law claims for damages were barred under the feres doctrine of immunity because the injuries for which he sought recovery arose out of,or were incurred in the course of activity incident to,his military service.the district court further held that matreale requests for reinstatement,promotion and other injunctive or declaratory relief were.
the doctrine of immunity upon which the district court relied in dismissing matreale damages claims had its genesis in feres,supra,a consolidation of three cases in each of which the claimant while on active duty in the united states armed forces sustained an injury due to the negligence of others in the armed forces.the supreme court held that the federal government was not liable under the federal tort claims act for injuries to servicemen arising out of,or in the course of activity incident to,military service.at.at.the court noted that without exception,the relationship of military personnel to the government has been governed by federal law,and that no federal law has permitted a soldier to recover for negligence,against either his superior officers or the government he is serving.at.at.
although only alluded to in feres,the supreme court subsequently expounded upon the underlying rationale for the immunity doctrine and described it as being predicated upon 
t he peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors,the effects of the maintenance of such suits on discipline,and the extreme results that might obtain if suits were allowed for negligent orders given or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty 
united states brown.
in chappell wallace,d,the supreme court expanded the reach of the feres doctrine to bar a bivens claim for damages brought by federal servicemen against their federal superior officers alleging constitutional violations resulting from alleged racial discrimination in assignments,evaluations and punishment.as in feres,the court relied primarily upon the peculiar and special relationship between a soldier and his superiors,and the potential effects of permitting such lawsuits on military discipline,in holding that the doctrine of immunity barred bivens damages claims.chappell,at.at.
without exception,in other cases,the court has adhered to the compelling necessity of maintaining military discipline as the basis for expanding the immunity doctrine to encompass a variety of claims,against an assortment of defendants,brought by a range of servicemen,for injuries arising out of,or in the course of activity incident to,military service.see united states stanley,d feres incident to service test equally applicable in bivens cases brought by serviceman against military officers and civilians united states johnson,d barring ftca claim against civilian defendant by widow of serviceman killed in rescue mission united states shearer,d barring ftca claim against united states arising from murder of serviceman by another serviceman stencel aero eng g united states,d barring claim for indemnification against united states brought by a government contractor in a negligence suit filed by a national guardsman on a training mission.
following the supreme court rationale in those cases,in defining the scope of the feres doctrine we too have recognized the adverse impact on military discipline inherent in the judicial review of military orders and have sought to avoid it.in jaffee united states,cir,we held that the feres doctrine extends to bar a federal serviceman state law intentional tort claim against his army supervisors.we recognized two potential consequences of permitting suits for service injuries their effect on the willingness of military personnel to follow the directions of their superiors and the concomitant chilling effect that the concern of being called into civilian court may have on the discharge of the duties of military authorities.id.at.of particular significance to the matter presently before us,we noted in jaffee that s uits founded on state law have the same potential for undermining military discipline as federal tort claims.id.at.
later,in jorden national guard bureau,cir,we determined that the reasoning in chappell,supra,barring bivens damages claims against federal military officers,was equally applicable to a action brought by a civilian technician in a state national guard against state military officers in light of the supreme court decision in butz economou,d,which unequivocally held that bivens claims and claims are to be treated as identical for immunity purposes.we observed that in chappell the supreme court was laying down a general rule barring damages actions by military personnel against superior officers for constitutional violations,rather than authorizing a inquiry.jorden,at.
in this case,there is no dispute that the alleged harm suffered by matreale arose from,or in the course of activity incident to,his military service in the njang,since his damages allegedly resulted from the conduct of his superior officers in evaluating and disciplining him.a straightforward application of the feres doctrine as it has evolved in the supreme court and this circuit,therefore,would appear to dictate the conclusion reached by the district court that matreale damages claims are barred by immunity.
pressed by the overwhelming weight of the foregoing federal precedent,however,matreale seeks to avoid such a straightforward application of the federally created feres doctrine by attempting to convert this case into an exclusive state law matter.in that vein,matreale argues that,as a state guardsman,serving under title,he is a state employee suing other state employees,also serving under title,under state law.accordingly,his argument goes,the issue of immunity is one which should be addressed and resolved solely under state law specifically,the question should be whether the njdmva is entitled to immunity under the njlad,rather than one addressed to federal law in the form of the feres doctrine.
matreale entire position rests on his attempt to differentiate between state guardsmen serving pursuant to title,on the one hand,and those serving pursuant to title,on the other.matreale contends that the feres doctrine applies only to state guardsmen who have been mobilized to active duty under title,but does not apply to guardsmen serving under title,except to the extent those guardsman are engaged in drills or field training under a at the time of the alleged conduct,because guardsmen serving under title are state,as opposed to federal,employees.
neither party in this case questions the fact that matreale was serving under orders issued pursuant to f,and had not been mobilized under title,at the time of the conduct in question likewise,there is no dispute that all of the superior officers implicated in the alleged retaliatory behavior against matreale also were serving under orders issued pursuant to f.finally,there is no dispute that at the time of the conduct in question,neither matreale nor his superiors were engaged in drills or field training under a.under these circumstances,matreale contends that at all material times all relevant parties in this case were serving in a state,not a federal,capacity and,therefore,were state employees subject only to state law on the question of immunity.
matreale argument is without merit for several reasons.first,the essential premise of his entire case,that,for immunity purposes,he was solely a state employee,is invalid.rather,the district court clearly was correct in holding that matreale title status at the time of the alleged incidents rendered him a federal employee for feres purposes.
first,at the time of the conduct in question,matreale was serving under orders issued pursuant to federal law,specifically,f.his appointment as an officer was pursuant to the sixteenth clause of section,article i of the constitution,and he began full time service with the national guard in december of on orders issued pursuant to f.as the district court correctly noted,these orders rendered matreale,at all relevant times,a full time guardsman in the national guard of the united states serving in accordance with the active guard reserve program.
in addition,this court previously has applied the feres doctrine to a guardsman serving under title.in loughney united states,cir,we held that a national guardsman on active guard reserve duty status,as matreale was in this case,was barred by the feres doctrine from suing the government under the federal tort claims act.we emphasized there that i t is simply the status of the claimant that is dispositive.id.at.because loughney was a serviceman and his injury arose out of or in the course of activity incident to his military service,we concluded that his ftca claim was barred by the doctrine of immunity.id.
like loughney,matreale was a title serviceman in active guard reserve duty status and his alleged damages arose out of,or in the course of activity incident to,his military service.the fact that loughney sued under the ftca whereas matreale is suing only under state law is of no consequence.as we recognized in jaffee,supra,the feres doctrine applies to suits founded on state law as well as to those founded on federal law because state law based suits have the same potential for undermining military discipline as do federal claims.jaffee,at see also coffman state of michigan,cir statutory remedies under michigan handicapper civil rights act are not available to uniformed members of the armed forces including national guard members.
matreale arguments in support of his position that his status as a title guardsman rendered him a state rather than a federal employee likewise are unpersuasive.first,his reliance on perpich department of defense,d is misplaced.there,the supreme court held that congress may authorize that members of the national guard be assigned to active federal duty for training outside the united states without either the consent of the state governor or the existence of a national emergency.the court,in addressing the unique dual enlistment status of state national guard members,observed that s ince all persons who have enlisted in a state national guard unit have simultaneously enlisted in the national guard of the united states.at.the court held that under this dual enlistment system,a member of the guard who is ordered to active duty in the federal service is thereby relieved of his or her status in the state guard for the entire period of federal service.id.at.
matreale misconstrues the perpich holding as implying that unless a state guardsman has been called to active duty under title and thereby loses his status in the state guard,he at all other times remains solely in state,not federal,status.but the plain holding of the court is to the contrary.under the holding in perpich,matreale attained dual status as a member of both the national guard of the united states and the njang when he accepted his commission as an officer.and.and while under perpich a state guardsman loses his state status when he is called to active duty under title,there is nothing in perpich from which one reasonably may infer,as matreale argues,that a title guardsman loses,or does not have,federal status unless he is mobilized under title or engaged in drills or field training under a.on the contrary,the supreme court in perpich stressed that its holding that a state guardsman is stripped of his state status when he is called to active duty under title merely recognizes the supremacy of federal power in the area of military affairs.perpich,at.at.our conclusion that a state guardsman serving under orders issued pursuant to title,whether serving under a or f,has and retains his federal status,along with his state status,even when he has not been called to active duty under title,likewise recognizes federal supremacy over military affairs.
matreale also cites to phillips state department of defense.this case too is of little value to his position.in phillips,the new jersey supreme court held that a national guardsman injured while training remained an employee of the state and was not an employee of the federal government,which would have precluded application of the new jersey state military compensation law.while mentioning the feres doctrine in passing,the court did not rely on the feres rationale because the statutory interplay between the new jersey military compensation law and the new jersey tort claims act was not present in feres.at,at.in short,phillips did not authorize a tort suit against the state of new jersey or any other person or entity by an injured guard member,whether in federal or state status,but merely provided a remedy under the state military compensation law for personal injuries suffered by a guard member in state status.
for the foregoing reasons,we agree with the district court determination that matreale and his supervisors,all of whom were serving under orders issued pursuant to f at the time of the conduct in question,were serving in a federal capacity and therefore were federal employees for purposes of the immunity doctrine.
our conclusion that matreale and his supervisors were federal or at best dual employees,at the time of the conduct in question is dispositive of his remaining argument that state law,rather than the feres doctrine,should determine the question of immunity we need look no further than feres for an unequivocal refutation of this argument.there,the supreme court stressed the point that the relationship between the government and members of its armed forces is distinctly federal in character and that without exception,the relationship of military personnel to the government has been governed by federal
