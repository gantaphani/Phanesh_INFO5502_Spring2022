a group of local volunteer fire and rescue departments lfrds and several of their former administrative employees collectively,plaintiffs brought suit against montgomery county,maryland,the county council,and certain county officials collectively,defendants contending that defendants eliminated part of plaintiffs funding in retaliation for plaintiffs opposition to legislation supported by defendants.
the district court dismissed plaintiffs complaint,declining to inquire into defendants alleged illicit motive behind an otherwise facially valid budgetary enactment,finding that certain individual defendants were protected by legislative immunity,and concluding that because the individual plaintiffs were not county employees,they could not bring an abusive discharge claim under state law.we affirm.
the montgomery county fire and rescue service mcfrs is a combined and integrated operation consisting of both county employees and several lfrds that collectively provide fire,rescue,and emergency medical services.although each lfrd is an independent corporation under maryland law,the county traditionally funds administrative support positions at the lfrds.despite this unique funding relationship,the montgomery county code code provides that these lfrd administrative personnel are not employees of the county.id.employees of local fire and rescue departments who are paid with tax funds are not county employees.quoting code a see also id.nothing in this chapter means that employees of the local fire and rescue departments are county employees,either on a de jure or de facto basis.quoting code c.

prior to the referendum vote but after determining that the ambulance fee legislation would likely fail county executive isiah leggett sent a budget savings plan to the county council on october,to address the potential loss of revenue from bill defeat.the plan called for million in spending cuts and the elimination of publicly funded positions,affecting the mcfrs and a host of other agencies.relevant to this appeal,the plan recommended in part that the county discontinue funding lfrd civilian employees,at a savings of,offsetting the loss of personnel by creating five new administrative positions with the county,id.the plan did not cut funding for administrative positions within mcfrs.
as a result of the general economic slump,leggett submitted another savings plan for in december,proposing additional reductions to close the projected shortfall for fiscal year.the revised plan called for deeper cuts from a range of agencies,but no additional reductions to the lfrds budget.
at a december,county council session to discuss the revised plan,montgomery county fire chief richard bowers spoke in support of the proposal and,according to plaintiffs,promoted the impression that the council choices for funding priorities lay between boots on the ground and administrative personnel that readily could be supplanted by mcfrs operational personnel.id.plaintiffs also allege that one councilmember appeared to blame the lfrds for the ambulance fee defeat and stated that he thought lfrd budgets should be cut even further.another councilmember assailed the proposal for imposing a disproportionate hit on the volunteers.id.internal quotations omitted.ultimately,in a vote,the county council passed the revised budget,authorizing reductions of from the budget.of this figure,or about percent of the savings stemmed from defunding the twenty lfrd administrative positions.
days later,bowers sent a letter to each lfrd stating that as of the end of the year,lfrd employees will no longer be paid by montgomery county,and adding that each lfrd must immediately determine if the lfrd will retain your employee or effect a reduction in force rif.id.thereafter,the lfrds notified the affected employees that they would be conducting a rif and terminating the administrative positions.

after removing the case to federal court,defendants moved to dismiss for summary judgment.finding that it could resolve the motion without considering matters outside of the pleadings,the district court treated defendants filing as a rule b motion to dismiss,and granted it.the district court found that plaintiffs could not challenge the alleged illicit legislative motive behind the county facially valid budget defendants leggett and bowers were shielded by legislative immunity because they were acting in a functionally legislative role on matters related to the county budget and plaintiffs could not bring an abusive discharge claim under maryland law because the individual plaintiffs were not county employees,dual or otherwise.id.plaintiffs timely appealed.

plaintiffs first argue that the district court erred in refusing to inquire into the allegedly unconstitutional motive behind the county budget.the district court decision relied on united states,d,in which the supreme court declined to strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive.
considered a first amendment challenge to a federal statute that penalized the destruction of draft cards.noting that the law did not facially abridge speech,the court rejected an argument that the law was nonetheless unconstitutional because its purpose was to suppress free speech.the court warned that it was a hazardous matter to inquire into legislative motives because w hat motivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it,and the stakes are sufficiently high for us to eschew guesswork.id.at.accordingly,the court decline d to void legislation essentially on the ground that it is unwise legislation which congress had the undoubted power to enact and which could be reenacted in its exact form if the same or another legis
