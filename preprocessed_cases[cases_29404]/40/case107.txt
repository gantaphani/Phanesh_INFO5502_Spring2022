plaintiff angel sanchez,a widower and the executor of his wife estate,sued his wife doctors for medical malpractice.as it turned out,those doctors were federal employees,against whom claims are forever barred unless brought within the limitations period congress allowed under the federal tort claims act ftca,as opposed to the period allowed by massachusetts law for medical malpractice claims.as it also turned out,those doctors status as federal employees was not readily apparent to one who undertook no investigation.sanchez lawyers both made no such investigation and waited more than two years before presenting his claim.based on our prior,controlling holding in a closer case,gonzalez united states,cir,we affirm the district court decision that it had no choice but to dismiss this lawsuit.
background 
the accuracy of the allegation that the doctors were negligent is not yet at issue in this stage of this lawsuit.otherwise,the material facts of this case,especially those relating to the procedural history and posture of the suit,are undisputed.merlonghi united states,cir.
rafaela died on april,two days after she delivered her third child,by caesarean section,at north shore medical center salem hospital nsmc the doctors who treated her at nsmc,kristin cotter and kalinda dennis,worked for lynn community health center lchc,where sanchez had received prenatal care.angel sanchez contends that the treating doctors knew or should have known that his wife had at least one of two potentially dangerous conditions,placenta and placenta accreta and so required special care in the removal of her placenta,and probably a hysterectomy,to minimize the risk of hemorrhage.plaintiff claims that cotter left the hospital after the delivery,leaving sanchez in the care of dennis and that neither doctor performed a hysterectomy until after hemorrhaging began.when the bleeding persisted or resumed,sanchez died.
sanchez retained legal counsel at some point prior to february.counsel waited until april,months after sanchez death to file suit on sanchez behalf against cotter in massachusetts state court.nine days later,they filed an amended complaint,adding dennis as a defendant.unbeknownst to sanchez and his counsel,as employees of lchc both doctors were deemed to be federal employees under the federally supported health centers assistance act of.as we have explained before,see gonzalez united states,cir,and explain again below,tort claims against such doctors for malpractice within the scope of their employment are claims against the united states,barred if not properly pursued within two years of their accrual as opposed to three years under massachusetts law,see.laws ch.
the united states removed the case to federal court,and substituted itself as the defendant.see d.the district court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction after finding it.sanchez appeals.
ii.the federal tort claims act 
federal courts lack jurisdiction over claims against the united states unless the government has waived its sovereign immunity.see,meyer.absent waiver,this immunity applies to tort claims against federal employees for conduct within the scope of their employment.b,merlonghi united states,f d,cir.the ftca is a limited waiver of that immunity,abreu united states,cir,giving federal courts jurisdiction over civil claims against the government for death or injury caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.b.
the ftca limited waiver of immunity comes with an expiration date.specifically,an ftca claim is forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after such claim accrues or unless action is begun within six months after the agency denies the claim.id.b the ftca bar for presenting claims creates a trap for the unwary who fail to recognize its applicability to a specific case and thus fail to act at all within two years of accrual,or who sue in time but fail to first present the claim to the appropriate federal agency.in,congress provided leeway for individuals in the latter category.see federal employees liability reform and tort compensation act of westfall act,stat.under the westfall act,if a tort case is filed in federal court or removed from state court and the united states is substituted as the defendant,see d,the claim will be deemed timely under section b if a the claim would have been timely had it been filed on the date that the underlying civil action was commenced,and b the claim is presented to the appropriate federal agency within sixty days after the dismissal of the civil action.d.congress has not otherwise seen fit to alter the bar in a way material to this suit since doubling its length in.see cong.ch,stat.
it is undisputed that,in this case,cotter and dennis were federal employees at the time of their alleged malpractice,the ftca applies to the claims brought against them now against the united states,and sanchez did not present his claim to any federal agency,or file suit,within two years of his wife death.the district court therefore dismissed this lawsuit,finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear a case against the united states not allowed under the ftca.
iii.analysis 
sanchez argues that under the discovery rule,his claim did not accrue until may,at the earliest.alternatively,he argues that the running of the period was equitably tolled long enough to salvage this case.having rejected such arguments in gonzalez on facts more favorable to a tardy plaintiff,and otherwise finding no basis in the law to reach a contrary result in this case,we must also reject sanchez arguments and affirm the judgment of dismissal.
exhaustion or timeliness 
questions of exhaustion and timeliness pose similar potential bars to this lawsuit.they may both be seen as jurisdictional bars.see,román cancel united states,cir timeliness barrett ex rel.estate of barrett,cir exhaustion acosta marshals,cir same gonzalez united states,cir treating timeliness as jurisdictional in affirming dismissal of an unexhausted claim,and concluding that section d did not apply.alternatively,either or both may be seen as nonjurisdictional,but essential,rules.see,kwai fun wong beebe,cir en banc concluding that section constitutes a rule glade ex rel.lundskow united states,cir exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional and may be waived.in either event,we certainly have some leeway to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case.sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
determining that this lawsuit should have been dismissed without prejudice due to failure to exhaust would be the narrowest approach to disposing of this appeal,because it is undisputed that sanchez has never presented his claim to the department of health and human services.see mcneil united states,celestine mount vernon neighborhood health,cir affirming a dismissal where failure to exhaust barred the claim and would continue to bar it even if any possible unjust effects of disparities between state and federal statutes of limitations were remedied by equitable tolling.sanchez would then presumably present the claim to the agency within sixty days of final entry of the judgment of dismissal the agency would deny the claim as untimely,and sanchez would file suit anew.at that point,the ftca exhaustion requirement arguably would have been satisfied,leaving only the question of timeliness.with the aid of the westfall act,sanchez would then present exactly the same arguments that he now presents,asking us to find that this suit was commenced within two years of when his claim accrued.
little commends such an approach unless it is truly necessary.nor does any party request it,each presumably recognizing that it would add expense and delay without offering any countervailing pragmatic benefit.accordingly,as we did in gonzalez,we find it most appropriate to forgo the question of administrative exhaustion and go straight to the question of timeliness upon which the final disposition of this case will necessarily turn 
b.when did the claim accrue 
the parties agree that our review of the district court ruling under rule b is de novo,as the relevant facts are not disputed.see donahue united states,cir noting that while appellate review of dismissals under rule b sometimes requires deference to the trial court,an appeal involving only the objective reasonableness of the plaintiffs failure to discern at an earlier time both their injury and its likely cause is reviewed de novo.
as noted above,the ftca limitations period expires two years after the claim accrues.b.a cause of action generally accrues when the plaintiff is injured.donahue,f d at.nevertheless,in ftca medical malpractice cases,the discovery rule may delay accrual until a plaintiff knows or reasonably should know both that he is injured and what caused his injury it does not,however,postpone accrual until a potential plaintiff also learns that his injury was negligently inflicted.see see also united states kubrick.the discovery rule incorporates an objective standard.to delay commencement of the running of the statute of limitations,the factual basis for the cause of action must have been inherently unknowable that is,not capable of detection through the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time of injury.gonzalez,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also ramírez carlo united states,cir.once a plaintiff knows of the injury and its probable cause,bears the responsibility of inquiring among the medical and legal communities about whether was wronged and should take legal action.gonzalez,at citing kubrick,at.
it is beyond reasonable dispute that the claim here accrued well before april.sanchez died on april,after giving birth.her injury was then,by its nature,complete and obvious.the cause bleeding was both known and chronicled contemporaneously.the death of a generally healthy woman in childbirth is sufficiently rare in this country today so as to make most reasonable people ask why it happened.sanchez is apparently just such a reasonable person,who wisely and understandably turned to experts in an effort to answer that question,retaining his present law firm sometime prior to february 
the decision to retain malpractice counsel following a mother death in childbirth is a telling sign that a reasonable person would have concluded that reasonable diligence was called for in order to determine whether there was negligence.gonzalez,at claim accrued at the latest when plaintiff retained counsel see also ramírez carlo,at.here,moreover,there was much information available to plaintiff and his counsel to raise further cause for diligent inquiry.the operative and discharge identified the risk factors known before the first surgery placenta previa and possible placenta accreta,explained what steps were taken,and expressly attributed sanchez hemorrhage to dic that is,disseminated intravascular coagulation,a dangerous bleeding condition those reports,combined with the amended surgical pathology report that was completed and available in may,provide evidence that sanchez suffered from both placenta previa and placenta accreta,the risky conditions on which plaintiff complaint was premised.
sanchez notes that the autopsy report was not available until may of.the autopsy report,though,largely confirmed information in or suggested by the already available records it listed as the cause of death postpartum dic of unknown cause,and both placenta previa and placenta accreta as final diagnoses.in short,it revealed no new cause of injury.
sanchez also argues that the claim did not accrue until april,when he received legible copies of the final six pages of medical reports including the handwritten intraoperative reports.he does not adequately explain,however,either what efforts were made to get them sooner,or how their absence precluded him from timely filing his claim.ex rel.ingram united states,cir noting that a cause of action may not accrue until critical medical records are received,but declining to toll the limitations period where the plaintiff did not show that only the missing records held the critical information.he points to no information in these records that is both newly revealed and reasonably necessary to ascertaining the cause of the injury.in sum,in this case arising out of an unexpected nosocomial death,witnessed by identifiable professionals who chronicled the injury,its cause,and their own acts,the claim accrued at the latest by the date prior to february when sanchez retained counsel to investigate a malpractice claim.whether it accrued earlier,we need not decide.
is equitable tolling available under the ftca 
there exists a long running debate over whether the concept of equitable tolling can be used to delay the running of the timeliness requirements that are conditions to the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity.rather than focusing directly on the language and history of the ftca as one might expect,courts have generally approached this question indirectly,asking whether the applicable time limit is jurisdictional and,if so,deeming equitable tolling to be unavailable.see,kwai fun wong beebe,cir arteaga united states,cir see generally john sand gravel united states,discussing the relationship between absolute or jurisdictional deadlines and equitable tolling.most recently,the supreme court has given added credence to this approach.see sebelius auburn reg l med,w ere we to type the governing statute jurisdictional there could be no equitable tolling.citation omitted.
this circuit has previously opined that the ftca timeliness requirements are jurisdictional.see,román cancel united states,cir explaining that c ompliance with the ftca temporal deadlines is both mandatory and jurisdictional.we have also nevertheless assumed that equitable tolling can be applied to those deadlines.see ramírez carlo united states,cir rakes united states,cir.but see mcintyre united states,cir questioning whether equitable tolling applies to ftca.we are not,it seems,the only circuit to have proceeded in this manner.see ex rel.ingram united states,cir.
the observation in sebelius and like cases that labeling these deadlines jurisdictional would preclude application of equitable tolling suggests that something must eventually give in our circuit jurisprudence.the supreme court most recent guidance on what is jurisdictional suggests that we may have erred in presuming that subject matter jurisdiction hinged on compliance with the ftca deadlines for presenting claims.see generally gonzalez thaler,pressing a strict distinction between truly jurisdictional rules and nonjurisdictional rules citations and quotation marks omitted.if we did so err,however,it does not follow that we also erred in presuming that equitable tolling can stay the running of the ftca deadlines.to the contrary,classifying the deadlines as enhances the case for finding equitable tolling to be available.see kwai fun wong,at ftca deadlines are not jurisdictional and equitable tolling is available,overruling marley united states,cir.
to decide the case now before us,we need not definitively unravel this skein.rather,we can approach this case as we approached our decision in gonzalez,giving the plaintiff the benefit of assuming that equity can toll the running of the ftca limitations period if a factual basis for tolling exists.
has plaintiff established a factual basis for invoking equitable tolling 
the trap for the unwary into which sanchez has fallen arises because doctors who work at facilities that may appear to be nongovernmental may nevertheless be deemed federal employees because of the manner in which their employers receive federal funds.see g.the risk of encountering such a trap need be taken seriously.a federal database suggests that,for,there are entities like lchc in massachusetts and in the first circuit.dep t of health and human servs.health res.and servs,search current deemed entities,h ttp.html last visited.understood in this context,gonzalez instructs that lawyers handling medical malpractice cases can not simply assume without investigation that the longer of the two potentially applicable limitations periods controls.instead,they need make inquiry or,perhaps,simply sue within two years of accrual see gonzalez,at noting that n o evidence has been presented that plaintiff or her attorneys made any inquiry whatsoever as to the status of the defendants as federal employees.as the seventh circuit recently explained,
it not asking too much of the medical malpractice bar to be aware of the existence of federally funded health centers that can be sued for malpractice only under the federal tort claims act and if a member of that bar is not aware and misleads a client,the lawyer may be liable for legal malpractice but the government can still invoke the statute of limitations.
arteaga united states,cir citations omitted.
good lawyers,like good doctors,make mistakes.sanchez counsel either were unaware of the ftca deadline,or simply assumed without asking that none of the possible defendants were federal employees.counsel do not say which it was.given what otherwise appears to be a firm dedication to their client case,one suspects it was the former.in any event,neither inaction born of ignorance nor recklessness in the face of a known risk could provide a basis for establishing diligence given the holding in gonzalez.and due diligence is a sine qua non for equitable tolling.donahue united states,cir.
sanchez also argues that any inquiry regarding the employment status of the doctors would have been unavailing.he contends that lchc never informed him of its federal status,that his wife records did not reveal that the doctors were federal employees,and that the department of health and human services relied on internal records,not publicly available information,to certify the status of lchc and the doctors for litigation purposes.the government contends that,if plaintiff had used it,a website and hotline for the department of health and human services,health resources and services administration would have adequately informed him that lchc and its employees were federally funded and might be covered by the ftca.as sanchez notes,however,in and,that website would not have informed him that the specific doctors who treated his wife were deemed to be federal employees,and not every clinic that receives federal funds or was listed on that website was necessarily covered by section.in addition,we observe that the information regarding ftca coverage and the hotline was hardly conspicuous on the site.
even so,the information on the website,had counsel availed themselves of it,would certainly have put them on at least heightened inquiry notice regarding the treating doctors status.moreover,a lexis or westlaw search for lynn community health center would have revealed harrison united states,cir,a ftca medical malpractice case against another of lchc doctors.simply put,no reasonably diligent lawyer who checked any of these sources of information would have let two years pass without doing much more.
sanchez has also offered no evidence that a phone call or letter to lchc inquiring about its or its doctors status would have been ignored,or would have generated a misleading response.we have examined the record for any indication that the doctors,lchc,or the government gave plaintiff any false information or delayed unduly in answering important requests so as to thwart,intentionally or otherwise,efforts by plaintiff to ascertain whether this suit belonged in federal court.we have found none.
we agree that the federal government could do more to publicize or alleviate the statute of limitations trap created by section.be that as it may,the absence of due diligence here is no less patent,and likely more so,than in gonzalez.as we noted above,and as was not the case in gonzalez,a doctor from lchc had already been identified as a federal employee in an ftca suit.both gonzalez and harrison were decided in,well before the events in question here.if,on these facts,we were to find the statutory deadlines tolled,then it would follow that gonzalez was wrong.
understandably,finding gonzalez to be wrongly decided is precisely what plaintiff invites us to do.departing from circuit precedent,however,can be justified only by supervening authority such as a ruling of the supreme court or this court en banc,muskat united states,cir,or in those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision,although not directly controlling,nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel,in light of fresh developments,would change its collective mind.united states pires,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.the latter justification is narrowly construed,igartúa united states,cir,and imposes an exacting standard,sánchez ex rel.united states,cir see also san juan cable llc,cir noting that the contrary conclusion of another circuit court does not divest a panel opinion of its customary stare decisis effect within the circuit.
to suggest that the development of the law in other circuits,had it been known to the gonzalez panel,would have caused it to change its collective mind,sanchez relies on cases from two other circuits santos ex rel.beato united states,cir,and valdez ex rel.donely united states,cir.plaintiff is correct that these and subsequent cases from those two circuits reject the proposition that by failing to ask specifically about possible federal employment,counsel necessarily fail the due diligence test.neither circuit,however,blesses complete inaction.in santos,for example,counsel actually ran a public records search on the relevant doctors employer.santos,at.in phillips generations family health,cir,the second circuit recently distinguished a case in which counsel did literally nothing to investigate the defendant status and adopted an approach to equitable tolling that incorporates,among other factors,the prior knowledge and experience of counsel.id.at.that approach runs the risk of effectively holding better,more knowledgeable practitioners to a higher standard of care.this seems a bit odd,but we need not consider it further because sanchez counsel offers no significant evidence of their medical malpractice experience.more importantly,whether one views the approaches taken by those two circuits as appropriate or not,they hardly paint a picture of a rush to the exit so as to allow us to overrule our own controlling precedent here.
statutes of limitations balance a desire to decide claims on their merits against a desire to provide repose and avoid the unfairness of litigating stale claims encumbered by faded memories.under federal law,congress strikes the chosen balance,leaving perhaps some room for equitable dispensation where due diligence could not have saved a claim.here,with no good explanation for the complete failure to try to ascertain which limitations period applied,no pertinent precedent allows the individual dispensation requested.we note,however,that while sanchez has thus lost his claim against his wife doctors,he may not have yet lost altogether his chance to recover full compensation for that loss from any professionals responsible for the effects of the judgment in this case.
