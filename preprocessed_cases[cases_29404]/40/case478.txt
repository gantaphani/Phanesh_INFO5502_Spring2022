plaintiffs and appellants are former temporary employees of the municipality of aguada,puerto rico.each held a contract stating that the term of employment was effective through june,but also stating that the employment was by way of a particular financial grant a law grant,explained further below that the municipality had received from the commonwealth.funding under that grant was exhausted on december,and the municipality,under a new mayor,terminated plaintiffs contracts one month later on the basis of lack of law funding.
plaintiffs sued the municipality and individual municipal officers in their official and personal capacities under on two federal claims and related state claims.they alleged that the termination of their contracts before the expiration dates,without a pretermination hearing,violated their procedural due process rights under the constitution.they also alleged that their contracts were terminated because they belonged to a different political party,the new progressive party npp,than the newly elected popular democratic party pdp mayor of the municipality in violation of the first amendment.plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief,back pay,front pay,economic and punitive damages,pre and interest,and other relief.
at trial on june,after the close of plaintiffs evidence,the district court granted judgment under rule,for defendants on the procedural due process claim.the court held that the plaintiffs had no property interest in further employment inasmuch as the program in which they were employed depended upon receipt of the law funding from the commonwealth which had expired on december.the jury considered the first amendment claim and returned a verdict for defendants.
on appeal,the plaintiffs challenge both the rule procedural due process ruling and the denial of a motion for mistrial based on a nearly delay in the middle of the trial proceedings.they do not challenge the jury verdict.as to the denial of the motion for mistrial,we find no abuse of discretion and affirm.as to the procedural due process claim,however,we vacate and remand for further consideration.
the commonwealth established the law program more than years ago.under the program,see laws ann.tit,puerto rico subsidize s locally managed programs to ameliorate unemployment.gomez rivera rodriguez,cir.municipalities do not have an automatic entitlement to law grants a municipality must submit a proposal describing how it will use the money such proposals must be approved by the commonwealth department of labor and human resources dlhr.id.once a grant is approved,the commonwealth and the municipality sign a contract specifying how much money the municipality will receive,over what term,and how many jobs it will subsidize.the various law contracts between the municipality of aguada and the dlhr contained standard clauses stating that the municipality commit ted itself to create the number of jobs specified,and that u nder no circumstances will it be construed that people hired by virtue of the law contract are or act as employees of the dlhr.
on july,a new law agreement the law contract between the municipality and the dlhr took effect.under the contract provisions,the dlhr awarded the municipality to pay the salaries and benefits of the employees through december.the law contract required the municipality to keep the law funds separate from other municipal funds.
the plaintiffs are among the workers hired by the municipality in connection with this law grant.between june and september,each of the plaintiffs received letters the hiring letters signed by julio césar román,appointing them to various municipal jobs,including carpentry and labor positions.the stated starting dates for these jobs ranged from july to september.the stated termination date for each job was the same june.
mayor román was a member of the npp,as is each of the plaintiffs.it is noteworthy that the mayor letter used an employment date for the plaintiffs through june,despite the fact the law funding lasted only through december,and that he did so in the face of an upcoming municipal election in which control of the municipal government might switch to the opposing political party.defendants rely on this to argue that the mayor acted ultra vires in using a termination date of june.
the hiring letters signed by mayor román varied only slightly in their terms.a typical letter,such as the one sent to plaintiff josé méndez valle,stated 
allow me by these means to appoint you to hold the post of laborer by way of the labor department proposal for this municipal administration.
the same shall be effective september,until june.you shall earn a monthly salary of.
as of the autumn of,then,the plaintiffs were all employed by the municipality and receiving salaries paid out of law funds.on november,elections were held in aguada,and a new mayor,defendant miguel of the pdp,was elected.the plaintiffs had supported the new mayor opponent in the mayoral race 
mayor was sworn into office on january.by this time,the funding provided by the law contract had expired.the municipality nonetheless continued plaintiffs employment through the month of january,paying their salaries out of municipal funds.on january,however,mayor sent letters to the plaintiffs the firing letters informing them that the law funds had expired a month earlier and that their jobs were therefore being terminated.a typical firing letter,this one addressed to plaintiff edwin acevedo acevedo,read as follows 
i hereby inform you that your work contract through the proposal of the department of labor and human resources law expired on december.the previous administration failed in not informing you that your contract expired and that your functions ceased on the aforementioned date.
we do not have the funds that the department of labor and human resources provided for these contracts.that is why we have to dispense with your services.we regret the inconveniences this may cause you.
all of the plaintiffs jobs were terminated on january none of the plaintiffs were granted a hearing,although each had notice via the firing letters that the stated reason for termination was the expiration of law funding.
on february,less than two weeks later,the municipality and the dlhr entered into a new law contract,which provided funding for forty positions from february through june.none of the plaintiffs were offered any of the jobs created by these funds,despite the fact that defendant glenda,the new municipal human resources director appointed by mayor,had promised them they would be recalled when new law funds were procured.
the plaintiffs filed suit on april,against the municipality,mayor,and human resources director in response to plaintiffs political discrimination claim,defendants countered that the terminations had nothing to do with political animus,but were instead inevitable and proper given the cessation of law funding.and as to the procedural due process claim,defendants argued that mayor román had had no authority to offer the plaintiffs contracts that outlasted the law funding thus the contracts were void as to a june termination date,and no hearing was required under the due process clause 
jury trial began on march.on april,plaintiffs rested.defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to.a as to the political discrimination and procedural due process claims.on june,during an extended hiatus in the trial discussed further below,the district court entered judgment for the defendants on the procedural due process claim but allowed the political discrimination claim to proceed.trial resumed on july on the plaintiffs remaining claims and the jury rejected the political discrimination claim on july 
denial of mistrial based on the trial delay 
plaintiffs argue the district court erred in not granting their motion for mistrial.
on april,the day the plaintiffs rested,the district court authorized the jury forewoman to take a previously scheduled vacation from april through april and halted the trial pending her return.none of the parties objected to this continuance,despite having had the chance to do so both on april and at sidebar on april.
on april,the district court announced a date for resumption of the trial,noting that it had two additional trials scheduled for may and that another juror had told the court he would be away from may to june.the district court decided that the trial would not reconvene until june.again,there were no objections.
on june,after the trial had already been on hold for months and only a week before it was to resume,plaintiffs raised their first objection to the delay,moving for a mistrial the district court rejected the motion three days later.in a june explanatory order,the court stated that 
calendar exigencies and the unopposed absence of two jurors in this case were the only reasons for the interruption the adjournment was compelled under the circumstances since the court could neither vacate the trial settings in the other cases nor did the plaintiffs in this case oppose the absence of the two jurors who took annual leave.
review of denial of a motion for mistrial is for abuse of discretion.caribbean forms,cir.we will not reverse if there is no showing of prejudice.see,ferrara dimercurio paul mercury ins,cir clemente mgmt,cir finding no abuse of discretion in part because appellant did not demonstrate actual prejudice.plaintiffs argue that prejudice may be presumed from a protracted delay after the close of plaintiffs evidence.they cite supporting case law to this effect from other courts.see young simon,merritt sav.loan,cir citron aro,cir.but whether prejudice may be presumed or not is not the point.
more important here is that plaintiffs did not offer any objection when consulted about the time off requested by the two jurors.as the district court pointed out in denying the mistrial request,plaintiffs had multiple opportunities to object to the initial hiatus,and they did not do so.to the contrary,they explicitly told the district court they had no objection.plaintiffs argue that their lack of objection may have stemmed from their concern that the vacationing juror could have become indisposed with plaintiffs for ruining her leisure time.if that were so,then plaintiffs made a tactical choice with which they must live.it may not be so the record makes clear that the district court offered plaintiffs the chance to object at sidebar,out of the jury presence,and they declined.this was still a tactical choice.as to the second portion of the continuance,the plaintiffs did not object until june,one week before trial was scheduled to resume.
plaintiffs did too little,too late.see clemente,at refusing to find an abuse of discretion in the district court denial of a mistrial where appellant had not preserved her rights id.at noting that the time to complain is at the outset and that plaintiff did not make a peep when the district court took the action which plaintiff later said warranted a mistrial.the cases plaintiffs rely on do not help them in the face of their failure to object.see young simon,at ordering a new trial and repeatedly emphasizing that counsel timely and persistently objected to the delay when it was proposed,when it occurred,and after the trial ended citron,at ordering a new trial despite a lack of objection to the delay,but emphasizing that the trial judge had told counsel that he was not going to cancel a planned trip for this case or any other case,thus making clear in advance that objection would be futile.the district court did not abuse its discretion.
rule motion re procedural due process 
the district court grant of defendants rule a motion as to the procedural due process claim is subject to de novo review.burton town of littleton,cir.we review the evidence,taking all inferences in favor of plaintiffs,and ask whether a reasonable jury could have found defendants liable based on the evidence presented.id.
in a due process claim stemming from the termination of employment,a public employee must first demonstrate that he has a reasonable expectation,arising out of a statute,policy,rule,or contract,that he will continue to be employed.wojcik.state lottery comm n,cir.we determine whether such a property interest exists by reference to state law.bishop wood,d.
while state law may create property interests,it is a separate question of federal law whether those interests rise to the level of a legitimate claim of entitlement sufficient to trigger procedural due process protections.see memphis light,gas water div.craft,d although the underlying substantive interest is created by an independent source such as state law,federal constitutional law determines whether an interest rises to the level of a legitimate claim of entitlement protected by the due process clause.quoting bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.
if the employee has such a state property interest,and that property interest rises to the level of a legitimate claim of entitlement,then the employer can not dismiss the employee without affording him due process of law.see,gomez rivera rodriguez,cir.in the public employment context,the required process typically includes some kind of hearing and some pretermination opportunity to respond.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.
under our case law a contract of employment with a puerto rico government body usually suffices to show a property interest sufficient under commonwealth law.see,caro,cir.plaintiffs here argue that they had approximately contracts of employment,that those contracts had not yet expired,and therefore that defendants were required to give them hearings.
the district court disagreed,finding that plaintiffs had no property interest in their employment past december,the day law funding expired.as we understand the ruling,the district court determined that either the law contract or municipal law required that each plaintiff hiring contract be read to include the implicit condition that the term of employment was conditioned on the municipality receipt of law funding.
the district court stated reasoning was as follows.the former mayor,it held,lacked authority under the law contract then in effect between the municipality and the dlhr to extend the appointments beyond the term of funding specifically set forth in the award under law.in response to the plaintiffs argument that the former mayor could have extended plaintiffs appointments and paid them using municipal funds,the district court stated that it need not delve into that possibility because in making the appointments the former mayor made sole and express reference to the law proposal as the mechanism which made them possible.the court relied on the hiring letters and their references to appointments by way of the law funding agreement.the court concluded 
t he former mayor clearly acted ultra vires in making appointments to law posts for terms that exceeded the duration of the law grant,and in so doing failed to extend plaintiffs property interest in continued employment in their positions beyond the term established in the law contract.
the court correctly referred to precedent to the effect that illegally obtained public employment confers no property interest on the employee,see,cir en banc,and written assurances in a letter of engagement are insufficient to contravene a comprehensive network of statutory and regulatory directives governing the terms of employment,cir,overruled on other grounds by educadores puertorriqueños en accion hernández,cir.
on appeal,plaintiffs argue that the due process interest was created by the hiring letters,which themselves do not explicitly limit the terms of the appointments to the limits on law funding.they say the mayor had authority to enter into a contract of a term of one year legally,without limits under law,by providing additional funding from the municipal budget.
we understand the district court to have ruled as a matter of law that law,by its terms,prohibits the extension of law jobs using municipal funds.but the law itself contains no such prohibition.indeed,the law speaks only in general terms it states that funds disbursed thereunder shall be used to promote,inter alia,employment opportunities in occupations with future possibilities,jobs that are in demand in the present mar
