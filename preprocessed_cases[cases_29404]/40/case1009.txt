opinion of the court 
in pursuit of his stated goal of transforming the islamic republic of iran into a global chemical powerhouse,ali amirnazmi,a chemical engineer,marketed a dynamic software program to iranian actors and entered into agreements with various iranian entities in which he pledged to provide technology to facilitate the construction of multiple chemical plants.following a jury trial,amirnazmi was convicted on ten charges four counts stemming from violations of the international emergency economic powers act ieepa,three counts of making false statements,and three counts of bank fraud.amirnazmi moved both for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial.the district court denied both motions and sentenced him to a prison term.we will affirm.
amirnazmi,a dual citizen of the united states and iran,founded a company called trantech consultants,in.billed as a business geared toward providing an innovative approach to strategic decision making for the chemical process industries,trantech marketed its primary product a computer software program called chemplan as an exclusive,fully integrated,worldwide database designed to allow chemical companies to assess product viability and cost based on a number of variables.chemplan had two principal functions.as a database that illuminated how chemical reactions could be disaggregated into their component parts,it included both public information and proprietary data derived from amirnazmi expert analysis of the various processes and as a dynamic planning tool,chemplan enabled end users to determine individualized production costs and the feasibility of embarking on prospective projects by allowing them to change the input variables in order to generate what if scenarios accounting for market fluctuations.these features made chemplan attractive to major manufacturers such as the dow chemical company,lyondellbasell industries,and rohm and haas company.
aiming to facilitate iran transformation into an independent chemical powerhouse,and seeking to spur a flow of iranian scientists back to iran where he would ultimately join them to impart his expertise amirnazmi began,in the mid,to explore business partnerships with iranian entities.first,he initiated efforts to sell chemplan to the national petrochemical company of iran npc.in august,trantech and npc executed a license agreement whereby npc agreed to purchase a subscription to chemplan for.amirnazmi directed npc to wire payment to a european bank account,and he traveled to iran to demonstrate the product functionality to npc officials.in,npc purchased a software update for.in,npc enlisted amirnazmi assistance in its quest to obtain an software package called boxscore,a suite of programs manufactured in the united states and consequently unavailable to iranian entities affected by trade sanctions.amirnazmi procured the software,sent it to an intermediary in germany,and charged npc for his efforts.
amirnazmi met in person with npc personnel at a international petrochemical conference held in iran.thereafter,he sent npc director of planning and development a letter in which he encouraged npc to renew its chemplan subscription and proposed three options including the formation of a joint venture for tailoring chemplan to npc unique needs.amirnazmi attended the same conference in and again attempted to solicit npc interest in a customized chemplan package by sending an npc contact several renewed proposals along with subscription order forms.
in,amirnazmi endeavored to engage an iranian company to handle its advertising and promotional efforts.in connection with this deal,amirnazmi attempted to transfer to an iranian bank account.the bank declined to complete the transaction,and the treasury department office of foreign assets control ofac requested from amirnazmi a detailed explanation for this attempted transfer.amirnazmi responded that he had not known such a transaction was prohibited by the sanctions then in place against iran 
after indicating he was willing to conduct business with iran,amirnazmi was granted a private audience with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad at an event in new york city in september.at this meeting and in subsequent correspondence,amirnazmi expressed his desire to transfer chemplan technical and economic knowledge to iran and sought president ahmadinejad assistance in helping him return to iran so that he might serve the country in his field of expertise.in a january letter,amirnazmi beseeched president ahmadinejad to arrange an meeting in tehran so that he might unveil his plan to help iran,and he decried the united states cruel and tyran nical treatment of the iranian people 
having brought himself to president ahmadinejad attention,amirnazmi efforts to improve iran chemical capacities began to show results.in december,amirnazmi on behalf of trantech signed a memorandum of understanding with the institute for business analysis and consultancy ibaco,an iranian company,regarding the provision of technology for a proposed polyvinyl butyral chemical plant to be constructed in iran.in may,amirnazmi entered into a separate confidentiality agreement with ibaco in which he agreed to have trantech provide software licensing,equipment and chemicals in connection with the construction of a glacial acrylic acid and super absorbent polymer plant in iran.
amirnazmi and npc rekindled their working partnership in,entering into a new licensing agreement for the chemplan software.during the negotiations leading up to this agreement,amirnazmi represented that the chemplan licensing agreement was still valid.and in june,amirnazmi entered into a memorandum of understanding with the nokhbegan institute of technology development nitd,an iranian company,to create a joint venture to provide software,database and technology transfer services to clients in the chemical process industry.under the agreement,amirnazmi pledged to have trantech transfer the chemplan system to a company in iran in which trantech would have been the majority shareholder.
the memorandum of understanding with nitd expired by its own terms after two months.the licensing agreement with npc,which was signed by the counterparties and which fixed the subscription fee at,was to become effective upon installation of chemplan on npc hardware.amirnazmi twice met with ibaco officials in to negotiate the terms of a formal contract covering the polyvinyl butyral plant,but the resulting technology transfer and construction agreement was never signed by the parties.and the ibaco confidentiality agreement concerning the super absorbent polymer plant contemplated further elucidation within the framework of a formal contract drafted upon finalizing negotiation s with investors.
amirnazmi drew the attention of customs and border protection by traveling to iran in and twice more in.customs agents interviewed amirnazmi upon his return to the united states in both april and june of.upon questioning,he claimed both trips were to visit his elderly mother and that the latter trip also permitted him to attend a petroleum conference.although amirnazmi repeatedly disavowed any commercial purpose for his travels,the presence of ostensibly possessions cast doubt on the credibility of his responses.in april he claimed the sundry business cards and documents found in his briefcase were personal effects he had not made use of on his trip.in june,confronted by customs officials with computer files and hard copy documents detailing plans to build chemical plants in iran,he declined to offer an explanation.
on june,the day after his second encounter with customs officials,amirnazmi contacted the ofac compliance hotline to inquire in general about restrictions on commercial activity with iran.without either delving into the specifics of how chemplan operated or mentioning his prior business dealings with iranian companies,he asked whether making public documents available on a website would fall within the exemption to ieepa and whether exporting an unidentified good would theoretically require dispensation in the form of a license issued by ofac.
two days after this telephone conversation,amirnazmi was questioned by agents from the internal revenue service and the federal bureau of investigation.he acknowledged meeting president ahmadinejad but denied having conducted business on either of his trips to iran,and he claimed his only two financial transactions with iran had been the disallowed wire transfers much earlier in the decade.the agents subsequently obtained a search warrant for amirnazmi business.despite amirnazmi protestations that none of the documents named in the warrant were located on the premises,the authorities seized numerous physical documents and the hard drive from his computer,which also contained pertinent documents.upon further interrogation,amirnazmi conceded he had business relations with npc both in and in the more recent past,and he acknowledged having met with iranian state officials during his trips abroad.
on july,the government filed a indictment against amirnazmi in the eastern district of pennsylvania charging him with one count of conspiracy to violate ieepa,in violation of four substantive counts of violating ieepa,in violation of,and of aiding and abetting the same,in violation of one count of conspiracy to act as an illegal agent of a foreign government,in violation of the foreign agents registration act fara and in violation of one substantive count of acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government,in violation of,and of aiding and abetting the same,in violation of and three counts of making false statements to government officials,in violation of.on october,the government filed a superseding indictment,charging amirnazmi with three additional counts of bank fraud,in violation of,and supplementing the original indictment with further factual allegations.
prior to trial,amirnazmi filed a motion to dismiss in which he alleged ieepa regulations are the product of an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the executive and portions of the superseding indictment referencing conduct that occurred more than five years prior to the indictment should be barred by the statute of limitations.the court denied the motion,concluding ieepa does not violate the nondelegation doctrine and that amirnazmi actions prior to were part of a continuing course of conduct that extended into the limitations period and contributed to the charged conspiracy.see united states amirnazmi,cr,dist.lexis,
the jury convicted amirnazmi on all but one of the ieepa counts and on all of the false statement and bank fraud counts amirnazmi was acquitted of the fara violations charged in counts six and seven.amirnazmi moved for a judgment of acquittal under.on the ieepa counts,the false statement counts and one of the bank fraud counts.he reiterated his argument that ieepa unconstitutionally delegates to the executive authority to criminalize commercial conduct,and he added an argument that the accompanying ofac regulations under which he was convicted are unconstitutionally vague.he also argued the evidence was insufficient to prove his conduct did not fall within ieepa exemption and that the government failed to prove ieepa required him to obtain a license to engage in his activities.the court denied amirnazmi motion in its entirety.it rested on its previous ruling concerning the nondelegation doctrine,concluded that the ieepa regulations are not unconstitutionally vague,and determined the government had produced sufficient evidence to sustain each conviction.see united states amirnazmi,cr,dist.lexis.
amirnazmi also moved for a new trial under.amirnazmi reiterated his claims that the prison tapes were improperly obtained and should not have been admitted and that evidence of his conduct prior to should have been barred by the statute of limitations.the court denied this motion,resting on its previous ruling with respect to the tapes and concluding amirnazmi pre actions fell within the scope of his conspiracy to bring his technical wherewithal,especially the chemplan system,back to iran for the benefit of that country.see united states amirnazmi,d.
as noted,the district court sentenced amirnazmi to a month term of imprisonment followed by five years supervised release.amirnazmi timely appealed 
on appeal,amirnazmi principally challenges the constitutionality of ieepa and the accompanying ofac regulations.we will first address the constitutionality of the statute itself,which amirnazmi challenges on two fronts.first,he argues that congress when delegating the authority to create criminal offenses must articulate the standards by which executive conduct will be governed with greater precision than is required in the context of delegations of civil authority.ieepa,amirnazmi contends,lacks the requisite specificity.second,he claims congress failure to comply with its statutory responsibility to oversee the implementation of the iranian sanctions regime left the executive discretion wholly unchecked.because ieepa reserves for congress the final word in determining trade policy during peacetime emergencies,amirnazmi alleges,congress abdication of its oversight role rendered the delegation unconstitutional 
as the source of statutory authority for the executive exercise of emergency economic powers in response to peacetime crises,ieepa traces its provenance to b of the trading with the enemy act of,stat,as amended,twea.dames moore regan,d.twea endowed the president with sweeping powers to regulate international trade in times of war or national emergency,but it lacked a countervailing mechanism to divest the president of such authority once the emergency had ebbed.because presidents had displayed a tendency to allow emergency declarations to linger even after the circumstances or tensions that had led to the declaration could no longer be said to pose a threat of emergency proportion to the nation,some expressed concern that twea effectively served as a ratchet to enhance greatly the president discretionary authority over foreign policy.regan wald,d blackmun,dissenting.
in an effort to address twea evolution into a flexible instrument of foreign policy in nonemergency situations,id.at,congress amended b in,restricting the executive ability to act under that statute strictly to times of war,tit.i,stat,striking or during any other period of national emergency declared by the president from the text of b.contemporaneously,congress enacted the international emergency economic powers act to serve as the locus of executive economic authority during situations.see id.at tit.ii,stat.at codified at et.although the powers conferred in ieepa closely mirror those granted in its progenitor,ieepa removed certain tools from the president peacetime kit and,significantly for our purposes,ieepa subjected the president authority to a host of procedural limitations designed to ensure congress would retain its essential legislative superiority in the formulation of sanctions regimes erected under the act delegation of emergency power 
the predicate for an exercise of executive authority under ieepa is the declaration of a national emergency under the national emergencies act nea.see,b.under ieepa,the emergency must stem from an unusual and extraordinary threat,which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the united states,to the national security,foreign policy,or economy of the united states.id.a.after declaring such an emergency,the president may,through regulations instructions,licenses,or otherwise,

why the president believes those circumstances constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat,which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the united states,to the national security,foreign policy,or economy of the united states 
the authorities to be exercised and the actions to be taken in the exercise of those authorities to deal with those circumstances 
why the president believes such actions are necessary to deal with those circumstances and

subject to limited exemptions and to licenses issued by ofac,the itr prohibits,in part,the exportation,reexportation,sale,or supply,directly or indirectly,from the united states,or by a united states person,wherever located,of any goods,technology,or services to iran or the government of iran,and any new investment by a united states person in iran or in property including entities owned or controlled by the government of iran,id.see also id.a generally prohibiting any transaction or dealing in or related to g oods,technology,or services for exportation,reexportation,sale or supply,directly or indirectly,to iran or the government of iran the regulations also incorporate the statutory exemption permitting the exportation of informational materials.id.c.critically,this exemption does not apply to informational materials not fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions,or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of informational materials.id.
the maxim that congress may not delegate legislative power to the president is universally recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the constitution.field clark.nevertheless,the supreme court has invoked the unconstitutional delegation doctrine which derives its constitutional underpinning from article i vesting of all legislative powers with to strike down a law only twice in its history.see panama ref.ryan.invalidating delegation under section c of the national industrial recovery act permitting the president to prohibit the interstate transportation of petroleum goods schechter poultry united states.striking down section of the same act,which authorized trade and industrial associations to propose codes of fair competition that would become legally binding if approved by the president.the court jurisprudence has been animated by a practical understanding that in our increasingly complex society,replete with ever changing and more technical problems,congress simply can not do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.mistretta united states,d.accordingly,in assessing a permissible delegation,the court has decreed it will be constitutionally sufficient if congress clearly delineates the general policy,the public agency which is to apply it,and the boundaries of this delegated authority.id.at quoting am.power light sec.
congress ability to endow a coordinate branch of government with a measure of discretion is circumscribed by the requirement that it must lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to exercise the delegated authority is directed to conform.hampton,united states.whereas congress must itself elucidate the standards of legal obligation in order to fulfill its essential legislative function,it may devolve to selected instrumentalities responsibility for the making of subordinate rules within prescribed limits and the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the legislature is to apply.schechter poultry,at.because no one standard can account for the range of contexts in which congress legislates,the degree of agency discretion that is acceptable varies according to the scope of the power congressionally conferred.whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.
the supreme court has upheld congress delegation to the president of civil authority to nullify certain attachments and transfers of assets under ieepa.dames moore,at.but amirnazmi contends ieepa delegation of authority to define criminal conduct is inherently more suspect and that,consequently,only a lesser degree of executive discretion is constitutionally permissible in this context.the court has expressly refrained from deciding whether congress must provide stricter guidance than a mere intelligible principle when authorizing the executive to promulgate regulations that contemplate criminal sanctions.touby united states,d.after concluding the contested delegation would pass constitutional muster even under a heightened standard,the court refrained from resolving the petitioner argument that criminal regulations promulgated under congressional delegations of authority should be subject to more searching scrutiny on account of the heightened risk to individual liberty they pose.id.at 
two of our sister circuits have analyzed ieepa delegation of authority to criminalize conduct in light of touby and have concluded the act withstands constitutional scrutiny.in united states arch trading,cir,the fourth circuit discerned constraining factors in ieepa comparable to those found sufficient in touby and concluded the president powers are explicitly defined and circumscribed.and in united states dhafir,cir,the second circuit adopted the fourth circuit logic,concluding ieepa would satisfy even a heightened standard because the authorities delegated are defined and limited.
we too conclude that ieepa meaningfully constrains the president discretion.see touby,at.under the controlled substance act provision examined in touby,the attorney general could not temporarily schedule a drug without first finding that doing so would be necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety.id.similarly,to activate ieepa,the president must find that an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,foreign policy,or economy of the united states originating on foreign soil has reached national emergency proportions.see.in touby,the court found the attorney general was constrained by the requirement that he abide by several of the more rigorous features of the permanent scheduling process designating illegal drugs.at.likewise,ieepa prohibits the president from regulating certain exempt transactions,b,from prosecuting unwitting violators or holding liable those who act in good faith reliance on the statute and regulations,id.c,a,and from obviating congress role as ultimate arbiter of emergency trade policy,see id.b,see also mistretta,at explaining congress must clearly delineate the general policy and the boundaries of this delegated authority.
in effecting the shift of peacetime authority from twea to ieepa,congress placed several procedural restrictions on the president exercise of the powers,including congressional consultation,review,and termination.regan,at blackmun,dissenting.in so doing,congress reaffirmed its essential legislative function,see schechter poultry,u.at,and struck a careful balance between affording the president a degree of authority to address the exigencies of national emergencies and restraining his ability to perpetuate emergency situations indefinitely by creating more opportunities for congressional input,panama ref,at congress has declared no policy,has established no standard,has laid down no rule therefore,ieepa meets the same standard of constraint outlined in touby that is,ieepa meaningfully constrains the executive discretion.accordingly,it is unnecessary for us to address the unsettled question of whether something more demanding than an intelligible principle is necessitated within the context of delegating authority to define criminal conduct.
second,amirnazmi claims congress has violated fundamental precepts by neglecting its statutory responsibility to monitor the implementation of the iranian sanctions regime established under ieepa.in so doing,amirnazmi claims,the legislature has allowed the president to arrogate virtually unlimited power over foreign trade,thereby fomenting a serious threat to public liberty that necessitates judicial intervention.this allegation implicates interrelated issues of foreign policy,congressional authorization,and statutorily mandated oversight.because these considerations are intertwined,we consider them in concert.
the linchpin of amirnazmi claim is b,which reads not later than six months after a national emergency is declared,and not later than the end of each period thereafter that such emergency continues,each house of congress shall meet to consider a vote on a joint resolution to determine whether that emergency shall be terminated.in dhafir,the second circuit noted in passing that congress failure to fulfill its oversight responsibilities might conceivably raise complicated and sensitive issues concerning separation of powers but declined to expound in light of an inadequate factual record.at.given the conventional wisdom that the shift in authority from twea to ieepa was inspired in part by a prevailing sentiment that congress role in devising emergency trade policy warranted strengthening,see supra section,its failure to police executive conduct would appear counterintuitive 
as a threshold matter,we must determine whether a national emergency properly declared under nea terminates automatically when congress fails to meet in conformance with the language of b.in beacon products reagan,cir,the first circuit answered that question in the negative.the court reasoned that the disparity between d,which explicitly provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency should the president fail to extend it,and b,which is devoid of a parallel congressional provision,suggests congress deliberately withheld automatic termination as a remedy for violation of the periodic meeting clause.id.at.next,the court noted congress eliminated a sunset provision from an earlier draft of nea,reserving for itself the burden of acting affirmatively by substituting in that provision place the requirement that it pass a resolution to end an emergency.id.referencing a.the court then concluded congress likely intended to give those who want to end the emergency the chance to force a vote on the issue,rather than to require those who do not want to end the emergency to force congressional action to prevent automatic termination.id.at.we agree that congress did not effectively terminate the emergency against iran simply by virtue of its failure to hold the periodic meetings addressed in b.
amirnazmi contends beacon products should not control our analysis because the issue here is not merely one of statutory interpretation but instead one that requires us to consider whether congress failure to regularly convene to evaluate the desirability of a continued emergency trade regime violates the program contemplated by ieepa.that is,amirnazmi would have us hold that congress assumption of a silent partner role transforms a limited delegation into a blank check that confers upon the executive unbridled power to create trade policy.in dames moore,the court wrote that ieepa constitutes specific congressional authorization to the president to take certain emergency measures.at.following amirnazmi logic,the issue would then become whether protracted inaction vitiates this authorization.if this were the case,we would likely consider whether,after express authorization has ostensibly lapsed,the president continued criminalization of certain commercial conduct has either been implicitly countenanced or whether he is in fact acting pursuant to some form of inherent authority.
the constitutionality of ieepa delegation of criminal authority does not rest on congress affirmatively renewing its approval of each ongoing emergency at regular intervals.equating inaction with a withdrawal of authorization would be particularly improper with a statute that concerns foreign affairs,a sphere in which delegation is afforded even broader deference.dhafir,at.congress in giving the executive authority over matters of foreign affairs must of necessity paint with a brush broader than that it customarily wields in domestic areas.zemel rusk,d see also veterans reservists for peace in vietnam reg.comm r of customs,cir ordinarily,when dealing with matters of foreign relations,congress may lawfully delegate to the president broader discretion than would be permissible with regard to domestic affairs.united states curtiss wright exp.upholding congress ability to delegate the power to prohibit the sale of arms to certain countries designated by the president and explaining that it was important to bear in mind that we are here dealing not alone with an authority vested in the president by an exertion of legislative power,but with such an authority plus the very delicate,plenary and exclusive power of the president as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.mindful of the heightened deference accorded the executive in this field,we decline to interpret the legislative grant of authority parsimoniously.congress may act to terminate the national emergency nea does not necessarily compel congress to take affirmative steps to prolong the president charted course.see beacon,at.
congress failure to satisfy the periodic meeting requirements of b does not ineluctably lead to a conclusion that the president continued prosecution of trade sanctions under ieepa has ceased to be pursuant to an express or implied authorization.see youngstown sheet tube sawyer.jackson,concurring setting forth the familiar tripartite framework for evaluating executive action and explaining the president power is at its maximum when he acts according to congressional directive.in haig agee,d,the court inferred congressional approval of a longstanding and officially promulgated executive policy from both inaction and statutory developments that left completely untouched the broad authority granted in the earlier act.id.quoting zemel,at.under agee,we must generally defer to a consistent administrative construction of a statute.id.at.this is especially so in the areas of foreign policy and national security,where congressional silence is not to be equated with congressional disapproval.id.the court analysis in agee was buttressed by its determination that congress had endorsed not only the underlying premise of executive authority in the areas of foreign policy and national security,but also its specific application to the subject matter at issue.id.at.
similarly,this regulatory embargo against iran has been in place since.far from sitting by as successive presidents maintained a sweeping sanctions regime,congress has expanded,deepened and formalized the sanctions in a comprehensive legislative effort to target iran through economic measures.in,congress passed the iran sanctions act,stat.codified in part at note,which mandated the imposition of specified sanctions against foreign firms that reached threshold levels of involvement with iran energy sector subsequently,in,congress passed the iran freedom support act.pub,stat.codified in part at u.note.in addition to appropriating funds earmarked for the support of persons and organizations working for the purpose of supporting and promoting democracy for iran,id,the act placed congress imprimatur on executive sanctions against iran.under the heading codification of sanctions,congress wrote 
united states sanctions with respect to iran imposed pursuant to sections and of executive order,sections e,g and of executive order,
and sections,and of executive order relating to exports and certain other transactions with iran as in effect on january,shall remain in effect.the president may terminate such sanctions,in whole or in part,if the president notifies congress at least days in advance of such termination.
id.at a.notably,one of the provisions incorporated by reference section of executive order specifically prohibited the exportation,reexportation,sale,or supply,directly or indirectly,from the united states,or by a united states person,wherever located,of any goods,technology,or services to iran or the government of iran.
and in,congress passed the comprehensive iran sanctions,accountability,and divestment act of,stat.codified in part at note.cisada expanded the iran sanctions act by targeting iran ability to make or import gasoline and placing new restrictions on financial institutions.id.most significantly for our purposes,however,is b,in which congress codified the prohibitions on the exportation of goods,services and technology of united states origin to iran that were then in effect under executive orders promulgated pursuant to ieepa.id.at tit.i,stat.at therefore,when amirnazmi was tried and convicted,congress had already ratified the ofac regulations under which he was charged.and,in the aftermath of his conviction,congress once more manifested its approval of executive conduct by again codifying the extant prohibitions on exports issued pursuant to ieepa.these measures demonstrate congress approval of the emergency measures undertaken against iran notwithstanding its failure to adhere to the meeting requirements of b 
far from being unaware or indifferent,in the case of iran,congress has clearly and consistently demonstrated its support of the executive agenda.this is not a scenario in which we are compelled to divine the significance if any of congressional silence.nevertheless,given the number of countries against which trade sanctions have been leveled pursuant to ieepa it is not difficult to envisage a situation in which congress position is less robustly documented.although congress failure to periodically meet neither automatically terminates an emergency nor bespeaks its dissatisfaction with the president policies,b provides a regularized mechanism for disquieted representatives to initiate a dialogue about or even contest the wisdom of continuing on with the president strategy.once the president has invoked his power to criminalize certain conduct under ieepa,congress retains an ongoing part in ensuring the executive actions remain meaningfully constrained so as to satisfy the requirements of touby 
the supreme court has held that m atters intimately related to foreign policy and national security are rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention,agee,at,and federal courts have historically declined to review the essentially political questions surrounding the declaration or continuance of a national emergency,united states spawr optical research,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although such considerations do not preclude enforcing compliance with statutory dictates,nea places the onus on congress to ensure emergency situations remain anomalous and do not quietly evolve into default norms.see youngstown,at jackson,concurring p ower to legislate for emergencies belongs in the hands of congress,but only congress itself can prevent power from slipping through its fingers.
next,amirnazmi argues the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that chemplan does not fall within the scope of ieepa exemption.he contends that congress intended to insulate transactions incident to the free flow of information from regulation and that the sale of chemplan,which conveys pricing information and scientific information,falls within this category of presumptively exempt activity.he urges us to vacate his convictions on counts two and five of the superseding indictment,which charged him with ieepa violations,because,he argues,ofac interpretation of this exemption both flouts congressional intent and is unconstitutionally vague.
congress proscribes the executive from regulating,pursuant to ieepa,
the importation from any country,or the exportation to any country,whether commercial or otherwise,regardless of format or medium of transmission,of any information or informational materials,including but not limited to,publications,films,posters,phonograph records,photographs,microfilms,microfiche,tapes,compact disks,cd roms,artworks,and news wire feeds b.ofac has incorporated the statutory exemption into the itr the regulations provide a general license authorizing transactions involving information and informational materials.see c.although not enumerated in the statute,technology and software are capable of qualifying as informational materials under the regulations.see id.the release of technology or software in the united states to any person violates the itr if made with knowledge or reason to know the technology is intended for iran or the government of iran,unless that technology or software meets the definition of information and informational materials in.however,under ofac interpretation,the general license is not applicable to transactions related to information and informational materials not fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions,or to the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of informational materials,or to the provision of marketing and business consulting services.id.c emphasis added.
at trial,the parties agreed to submit the issue of whether chemplan fell within the exemption to the jury as a factual matter,and the jury was instructed that the government had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the exemption did not apply.in his rule motion,amirnazmi appeared to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction on the ieepa counts.the district court,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,concluded a reasonable factfinder could have found the government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that chemplan was not fully created and in existence at the date of the relevant transactions and thus could have found the exemption inapplicable.amirnazmi,dist.lexis,at.in reaching this conclusion,the district court cited amirnazmi description of chemplan as a dynamic tool,which allows the user to generate what if scenarios,as well as testimony indicating that chemplan packages were specifically tailored to end users and that the program allowed users to enter their own data in order to generate customized reports.
ordinarily,our review of whether a jury verdict rests on legally sufficient evidence is particularly deferential.united states dent,cir.we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and will sustain the verdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the government argues amirnazmi has waived any claim that the exemption applies as a matter of law by accepting the proposed jury instruction.see united states ex rel.new jersey,cir quoting johnson zerbst.defining a waiver as an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.
but because the jury returned a guilty verdict without specific interrogatories,we can not say with any certainty whether it concluded chemplan simply did not qualify as informational materials or whether,as the district court surmised,it concluded the exemption was inapplicable on account of the regulatory.in federal criminal cases,a general verdict will be upheld if the government has adduced sufficient evidence in support of at least one of the alternative theories on which the jury was charged.griffin united states,d we agree with the district court that a reasonable factfinder could have found the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that chemplan was not fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions,and was therefore subject to ofac regulation under the itr 
amirnazmi argues reliance on this regulatory language is fatally misplaced for two reasons.first,he claims ofac interpretation of the exemption is ultra vires.as congress has structured ieepa to disempower the executive from imposing trade sanctions that impinge upon certain conduct,he argues,a regulation that undercuts this legislative charge by purporting to criminalize such conduct would be unenforceable.second,he argues this regulation fails to inform those potentially affected by ieepa that certain conduct is proscribed.because the regulation did not announce with unmistakable clarity that a product of chemplan nature would not fall within the general license for informational materials,he contends,it is unconstitutionally vague.
first,amirnazmi contends ofac regulation removing informational materials not fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions from the scope of the statutory exemption reflects an impermissible agency interpretation that should be struck down under the principles enunciated in chevron natural resources defense council,d.we disagree.
prior to,trade sanctions that hampered the exchange of informational materials were routinely justified under twea and ieepa as incidental to the broader commercial purpose of these trade measures.see,teague regional comm r of customs,cir upholding twea regulations that effected a categorical prohibition on importation of informational materials from china,north korea and north vietnam because the limitation was incidental to the proper general purpose of the regulations restricting the dollar flow to hostile nations.in veterans reservists for peace in vietnam,we wrote 
a statute is not overly broad and thus violative of the first amendment merely because it regulates incident to its scheme protected activities or property.it is only where the statute directly regulates speech or expression arguably protected by the first amendment,or where as its mechanism the statute has granted discretion to a delegatee to determine whether particular items of expression may be prohibited on the basis of their content,that the question of overbreadth arises.twea section b does not directly regulate first amendment protected material,rather it controls transactions concerning property in which an enemy has an economic interest.the purport of the statute is clear on its face,and therefore provides guidance to the delegatee with regard to the exercise of his functions.
at.until,this line of reasoning held sway.the regulations nominally allowed the importation of informational materials but in reality banned it by requiring that the importers make payment into blocked accounts.walsh brady,citing.
congress amended section of twea and section b of ieepa in to exempt the regulation of informational materials from the executive congeries of powers.see omnibus trade and competitiveness act of,stat,codified at app.b,b the amendment specifically removed from the executive purview the authority to regulate or prohibit such transactions directly or indirectly.id.this berman amendment was considered a reaction to several seizures by the united states of shipments of magazines and books from embargoed countries and to the treasury department restrictions on the permissible forms of payment for informational materials purchased from cuba.kalantari nitv,cir footnotes omitted.
in the wake of the berman amendment,ofac amended its regulations to conform with the new statutory language.see foreign assets control regulations and cuban assets control regulations,codified at.paralleling the statute,the new regulations exempted informational materials,whether commercial or otherwise,from prohibition or regulation.id.notably,however,ofac took a narrow view of what constituted informational materials.from the outset,ofac reserved the right to regulate transactions related to informational materials not fully created and in existence at the date of the transaction and those concerning the substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of informational materials.id.ofac also excluded intangible items,such as telecommunications transmissions,from the definition of informational materials.id.
a divergence in views soon developed with regard to how expansively ofac was required to interpret the berman amendment.in cernuda heavey,the district court for the southern district of florida discerned from the legislative history of the berman amendment an obvious first amendment orientation.in holding ofac exclusion of original artwork from the definition of informational materials unreasonable,the court determined congress had amended twea and ieepa to prevent the statute from running afoul of the first amendment.id.at.because original artwork merits first amendment protection,the court concluded,ofac could not exclude it from the sweep of informational materials.in dictum,the court theorized that the berman amendment totally exempts from prohibition or regulation the import of ideas and information protected by the first amendment.id.at.
by contrast,in capital,brady,the district court for the southern district of new york concluded ofac exclusion of intangibles was consistent with the amendment other informational materials language.capital cities had purchased the exclusive rights to televise the pan american games from havana,cuba for million and agreed to remit percent of this sum to the host organizer of the games.id.at.ofac informed capital cities the proposed transaction would not fall within a general license provision and that it would not issue a specific license so long as the transaction would result in a substantial sum being transferred to cuba.id.the court found the berman amendment was susceptible of multiple reasonable interpretations and found the agency interpretation that excluded intangibles such as telecommunications worthy of deference under chevron.id.at.in contrast to the cernuda court,the capital cities court found the legislative history reflects,at best,a general purpose to foster the exchange of ideas across national borders.id 
in,congress expanded this limitation on executive authority by enacting the free trade in ideas act,stat,codified as amended at,b.in part,congress responded to ofac exclusion of intangible materials from the definition of informational materials by amending ieepa exemption to restrict the executive from regulating transactions concerning informational materials regardless of format or medium of transmission.id.c amending b.congress also added compact disks,cd roms,artworks,and news wire feeds to the nonexclusive litany of enumerated media that could qualify as informational materials.id.the house conference report stated 
n o embargo may prohibit or restrict directly or indirectly the import or export of information that is protected under the first amendment to the constitution.the language was explicitly intended,by including the words directly or indirectly,to have a broad scope.however,the treasury department has narrowly and restrictively interpreted the language in ways not originally intended.the present amendment is only intended to address some of those restrictive interpretations,for example limits on the type of information that is protected or on the medium or method of transmitting the information.
conf,at,reprinted in.significantly,although congress overrode ofac interpretation to the extent that it excluded intangible materials from the definition of informational materials,it did not disabuse ofac of its belief that it could permissibly regulate informational materials not fully created and in existence at the date of the transaction.that remained in place and,to date,has not been challenged as ultra vires.
before this court,amirnazmi relies on cernuda to argue that,because chemplan is a product that would merit first amendment protection,it necessarily falls outside the scope of ofac regulatory capabilities.although it suffused its opinion with constitutional considerations,the cernuda court refrained from reaching the merits of the petitioner first amendment challenge to the regulations,opting instead to rest on statutory construction and the legislative history of the berman a mendment.at.similarly,amirnazmi stresses he is not challenging his conviction under the ieepa on first amendment grounds.consequently,whether chemplan theoretically could qualify for first amendment protection is not the dispositive inquiry instead,we must determine whether ofac interpretation of the informational materials exemption comports with congressional intent.see chevron,at the judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.
we are satisfied that ofac interpretation of ieepa exemption is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.with the berman amendment and the free trade in ideas act,congress sought to ensure the robust exchange of informational materials would not be unduly inhibited by ofac.when ofac enacted regulations that congress considered at odds with this overarching purpose,the legislature intervened and modified the statutory language to rectify ofac perceived missteps.critically,although congress addressed one facet of ofac interpretation of the exemption by stressing in that the executive may not regulate informational materials regardless of format or medium of transmission,it did not counteract the component of that interpretation at issue here.presumably cognizant of ofac narrowing interpretations,congress could have inserted text stipulating that the executive may not regulate informational materials regardless of whether fully created and in existence at the date of the transactions.although the legislative history obliquely alludes to other ways in which ofac had interpreted the exemption in an unforeseen manner,it chose to only address some of those restrictive interpretations.see conf,at.w hen congress is aware of an agency interpretation of a statute and takes no action to correct it while amending other portions of the statute,it may be inferred that the agency interpretation is consistent with congressional intent.barrera echavarria rison,cir en banc citing north haven bd.of educ.bell,d,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in kwai fun wong united states ins,cir.
moreover,there is ample evidence to suggest congress has accepted ofac decision to permit the circulation of informational materials already in existence while concomitantly regulating transactions that contemplate the creation of new materials.in the itr,ofac has fleshed out the scope of the regulatory by explaining 
transactions that are prohibited notwithstanding this section include,but are not limited to,payment of advances for information and informational materials not yet created and completed with the exception of prepaid subscriptions for widely circulated magazines and other periodical publications,and provision of services to market,produce or,create or assist in the creation of information and informational materials.
c ofac has made a reasoned determination that congress paramount concern for facilitating transactions and activities incident to the flow of informational materials does not reach goods and events that would not be produced but for financing from the united states in the case of imports or financing from purchasers in embargoed countries in the case of exports.in the case of commercial goods,the key distinction rests between informational materials that are widely circulated in a standardized format and those that are bespoke.whereas ofac may not regulate the sale or transfer of prefabricated or informational materials,materials crafted to suit the unique specifications of a particular purchaser are not sacrosanct.this distinction is sensible,and it reflects a permissible implementation of the statutory exemption in light of ieepa competing imperatives restricting material support for hostile regimes while encouraging the robust interchange of information.
at trial,the government adduced sufficient evidence to convince a reasonable factfinder beyond a reasonable doubt that chemplan was not fully created and in existence at the date of the relevant transactions.amirnazmi trumpeted the software dynamism.joseph mehl,a computer network support technician who provided services to trantech,testified to his belief that each chemplan package was specifically tailored to the end user,depending on what industry they worked in.in aggressively pursuing commercial ties with npc,amirnazmi attempted to stoke his counterparty interest by proposing several options for calibrating the software to npc unique needs.as explained below,the sale of chemplan to npc was the cornerstone of amirnazmi conspiracy to bring his technical expertise to iran for that country aggrandizement.consequently,the transfer of chemplan to iranian purchasers does not fit neatly into the paradigm of informational exchange envisioned by congress.quite clearly,amirnazmi envisioned chemplan as being of singular functional utility to iranian users.since the inception of the exemption,ofac has excepted such transactions from the scope of the general license.
accordingly,we conclude that c is a permissible construction of ieepa exemption and is worthy of deference under chevron.see at.therefore,a reasonable factfinder could have found the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the sale of chemplan to iranian purchasers did not qualify for exemption from ieepa as a matter of law.
next,amirnazmi contends ofac regulations are imprecisely drafted and consequently void for vagueness.his core argument is that the to the exemption fail to provide clear principles.according to him,it is impossible to determine whether a work is fully created and in existence without necessarily invoking an untethered subjective judgment.again,we find amirnazmi argument unconvincing 
a statute is void on vagueness grounds if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits or authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.united states stevens,cir quoting hill colorado,d.in the criminal context,since vagueness attacks are based on lack of notice,they may be overcome in any specific case where reasonable persons would know their conduct puts them at risk of punishment under the statute.san filippo bongiovanni,cir quoting maynard cartwright,d alteration in original.criminal statutes need only give fair warning that certain conduct is prohibited to survive constitutional challenges.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
furthermore,the supreme court has stated that 
e conomic regulation is subject to a less strict vagueness test because its subject matter is often more narrow,and because businesses,which face economic demands to plan behavior carefully,can be expected to consult relevant legislation in advance of action and may clarify the meaning of the regulation by their own inquiry,or by resort to an administrative process.
village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d.and,significantly,the court has recognized that a scienter requirement may mitigate a law vagueness,especially with respect to the adequacy of notice to the complainant that his conduct is proscribed.id.at see also united states hescorp,heavy equip.sales,cir a requirement of willfulness makes a vagueness challenge especially difficult to sustain a mind intent upon willful evasion is inconsistent with surprised innocence.quoting united states ragen.
the district court rested its conclusion that the regulation is not unconstitutionally vague on two grounds.first,it reasoned that the sophisticated nature of those required to consult the ieepa regulations coupled with the availability of guidance from ofac officials on electronic and telephone hotlines negated any notice concerns.and second,it noted that ieepa scienter requirement counseled against a vagueness finding.see amirnazmi,dist.lexis,at 
as to the latter point,the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that amirnazmi willfully violated the trade restrictions.see c restricting ieepa convictions to those who willfully commit,willfully attempt to commit,or willfully conspire to commit a violation of any license,order or regulation issued pursuant to ieepa see also id.a no person shall be held liable in any court for or with respect to anything done or omitted in good faith in connection with the administration of,or pursuant to and in reliance on,this title,or any regulation,instruction,or direction issued under this title.as the district court noted,this is a case where ignorance of the law is a defense the inability to appreciate the meaning of the law negatives the mens rea required for conviction,and defendant was free to,and did,argue this to the jury.amirnazmi,dist.lexis,at internal quotation marks omitted.the jury unanimously concluded amirnazmi knew his conduct was unlawful.
and,as to the former point,the record reveals amirnazmi only halfheartedly availed himself of the opportunity to receive definitive guidance from ofac.amirnazmi first contacted ofac upon his return from iran on june.he indicated he was curious as to whether consolidating publicly available documents in a single location to increase the ease of access for individuals in iran would fall within the exemption,and he alluded to the possibility of exporting a good to iran.he did not mention the computations that could be done with the data,nor did he ask if confidential trade secrets were exempt.on june,after fbi and irs officials had executed the search warrant for trantech,amirnazmi again contacted the ofac hotline,this time to complain his office had been searched,but without making any inquiries about the interplay between chemplan and the iranian sanctions.on june,he sent a letter to ofac confirming his unsupported understanding that chemplan fell within the exemption but again failed to disclose how chemplan functioned as a dynamic planning tool.amirnazmi once more contacted ofac on june and was told to submit a detailed explanation of the transactions he wanted to carry out if he wanted authoritative guidance.one month later,he was indicted.the district court concluded amirnazmi did not contact ofac in good faith or with the intention of actually procuring guidance in complying with the ofac regulations.amirnazmi,dist.lexis,at.amirnazmi refusal to provide ofac with the detailed information that might have allowed the agency to offer reasoned guidance supports the district court conclusion.
moreover,ofac interpretive rulings do not cast doubt on the ability of reasonable persons to appreciate whether their conduct was prohibited.amirnazmi points to a sequence of rulings in which ofac attempted to demarcate the scope of permissible editing of works to be published in the united states.after ofac ruled on september,that collaboration on and editing of manuscripts submitted by persons in iran,including activities such as the reordering of paragraphs or sentences,correction of syntax,grammar,and replacement of inappropriate words by persons,prior to publication,may result in a substantively altered or enhanced product,it revisited this broad statement after meeting with publishing representatives,concluding on april,that style and copy editing,such as correcting grammar and spelling and reformatting the document for publication,was exempt activity.on july,ofac addressed how these prior rulings would apply to newspapers seeking to publish articles.it wrote that substantive edits to the work content to make the work more cohesive,efficient,argumentative or effective and to make the work conform to the newspaper editorial standards would not constitute substantive or artistic alteration or enhancement of the article or commentary.
although amirnazmi would read this publishing trilogy as indicating the regulations are so convoluted as to render them incomprehensible even to those charged with administering the sanctions,the salient lesson is that representatives of the publishing entities actually met with ofac officials to proactively and candidly discuss how the regulations should apply to their line of work ofac,for its part,demonstrated its willingness to partake in productive consultations with businesses that approached it.if amirnazmi had been perplexed by the applicability of the regulations,he had abundant opportunity to obtain clarification.see village of hoffman estates,at noting that the ability of sophisticated businesses to obtain clarification by resort to an administrative process provides one of the rationales for according economic regulations greater latitude upon a review for vagueness.
in sum,we agree with the district court conclusion that,in light of the narrow subject matter and reach of the ieepa regulations,as well as the sophisticated nature of the persons they affect and the ability of such persons to obtain guidance from ofac itself,the ieepa regulations are not unconstitutionally vague.amirnazmi,dist.lexis,at because ofac regulations are neither ultra vires nor unconstitutionally vague,we will deny amirnazmi request to vacate his ieepa convictions on these grounds.
finally,amirnazmi appeal requires us to address two further issues whether there was a variance between the indictment,which charged amirnazmi with one continuous conspiracy,and the facts established at trial and whether the district court abused its discretion in admitting tape recordings of amirnazmi prison telephone calls.we conclude amirnazmi is not entitled to relief on either of these grounds.
amirnazmi contends there was a variance between the indictment and the facts established at trial,and that this variance caused evidence to be admitted that would otherwise have been barred by the statute of limitations namely,amirnazmi alleges the evidence,if anything,proved he engaged in two separate conspiracies,one of which terminated before the limitations period.the statute of limitations for violations of ieepa is five years.see a setting the default statute of limitations for federal offenses.but,because the district court concluded amirnazmi actions dating back to were part of a single,continuous conspiracy,it admitted evidence of acts occurring prior to.amirnazmi contends,as he did in his rule motion,that the introduction of evidence relating to his activities outside the limitations period tainted his trial.
there is a variance if the indictment charges a single conspiracy while the evidence presented at trial proves only the existence of multiple conspiracies.united states kemp,cir.the rule against variance protects the defendant right to an indictment sufficiently inform ing him of the charges against him so that he may prepare his defense and not be misled or surprised at trial.united states schurr,cir internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.conspiracy is a continuing offense and a jury may consider each and all of a defendant actions in furtherance of the conspiracy so long as the indictment is brought within five years of the last overt act.united states jake,cir.t he crucial question in determining whether the statute of limitations has run is the scope of the conspiratorial agreement,for it is that which determines both the duration of the conspiracy,and whether the act relied on as an overt act may properly be regarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.grunewald united states,d.
the government superseding indictment charged amirnazmi with conspiring to violate ieepa from through july by engaging in transactions with companies located in iran despite knowing such conduct was prohibited.when the district court analyzed amirnazmi claim within the statute of limitations context,it defined amirnazmi conspiracy as a plot to bring his technical wherewithal,especially the chemplan system,back to iran for the benefit of that country.amirnazmi,d at.the superseding indictment set forth six pre overt acts that allegedly contributed to the advancement of this conspiracy,and the court concluded that the evidence adduced by the government at trial demonstrated this conduct was closely tied to his continuing efforts to sell his chemplan software to the npc.
the district court concluded amirnazmi had resolved on achieving certain goals for the betterment of iran prior to and that,although he failed to make significant headway until well later,there is no evidence that he ever abandoned or renounced the plan he had hatched in the late.id.after his encounter with president ahmadinejad in,amirnazmi efforts began to bear fruit.he successfully negotiated another licensing agreement with npc in after representing that the agreement was still valid,and he signed memoranda of understanding with ibaco and nitd.in the court estimation,amirnazmi efforts to sell chemplan to npc were integral to his goal of turning iran into a chemical powerhouse.thus,it concluded,amirnazmi pre acts fell squarely within the scope of his conspiracy to bolster iran chemical capacities,and evidence of these acts was properly presented to the jury on the theory that they contributed to a continuing course of conduct.id.
amirnazmi now offers two alternative arguments the government failed to prove his pre conduct was part of any conspiracy,and even if his early sales to the npc were part of a conspiracy to violate ieepa,that purported conspiracy terminated well before the subsequent sale of chemplan.
the gravamen of amirnazmi contention that his pre conduct was not conspiratorial in any way is that the government failed to demonstrate the existence of an agreement to violate the statute.see united states gebbie,cir listing an agreement between two or more persons as an essential element of a conspiracy charge under.amirnazmi claims the government failed to demonstrate he shared a common enterprise with npc beyond occasionally buying and selling computer software.he attempts to divorce his pre acts from the overriding contextual narrative and style them as intermittent transactions between a buyer and a seller working at arms length and without any nefarious joint objective.however,amirnazmi declines to confront the evidence that demonstrates he worked in conjunction with various officials to provide chemplan and boxscore and had ongoing,regular contact with assorted npc agents.the jury may reasonably infer these business relationships would not have persisted without at least an understanding in place between the parties that amirnazmi would be willing to provide goods and services in violation of the embargo.see united states mcglory,cir concluding that a reasonable jury could infer from the totality of the evidence that the activities of the participants could not have been carried on except as the result of a preconceived scheme or common understanding internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.
and amirnazmi alternative contention that,at best,the government proved the existence of two separate conspiracies is similarly unpersuasive.it miscasts his unrequited efforts to spark renewed interest in chemplan prior to as evidence the conspiracy could not have been continuing.this slackening may reveal a disparity in the vigor with which each side pursued the object of the conspiracy npc seems to have been a somewhat reluctant collaborator for most of the early part of the past decade.nevertheless,the resumption of concerted activity in came on the heels of amirnazmi continuous efforts to preserve and strengthen trantech iranian ties.the temporary lull in sales does not detract from the district court conclusion that amirnazmi later actions were part of the same conspiracy that had begun in the.amirnazmi recurrent efforts to strengthen the relationship were sandwiched between two periods of concerted activity in which the parties pursued the same unlawful end.the unaltered nature of the parties interests both prior to and after belies amirnazmi depiction of the facts as evidencing one conspiracy ceasing and another commencing.
amirnazmi would have to demonstrate that,even if a variance led to evidence being admitted that otherwise would have been barred by the statute of limitations,such evidence prejudiced a substantial right.as noted,this holds true whether we conduct a plenary review or review for plain error.an error affects substantial rights when it is prejudicial it must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.united states vazquez lebron,cir internal quotation marks omitted.here,it appears as though amirnazmi variance argument is targeted primarily,if not exclusively,at his conviction for conspiracy in count one.because limiting the jury consideration to evidence of amirnazmi post activities would not have resulted in a different outcome,amirnazmi can not demonstrate his substantial rights were prejudiced by introduction of this evidence.
because the district court neither misinterpreted the law of conspiracy nor prejudiced a substantial right of amirnazmi,it did not err in admitting evidence of amirnazmi pre conduct.
lastly,amirnazmi appeals the district court decision to allow the government to introduce into evidence tape recordings and translated transcripts of telephone calls placed by amirnazmi to certain family members during his pretrial imprisonment at the federal detention center fdc amirnazmi argues the government violated.c by impermissibly using subpoenas as discovery devices.rule c,which governs the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum in federal criminal proceedings,is not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal cases.united states nixon,d,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in bourjaily united states,d see also united states cuthbertson,cir.rather,the rule was designed to expedite a trial by providing a time and place before trial for the inspection of the subpoenaed materials.bowman dairy united states.notably,the rule c test outlined in nixon pertains to the production of documents in advance of trial.at.
here,the government served a series of trial subpoenas on the fdc custodian of records requiring him to appear on a specified date and to bring with him copies of amirnazmi telephonic communications aside from those shielded by privilege.critically,the dates returnable of the subpoenas paralleled the trial dates and noted that the witness was subject to call.because the subpoenas did not require production,the district court concluded nixon was not controlling and the government had not run afoul of rule c.amirnazmi,however,argues the government implicitly understood that the fdc would expedite its production of the requested evidence.that is,based on the alacrity with which the fdc habitually responds to subpoenas received from the united states attorney office,amirnazmi believes the government anticipated the fdc turning around the subpoenas in short order and consequently having access to the communications well in advance of trial.thus,he argues the protections embodied in nixon against the misuse of subpoenas should apply notwithstanding the formal returnable dates on the subpoenas.
although the district court rejected amirnazmi invitation to adopt a broad reading of rule c both at the suppression hearing and in its denial of his rule motion,amirnazmi again seeks a ruling that nixon gloss on rule c applies with equal force to trial subpoenas likely to yield production.amirnazmi discerns support in united states noriega,for the broad proposition that trial subpoenas may not be used to procure advance production of a defendant conversations without first obtaining leave of court.significantly,in noriega,the subpoenas directed the custodian of records to appear and testify on various dates,none of which corresponded with scheduled hearings in the case.id.at.because no proceedings were scheduled on the dates indicated in the subpoenas,the court found it unmistakable that the subpoenas constituted a broad dragnet designed to enable the prosecution to examine these recordings prior to trial in order to obtain additional discovery against the defendant.id.at.additionally,the court noted that subpoenas are more likely to be used for impermissible discovery purposes when advance production of materials is sought instead of the usual production at time of trial or other proceeding in which they are to be used in evidence.id.at.
here,the government issued subpoenas that complied with the facial requirements of trial subpoenas.on other facts,such formalistic compliance may be insufficient to mask the government efforts to make an end run around nixon.however,the record before us does not demonstrate such an impermissible discovery motive.we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the recordings as evidence 
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the jury verdict and the district court imposition of a prison sentence.
