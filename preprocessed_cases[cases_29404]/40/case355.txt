christopher demayo appeals from a district court order denying his motion for partial judgment on the pleadings and granting a dismissal on the basis of qualified immunity in favor of massachusetts state police state police troopers robert nugent and jeffrey lugas.demayo complaint alleged that nugent and lugas violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches under the fourth amendment of the united states constitution.see bivens six unknown named agents,d.although the district court determined that nugent and lugas infringed demayo constitutional rights by entering his home without a search warrant or exigent circumstances,it nevertheless dismissed demayo claims on the basis of qualified immunity.because we hold that the district court erred in its analysis of whether the right that nugent and lugas violated was clearly established,we reverse the decision below,render partial judgment in favor of demayo,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in reviewing the district court decision to deny judgment on the pleadings in favor of demayo,we review the factual allegations in the light most favorable to nugent and lugas,the parties.of,cir.conversely,in reviewing the district court order dismissing demayo claims,we examine the record in the light most favorable to demayo,the plaintiff.see margo caribe,cir pagan calderon,cir we conduct our review of each of these questions de novo.see local,united food commercial workers union shaw supermarkets,cir judgment on the pleadings pagan,at dismissal.the salient facts,set forth below,are taken from the parties pleadings see,at a rule c motion,unlike a rule b motion,implicates the pleadings as a whole.
on may,at around,a united parcel service ups employee notified the state police that a suspicious package had arrived at ups lynnfield facility.the package was addressed to an individual named debbie moore,was entrusted to the care of chris demayo,and was sent by susan kelty.shortly thereafter,nugent,in his capacity as a member of the drug enforcement administration dea task force group,traveled to the ups facility to investigate the report.there he was joined by other officers.nugent indicated that his suspicions were raised by the box heavy taping,its california return address,and the lack of a requirement for a signature.at approximately,a dog under the supervision of the state police signaled the presence of narcotics in the box.later,at,dea special agent robert donovan,acting in an undercover capacity,called kelty to confirm that she wished ups to deliver the package.kelty responded that it was a very important package for her terminally ill sister,whose condition necessitated delivery rather than pickup.
at approximately,donovan,disguised as a ups employee and accompanied by a number of other task force officers,including nugent and lugas,conducted a controlled delivery to demayo residence.gary demayo the plaintiff father,opened the door,remaining in the threshold.indicating that he could accept the package for chris demayo,he began to sign his name when provided with a signature sheet.while gary demayo was still in the process of signing for the package,donovan gave a prearranged signal for the arrest team to advance to the home.at this point,gary demayo had only signed his first name.nugent and lugas brushed by gary demayo,entered the residence,and then proceeded to conduct a brief protective sweep of the house lasting approximately fifteen to twenty seconds.during this sweep,lugas encountered a frail looking woman,later identified as debbie moore,demayo mother and the intended recipient of the package,exiting a bathroom on the second floor of the house.
when confronted by the officers,gary demayo refused to identify himself.he informed the officers that he had no identification,as he was only residing at the home temporarily.he refused to accept the package and stated that he would not sign for it,despite his earlier acquiescence.nugent report indicates that,after the officers entry into the home,gary demayo became belligerent and uncooperative.ultimately,the officers issued gary demayo a criminal summons and seized the package after indicating their intent to obtain a search warrant for it.according to nugent and lugas,nugent subsequently obtained a warrant to search the package which was then revealed to be conspicuously devoid of narcotics,containing only sandals,two packages of underwear,two boxes of cold compresses for injuries,a figurine,a white visor,and women shirts wrapped in a towel.
plaintiff brought suit against nugent and lugas,as well as dea group supervisor michael mccormick and the state police,in massachusetts superior court in middlesex county on may,alleging the violation of his constitutional rights as well as various state law claims after considerable procedural wrangling,the case was removed to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts because michael mccormick was a federal officer and nugent and lugas were acting as federal agents as part of the dea task force.eventually,all parties other than nugent and lugas were dismissed from the case,and the only remaining claim against them lies under bivens.
on november,demayo moved for partial judgment on the pleadings as to liability against nugent and lugas.they filed a response on december,requesting dismissal.despite holding that nugent and lugas violated demayo constitutional rights under the fourth amendment,the district court denied demayo motion and granted dismissal in favor of the defendants on the basis of qualified immunity.
ii.analysis 
constitutional violation 
the bivens doctrine allows plaintiffs to vindicate certain constitutionally protected rights through a private cause of action for damages against federal officials in their individual capacities.see mccloskey mueller,cir.a claimant who seeks relief under bivens must prove the violation of a constitutional right by a federal agent acting under color of federal law.see at.dep t of housing urban,cir.the parties agree that,at the time of the search,nugent and lugas were acting as federal agents under color of federal law.nugent and lugas,however,contest the district court determination that their intrusion into demayo home constituted a violation of his constitutional rights.
we begin with the basic rule that,absent consent or exigency,a warrantless search of the home is presumptively unconstitutional under the fourth amendment.groh ramirez,d.to show exigent circumstances,the police must reasonably believe that there is such a compelling necessity for immediate action as will not brook the delay of obtaining a warrant.united states samboy,cir quoting fletcher town of clinton,cir.proof of exigent circumstances should be supported by particularized,facts,not simply generalized suppositions about the behavior of a particular class of criminal suspects.id.citation omitted.an individual may vindicate a proven violation of his or her right to be free from unreasonable searches through a bivens action.see at.
first,we note that,as the district court recognized,the primary factual predicate for the alleged constitutional violation occurred when the officers first breached the threshold of demayo home.in their briefing to the district court,nugent and lugas ignored the alleged illegal entry,focusing instead on justifying the protective sweep that was conducted once the officers had already entered the home.the defendants efforts to justify the subsequent protective sweep miss the mark and,at best,conflate two distinct concepts.here,because the officers indisputably lacked a warrant and no consent to search was given,nugent and lugas were required to demonstrate the presence of an exigency to justify their intrusion into the home.
on appeal,nugent and lugas offer three different explanations for their entry.all three of these arguments are waived because,as explained above,the defendants defended their actions in the district court by attempting to justify a protective sweep,not the initial entry itself.these theories are factually and analytically distinct and,thus,are not interchangeable.see,united st
