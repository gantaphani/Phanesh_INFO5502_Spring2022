opinion of the court 
marco tulio,his wife,luz,and his adult daughter,ximena,are natives and citizens of colombia.between and,the family was repeatedly threatened by agents of the fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de colombia farc in an effort to coerce,who had close connections to the colombian government and military,into becoming a farc informant.once it became clear that the colombian government would not take steps to protect his family,liquidated his assets,fled with his family to the united states,and applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.the immigration judge ij denied his application,and the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed,concluding that had not shown that he would be persecuted on account of actual or imputed political beliefs if he were removed to colombia.
seeks review on one substantial evidence supports the bia conclusion that lacks a reasonable fear that he would be persecuted on account of his actual or imputed political beliefs if he were to return to colombia although we review the bia decision under a highly deferential standard,we conclude that the bia decision is not supported by substantial evidence,and we will grant the petition for review.
we begin by reviewing testimony.we note at the outset that the ij found the majority of testimony credible,and unless otherwise noted,the testimony we review below was found credible.
troubles with the farc trace back to,when a vehicle he was driving was ambushed and he was kidnapped.was held captive by the farc for approximately one month until a ransom was paid to secure his release.conceded during his testimony that the kidnapping was motivated by his wealth,not his political beliefs indeed,he was not politically active in any meaningful way in.after the kidnapping,however,and as a result of his dislike for the farc,he became increasingly active in liberal party politics,giving money to various liberal party candidates and participating in a variety of political campaigns.according to testimony,these campaigns would frequently receive generalized threats from the farc,although he personally received no direct threats from the farc while participating in the campaigns.did not testify in significant detail as to his participation in liberal party politics,mentioning it only in passing during his direct testimony.the ij did not find his testimony concerning the degree of his political activity to be credible in light of the fact that he mentioned his political participation only incidentally.app.at.
in addition to his direct participation in political campaigns,had connections with the colombian military and government as a result of his social and business activities.had long participated in equestrian events in colombia and was a member of the federal equestrian board testified that he and his wife would attend equestrian events every weekend,where they would socialize with government ministers and military personnel.
more importantly for purposes of petitioners asylum claims,also developed relationships with governmental and military figures through his business activities.in particular,owned a catering business that supplied food to governmental and military institutions,and he owned a store within the military academy that sold food to cadets.through his work as a food supplier,his family,and his employees had free access to the military academy at all hours,app.at that is,as a food supplier to government and military institutions,and his family had ready access to,and frequently worked in,those institutions.
between and,received a series of threatening telephone calls from the farc when he received the first such call,he thought that the caller was playing a prank on him,but the farc agent informed him that he was not joking and that the farc wanted his help.the caller promised to get back in touch with him and hung up.in november,the farc agent called back and demanded,first,that act as an informant for the farc and,second,that he cease providing food and other services to the army.the caller stated that wife and daughter would be killed if he did not assist the farc the caller described ximena daily routine in detail,implying that the farc had been following her.although the translation or transcription of testimony on this point could be clearer it is evident that rejected the farc demands in no uncertain terms 
they wanted me,me to be an informant.and that we stop providing for the army and work with them and they they wanted part of the money that i had,that i made.they just stated that no moment would i accept because they go against my principles.at,at no time because with the experience that i had my hatred of them was complete and i,i wanted them to be enemies.
id.at emphasis added.
prior to the november telephone call,had informed neither his wife nor the police of the prior threats.after that call,however,he went into a panic and informed his wife of the telephone calls.id.at.he also spoke to his friends in the military,who advised him that there was nothing to be done and that he should change his daily routine.in december,he found on the windshield of his car a drawing of the route he took when driving to the military academy,which he understood to be an indication of the fact that he was being followed by the farc.at this point,went to the military unit called grupos de acci√≥n unificada por la libertad personal gaula,which is a specialized unit of the colombian military.gaula informed him that cases older than his took priority and that,in effect,nothing could be done to protect him or his family.
in february,received a final call from the farc in which the caller demanded that he work as an informant and cooperate with them in every sense.id.at.subsequently,in may,two men approached ximena on the street on her way home from school.the men told her to relay the message to her father that they were not playing.id.at.alarmed by the fact that the farc had escalated from making telephone calls to to making personal contact with ximena,the family decided that they had to leave colombia.they quickly liquidated their assets and flew to the united states,the only country where the three already had tourist visas.
shortly after their arrival in the united states,and ximena filed separate petitions for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief application was filed on behalf of himself and his wife.the hearings on the two petitions were consolidated,as the factual basis for ximena application is identical to that underlying her parents application.
the ij denied the applications.as we noted,supra,the ij found that testimony concerning the farc pursuit of him to become their informant was credible,but she did not find his testimony concerning his liberal party campaign activities to be credible.the ij concluded that treatment by the farc did not amount to past persecution on account of his political opinions,because the kidnapping was motivated by money,not politics and the farc threats were not sufficiently imminent to constitute persecution.
the ij further concluded that petitioners had not demonstrated that they have a fear of future persecution on account of actual or imputed political beliefs.the ij observed that the farc seeks to destabilize the country as a noted that everyone from the president on down is under threat from farc,id.at and that generalized civil unrest does not constitute persecution.with regard to the threats that were levied at petitioners in particular,the ij concluded that there was no nexus between these threats and actual or imputed political beliefs because respondent own political activity is very scanty.id.at.instead,the ij concluded that had been threatened because of his social and professional ties to the government,not his political beliefs 
almost all the evidence reflects that farc motivation to recruit respondent as an informant was based on his commercial and social ties to police,military and government officials,and his access to these groups through his catering business.farc does view the respondent as potentially useful to their goal,but did not deem him politically offensive.
id.at.having found that the persecution faced was not on account of his political beliefs,the ij concluded that he was ineligible for asylum 
appealed the ij ruling to the bia,which affirmed.the bia reasoned as follows 
t he respondent did not demonstrate that the farc was motivated to threaten him by any political opinion imputed to him or because of his prior support and participation in mayoral campaigns on behalf of the liberal party.the respondent did not adequately show that his political opinion played any significant role in his business connections with the military.nor did he sufficiently show that the farc would view him as a political supporter of the government if he did not serve as an informant thus,while the lead respondent claims that the farc attributed a political opinion to him based on his strong connections with the colombian government and that his refusal to cooperate was perceived as an intention to support the government,the evidence of record does not adequately support his claim.see,d.
app.at.the bia likewise affirmed the ij denial of application for withholding of removal and cat relief,see note,supra,and rejected argument that inadequate translation and transcription affected the fairness of the proceedings,see note,supra.thereafter filed this timely petition for review of the bia decision.
we have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal under u.a.because the bia issued an opinion,rather than a summary affirmance,we review the bia rather than the ij decision.rranci att y,cir citing li att y,cir.
our review of the bia denial of petitioners asylum application is highly deferential.we affirm any findings of fact supported by substantial evidence and are bound by the administrative findings of fact unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to arrive at a contrary conclusion.camara att y,cir quoting yan lan wu ashcroft,cir see also b b t he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.whether,for asylum purposes,a petitioner has proven that he or she has a fear of persecution is a question of fact,and the agency determination must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record.att y,cir quoting lukwago ashcroft,cir.we have,however,emphasized that the requirement that the bia decision be supported by substantial evidence is not an empty one.chavarria gonzalez,cir.d eference is not due where findings and conclusions are based on inferences or presumptions that are not reasonably grounded in the record,viewed as a whole,att y,cir citation omitted,and the bia is not permitted simply to ignore or misconstrue evidence in the asylum applicant favor.see,chavarria,at binrashed gonzales,cir.
contends that the bia decision that he lacked a reasonable fear of future persecution on account of his actual or imputed political beliefs is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.in particular,he argues that the bia employed too narrow an understanding of what constitutes a political opinion,and that the bia overlooked the significance of his close ties to the colombian government in concluding that he had not been targeted because of an imputed political opinion.we review the law that governs asylum claim and address the merits of his petition for review in turn below.
the attorney general has the discretion to grant asylum to any alien who is a refugee within the meaning of section a a of the immigration and nationality act ina.camara,at quoting b a.the ina defines the term refugee as follows 
a ny person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.
under the terms of this provision,may show that he is eligible for asylum by proving either that he was previously persecuted on account of a statutorily enumerated ground,or that he has a fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily enumerated ground.persecution includes,but is not limited to,threats to life,confinement,torture,and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom,at quoting yu att y,cir.an asylum applicant who establishes that he or she was previously persecuted on account of a statutorily enumerated ground triggers a rebuttable presumption that the applicant has a fear of future persecution.see lukwago,at citation omitted.
an asylum applicant who can not establish past persecution does not enjoy the benefit of such a presumption but may still demonstrate eligibility for asylum by establishing that he or she has a fear of future persecution.in order to show that a fear of future persecution is,a a,a petitioner must demonstrate that his or her fear is both subjective ly and objectively reasonable,which he or she may do by using testimonial,documentary,or expert evidence,at internal citations omitted.in order to satisfy the subjective prong of this inquiry,the petitioner must show that the fear is genuine.zubeda ashcroft,cir citation omitted.to satisfy the objective prong,the petitioner must show that a reasonable person in the alien circumstances would fear persecution if returned to the country in question.id.citation omitted.
however,an applicant for asylum need not prove that the persecution he or she suffered or fears suffering in the future occurred solely on account of one of the five grounds enumerated in the ina.singh gonzales,cir citation omitted.rather,the applicant must only demonstrate that the protected ground constitutes at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.b b i.the asylum applicant bears the burden of proving eligibility for asylum,and t estimony,by itself,is sufficient to meet this burden,if credible.singh,at quotation marks and citations omitted.
turning to the merits of the instant petition for review,we conclude that the bia determination that the farc did not target on account of a political opinion it imputed to him is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.we have long recognized that a person can be eligible for asylum if he faces the prospect of persecution on account of imputed,as well as actual,political beliefs.see,lukwago,at p ersecution may be on account of a political opinion the applicant actually holds or on account of one the persecutor has imputed to him.citation omitted.the majority of our sister circuits have likewise held that an alien may base a persecution claim on imputed political opinion.chen holder,wl,at cir,accord haider holder,cir holder,cir singh mukasey,cir delgado mukasey,cir rivera att y,cir,cir.
in determining whether an asylum applicant was persecuted because of an imputed political opinion,we focus on whether the persecutor attributed a political opinion to the victim,and acted upon the attribution.amanfi ashcroft,cir citation omitted.this focus on whether the persecutor or persecutor attributes a political view to the victim makes clear that the ina makes motive critical and an asylum applicant must provide some evidence of motive,direct or circumstantial,at quoting,at.although cognizant of this emphasis upon a persecutor motive,the courts of appeals have at the same time recognized that it would be patently absurd to expect an applicant to produce documentary evidence of a persecutor motives,chavarria,at quotation marks and citations omitted,since persecutors are hardly likely to submit declarations explaining exactly what motivated them to act.parussimova mukasey,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.accordingly,in certain cases,the factual circumstances alone may constitute sufficient circumstantial evidence of a persecutor motives.gonzales,cir further explaining that circumstantial evidence of motive may include,inter alia,the timing of the persecution and signs or emblems left at the site of persecution quotation marks and citations omitted see also chavarria,at.
in finding that failed to establish that farc motives for pursuing him related to actual or imputed political beliefs,the bia relied almost exclusively upon the supreme court decision in in defending the bia decision,the government likewise rests heavily upon.owing to its importance in this case,therefore,a detailed review of that decision is in order.
in,the petitioner was a young man from guatemala who was approached by guerrillas and urged to join their movement.at.the petitioner resisted this attempt at recruitment because,according to his testimony,the guerrillas are against the government and he was afraid that the government would retaliate against him and his family if he did join the guerrillas.id.at.the ij and the bia concluded that the guerrillas attempted recruitment did not constitute persecution on account of the petitioner political beliefs,but the ninth circuit ruled that acts of conscription by a nongovernmental group constitute persecution on account of political opinion,and determined that had a fear of such conscription.id.
the supreme court reversed.as the court explained,had not only failed to demonstrate that he resisted the recruitment efforts on account of his political beliefs,but his testimony revealed just the opposite to be he resisted out of fear of governmental retaliation which is not a political opinion 
even a person who supports a guerrilla movement might resist recruitment for a variety of of combat,a desire to remain with one family and friends,a desire to earn a better living in civilian life,to mention only a few.the record in the present case not only failed to show a political motive on part it showed the opposite.he testified that he refused to join the guerrillas because he was afraid that the government would retaliate against him and his family if he did so.nor is there any indication assuming,arguendo,it would suffice that the guerrillas erroneously believed that refusal was politically based.
id.at.the court likewise rejected the petitioner suggestion that the guerrillas would automatically construe his resistance to their recruitment efforts as being political in nature.the court explained that such resistance could just as easily be explained by indifference,indecisiveness,and risk averseness,and that had failed to present any evidence that the guerrillas would persecute him because of his political opinion,rather than because of his refusal to fight with them.id.at.
the bia more or less treated as dispositive of asylum claim,and the government urges that we do the same.as the bia concluded and the government argues,there are certain obvious similarities between this case and.as in,was subjected to an effort at recruitment by a guerrilla organization,and,as in our case,the attempted recruitment in was accompanied by threats.see id.at.and,as was true in,produced no direct evidence that the guerrillas targeted him,at least in part,on account of their perception of his political views id.at.at first blush,then,the similarities between the two cases lend some support to the bia rejection of asylum claim.
there are,however,important factual distinctions between and this case that the bia did not consider.these factual distinctions lead us to conclude that a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to find that the farc pursuit of stemmed,at least in part,from a political opinion it imputed to him.camara,at citation omitted,in other words,is not dispositive of claim,and the bia overlooked the significance of certain critical facts in the record that clearly distinguish case from.
the first such fact is close,direct affiliation with,and support of,the colombian government and military.quite unlike the record in,in which there was no suggestion whatsoever that the petitioner had any ties to the guatemalan government,made his living by supporting the colombian government,military,and military academy through the provision of food and other services.although we have not made the point expressly,the ninth circuit has long found persecution of those who work for or with political figures to be on account of the political opinion of their employer even if the nature of their work for or with that person is not in itself political.navas,cir accord sagaydak gonzales,cir viktor was aligned with the political opinion of his employer simply by the fact that he worked as a government official enforcing government policies,at where a teacher taught literacy classes for a organization,her presumed affiliation with the guatemalan entity the guerrillas the functional equivalent of a conclusion that she holds a political opinion opposite to that of the guerrillas,whether or not she actually holds such an opinion.quotation marks omitted velarde ins,cir.
is instructive on this point and highly relevant to our case.the petitioner in that case worked for conalfa,a literacy agency in guatemala,at.she was approached by a guerrilla who,like the farc agents in our case,informed her that the guerrillas wanted her to work for them instead of for conalfa.id.at.the guerrilla informed the petitioner that the guerrillas opposed her literacy work,threatened her,and told her that she would have to decide which one you going to work with.id.the petitioner fled to the united states and applied for asylum the ij rejected her asylum claim and the bia affirmed.
the ninth circuit granted the petition for review,holding that had been persecuted on account of a political opinion that the guerrillas had imputed to her by virtue of her employment with a organization.as the court explained,a bsent her affiliation with the government and its push for literacy among guatemalans,petitioner likely would not have come to the guerrillas attention.id.at.in an analysis that is directly applicable to asylum claim,the court observed that 
petitioner presumed affiliation with the guatemalan entity the guerrillas the functional equivalent of a conclusion that she holds a political opinion opposite to that of the guerrillas,whether or not she actually holds such an opinion.this is the crux of the idea covered by the doctrine of imputed political opinion in refugee and asylum law.accordingly,we hold that any reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that petitioner suffered persecution,at least in part,due to this imputed political opinion.
according to the bia,petitioner experiences resulted from attempted recruitment,displeasure with the respondent profession,and nothing more than the general strategy of the guatemalan guerrillas to create civil disorder.these descriptions are not borne out by the record in this case.petitioner plainly suffered this experience specifically because of her affiliation with the government each of the bia attempts to nullify the political overtones of petitioner experiences overlooks both the fact that she was affiliated with the government and the obvious inference that her continued teaching meant opposition to the guerrillas goals.
id.at internal citations omitted.
we agree with this analysis,and,as was the case in,we believe that a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude that the political opinions that the guerrillas imputed to were at least one central reason for the farc threats.b b i.as was true in,was not directly employed by the colombian government,but he was closely affiliated with the government,provided support to the government,and he depended upon the government for his livelihood.id.at.and as in,it was exclusively affiliation with,and access to,the colombian government and military that brought him to the guerrillas attention in the first place.id.at.there is absolutely no suggestion from the record that the farc would have pursued to become an informant if he had not been so closely associated with the government and military,and,indeed,the entirety of the evidence is to the contrary.to conclude,as the bia did,that there was no political link to the farc threats,app.at,would require either that one turn a blind eye to the factual circumstances surrounding the farc pursuit of,or that one adopt an impermissibly narrow construction of the term political opinion.see delgado mukasey,cir being and is a political opinion for asylum purposes.
indeed,as argues,we have determined that the bia erred in failing to impute political opinions under more tenuous circumstances than those presented in this case.in chavarria,the petitioner was essentially apolitical,but,acting as a good samaritan,he came to the aid of two women who were being attacked by paramilitaries in guatemala.chavarria,at.the two women,it turns out,were members of conavigua,an human rights organization,and the petitioner was subsequently followed and threatened by the paramilitaries who had attacked the women.id.we held that chavarria fear was clearly on account of an imputed political opinion and rejected the ij and bia determinations to the contrary,finding that the agency conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence.id.at.we explained 
here,chavarria testified that,before the first incident with the conavigua women,he was essentially apolitical.as we noted earlier,he then offered substantial and compelling testimony that after the incident he was put under surveillance by the same men who perpetrated the attack on the conavigua women.there is no evidence casting any doubt on this testimony,and we think it clear that the paramilitaries targeted chavarria because they ascribed to him an association with the conavigua group that,at minimum,could be sympathies.
id.it goes without saying that affiliation with,and support of,the colombian government was much more significant than was chavarria fleeting association with two members of the conavigua group in short,the bia overlooked the obvious political overtones in the farc pursuit of,who would have been of no interest to the guerrillas but for his,close association with the colombian government,at.
there are two additional significant facts,overlooked by the ij and the bia,that distinguish this case from.first,unlike the petitioner in,engaged in protracted resistance to the farc recruitment efforts.in,the petitioner was approached by guerrillas on a single occasion refused their single effort at recruitment without,apparently,expressing any political views and fled to the united states.see,at.by contrast,in this case,the family was approached by the farc on multiple occasions,including the occasion in which the farc agents approached ximena on the street,and was repeatedly asked to serve as an informant and to cease providing food to the military.second and more importantly,although the translation of his testimony could be clearer,it is apparent that,unlike,made his views known to his persecutors in rejecting their advances.in describing one of his exchanges with a farc caller,testified as follows they just stated that no moment would i accept because they go against my principles.at,at no time because with the experience that i had my hatred of them was complete and i,i wanted them to be enemies.app.at.
there are two possible ways to interpret the first of these sentences either that stated directly to his farc pursuer that he would not inform for them because the farc went against his principles,or that a member of the farc stated to that would not join the farc because the farc went against his principles.under either interpretation,the significant point is that testimony demonstrates unmistakably that the farc was aware that refusal to work for the guerrillas stemmed from his principles.unlike in,where it was unclear whether the petitioner resistance to the guerrillas was motivated by political beliefs or indifference,indecisiveness,and risk averseness,at,in this case we know and,more importantly,the farc knew that resistance was motivated at least in part by his sentiment.the guerrillas continued threats in the face of stated opposition to the farc demonstrate a close nexus between the farc threats and political opinions that was absent in.
in this respect,even if the bia concluded that was not initially targeted on account of imputed political beliefs a conclusion that,as we noted above,is undermined by the principles of,he was eventually threatened,at least in part,on account of his political beliefs.that is,a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude that the farc,by threatening a person after that person made his views known,had threatened persecution at least in part on account of the victim political beliefs.as the second circuit has explained 
p ersecution on account of one ground does not preclude a fear of future persecution on account of another.the petitioner did testify,as the bia emphasized,that the farc initially targeted her because of her knowledge of her computers,a reason unrelated to political opinion.but she also testified that she would be targeted by the farc in the future for betraying them,which,when coupled with the government unwillingness to control the farc,could well qualify as persecution for an imputed political opinion opposition to the farc.
delgado,at.threatening a person with death for not collaborating with the farc,after the recipient of the threat made clear that his refusal was because they go against his principles,is persecution on account of political beliefs.app.at.
although our review of the bia conclusion that a person does not have a fear of persecution is deferential,the bia may not simply overlook evidence in the record that supports the applicant case.see binrashed,at see also,at mema gonzales,cir an applicant for asylum is entitled to a reasoned analysis,not one which wholly disregards relevant,probative evidence.in this case,the bia overlooked the inescapable political overtones in the farc pursuit of,and it completely disregarded evidence showing that the farc knew of principles,even as the guerrillas threatened him for not betraying those principles.under these circumstances,a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude that the threats levied by the farc were motivated,at least in part,by a political opinion the farc imputed to.see b b.
in granting petition,we do not hold that any person affiliated with a foreign government who is threatened by an organization has necessarily been threatened on the basis of imputed political opinion.in this case,testified about his association with the colombian government and military,made his living by providing support to those institutions,would not have come to the guerrillas attention but for his relationship with the government and military,rebuffed repeated overtures from the farc to join with them,and expressly made his opinions known to the farc agents attempting to recruit him.under these circumstances,the bia conclusion that the farc threats were not centrally motivated by a political opinion the guerrillas imputed to is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
for the foregoing reasons,we will grant the petition for review.
there are two petitions under review in this of which includes his wife as a derivative claimant and that of his adult daughter,ximena.the petitions arise out of the same set of facts,which center around social and business activities and his connections to the colombian military and government.for the sake of simplicity,we refer to petitioners collectively as,except where it is necessary to identify them individually.
the ij expressly stated that she found testimony with respect to the farc pursuit of him to become their informant to be credible.app.at.
the transcript of the immigration proceedings is replete with errors,and numerous words of the testimony are simply labeled indiscernible.petitioners complained during the proceedings that testimony was being poorly translated,and they raised this issue as well as a concern over the inadequacy of the transcript on appeal before the bia,but they do not raise it here.
the underlined portion of the testimony quoted here appears to contain an error in translation or transcription,in that the first word clearly should be i,not they.it makes little sense for the farc to have informed that he would not inform for them because they go against his,said this to the caller,not the reverse.this reading is supported by the next sentence,which explains why at no time would espinosa inform for the farc.as we explain below,however,whether or not
