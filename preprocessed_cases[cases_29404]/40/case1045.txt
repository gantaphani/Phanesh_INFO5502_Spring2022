opinion of the court 
for the second time in just over five years,a group of new jersey blueberry farmers collectively,plaintiffs appeals orders of the district court granting summary judgment to defendant novartis crop protection,novartis on plaintiffs claims for damage to their crops allegedly caused by use of a pesticide manufactured and distributed by novartis.
the principal issues on appeal are whether plaintiffs claims of negligent,violation of the new jersey consumer fraud act njcfa,and are preempted by the federal insecticide,fungicide,and rodenticide act fifra,a comprehensive regulatory statute that covers the use,sale,and labeling of pesticides whether plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that they relied on the alleged misrepresentations by novartis to avoid summary judgment on their negligent and njcfa claims and whether novartis was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs strict product liability,design defect claim on the ground that novartis owed no duty to test its pesticide when mixed with fungicides.
we conclude that because plaintiffs negligent and njcfa claims are based on alleged misrepresentations in novartis marketing brochure,and that brochure does not qualify as labeling under fifra,those claims are not preempted.we further conclude that plaintiffs,other than plaintiff indian brand farms,have tendered prima facie evidence of their reliance on novartis alleged written misrepresentations.accordingly,we will vacate the district court grant of summary judgment as to the negligent and njcfa claims as to all plaintiffs except indian brand farms and remand for further proceedings.we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to novartis on these claims as to indian brand farms.
because plaintiffs claim,if successful,would not result in a labeling requirement in addition to or different from those required by fifra,the claim is not preempted,and further proceedings on that claim are required.finally,we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to plaintiffs design defect claim,and summary judgment in novartis favor was inappropriate.
background 
for several years,plaintiffs treated their blueberry plants with two of novartis pesticides,diazinon wp and diazinon wp and,respectively.before applying wp and,plaintiffs would combine them with fungicides called captan and captec in a process known as tank mixing.plaintiffs assert that tank mixing is a common practice that is well known in the industry,and while using wp and in this manner,they experienced no crop damage.
in the spring of plaintiffs purchased and began using diazinon,a new pesticide produced and marketed by novartis,and plaintiffs tank mixed with captan and captec in the same manner they had tank mixed wp and.was indicated for use on different plants,one of which was blueberries.novartis did not recommend,however,on the product label or orally,that growers mix with captan or captec,and the product label warned purchasers that unintended consequences such as crop injury could result from the presence of other materials,or the manner of use or application.app.at.
the product label is a document that is divided into directions for use and conditions of sale and warranty.the conditions of sale and warranty are contained in the first two paragraphs of the label,and the directions for use take up the remainder,containing multiple subparagraphs and charts covering various crop and pest types.the label does not specify that contains an inert ingredient called an ionic because the united states environmental protection agency epa does not require manufacturers to identify the inert ingredients of a product on the label unless the agency has determined that a particular inert ingredient is of toxicological concern.see d c g labeling requirements for pesticides and devices,because the identity of an inert ingredient is protected from disclosure by fifra d c,a prerequisite for labeling identification of such ingredients is that the agency make a finding that disclosure is necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
novartis distributed advertising literature stating that was safer and more effective than its previous products.this literature was in the form of a,marketing brochure stating that had t he same powerful product performance,i ncreased safety to users and the environment,and promoted b etter crop safety with equal performance.app.at.the marketing brochure contained no instructions for use of.the brochure was distributed to,among others,product retailers and scientists at the rutgers university cooperative extension,a part of the rutgers new jersey agricultural experiment station.as a result of these marketing efforts,these scientists recommended to new jersey blueberry farmers,both at a twilight meeting of farmers in may and via the may,edition of the blueberry bulletin,a newsletter published by rutgers.
contrary to these claims of crop safety,plaintiffs contend that,when mixed with the fungicides captan and captec,caused systemic injury to their blueberry plants,including blotches,depressions,spots on the plants,and even plant death.plaintiffs allege that this injury was due to the presence of an ionic surfactant,which was not an ingredient of wp or.plaintiffs allege that this ingredient,about whose inclusion in plaintiffs were unaware,when mixed with the fungicides,caused the damage to their plants.
plaintiffs filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on may,seeking damages based on claims of strict liability under the new jersey products liability act njpla in that had a latent design defect and novartis failed to warn that could be harmful to crops if mixed with a fungicide negligence in that novartis was negligent in failing to test before putting it in the stream of commerce negligent in that novartis marketed as controlling insects without having adverse effects on plants,when novartis knew or should have known that this was false breach of the njcfa in that novartis deceptively represented that was safe to use on blueberry plants and breach of express warranty in that novartis warranted that would conform to the chemical description on its label and would not injure plants.
following discovery,novartis moved for summary judgment,arguing,inter alia,that plaintiffs claims were preempted by fifra.the district court agreed and granted the motion.plaintiffs then appealed to this court.
on appeal,this court concluded,in light of the intervening case of bates dow agrosciences llc,in which the supreme court clarified the scope of fifra preemption,that plaintiffs claims of strict product liability,negligent testing of,and breach of express warranty were not preempted by fifra,and it reversed the district court grant of summary judgment on those claims for that reason.mortellite novartis crop protection,cir.with respect to plaintiffs claims of negligent and violation of the njcfa,to the extent that they were based on oral misrepresentations by novartis,we ruled that they were not preempted by fifra.however,to the extent that these claims were based on written misrepresentations,we remanded them to the district court,because the preemption issue with respect to these claims had not been fully briefed and argued on appeal.we remanded plaintiffs claim as well,also because the issue of whether they were preempted by fifra was not fully briefed and argued on appeal.
following remand,novartis filed several summary judgment motions,and in a series of rulings,the district court once again granted summary judgment to novartis on all of plaintiffs claims.the district court concluded that,to the extent plaintiffs claims of negligent and violation of the njcfa were based on written misrepresentations by novartis,they were preempted by fifra,because the marketing brochure qualified as labeling under the statute.alternatively,the district court concluded that even if these claims were not preempted,summary judgment was appropriate because the record reflects plaintiffs never received relied upon any written representations outside of the product label before purchasing and using.indian brand farms,novartis crop protection,dist.lexis,at.to the extent plaintiffs negligent and njcfa claims were based on alleged oral misrepresentations by novartis,the district court ruled that there is no evidence that any oral representations were made by novartis regarding the use of diazinon relied upon by plaintiffs.id.at.regarding plaintiffs claim,the district court concluded that success on this claim would impose a labeling requirement in addition to the requirements set forth in fifra,and thus this claim was preempted.id.at.with reference to plaintiffs design defect claim the district court concluded that tank mixing of was not a reasonably foreseeable use of the product,and it was not practical,feasible,and reasonable,as a matter of law,to require novartis to have tested its product in combination with every fungicide for use on all plants.indian brand farms,novartis crop protection,slip op.at.
plaintiffs once again appeal 
ii.preemption and the alleged waiver of efficacy jurisdiction 
we first briefly address an overarching contention of plaintiffs.they insist that there can be no fifra preemption of any form of crop damage claim because congress granted the epa authority to waive its jurisdiction over pesticide efficacy issues and the epa has opted in favor of exercising that authority.it follows,in plaintiffs view,that there is no federal regulation of product efficacy and,accordingly,no preemption.we can not agree for a number of reasons.
first,this case does not involve the efficacy of.plaintiffs do not allege that it fails to perform in the manner intended with respect to targeted pests rather,they complain about plant damage,which in fifra terminology is damage to the environment.j the term environment includes all plants e the information required to assess hazards to nontarget organisms is derived from tests to determine pesticidal effects on plants.kuiper am.cyanamid,cir concluding that corn is a plant and falls within this definition etcheverry,cal stating that with regard to crop damage claims,the epa waiver of the submission of efficacy data is irrelevant,since plaintiffs complain of phytotoxicity,not inefficacy.
moreover,congress did not authorize the epa to waive its jurisdiction over efficacy issues,and the epa has not done so.the authority referred to see footnote,supra is authority only to waive data requirements pertaining to efficacy when passing on an application for initial registration of a pesticide.if there is cause for concern about crop damage,initially or thereafter,the epa will respond by requiring additional data and,if appropriate,changes in label warnings it is thus not the case that the epa no longer regulates efficacy.
finally,we held when this case was first before us,based upon bates,that plaintiffs claim was preempted if it imposed a labeling requirement different from or in addition to the labeling requirement imposed by fifra.plaintiffs broad sweeping waiver of efficacy jurisdiction argument is inconsistent with that holding and,accordingly,with the law of the case.
iii.the negligent and njcfa claims 
as noted,the district court held that plaintiffs claims of negligent and violation of the njcfa are preempted by fifra.we turn to that issue.fifra sets up the basic system of pesticide regulation in the united states,and it covers,inter alia,the use,sale,and labeling of pesticides.fifra requires a manufacturer seeking to register a pesticide to submit to the epa a complete copy of the labeling of the pesticide,a statement of all claims to be made for it,any directions for its use,and a full description of the tests made and the results thereof upon which the claims are based,or alternatively a citation to supporting data that appear in the public literature.c c,f.the epa will register the pesticide if it determines that the pesticide is efficacious and will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on humans and the environment,and that its label complies with fifra prohibition on misbranding.mortellite,at.under fifra,a pesticide is misbranded if its labeling contains statements that are false or misleading in any particular,the pesticide labeling does not contain directions for use which are necessary for effecting the purpose for which the product is intended,or the label does not contain a warning or caution statement which may be necessary to protect health and the environment.q.
importantly for present purposes,fifra provides that a state may regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device in the state,but only if and to the extent the regulation does not permit any sale or use prohibited by this act.a.additionally,it provides that states shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging in addition to or different from those required under this act.b.thus,the states have joint control with the federal government in regulating the sale and use of pesticides with only the exception of the epa exclusive supervision of labeling.novartis does not contend that the state law relied upon by plaintiffs permits a sale or use prohibited by fifra.accordingly,the preemption issue before us turns not on whether novartis brochure is related to the sale or use of a pesticide,but rather on whether it constitutes labeling within the meaning of fifra.moreover,even if the brochure constitutes labeling,the law relied upon by plaintiffs is not preempted unless it imposes a requirement or requirements in addition to or different from those required under fifra.bates,at.
in bates,a group of texas peanut farmers alleged that a newly marketed pesticide manufactured and distributed by defendant dow severely damaged their crops.the pesticide bore a label stating that use of the pesticide was recommended in all areas where peanuts are grown,but the farmers alleged that dow should have known that the pesticide would stunt the growth of peanuts in soils with ph levels of or greater.bates,at.when the farmers applied the pesticide to their western texas farms,where the soil typically has a ph level of or higher,crops were damaged.the farmers brought claims of strict product liability,negligence,fraud,breach of warranty,and violation of the texas deceptive trade practices act.bus.ann,et.in the course of determining whether these claims were preempted by fifra,the supreme court articulated the following test 
for a particular state rule to be,it must satisfy two conditions.first,it must be a requirement for labeling or packaging rules governing the design of a product,for example,are not.second,it must impose a labeling or packaging requirement that is in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter.a state regulation requiring the word poison to appear in red letters,for instance,would not be if an epa regulation imposed the same requirement.
id.at italics in original.
the supreme court in bates held that plaintiffs claims of strict product liability,negligent testing,and breach of express warranty were not preempted,because n one of these common law rules requires that manufacturers label or package their products in any particular way concluded that plaintiffs claims under the texas deceptive trade practices act were not preempted,to the extent that statute might provide a remedy for the breach of an express warranty and remanded the case to the court of appeals to determine whether,consistent with the supreme court reasoning,plaintiffs fraud and claims were preempted.id.at.
fifra defines label as the written,printed,or graphic matter on,or attached to,the pesticide or device or any of its containers or wrappers.p.fifra defines labeling as 
all labels and all other written,printed,or graphic matter 
a accompanying the pesticide or device at any time or 
b to which reference is made on the label or in literature accompanying the pesticide or device,except to current official publications of the environmental protection agency,the united states departments of agriculture and interior,the department of health and human services,state experiment stations,state agricultural colleges,and other similar federal or state institutions or agencies authorized by law to conduct research in the field of pesticides.
p.it is undisputed that the marketing brochure was not on,or attached to,and so it can not qualify as a label.it is equally unquestionable,though,that the brochure qualifies as all other written,printed,or graphic matter.given that the brochure is not referenced on the label,and that there is no other writing accompanying the product which references it,the question of whether the brochure qualifies as labeling thus comes down to whether the brochure was accompanying,as that term is used in the statute.the case law on the meaning of accompanying in this and similar contexts is sparse but helpful.
the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act of june,et,defined labeling as all labels and other written,printed,or graphic matter upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers,or accompanying such article.kordel united states.the term label was defined as a display of written,printed,or graphic matter upon the immediate container of any article.id.at.the supreme court was asked in kordel to determine whether this definition of labeling,similar to that in fifra,covered sales literature that was not distributed with a drug.the court declined to read accompanying such article as limited to materials accompanying such article in the package or container.rather,it was the content of the materials,not their physical proximity,that controlled 
one article or thing is accompanied by another when it supplements or explains it,in the manner that a committee report of the congress accompanies a bill.no physical attachment one to the other is necessary.it is the textual relationship that is significant.
the court acknowledged that congress had not intended that the labeling provisions of the act regulate drug advertising generally.it held,however,that advertising matter was nevertheless labeling where it performs the same function as it would if it were on the article or on the containers or wrappers.id.at.the supreme court concluded that the particular material before it was labeling because it instructed the ultimate users how to use the drugs 
it explained their uses.nowhere else was the purchaser advised how to use them.it constituted an essential supplement to the label attached to the package.
justice black dissenting opinion agreed with this aspect of the court decision.he summarized the court holding as follows 
i agree that a drug is misbranded within the meaning of the statute if false and misleading written,printed,or graphic matter is either placed upon the drug,its container or wrappers,or used in the sale of the drug as a supplement to the package label to advise consumers how to use the drug.
the decision of the second circuit in new york state pesticide coalition,jorling,cir,appears to be the only federal appellate decision which speaks directly to the meaning of accompanying in the context of fifra.it too focuses on the content of material alleged to be labeling,rather than the manner of its distribution,and on whether it instructs the ultimate user on how to use the product.
in jorling,the court resolved the question of whether a new york law,designed to assure public awareness that poisonous chemicals are being utilized,created labeling requirements under fifra,and was therefore preempted.id.at.the new york law at issue required all commercial pesticide applicators to enter into a written contract with the owner of the premises where extermination is to occur provide a list of the chemicals to be applied along with any warnings which appear on the pesticide label give the prospective purchaser a notification cover sheet which provides further warnings and safety information post signs on the perimeter of the premises,instructing persons not to enter the area for a hour period and in some instances notify the public in newspapers of prospective use over large tracts.id.at.
the plaintiffs in the case,a coalition of pesticide applicators,argued that the new york notification requirements constituted labeling under fifra and were therefore preempted because those provisions required additional written,printed,or graphic matter which accompan ies the pesticide or device at any time.id.at.the jorling court disagreed,concluding that even though these notification materials would be present in some spatial and temporal proximity to the pesticides,the materials would not accompany the pesticides,as that term is used under fifra.id.at.as the jorling court advised,l abeling is better understood by its relationship,rather than its proximity,to the product.id.the court instructed that fifra labeling is designed to be read and followed by the end user.id.it then concluded 
in enacting b,congress clearly sought to set minimum standards for pesticide labeling,see cox velsicol chemical,not to prevent states from regulating the sale and use of the poisonous chemical substances through mandatory written,printed,or graphic materials revealing the ingredients.
the district court properly noted that fifra prohibition of state labeling in addition to or different from that approved by the epa has as its main focus preserving the force of the information contained in the fifra label.notification requirements such as cover sheets,signs,and newspaper advertisements do not impair the integrity of the fifra label.rather,they serve to further the purpose of the statute by enlisting state aid to prevent unreasonable adverse effects of pesticide use on the environment.c.
to hold otherwise would preempt a wide range of state activities which congress did not subject to the jurisdiction of the epa.
while,as the district court stressed,these precedents do rule out physical proximity to the product as the controlling factor,they also speak persuasively to the necessity of constraining the scope of accompanying if congress intent is to be served.as the jorling court stressed,congress explicitly preserved the states right to regulate the sale and use of pesticides while reserving labeling to federal control.id.at.the labeling provisions of fifra were thus clearly not intended to regulate sales literature generally and the legal obligations that can arise therefrom.congress objective was much narrower.it sought to impose uniformity of labeling throughout the country,bates,at and to protect the integrity of that uniform labeling.jorling,at.
novartis marketing brochure can not be read as providing a supplement to the label.its function is to point out the advantages of the new product to wholesalers and retailers,as well as farmers.importantly,it contains no instructions for the use of.if we were to construe the term labeling as including the brochure,then all sales and marketing materials would necessarily be included within the scope of that term.we are confident that such was not the intent of congress.
in light of the foregoing,the district court erred when it concluded that novartis marketing brochure qualified as labeling under fifra.plaintiffs claims of negligent and violation of the njcfa are not preempted by fifra.
the district court,however,as an alternative basis for its summary judgment ruling on the claims of negligent and violation of the njcfa,concluded that the record reflects plaintiffs never received relied upon any written representations outside of the product label before purchasing and using.indian brand farms,dist.lexis,at.thus,the district court ruled that even if these claims were not preempted by fifra,and even if the statements in the marketing brochure were fraudulent misrepresentations,plaintiffs could not prevail because they failed to show that they relied on the statements to their detriment.we are unpersuaded by this alternative analysis.
in new jersey,a successful claim of fraud requires proof of five elements a material misrepresentation of a presently existing or past fact knowledge or belief by the defendant of its falsity an intention that the other person rely on it reasonable reliance thereon by the other person and resulting damages.gennari weichert.realtors.negligent misrepresentation is a n incorrect statement,negligently made and justifiably relied upon,and may be the basis for recovery of damages for economic loss sustained as a consequence of that reliance.rosenblum,adler.
regarding the reliance element,it is enough for a plaintiff to show indirect reliance.the new jersey supreme court has explained this concept in the following manner 
indirect reliance allows a plaintiff to prove a fraud action when he or she heard a statement not from the party that defrauded him or her but from that party agent or from someone to whom the party communicated the false statement with the intention that the victim hear it,rely on it,and act to his or her detriment.

t o state a claim under the njcfa,a plaintiff must allege each of three elements unlawful conduct by the defendants an ascertainable loss on the part of the plaintiff and a causal relationship between the defendants unlawful conduct and the plaintiff ascertainable loss.citizen action.the proscribed unlawful conduct includes,inter alia,any unconscionable commercial fraud,false pretense,or misrepresentation and the knowing omission of any material fact with intent that others rely upon such omission.stat.ann.while the required causal relationship may be shown under some circumstances without evidence that would satisfy the reliance requirement of common law fraud,evidence of the kind of indirect reliance which satisfies the common law requirement would clearly satisfy the causal relationship requirement of the njcfa.see varacallo.mut.life ins.
plaintiffs concede that there was no credible evidence that they directly relied on the brochure before purchasing and applying.pl.reply br.at.plaintiffs contend,though,that they have made a sufficient showing of indirect reliance to avoid summary judgment,given the evidence regarding the recommendations of by rutgers scientists at a twilight meeting in may,and the blueberry bulletin that was published on may.we agree with plaintiffs as to all plaintiffs except indian brand farms.
sridhar polavarapu of rutgers testified that he relied on the marketing brochure in recommending to the farmers at the twilight meeting that they purchase and use on blueberries 
q at one of these twilight meetings,did you talk about the new product,
a yes,i do recall talking about the new product.
q and do you remember which meeting that was,doctor 
a that more than likely the may meeting,yeah.
q do you remember what you said about it 
a i probably said what i said in the newsletter,which is,you know,this is a newer product that is coming here and it is purportedly to be safer to the environment and because it does have solvents.basically,i would have said what is provided to me the information,as per the information from the manufacturer.
q okay.so,as we sit here today,what you do recall is that you did say something to the effect that it was purported to be a safer product,the 
a it based on what i learned from the literature.
a i would have said something like that.
app.at.further,polavarapu testified that he relied on the marketing brochure in writing the blueberry bulletin article recommending the use of on blueberries 
and as you sit here today,you do recall reading something regarding better crop safety that was sent to you by novartis back before you had the twilight meeting with the farmers 
q and this written material that was sent to you by novartis did say specifically something to the effect that it was better for crop safety 
q and again,the only things you can think of now that were given to you by novartis as you sit here today that you relied upon to make that statement regarding crop safety in the blueberry bulletin was the brochure of three or four pages 
plaintiffs,in turn,certified testified that they relied upon the twilight meeting recommendation of polavarapu and the blueberry bulletin in purchasing and mixing in light of this evidence,plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that they indirectly relied upon the marketing brochure in making their decision to purchase or apply.
novartis raises an issue,however,based on the dates of plaintiffs purchase and use of,as to whether plaintiffs could have indirectly relied on the brochure.novartis points out that most plaintiffs purchased or used prior to the may,publication date of the blueberry bulletin.see footnote,supra.however,this does not resolve whether the two plaintiffs who clearly purchased and used after may.cappuccio sons and clark so in reliance on the blueberry bulletin.nor does it negate the possibility that plaintiffs relied on polavarapu recommendation at the earlier twilight meeting.the testimony in the record indicates different dates for the twilight meeting,but construing this testimony in a light most favorable to plaintiffs,plaintiffs with the exception of indian brand farms have demonstrated that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the farmers indirectly relied on the representations in the marketing brochure in their decision to purchase and mix.
the problem for plaintiff indian brand farms is that it purchased on april,and it applied on may,before either the twilight meeting or the publication of the blueberry bulletin.thus,indian brand farms is the only plaintiff that is temporally excluded from having indirectly relied on the marketing brochure.
in light of the foregoing,the district court grant of summary judgment to novartis on the claims of negligent and violation of the njcfa based on written representations will be reversed as to all plaintiffs except indian brand farms.the district court grant of summary judgment on these claims as to plaintiff indian brand farms will be affirmed.
our discussion of the district court alternative holding regarding plaintiffs claims of negligent and violation of the njcfa has thus far been limited to claims based on written representations.as noted in part above,the district court also granted summary judgment to novartis on the negligent and njcfa claims to the extent they were based on alleged oral misrepresentations.we will affirm this grant of summary judgment,because we agree with the district court that plaintiffs have failed to identif y with any certainty any oral representations made by novartis regarding the use of that they relied on.indian brand farms,dist.lexis,at.
iv.the claim 
plaintiffs seek to impose liability on novartis for failing to warn of dangers to their crops from tank mixing with the fungicides captan and captec.plaintiffs contend that fifra requires labels to contain sufficient warnings,see q,and,accordingly,that their claim would only impose labeling requirements equivalent and parallel to those of fifra,not labeling requirements in addition to or different from those of fifra.
we note at the outset that prior to the supreme court decision in bates,several of our sister courts of appeals held that claims based on inadequate labeling were by fifra,on the reasoning that i n order to prevail on failure to warn claim s,plaintiffs would have to prove that product labels approved by the epa contained insufficient information and that different labels were warranted,and so a warding damages on the se claim s would therefore be tantamount to allowing the state s to regulate pesticide labeling indirectly,an action which is specifically prohibited by b.taylor ag indus,cir see also bice leslie poolmart,cir holding that claims are preempted by fifra because actual agency approval eliminates any possible claims under state tort law for failure to comply with federal labeling requirements internal quotation omitted macdonald monsanto,cir holding that the express language of fifra clearly indicates that congress intended that the federal act preempt conflicting state law,including state common law tort claims of gulf van waters rogers,cir to the extent that state tort claims in this case require a showing that defendants labeling and packaging should have included additional,different,or alternatively stated warnings from those required under fifra,they would be expressly preempted.worm am.cyanamid,cir the plaintiffs argument that their state law claims are based on duties not inconsistent with those imposed by fifra has no merit,because to argue that the warnings on the label are inadequate is to seek to hold the label to a standard different from the federal one.however,bates introduced a different analysis of fifra preemption,one that compels us to depart from this precedent.
as we have earlier explained,the bates court made clear that claims were not preempted unless they would impose a requirement in addition to or different from those required by fifra.bates,at.it stressed that it was thus endorsing a parallel requirements reading of b which preserved state law duties that are consistent with those imposed by fifra,whether or not state law provides a remedy that fifra did not provide id.the court noted that p rivate remedies that enforce federal misbranding requirements would seem to aid,rather than hinder,the functioning of fifra.id.at.
also,as earlier noted,the bates court,because of insufficient briefing,remanded the case to the court of appeals to determine whether the plaintiffs claim would impose any requirements in addition to or different from the requirements under fifra.in doing so,it provided guidance which we find helpful here.first of all,the remand established that mere inconsistency between the duty imposed by state law and the content of a manufacturer labeling approved by the epa at registration did not necessarily mean that the state law duty was preempted we must look to the requirements imposed by fifra.accordingly,the court suggested that,on remand,the court of appeals look to whether the claim was not equivalent to fifra misbranding standards.id.at.if equivalency is found between the claim and the statutory text,the court should determine whether there are any epa regulations that further refine those general standards in any way that is relevant to petitioners allegations.id to the extent that epa has promulgate d such regulations,they will necessarily affect the scope of preemption under b.id.at.
fifra misbranding provisions require warning s or caution statement s which may be necessary to protect health and the environment.q g.the term environment includes water,air,land,and all plants and man and other animals living therein j kuiper,at etcheverry,at.the njpla imposes liability on a manufacturer where the product causing the harm was not reasonably fit,suitable or safe for its intended purpose because it failed to contain adequate warnings or instructions.stat.ann.this provision has been interpreted as consistent with section of the restatement third of torts product liability,liability is imposed for inadequate warnings when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable warnings and the omissions of the warnings renders the product not reasonably safe.in the context of this case,this does not appear to us to impose a duty inconsistent with or in addition to the duty imposed by the text of the warning provisions of fifra misbranding requirements.moreover,novartis does not purport to have identified any duty imposed by new jersey law that does not come within this statutory text.nor has novartis identified any epa regulations that further refine those general standards in any way that is relevant to plaintiffs allegations.bates,u.at.and we have found none rather,novartis response to plaintiffs parallel requirements interpretation of the state law and fifra is an epa notice of revised policy on label claims for tank mixing issued in january.as its title indicates,the revised policy is directed to applications for registration where the proposed label,unlike that of,claims that the product is suitable for tank mixing.under the revised policy,the epa will usually approve tank mix label claims without supporting compatibility and residue data if certain specified conditions are met,including 
the chemical characteristics of all products to be used in the mix are such that no incompatibility or potentiation is likely to occur.the agency reserves the right to request appropriate data if it determines that a problem could arise.
pesticide registration pr notice.
while this policy revision was not applicable to,novartis finds it to be of controlling significance because its discussion of the background of the policy revision contains the following statements 
in the past,the agency has required that applications for new registration or for amended registration involving claims for tank mixing the pesticide product with another pesticide product be supported by compatibility data and,if the mixture is to be used on a food or feed crop,by residue data demonstrating that the mixture would not result in residues higher than the tolerance established for each active ingredient.however,in cases where the pesticide labels are silent on the matter of tank mixing,applicators have been permitted to use tank mixes at their own risk if the sites or crops on which the mix is to be used are registered sites and crops for all the pesticides contained in the mix and if all pertinent limitations,use directions,and precautions are followed.
id.emphasis added.
for novartis,this statement establishes that the epa regards fifra as imposing no label requirements for a warning of an unreasonable risk of plant damage from tank mixing so long as no tank mixing claim is made.novartis therefore concludes that plaintiffs claim imposes a labeling requirement not required by fifra.we are not persuaded.
bates teaches that there is a strong presumption against preemption of state law 
even if dow had offered us a plausible alternative reading of b indeed,even if its alternative were just as plausible as our reading of that would nevertheless have a duty to accept the reading that disfavors.b ecause the states are independent sovereigns in our federal system,we have long presumed that congress does not cavalierly causes of action.medtronic,at.in areas of traditional state regulation,we assume that a federal statute has not supplanted state law unless congress has made such an intention clear and manifest.new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,quoting rice santa fe elevator.
bates,at.given this admonition,we would be most reluctant to base a preemption holding on a background observation of the kind relied upon by novartis.
more importantly,however,this observation does not relate to the labeling requirements for manufacturers.rather,it is addressed to what applicators have been permitted to do where the manufacturers label makes no claim concerning tank mixing.the duty of manufacturers under fifra is to avoid misbranding,and that duty is not limited to the claims they make for their products.indeed,the fact that the epa does not share novartis view of the limitation on its duty to warn is apparent from the fact that,after plaintiffs crop damage was called to the attention of the epa,it required that a warning of risk of tank mixing be added to the label,even though the label continued to contain no claim of tank mixing.
the njpla imposes a requirement for a warning of risk to property which is consistent with section of the restatement third of torts products liability.that requirement is thus not an extraordinary one.it is consistent in scope with the generally accepted commercial expectation.moreover,we note that fifra expressly endorses a concept quite similar to new jersey duty to warn of risks associated with objectively foreseeable uses.section c provides in part as follows 
approval of registration 
the administrator shall register a pesticide if the administrator determines that,when considered with any restrictions imposed under subsection d 
a its composition is such as to warrant the proposed claims for it 
b its labeling and other material required to be submitted comply with the requirements of this act 
c it will perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment and 
d when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice it will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.
c emphasis added.we find it significant that congress found it advisable to include the provisions of d in addition to the intended function provisions of c.
given that congress in fifra imposed a generalized duty to include in one labeling any warning statement necessary to protect plant life and the fact that the epa has not seen fit to narrow that duty,we find no basis for concluding that new jersey law imposes a duty to warn different than or in addition to the scope of the requirement imposed by fifra.the district court judgment regarding plaintiffs claim will be reversed 
v.the design defect claim 
the final question before us is whether novartis was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs design defect claim.the njpla provides that 
a manufacturer or seller of a product shall be liable in a product liability action only if the claimant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the product causing the harm was not reasonably fit,suitable or safe for its intended purpose because it was designed in a defective manner.
stat.ann.plaintiffs insist that was designed in a defective manner,because it contained the ionic surfactant that plaintiffs allege caused the damage to their crops when was mixed with certain fungicides.
to succeed under a strict liability design defect theory in new jersey,a plaintiff must prove that the product was defective the defect existed when the product left the hands of the defendant and the defect caused the injury to a reasonably foreseeable user.jurado gear works.because this case involves a design defect,as distinguished from a manufacturing defect,plaintiff must show specifically that the product is not reasonably fit,suitable and safe for its intended or reasonably foreseeable purposes.id.quoting michalko cooke color chem,suter san angelo foundry mach.
the decision whether a product is defective because it is not reasonably fit,suitable and safe for its intended purposes reflects a policy judgment under a analysis that seeks to determine whether a particular product creates a risk of harm that outweighs its usefulness.id.under this analysis,a manufacturer is not liable for damages where a person misuses the product,unless that misuse was objectively foreseeable.see port auth.of arcadian,cir stating that the unforeseeable misuse of a product may not give rise to strict liability,because where the use of the product is beyond its intended or reasonably anticipated scope,an injury resulting from that use is not probative of whether the product was fit,suitable,and safe quoting suter,at.thus,the first step of the analysis is for the jury to determine whether the plaintiff used the product in an objectively foreseeable manner.jurado,at.
novartis contends that tank mixing,as a matter of law,was not a reasonably foreseeable use of.we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to that issue.the evidence in the summary judgment record would support a finding of fact that plaintiffs misuse of was objectively,that is reasonably,foreseeable.first,the economics and utility of tank mixing make it almost inevitable that such mixing will occur.see,app.at testimony of plaintiff gene martinelli if you apply more than one chemical and it is compatible,that one less time you have to go through the fields,expert report of carl whitcomb the tank mixing of insecticides with fungicides is common practice as it allows the farmer to address several problems with one spray application thereby saving time and equipment expense.second,several plaintiffs testified that tank mixing was a and common practice among farmers.see,app.at plaintiff russell franceschini stating that the prior versions of diazinon and captan has been mixed for years,plaintiff anthony melora w e always mixed the fungicide with insecticide.third,several plaintiffs testified that pesticide dealers and rutgers personnel recommended tank mixing with fungicides,which indicates industry practice.see,app.at plaintiff joyce cappuccio,plaintiff michael dimeo,plaintiff anthony dimeo,plaintiff joseph martinelli.finally,novartis own representatives testified that they were aware that farmers frequently mixed pesticides and fungicides.see,app.at.this evidence is sufficient for a jury to conclude that tank mixing pesticides and fungicides was a reasonably foreseeable practice.
novartis relies upon this court decision in arcadian in arguing that tank mixing was not a reasonably foreseeable use of.in arcadian,the plaintiff sought to hold the defendants,manufacturers of fertilizers,liable for massive damage resulting from the terrorist bombing of the world trade center in new york because the terrorists used the defendants fertilizers in constructing the explosive device.arcadian,at.one of plaintiff claims was a products liability claim under new jersey law,and he argued that defendants owed a duty to plaintiff,even though there is no allegation that the fertilizer products were dangerous in and of themselves.id.at.with reference to whether building an explosive was a foreseeable use of the fertilizer,we first explained that in new jersey,foreseeability means objective foreseeability,which 
means reasonable foreseeability.the standard does not affix responsibility for future events that are only theoretically,remotely,or just possibly foreseeable,or even simply subjectively foreseen by a particular manufacturer.rather it applies to those future occurrences that,in light of the general experience within the industry when the product was manufactured,objectively and reasonably could have been anticipated.
id.at quoting oquendo bettcher,quoting brown stove.we then agreed with the district court conclusion that 
no jury reasonably could conclude that one accidental explosion years ago,one terrorist act in this country almost years ago,and scattered terrorists incidents throughout the world over the course of the last years would make an incident like the world trade center bombing anything more than a remote or theoretical possibility.
id.at quoting port auth.of arcadian.at.
arcadian holds that not all misuses that would be perceived as possible by a reasonable seller are reasonably foreseeable misuses that can lead to seller liability.virtually all misuses are foreseeable as possibilities.given that the ultimate objective of the analysis is to determine whether a particular product creates a risk of harm that outweighs its usefulness,all possible misuses clearly can not be the basis for liability on the part of the seller.this does not mean,however,that misuses which a reasonable seller would believe likely to occur in the normal course of events need not be taken into account.such misuses are objectively foreseeable and must be considered.here,unlike in arcadian,there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a reasonable manufacturer in novartis position would have anticipated that plaintiffs mixing was likely to happen in the normal course of events 
after determining that the plaintiff used the product in an objectively foreseeable manner,the next step of the analysis requires the to determine whether the reasonably foreseeable risk of harm posed by the reasonably foreseeable use of the product could have been reduced or avoided by a reasonable alternative design.lewis am.cyanamid.in making this determination,the jury is,of course,called upon to assess what risks of harm were reasonably foreseeable.
on remand from this court prior decision in this case,the district court granted summary judgment to novartis on plaintiffs defective design claim because it determined that the risk of harm to plaintiffs crops posed by when mixed with certain fungicides was not foreseeable.it concluded that it could not find it practical,feasible,and reasonable,as a matter of law,to require the defendant to have tested its product in combination with every fungicide for use on all plants.indian brand farms,slip op.at.however,while it is correct to say that a manufacturer in novartis position has no duty to test every possible combination of ingredients for every possible misuse of a pesticide,it is not correct to say that a manufacturer is never chargeable with knowledge of the risks of harm that reasonable testing would have revealed.the issue boils down to what a reasonably prudent manufacturer would have done in the way of testing before introducing the product to the market.see restatement third of torts products liability cmt.m stating that a seller bears responsibility to perform reasonable testing prior to marketing a product and is charged with knowledge of what reasonable testing would reveal,and so i f testing is not undertaken,or is performed in an inadequate manner,and this failure results in a defect that causes harm,the seller is subject to liability,if there was a reasonable alternative design feldman lederle,stating that a reasonably prudent manufacturer will be deemed to know of reliable information generally available or reasonably obtainable in the industry or in the particular field involved.
here,the evidence would permit a finding of fact that a reasonably prudent manufacturer would have appreciated the significant risk of crop damage from the use of the ionic surfactant and that a reasonable alternative with less risk was available.plaintiffs produced two experts,james witt and carl whitcomb,who testified that the presence of the ionic surfactant in should have raised a red flag that the pesticide would be physically incompatible with fungicides.see app.at.novartis contends that there is a distinction between physical compatibility and whether the mixture would result in plant damage,but witt specifically stated that the incompatibility caused by the ionic surfactant can cause crop damage,id.at,and whitcomb specifically stated that it appears that the incompatibility and in turn the damage to the blueberry crops resulted from a compound s added to the other than the primary active ingredient.id.at.in addition,pavlis of rutgers testified that while physical incompatibility does not necessarily result in crop damage,it a good indication,because i f you get a problem in the jar testing for compatibility,then you most likely will get a problem in the field.id.at.
in addition,there is evidence that such incompatibility could have been discovered by conducting a simple test in which a pesticide and fungicide are mixed in a bottle to test compatibility,id.at,and witt testified that there was no need to test every combination of pesticides and fungicides for stability,only combinations commonly used in the areas designated for sale.id.at.
in contrast,the record contains no expert testimony to support novartis claim that it would have required testing of almost combinations of pesticides and fungicides in order to determine that there was a significant risk of crop damage.in addition,there is evidence that novartis did not conduct any compatibility testing at all before marketing and distributing.see id.at.it was only after the damage to the blueberry crops was reported that novartis tested the pesticide with other chemicals and found that several of the mixes were in fact incompatible.id.at.
the evidence of record raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the risk of harm to plaintiffs crops was foreseeable,and whether such risk of harm could have been reduced or avoided by a reasonable alternative design,a pesticide not containing an ionic surfactant accordingly,the district court erred when it granted summary judgment to novartis on plaintiffs design defect claim.
vi.conclusion 
we will affirm the judgment of the district court in novartis favor on indian brand farms claims of negligent and violation of the njcfa.we will also affirm the judgment in novartis favor on plaintiffs negligent and njcfa claims to the extent that they rely on oral representations by novartis.in all other respects,the judgment of the district court will be reversed,and this case will be remanded for further proceedings on all of plaintiffs other claims.
i am pleased to join judge stapleton opinion for the court in most respects.unlike my colleagues,however,i would hold that novartis had no duty to test for compatibility with the fungicides used by plaintiffs.i therefore would affirm the district court summary judgment on plaintiffs design defect claim under the new jersey products liability act.and because it follows a fortiori that novartis had no duty to warn plaintiffs about the results of a test it had no legal duty to conduct,i would affirm the district court summary judgment on plaintiffs implied claim as well.accordingly,i respectfully dissent from parts iv and v of the court opinion.
the extensive factual background and tortuous procedural history of this case are aptly recounted in judge stapleton thorough opinion,so i shall briefly mention only a few points relevant to my dissent.
plaintiffs fourth amended complaint includes two claims brought pursuant to the new jersey products liability act njpla,stat.ann.et.first,plaintiffs allege that was defectively designed because it contained an undisclosed ionic surfactant that harmed plaintiffs crops when tank mixed with certain fungicides regularly used by plaintiffs,such as captan and captec.although novartis did not in fact warned with fungicides during the application process,plaintiffs contend that novartis had a duty to test for adverse interactions with other agricultural chemicals before distributing it.second,plaintiffs aver that was defective because novartis failed to warn of the dangers inherent in tank mixing the pesticide with plaintiffs fungicides.
in parts iv and v of its opinion,the court holds that the district court erred in granting novartis summary judgment on both of plaintiffs njpla claims.because i believe plaintiffs practice of combining with various fungicides during the tank mixing process was not objectively foreseeable to novartis,i disagree.
i begin with plaintiffs claim for defective design.under the njpla,a plaintiff asserting a claim for defective design must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the product causing the harm was not reasonably fit,suitable or safe for its intended purpose because it was designed in a defective manner.stat.ann.when a product is used for something other than its specifically intended purpose,a plaintiff nonetheless may prevail on a design defect claim under the njpla by demonstrating that such use was reasonably foreseeable to the manufacturer.jurado western gear works,citations and quotation marks omitted.because it is undisputed that novartis designed as a pesticide and did not recommend applying it in conjunction with fungicides,plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that their tank mixing practice was a reasonably foreseeable misuse of the pesticide.id.at 
to determine whether the misuse of a product was reasonably foreseeable under the njpla,we apply an objective test.id.at.we do not ask whether a manufacturer was aware of previous instances in which its product had been similarly misused because such evidence tends to show only subjective foreseeability,which is irrelevant to the objective foreseeability analysis.port auth.of new york and new jersey arcadian,cir quoting oquendo bettcher,see also brown stove.instead,whether the misuse of a product is objectively thereby imposes a duty on the manufacturer to take steps to ensure that the product is safe for that ultimately a question of fairness and public policy.arcadian,at.for that reason,we have emphasized that f airness,not foreseeability alone,is the test for reasonable foreseeability under the njpla.id.at quoting kuzmic ivy hill park apartments.
it is in this assessment of the objective foreseeability of plaintiffs tank mixing of with fungicides where i part ways from my colleagues.the majority marshals a considerable amount of evidence to support its conclusion that tank mixing was a reasonably foreseeable misuse of.according to the majority,individual plaintiff farmers,pesticide dealers,and rutgers university scientists all testified that tank mixing pesticides with fungicides was a common and industry practice among blueberry farmers.furthermore,novartis sales representatives themselves acknowledged a general awareness that farmers often engage in tank mixing.
although such evidence suggests a subjective awareness on the part of novartis and others
