opinion of the court 
this appeal requires us to decide,as an issue of first impression,whether a plaintiff prima facie case in a title vii employment discrimination action fails if it is irrefutable that plaintiff does not meet a necessary objective qualification for the job 
factual background and procedural history 
appellant wagih makky emigrated to the united states from egypt thirty years ago,and became a naturalized citizen of the united states.he also became a prominent researcher and university professor in the field of aviation security,and is considered to be a technical expert in that field.after the bombing of a pan american airways airliner over lockerbie,scotland,the united states government asked makky to create a unit within the federal aviation administration faa,later subsumed into the transportation safety administration tsa,for the purpose of developing technology to detect and prevent explosives from being detonated aboard commercial planes and trains.he was one of six founding members of that project with a stated purpose of preventing terrorist attacks on american passenger jets.
according to makky complaint makky expertise in the detection of contraband and explosives is recognized throughout the world.app.at.he has authored many scientific papers,served on national committees,and has chaired international symposia on explosives detection technology.he is one of the nation foremost technical experts on transportation security.app.at.
makky has been married to his wife,an american citizen,for over years,and all of his close family members living in egypt have passed away with the exception of his two brothers.although egyptian law provides that a person born to an egyptian father is irrevocably an egyptian citizen,makky considers himself only an american citizen,and he does not possess an egyptian passport.
makky was employed by the united states government for the fifteen years between and.in,makky first applied for a security clearance due to his position as a senior fellow at the naval oceans systems center.he was approved and was granted a secret level security clearance.then,in,he accepted the position with the faa described above.in connection with that position,he was once again granted a secret level clearance and was stationed at the transportation security research and development division in atlantic city,new jersey.
in,makky security clearance was upgraded to top secret.at that time,makky notified the government via his clearance application that he had recently found out that egypt still considered him a dual citizen of that country,and he indicated that dual citizenship on the application.
makky performance reviews have rated him at exceptional and outstanding.app.at.makky job performance has been exemplary.app.at.he has been commended for his extraordinary technical insight.app.at.
makky was the only muslim and only person of arab descent in his division.according to his complaint,he has always been treated differently than the other members of the group on account of his national origin and religion.app.at.the person who hired makky told him that it was a mistake to hire someone of arab descent.another supervisor who spoke to a group of employees,including makky,stated,in the context of a conversation about a possible terrorist attack by islamic fundamentalists,muslims have no brains.app.at.following the september,attacks,makky faced increased prejudice and hostility at work.
security clearance renewal 
in march,makky submitted a required security clearance renewal application.according to makky,there were no material changes since his application,except that some of his family members had died so he had fewer connections with egypt.
in october,while the security clearance renewal was still pending,makky came under the supervision of robin burke when burke became deputy administrator of the security lab.according to the complaint,burke took an unusual interest in makky national origin.app.at.specifically,burke made it a point to meet with makky and inquired into makky background.app.at.the first and only thing burke wanted to know about makky was his national origin.app.at.makky was the only employee with whom burke met.
suspension with pay 
on march,the day the united states invaded iraq,the tsa,through burke,placed makky on paid administrative leave and,without giving any explanation,told him not to come to work.one week later,makky received a letter from burke stating that he had been placed on administrative leave as a result of questions concerning his security clearance.app.at.makky later learned that burke had obtained a copy of makky fbi file even though burke had no role in the security clearance process.burke continued to take an active interest in makky clearance.
in january,the associate deputy director of the office of transportation vetting credentialing otvc,joy fairtile,issued an initial determination to makky indicating that a determination was made to deny his security clearance application pending further review.the notice of suspension cited several security concerns,including makky dual citizenship,foreign relatives and associates,foreign countries he had visited,and alleged misuse of his government computer as reasons for the action.makky began the process of administrative appeal on april,by responding in writing.
on august,at burke direction,makky was given a notice of proposed suspension for an indefinite period,citing the security clearance revocation as the reason.makky responded on august,in writing and through counsel.
suspension without pay 
makky was paid throughout his almost two and a half years of administrative leave until september,when burke suspended makky indefinitely without pay.makky responded on december,with an oral presentation,and on december,with additional written responses.
on march,the tsa issued its final denial of security clearance to makky,signed by chief security officer douglas callen.the notice stated that makky had successfully mitigated all concerns about his security clearance except about foreign relatives and associates,whose identities were not disclosed.the basis for the concern stemmed from information in makky fbi report.a redacted version of makky fbi file had been released to him on august.this version did not contain information regarding the foreign associates.
makky also appealed his suspension to the merit systems protection board mspb or board on october.the administrative judge aj,michael garrety,held a hearing on january.in his decision,the aj noted that makky appeal challenged the tsa decision suspending him indefinitely without pay effective september.the aj stated that makky was entitled to the following procedural rights days advance written notice of the proposed action,stating the specific reasons for the action a reasonable amount of time to respond to the proposed action and to furnish documents in response the right to representation and a written decision on the action.the aj concluded that makky had an adequate opportunity to make a meaningful response,and that the aj could not review the determination not to permit makky access to certain information because it was not a permissible basis for review,see king alston.
makky argued that he had received disparate treatment on the basis of his national origin and religion.the aj acknowledged that the evidence that burke inquired into makky national origin when he first met him was unrebutted but nevertheless found that this evidence is insufficient to establish that membership in a protected category was a motivating factor in the agency indefinite suspension action.app.at.
makky also argued that rather than being suspended without pay he should have been able to remain in administrative leave status while the final outcome of the security clearance was being determined.the aj stated that because makky retention in administrative leave status was contrary to agency policy,app.at,it was not appropriate for him to remain in an administrative leave status.
the aj denied all of makky claims and informed him that the decision would become final on may.
makky petitioned the full board for review.the mspb denied the petition.thus,the order suspending makky without pay became final on august.on september,makky commenced suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.on january,the fbi responded to the request makky had previously made under the freedom of information act foia to obtain an unredacted copy of the previously redacted portions of his investigative file.it provided him with additional portions of his fbi file,including the relevant portion listing his foreign relatives and associates.thereafter,the district court dismissed makky case,and he filed a timely notice of appeal.
district court decision 
makky district court complaint contained seven claims employment discrimination under title vii,a count employment discrimination under the civil service reform act of,b csra count due process violations count violation of agency procedures under the csra count retaliation under the csra count violation of foia,a a count and violation of the privacy act,d count.appellees moved to dismiss the first three counts on the basis that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction they sought summary judgment on all other counts.
the district court based its jurisdiction on b because this is a mixed case involving allegations of employment discrimination as well as procedural violations.the court applied de novo review of the discrimination claim and deferential review,abuse of discretion to the nondiscrimination claims.appellees argued that the district court did not have jurisdiction to review the denial of makky security clearance and therefore it could not review his termination based upon the denial of the clearance.however,the court recognized that makky does not contest the security clearance determination.rather his sole argument is that the decision to place him on unpaid leave on september,was discriminatory because the tsa could have selected one of two less severe options app.at.the court noted that those options were transfer to a position not requiring a clearance or remaining on paid leave.thus,makky argued,the court had jurisdiction because it did not have to consider the merits of the security clearance to review the claims of discrimination under a theory.
the district court dismissed count of the complaint the title vii discrimination claim because even under a theory,the would not be able to weigh the nondiscriminatory reason proffered,the security clearance revocation,and therefore could not determine whether the alleged discrimination was a motivating factor or not.the court concluded,b ecause as a matter of law makky can not prevail on either a or a pretext theory,defendants motion to dismiss count one will be granted.app.at.
the court dismissed count and the part of count alleging discrimination because those counts were premised on the csra.with respect to the due process claims regarding failure to get information requested,failure to follow proper procedures,alleged in the remaining counts,the court,citing king,at,and cheney department of justice,concluded that the aj decision was not erroneous.
with respect to the claims under foia and the privacy act,the court held that the defendants met their burden to show that the documents at issue fell into a statutory exemption for material to be held secret in the interest of national security.the court also determined that an in camera review was not necessary.
on appeal,makky argues that the district court erred with respect to the title vii discrimination claim and the due process claim under the csra.he argues that his suspension without pay in september violated title vii because discrimination was a motivating factor in the decision to suspend him without pay rather than to transfer him to another position or continue to suspend him with pay.he also argues that he was entitled to the materials in his foia request prior to his suspension without pay.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over this appeal of a final judgment pursuant to.the district court had jurisdiction because this is a mixed case,one containing allegations of employment discrimination as well as allegations of procedural violations under the csra.see b.we review the district court grant of the government motion to dismiss the title vii claim de novo.see.employees benefit trust fund zeneca,cir.we also review the district court grant of the motion for summary judgment of makky due process claim de novo,and apply the same standard applicable in the district court.saldana kmart,cir.we review the agency decision on the administrative record to determine whether it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise unsupported by law or substantial evidence.see c.
discussiona.title vii claim 
although makky was dismissed from his position,his complaint is limited to tsa decision to suspend him without pay on september,which he claims was motivated by discriminatory animus.thus,he seeks back pay for the period between september,when the suspension took effect,and march,when his security clearance denial became final,on the theory that the government could have transferred him to a position not requiring a security clearance or could have kept him on a status.importantly,makky does not challenge as discriminatory the initial decision in january to deny his security clearance pending review or the decision to place him on leave with pay in march when the security clearance issue was first raised.we note that the initial decision to deny the security clearance and the later decision to suspend makky without pay are two discrete events.
makky argues that in addition to the security clearance denial,a motivating factor in the government decision to suspend him without pay was discriminatory animus.the government argues that we have no jurisdiction to review this claim because we can not review the merits of a security clearance denial and such review would be necessary to examine makky claim.the government also contends that even if we did have jurisdiction,makky can not prevail on his claim of discrimination because he was not qualified to do his job.
jurisdiction 
in department of the navy egan,d,a vii case,the supreme court held that there is no judicial review of the merits of a security clearance determination.that decision is exclusively for the executive.the court also stated that the denial of a security clearance is not an adverse action.id.at.thereafter,in stehney perry,cir,another vii case,we considered the claim of a mathematician for the nsa who was fired for refusing to take a polygraph test.she sued,alleging equal protection and due process violations,among other claims.the district court had dismissed all claims under egan.we upheld the dismissal but for different reasons.we stated if stehney had asked for review of the merits of an executive branch decision to grant or revoke a security clearance,we would agree.but not all claims arising from security clearance revocations violate separation of powers or involve political questions.id.at.we held that we could review the merits of stehney claims because stehney had standing,and her claims were not barred by the political question doctrine or the doctrine of sovereign immunity.we concluded,however,that a writ of mandamus,which stehney sought,was not appropriate because stehney had not sought relief under the administrative procedure act in the first instance.moreover,deciding the merits,we held that the nsa had followed its own regulations in denying the security clearance and stehney received all the process she was due regarding the denial of the clearance if she was due any process at all since no one has a right to a security clearance.importantly,we noted that there was a distinction between challenging the merits of a clearance revocation and challenging the revocation process,and we had jurisdiction to rule on the latter.id.
here,makky asserts as alleged in the complaint,tsa supervisor robin burke suspended makky without pay on account of makky national origin and religion,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.although proceedings surrounding his security clearance had been commenced at the time of burke actions,makky allegations nevertheless clearly state a title vii claim that does not in any way depend on an analysis of whether the ultimate suspension or revocation of his security clearance was proper.appellant br.at.makky acknowledges that he would be foreclosed under egan from challenging the decision to deny the security clearance,even if it were denied due to discrimination.he emphasizes that is not what he is arguing.
instead,he argues that the decision to suspend him without pay was motivated in substantial part by discriminatory animus,and that claim is not foreclosed under egan.he compares his situation to that of stehney,who,we held,could challenge the process by which her clearance was denied.based on our precedent in stehney,we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review makky claim of discrimination because a discrimination claim under a theory does not necessarily require consideration of the merits of a security clearance decision.the basis of a theory is that both a legitimate and discriminatory reason for an employment decision can.see watson se.transp,cir recognizing that the point of a theory is that a plaintiff may suffer discrimination even though there may also be a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action.we reiterate that in analyzing makky title vii claim,we can not question the motivation behind the decision to deny makky security clearance.
theory of discrimination 
a title vii plaintiff may state a claim for discrimination under either the pretext theory set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d,or the theory set forth in price waterhouse hopkins,d,under which a plaintiff may show that an employment decision was made based on both legitimate and illegitimate reasons.following some division among the circuits as to application of price waterhouse,congress enacted two new statutory provisions geared toward setting the applicable standard in a case.the first provision stated except as otherwise provided in this subchapter,an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race,color,religion,sex,or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice,even though other factors also motivated the practice.m.the second provision gave the employer a limited affirmative defense to demonstrate that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor.desert palace,costa,d quoting g b alterations omitted.if proven,this defense limits the plaintiff relief to injunctive relief,attorneys fees,and costs.id.at.
although the courts were divided about whether a discrimination claim brought under a theory had to be proven with direct evidence,the supreme court resolved the circuit split in desert palace by holding that a plaintiff does not need to present direct evidence of discrimination to proceed on a theory of discrimination under title vii.id.at.the court reiterated the general principle that title vii has made it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.id.at.quoting a.in sum,i n order to obtain an instruction under m,a plaintiff need only present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude,by a preponderance of the evidence,that race,color,religion,sex,or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice.id.at.
requirement of basic qualification in cases 
assuming arguendo that makky has adequately pled that the tsa discriminated against him,we must decide whether an essential qualification for the job is a component of makky prima facie case.when a plaintiff attempts to prove a discrimination claim under a pretext theory,the mcdonnell douglas framework applies.see at.under that familiar test,the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that is a member of a protected class was qualified for the position sought to attain or retain suffered an adverse employment action and the action occurred under circumstances that could give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination.see mcdonnell douglas,at.sheridan dupont de nemours,cir en banc.
if a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination,then an inference of discriminatory motive arises and the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action.see mary honor ctr.hicks,d.if the defendant does so,the inference of discrimination drops and the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant proffered reason is merely pretext for intentional discrimination.see id.at.
in swierkiewicz sorema,d,the court held that the mcdonnell douglas prima facie case is an evidentiary standard,not a pleading requirement.in addition,the court stated that the mcdonnell douglas framework does not apply in every case,and the requirements of a prima facie case may vary depending on the case.id.at.see also jones sch.dist.of philadelphia,cir stating that the required elements of a prima facie case depend on the facts of the particular case.
the mcdonnell douglas framework does not apply in a case in the way it does in a pretext case because the issue in a case is not whether discrimination played the dispositive role but merely whether it played a motivating part in an employment decision.it is significant that in desert palace,the court omitted any discussion of the mcdonnell douglas framework as a requirement in cases.
makky argues that qualification for the position,an element of the prima facie case in the mcdonnell douglas test,does not need to be established in a case because the essence of the theory is the recognition that there may be a legitimate reason,as well as a prohibited reason,for the adverse employment action.the government argues that even under a theory,a plaintiff must state a prima facie case in order to prevail the government argues that at least makky must demonstrate that he was minimally qualified for his job appellees br.at.
we need not decide the question whether a plaintiff pursuing a theory of discrimination must satisfy each of the elements of the mcdonnell douglas prima facie case,as that issue is not squarely before us.we limit our consideration to the need for plaintiff to show his or her qualification,and specifically objective qualification,for the job.for example,if the hospital employing a person who has been performing surgery learns that the employee falsified his or her qualifications and never went to medical school,that employee could not establish a prima facie case irrespective of allegations of racial or ethnic discrimination.we hold today that a plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of a title vii employment discrimination claim if there is unchallenged objective evidence that did not possess the minimal qualifications for the position plaintiff sought to obtain or retain.in this respect at least,requirements under price waterhouse do not differ from those of mcdonnell douglas.
in the usual case,the issue of basic qualification will not arise until the summary judgment stage,following discovery and,because it will ordinarily be a question of fact.the issue will turn on whether plaintiff is able to perform or has satisfactorily performed the job,an issue that entails a subjective evaluation to be evaluated by the factfinder.it is only in the rare case that plaintiff lack of qualification to do the job will be capable of objective determination before discovery.
our holding today is necessarily narrow.we merely hold that in a employment discrimination case a plaintiff who does not possess the objective baseline qualifications to do job will not be entitled to avoid dismissal.
this involves inquiry only into the bare minimum requirement necessary to perform the job at issue.typically,this minimum requirement will take the form of some type of licensing requirement,such as a medical,law,or pilot license,or an analogous requirement measured by an external or independent body rather than the court or the jury.this requi
