the petition under review arises from an order of the federal communications commission fcc,which substantially limits federal regulation of internet access service provided over traditional telephone lines referred to as wireline broadband internet access service.the dispute centers,in large part,on the fcc decision to relieve telephone companies of regulations that required them to grant competing internet service providers nondiscriminatory access to their wirelines in order to reach consumers.the fcc contends that these regulations imposed significant costs on telephone companies,thereby impeding innovation and investment in new broadband technologies and services.fcc br.at.presumably,the fcc order now allows telephone companies to enter into individually negotiated arrangements with entities that seek access to their broadband wireline facilities.
petitioners,who are independent internet service providers,competing telecommunications service providers,cable modem providers,and various public interest organizations,argue that the fcc order allows telephone companies to deny competitors access to their wirelines,thereby resulting in decreased competition and consumer choice in the market for broadband internet service for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the fcc order is based on a reasonable interpretation of the communications act of,stat.codified as amended at,and a proper exercise of agency discretion.accordingly,we will deny the petition for review 
background 
we discuss in some detail the complex technical and regulatory context for the fcc order,which is set forth at appropriate framework for broadband access to the internet over wireline facilities,wireline broadband order.
technical background 
before the advent of broadband technology,consumers accessed the internet using connections provided over the interconnected system of telephone wires known as a local exchange see cable telecomm.ass brand x internet,d brand x.with a connection,consumers use computer modems to make calls which internet service providers isps link to the internet by providing consumers with a physical connection and the ability to translate raw internet data into information they may both view on their personal computers and transmit to other computers connected to the internet.id.connections,also referred to as narrowband connections,transmit data at relatively slow speeds.id.at.
by contrast,broadband connections,which are increasingly replacing connections,are much faster and are principally provided by cable modem service and digital subscriber line dsl service.dsl service,the type of transmission at issue in the wireline broadband order,involves the use of t wo dsl modems that are attached to a telephone loop,one at the subscriber premises and one at the telephone company central office.worldcom,fcc.if the line carries telephone service and data transmission,the telephone known as the local exchange carrier lec separates the streams and sends ordinary voice calls to the telephone network and data traffic to a data network where it is routed to an isp id.lecs use their transmission facilities to provide consumers with internet access service,in which case they are referred to as isps.see brand x,at.wireline broadband order,at.they also lease their wires on a wholesale basis to independent isps,referred to as isps,who use the wires to reach their customers.see brand x,at.wireline broadband order,at.
regulatory framework 
there are three key developments in the regulatory history of telecommunications and data processing services that are significant to this petition for review congress passage of the communications act in the fcc issuance of its computer ii ruling in and the passage of the telecommunications act in.we discuss each in turn.
the common carrier doctrine 
the regulatory issues raised in the wireline broadband order trace back to the enactment of the communications act in,which established the fcc broad authority to regulate interstate telephone communications.global crossing,metrophones,d.title ii of the statute heavily regulated the activities of local telephone companies by imposing upon them certain common carrier obligations see id.at.for example,title ii required telephone companies to charge consumers just and reasonable rates and to file and make publicly available their rate schedules known as tariffs authorized the fcc to set rates if the ones offered by a carrier were not just and reasonable prohibited carriers from constructing new wirelines without first obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the fcc and established liability for carriers that violated the statute.communications act,ch,stat,prior to amendments.these common carrier provisions remain essentially unchanged,see,although,as discussed below,congress has since amended title ii to include additional common carrier obligations.see generally setting forth the communications act title ii common carrier requirements.
the fcc computer inquiry proceedings 
in,the fcc initiated the computer inquiry proceedings to address the regulatory issues presented by the growing convergence of traditional telephone communications and data processing services.the fcc issued three important rulings in connection with the proceedings,known as computer i,computer ii,and computer iii.
in regulatory and policy problems presented by the interdependence of computer and communication services and facilities,computer i,the fcc addressed the nature and extent of regulatory jurisdiction and control which it would exercise over the furnishing of data processing and communications services,or some combination thereof,by telephone and data processing companies.with respect to telephone companies subject to title ii common carrier requirements,the fcc was concerned that without appropriate regulatory safeguards,the provision of data processing services by common carriers could adversely affect the statutory obligation of such carriers to provide adequate communications services under reasonable terms and conditions and impair effective competition in the sale of data processing services.id.
to address the concern,the fcc,pursuant to its rulemaking authority,required maximum separation of activities which are subject to regulation,traditional telephone communications from activities involving data processing to ensure adequate and efficient communications services at reasonable and rates and practices.id.internal quotations marks omitted.thus,telephone companies that provided consumers with data processing services were permitted to do so only through affiliates utilizing separate books of account,separate officers,separate operating personnel and separate equipment and facilities devoted exclusively to the rendition of data processing services.id.
at the same time that it imposed these structural safeguards on telephone companies,the fcc determined that the communications act did not require it to exercise full regulatory authority over data processing services in general.see id.as the fcc stated where message switching is offered as an integral part of and as an incidental feature of a package offering that is primarily data processing,there will be total regulatory forbearance with respect to the entire service whether offered by a common carrier or carrier.id.
in amendment of section of the commission rules and regulations,computer ii,issued nine years after its computer i ruling,the fcc addressed technological developments that had further blurred the boundary between traditional telecommunications and data processing services.the fcc adopted a regulatory framework that distinguished between the offering of basic transmission service and enhanced service subjecting only the former to mandatory title ii regulation.id.the fcc defined basic service as limited to the common carrier offering of transmission capacity for the movement of information.id.in offering this capacity,a communications path is provided for the analog or digital transmission of voice,data,video,information,and the carrier basic transmission network is not used as an information storage system.id.in other words,a carrier essentially offers a pure transmission capability over a communications path that is virtually transparent in terms of its interaction with customer supplied information.id.
in contrast,the fcc defined enhanced service as any offering over the telecommunications network which is more than basic transmission service.id.the fcc elaborated 
in an enhanced service computer processing applications are used to act on the content,code,protocol,and other aspects of the subscriber information additional,different,or restructured information may be provided the subscriber through various processing applications performed on the transmitted information,or other actions can be taken by either the vendor or the subscriber based on the content of the information transmitted through editing,formating sic.moreover,in an enhanced service the content of the information need not be changed and may simply involve subscriber interaction with stored information.
id.footnote omitted.
in addition to distinguishing between basic transmission services subject to title ii and enhanced services not subject to title ii,the fcc eliminated the maximum separation regime with respect to all telephone common carriers except those under the control of at t and gte,the two dominant carriers that the fcc determined had sufficient market power to engage in anticompetitive activity on a national scale.see id.thus,telephone companies were no longer required to use separate affiliates to provide enhanced services to consumers.however,the fcc,pursuant to its ancillary jurisdiction under title i of the communications act,required those carriers engaged in the provision of enhanced services to grant competing providers access to their wirelines on a nondiscriminatory basis pursuant to tariffs governed by title ii.id.the fcc explained the computer ii nondiscriminatory access requirements as follows 
because enhanced services are dependent on the common carrier offering of basic services,a basic service is the building block upon which enhanced services are offered.thus those carriers that own common carrier transmission facilities and provide enhanced services,but are not subject to the separate subsidiary requirement,must acquire transmission capacity pursuant to the same prices,terms,and conditions reflected in their tariffs when their own facilities are utilized.other offerors of enhanced services would likewise be able to use such a carrier facilities under the same terms and conditions.
id.these nondiscriminatory access rules are at the center of this petition for review.
finally,six years later,in amendment of sections of the commission rules and regulations third computer inquiry and policy and rules concerning rates for competitive common carrier services and facilities authorizations,computer iii,the fcc replaced the maximum separation regime applied to the dominant telephone companies with a system of nonstructural safeguards.
telecommunications act of 
congress substantially amended the communications act of when it passed the telecommunications act of,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.as one commentator has explained,the principal goal in the act was to open the local telephone market to effective competition.james speta,handicapping the race for the last mile a critique of open access rules for broadband platforms,yale on reg.thus,title ii was expanded to include additional requirements intended to break up the dominance of a small number of lecs over the telecommunications market.id.
as amended,title ii imposes on lecs the duty not to prohibit or unreasonably restrict resale of their services to provide number portability so that consumers can switch lecs but still retain their phone numbers to accord dialing parity so that a lec customer can reach a customer of another lec by dialing no more digits than necessary to permit competing lecs access to their rights of way and to establish reciprocal compensation with other lecs for the transport and termination of all calls.see id.at citing b.
in addition,title ii imposes on incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs,defined as any lec that existed as of the date the telecommunications act was passed,the obligation to permit nondiscriminatory interconnection with another carrier facilities at any feasible point in the ilec network provide any other carrier unbundled access to certain elements of the ilec network at rates establish wholesale rates for the resale of any telecommunications service provided by the ilec provide the fcc with notice of any changes to the ilec network and permit the collocation of other telecommunications carriers equipment on the ilec premises see id.at citing c.
crucial to this petition for review,the telecommunications act also introduced two new important regulatory classifications that parallel the basic and enhanced services distinction established in computer ii telecommunications service and information service.only telecommunications service is subject to mandatory regulation under title ii.
regulatory treatment of broadband internet access service 
cable modem broadband internet access service 
the fcc first applied the communications act new regulatory classifications to broadband internet access service in its ruling in inquiry concerning access to the internet over cable and other facilities,cable modem declaratory ruling.in the ruling,the fcc concluded that broadband internet access service provided by cable companies is an information service,which does not include a separate telecommunications service subject to mandatory title ii common carrier regulation.id.at.in addition,the fcc declined to apply the computer ii nondiscriminatory access requirements to cable modem broadband operators despite the fact that,at the time,telephone companies engaged in the provision of enhanced services were required to provide isps nondiscriminatory access to their transmission facilities.id.at.the supreme court upheld the cable modem declaratory ruling in brand x,at,noting that it appears to be a in an effort to reshape the way the commission regulates providers.
procedural background to the wireline broadband order 
in february,shortly before it released the cable modem declaratory ruling,the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking,setting forth and requesting public comment on a number of tentative conclusions concerning the regulatory treatment of wireline broadband internet access service.appropriate framework for broadband access to the internet over wireline facilities,wireline broadband nprm.in response,the fcc received numerous comments from a wide range of interested parties.
on september,three months after the supreme court brand x decision,the fcc released the order on review,which substantially limited federal regulation of wireline broadband internet access service through two principal rulings.first,the fcc ruled that wireline broadband internet access service,like cable modem service,is an information service that does not include a separate telecommunications service subject to mandatory common carrier regulation under title ii of the communications act,regardless of whether such service is provided by lecs or isps.wireline broadband order,at.second,the fcc eliminated the computer ii requirements on grounds that market conditions no longer justify requiring lecs to grant independent isps nondiscriminatory access to their wireline transmission facilities.see,id.at.these consolidated petitions for review followed.
petitioners,who are independent isps,competing telecommunications service providers,cable modem providers,and various public interest organizations,challenge the fcc statutory classification and computer ii rulings we address both in turn.
ii.standard of review 
our review is governed by chevron natural resources defense council,d,and of the administrative procedure act apa.see brand x,at.chevron requires a federal court to defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of any ambiguities in a statute which it administers.id.at.section of the apa requires a court to hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions that are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
iii.statutory classification 
in the wireline broadband order,the fcc rejected the proposition that wireline broadband internet access service includes both an information service and a telecommunications service.wireline broadband order,at.rather,it found that wireline broadband internet access service is a functionally integrated information service.id.we conclude that this statutory classification is based on a reasonable interpretation of the communications act.
the classification of a particular service as a telecommunication service or an information service under the communications act turns on the following definitions in the statute 
the term telecommunications means the transmission,between or among points specified by the user,of information of the user own choosing,without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received.
the term telecommunications service means the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public,or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public,regardless of the facilities used.
emphasis added.
the term information service means the offering of a capability for generating,acquiring,storing,transforming,processing,retrieving,utilizing,or making available information via telecommunications 
emphasis added.
in brand x,the supreme court,applying chevron familiar analysis,concluded that the term telecommunications service is ambiguous as applied to cable modem internet access service b ecause the term offer can sometimes refer to a single,finished product and sometimes to the individual components in a package being offered.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the court elaborated 
cable companies in the broadband internet service business offe r consumers an information service in the form of internet access and they do so via telecommunications,but it does not inexorably follow as a matter of ordinary language that they also offer r consumers the data transmission telecommunications that is an input used to provide this service.
id.at.alterations in original.the court illustrated its conclusion using the following analogy 
one might well say that a car dealership offers cars,but does not offer the integrated major inputs that make purchasing the car valuable,such as the engine or the chassis.it would,in fact,be odd to describe a car dealership as offering consumers the car components in addition to the car itself.even if it is linguistically permissible to say that the car dealership offers engines when it offers cars,that shows,at most,that the term offer,when applied to a commercial transaction,is ambiguous about whether it describes only the offered finished product,or the product discrete components as well.it does not show that no other usage is permitted.
id.at.given this ambiguity in the statute,the court considered whether the fcc conclusion that cable modem providers do not offer consumers a separate telecommunications service was based on a permissible construction of the communications act under chevron.
in its ruling,the fcc conceded that,like all providers,cable companies use telecommunications to provide consumers with internet service.id.at.that is,cable companies provide such service via the wire that transmits signals to and from an end user computer.id.but whether that service also includes a telecommunications offering,in the fcc view,turn ed on the nature of the functions the end user is offered.id.quoting cable modem declaratory ruling,at.in the fcc judgment,end users do not perceive the service they receive as consisting of both a data processing component and a transmission component.
the supreme court explained the fcc conclusion concerning end user perception 
seen from the consumer point of view,the commission concluded,cable modem service is not a telecommunications offering because the consumer uses the wire always in connection with the capabilities provided by internet access,and because the transmission is a necessary component of internet access as provided to the end user the telecommunications is part and parcel of cable modem service and is integral to its other capabilities.
id.quoting cable modem declaratory ruling,at.the wire is used,in other words,to access the world wide web,newsgroups,and so forth,rather than transparently to transmit and receive messages without computer processing or storage of the message.id.because of the integrated nature of the offering,the fcc determined,cable modem service is not a,transparent offering of telecommunications.id.quoting cable modem declaratory ruling,at.
the supreme court concluded that the fcc determination was reasonable,given t hat the question turns not on the language of the act,but on the factual particulars of how internet technology works and how it is provided,questions chevron leaves to the commission to resolve in the first instance.id.at.moreover,the court observed,the fcc emphasis on how end users perceive the nature of the service being offered was consistent with computer ii,which defined basic and enhanced services functionally,based on how the consumer interacts with the provided information.id.at.
applying the same analytical approach used in the cable modem declaratory ruling,the fcc,in this proceeding,concluded that wireline broadband internet access service provided over a provider own facilities is appropriately classified as an information service because its providers offer a single,integrated service,internet access to end users.wireline broadband order,at.the parties agree that internet service is an information service not subject to title ii regulation.see comptel br.at at t br.at.petitioners contend,however,that the fcc erroneously concluded that the wireline transmission component used to provide broadband internet access is not a telecommunication service offering subject to mandatory title ii regulation.
petitioners advance three principal arguments which we address in turn that the fcc statutory classification of wireline broadband internet access service is not supported by record evidence is contrary to the fcc past rulings and is inconsistent with the fcc classification of wireline broadband service under the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea.
record evidence 
in the wireline broadband order,the fcc determined that like cable modem service which is usually provided over the provider own facilities,wireline broadband internet access service combines computer processing,information provision,and data transport,enabling end users to run a variety of applications,web pages,and newsgroups.at.given the similarity between how end users perceive the finished product internet access,whether provided by wireline or cable modem providers,the fcc concluded that its decision to classify wireline broadband internet access service as an information service logically flowed from the supreme court brand x decision.see,id.at.in our view,the record adequately supports the fcc conclusion that from the perspective of the,wireline broadband service and cable modem service are functionally similar and,therefore,that they should be subject to the same regulatory classification under the communications act.
for example,public comments submitted in response to the wireline broadband nprm state that 
cable modem,dsl,fixed wireless,and satellite service are functionally similar.each is used primarily for internet access each can be used with an ordinary personal computer,with a modest hardware addition each provides an connection,at comparable speeds and unlike traditional connections,each enables consumers to use their ordinary telephone line for voice or fax while simultaneously accessing the internet.
at comments of verizon,may,footnotes omitted.
p roviders of cable modem,dsl,fixed wireless,and satellite service view them as substitutes.for example,cable operators have stated that they view dsl as their main competitor,whereas dsl providers have said the same thing about cable modem providers.
at comments of verizon,may,footnotes omitted.
dsl cable modem access are analogous 
functions for data access provided to the end user are the same.
service set up processes are functionally identical 
all data is packetized.
ip addresses are assigned to the premises in the same manner.
data uses similar protocol to connect to the internet 
the end user computer can be used interchangeably.this means if the same isp is connected to both the dsl and the cable network,the user can plug their pc into either the dsl modem or the cable modem and access their account.
at ex parte letter from qwest to fcc with attached presentation,april.
c onsumers view cable modem,dsl,fixed wireless,and satellite service as interchangeable.as one analyst has explained,most customers do care about technologies,but are platform agnostic,and simply want an experience that is better than narrowband.one poll found little difference between perceptions among those planning to get either dsl or cable modem services.
at comments of verizon,may,footnotes omitted.
petitioners attempt to distinguish wireline broadband service from cable modem service on grounds that lecs offer their wireline transmission component on a basis to other isps.that is,lecs lease their transmission facilities to independent isps who themselves provide consumers with internet access service.therefore,petitioners reason,lecs plainly offer a separate telecommunications service.we are not persuaded that this is a basis for distinguishing wireline broadband service from cable modem service.
the fact that lecs have provided independent isps with transmission capabilities is,as the fcc points out,a function of the very regulatory requirements that the fcc order seeks to is,wireline providers have been until the release of the wireline broadband order the only broadband provider required by computer ii to offer their transmission component on a basis.wireline broadband order,at.indeed,record evidence considered in the cable modem declaratory ruling showed that cable modem providers not only have the capability to offer their transmission facilities on a basis,but,in fact,have entered into agreements with independent isps to do so.cable modem declaratory ruling,at.this fact did not prevent the supreme court from upholding the fcc determination that cable modem service is a fully integrated information service.we see no reason why we should reach a contrary decision here.
past agency decisions 
we are likewise unpersuaded by petitioners argument that the fcc statutory classification ruling is improper because it conflicts with past agency decisions.in particular,comptel focuses on the advanced services order,in which the fcc concluded that it would treat broadband internet access service as consisting of both an information service and a telecommunications service.
the fcc candidly admitted in the wireline broadband order that past agency statements concerning the regulatory treatment of wireline broadband internet access service had not been entirely consistent,but nevertheless found that there was ample basis in its prior rulings to support its classification of wireline broadband internet access service as a functionally integrated information service.at.for example,the fcc relied on its report to congress in joint board on universal service,universal service report,in which it concluded that the categories of information service and telecommunications service are mutually exclusive.see wireline broadband order,at.the fcc relied on the universal service report heavily in the cable modem declaratory ruling,and the supreme court in brand x clearly found this sufficient.see brand x,at.
in addition,to the extent that the fcc current classification of wireline broadband internet access service conflicts with past agency rulings,brand x makes clear that an a n initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone.on the contrary,the agency must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.as the supreme court stated,t hat is no doubt why in chevron itself,this court deferred to an agency interpretation that was a recent reversal of agency policy.id.at.accordingly,we do not agree that past conflicting fcc rulings render its statutory classification in this order arbitrary and capricious.
classification of broadband service under calea 
petitioners next argue that the fcc classification of wireline broadband internet access service as a fully integrated information service under the communications act is rendered arbitrary and capricious by the commission conflicting interpretation in its calea proceeding.we agree with the fcc that this argument is a red herring.see fcc br.at.
congress enacted calea in to require telecommunications carriers to ensure that their networks are technologically capable of being accessed by law enforcement officials.see am.council on educ.fcc.calea substantive provisions apply to telecommunications carriers,but not information service providers.see id.at.in communications assistance for law enforcement and broadband access and services,calea order,released the same day as the wireline broadband order,the fcc concluded that calea creates three categories of communications services pure telecommunications service,pure information service,and hybrid service.it then determined that broadband services are hybrid services subject to the statute.see id.
comptel argues that the fcc classification of wireline broadband service in the wireline broadband order and the calea order can not be squared with one another.comptel br.at.we agree with the circuit,however,that the fcc has the discretion to interpret the two statutes differently.see am.council on,at.specifically,calea has a wholly distinct legislative history and congressional purpose uses a different term,telecommunications carrier not telecommunications service to establish the scope of the fcc jurisdiction under the statute and has a different statutory structure which indicates that congress did not intend that the terms telecommunications carrier and information service be mutually exclusive for purposes of identifying the entities that are subject to the statute provisions.id.at.accordingly,we reject comptel argument that the fcc calea order renders its classification of wireline broadband internet access service under the communications act arbitrary and capricious.
in sum,petitioners do not provide us with a basis for vacating the fcc ruling that wireline broadband internet access service should not be subject to mandatory common carrier regulation under title ii of the communications act.
iv.nondiscriminatory access under computer ii 
as discussed,in computer ii,the fcc,pursuant to its title i ancillary jurisdiction,required all lecs to provide competing enhanced service providers nondiscriminatory access to the basic transmission component underlying their enhanced services.see wireline broadband order,at.petitioners argue that the fcc decision to eliminate the computer ii requirements was arbitrary and capricious because the fcc failed to engage in a proper market analysis and failed to properly apply the common carrier test set forth in national association of regulatory utility commissioners fcc,naruc i.in addition,petitioners assert that the fcc decision to relieve lecs of their computer ii obligations violates the discontinuance requirements set forth in of the communications act,as well as the due process clause of the constitution.
market analysis 
petitioners argue that the fcc blanket deregulation of wireline broadband internet access service violates the agency regulatory policy for assessing ilec market power,which differentiates between services demanded by distinct customer classes.time warner br.at.specifically,petitioners contend,before eliminating the computer ii requirements,the fcc was required to consider ilecs dominance of the business market and certain geographic markets accordingly,petitioners request that the court remand this case to the fcc for a full market analysis.we do not agree that remand is necessary.
to the extent that the fcc decision not to conduct a traditional market analysis constitutes a departure from past agency practice,it is that an agency may change its course so long as it can justify its change with a reasoned analysis.horn thoratec,cir quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.here,the fcc argues that it fully justified its decision to refrain from standard market dominance analysis in order to avoid making highly dubious and premature conclusions about a nascent and dynamic market that is rapidly changing.fcc br.at citing wireline broadband order,at.
for example,the fcc explained in its order that only of consumers with access to advanced telecommunications capability subscribe to services providing such capability approximately of households subscribe to either broadband or narrowband internet access service and alternative broadband platforms are developing and emerging,satellite,wireless,and powerline in both the residential and business markets.wireline broadband order,at.by comparison,the market for telephone context in which traditional market analysis has been had a market penetration rate of roughly for more than twenty years.id.at.thus,in the fcc view,snapshot data of the broadband service market may quickly and predictably be rendered obsolete as the market continues to evolve.id.at.
instead,the fcc considered how the market for broadband services is likely to develop.for example,the fcc predicted based on record evidence that the market penetration of cable modem and wireline broadband service will grow dramatically in the future and that the two services will compete both services will continue to invest in and expand the reach of their services emerging broadband platforms will exert competitive pressure and gain market share and demand among consumers for broadband services will only increase.see id.at.we agree with the fcc that these reasons justified its decision to refrain from a traditional market analysis and to rely instead on larger trends and predictions concerning the future of the broadband services market.see worldcom,fcc,stating that the fcc is not required to be confident to a metaphysical certainty of its predictions about the future of competition in a given market before it may modify its regulatory scheme.
indeed,as the fcc points out,its predictive judgments about matters within its expertise are entitled to substantial deference.see fcc wncn listeners guild,d.moreover,we find significant that the fcc market analysis in this proceeding is consistent with the approach taken in the cable modem declaratory ruling,in which the agency made no express findings that cable modem service providers are.see brand x,at.noting that the fcc conclusions concerning general market conditions and substitute forms of internet transmission justified its regulatory treatment of cable modem service.in sum,despite petitioners extensive discussion of conditions in specific customer and geographic markets,we conclude that the fcc broad market analysis in this proceeding was both reasonable and consistent with the approach upheld by the supreme court in brand 
b.the naruc i common carrier test 
petitioners argue that having eliminated the computer ii nondiscriminatory access requirements,the fcc was required to determine whether wireline broadband transmission facilities should nevertheless be regulated on a common carriage basis under the test set forth in the circuit decision in naruc under this test,a carrier has to be regulated as a common carrier if it will make capacity available to the public indifferently or if the public interest requires common carrier operation of the proposed facility.see virgin islands.fcc,vitelco internal quotation marks omitted.we disagree with petitioners that the fcc failed to properly consider the public interest prong of the naruc i test.
it is that the commission judgment regarding how the public interest is best served is entitled to substantial judicial deference because the weighing of policies under the public interest standard is a task that congress has delegated to the commission.wncn listeners guild,at.internal quotation marks omitted.here,in addition to considering the market conditions discussed above,the fcc explained at length its judgment that continued regulation of wireline broadband providers under computer ii would harm consumers by imped ing the development and deployment of innovative wireline broadband internet access technologies and services.wireline broadband order,at.
for example,the fcc credited evidence that showed that wireline broadband providers are unable or unwilling to integrate more efficient equipment into their wireline networks because of the costs of complying with the computer ii requirements.see id.at.likewise,the fcc noted that s everal parties argue that the computer inquiry requirements prevent them from altering business priorities in response to changing market demands.id.at.accordingly,the fcc determined that eliminating the computer ii rules will make it more likely that wireline operators will take more risks in investing in and deploying new technologies than they were willing and able to take under the computer inquiry regime.id.at.
with respect to whether independent isps would continue to have reasonable access to ilecs transmission facilities in the absence of regulatory compulsion,the fcc explained that the record showed that wireline broadband internet access service providers have business incentives to make their facilities available to competing isps on a commercially reasonable basis.id.at.in particular,the fcc noted that ilecs have an economic incentive to spread the costs of their network s over as much traffic and as many customers as possible regardless of whether such customers are wholesale or retail.id.at.in this regard,the fcc implicitly rejected the argument asserted by time warner in its brief,that as a result of the elimination of the computer ii requirements,ilecs will now be free to upgrade the transmission inputs they use for their own retail broadband internet access services,while restricting their competitors access to the increasingly outmoded transmission services that remain subject to title ii regulation.time warner br.at.
section of the communications act and the due process clause 
finally,we reject petitioners argument that the wireline broadband order violates of the communications act and the due process clause of the constitution by granting ilecs a blanket certification to discontinue providing existing customers with common carrier broadband internet access transmission services.wireline broadband order,at.
under of the communications act,before a common carrier may discontinue service,it must first obtain from the fcc a certificate that neither the present nor future public convenience and necessity will be adversely affected thereby.a.as discussed,the fcc fully considered the public interest before eliminating the computer ii rules,and petitioners point to no authority that prevents the fcc from granting a blanket certification.see lincoln telephone telegraph fcc,noting that s ection a does not specify any particular procedure for making public interest determinations.
moreover,we note that the order imposed a transition period,requiring wireline transmission providers to continue to honor existing transmission arrangements with their current isp or other customers,in order to allow isps to continue operating under their current arrangements while they negotiate carrier agreements.wireline broadband order,at.the order further required lecs to provide both the customer and the fcc with advance notice of any discontinuance of service,with the fcc reserving the right to take any action that would be appropriate to protect the public interest.wireline broadband order,at.we fail to see how this aspect of the fcc order deprives petitioners of notice or the opportunity to be heard,whether in violation of of the communications act or the due process clause of the constitution 
conclusion 
for the reasons stated,we conclude that the wireline broadband order was based on a permissible interpretation of the communicati
