golden and zimmerman,llc,a virginia licensee under the gun control act,et,and robert privott,a north carolina licensee under the act,seek judicial review of the federal firearms regulations reference guide,which is published by the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf to provide information designed to help licensees comply with all of the laws and regulations governing the manufacture,importation,and distribution of firearms and ammunition.they seek a judgment declaring that frequently asked question in the reference guide is inconsistent with the gun control act.the answer given to frequently asked question states,in effect,that privott,as a north carolina licensee,may not sell guns at a virginia gun show to golden zimmerman,a virginia licensee,for transfer to virginia residents.the district court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,holding that publication of the reference guide was not final agency action subject to judicial review under the administrative procedure act apa,et.
because we conclude that the reference guide is simply informational and that its publication is neither agency action nor final agency action,as necessary for judicial review under the apa,we affirm.
the gun control act makes it unlawful for any person,except a licensed dealer,to engage in the business of selling firearms.see a a.licensed dealers,in turn,are prohibited generally from selling firearms to any person who the licensee knows or has reasonable cause to believe does not reside in the state in which the licensee place of business is located,except if the transaction is with another licensee.id.b b.the act sets out detailed rules governing the licensing process,see id,among which is the requirement that an applicant have premises from which he conducts business subject to license,id.d e.the act also requires that a fee be paid for each place in which the applicant is to do business.id.a.and the act administration is dependent on the requirement that a licensed dealer have licensed business premises.see,id.h requiring licensees to post their license on the premises covered by the license id.g a requiring licensees to maintain records at their business premises and authorizing law enforcement officers to obtain a warrant to inspect the records and firearms kept at a licensee business premises during business hours.regulations implementing the gun control act similarly recognize the importance of a licensee licensed premises.they provide that a license issued under the act entitles the licensee to engage in the business specified by the license,at the location described on the license,and for the period stated on the license.b emphasis added see also id.the license covers the class of business or the activity specified in the license at the address specified therein.
although the gun control act and its implementing regulations thus require generally that a licensed dealer sell guns only from the premises specified in its license,the act also authorizes licensed dealers to conduct business temporarily at a location other than the location specified on the license if such temporary location is the location for a gun show and such location is in the state which is specified on the license.j.the implementing regulation explains that,for a gun show held in a licensee state of business,t he premises of the gun show shall be considered part of the licensed premises,and,a ccordingly,no separate fee or license is required for the gun show.
for some years,the atf has published a reference guide for licensees,providing information designed to help the licensees comply with all of the laws and regulations governing the manufacture,importation,and distribution of firearms and ammunition.the reference guide,of which there have been some editions,contains the text of the relevant federal firearms laws,implementing regulations,rulings,and general information.the most recent edition,published in,also contains a section listing approximately frequently asked questions and answers.
in the questions and answers section,the reference guide has consistently explained to licensees that,based on statutes and regulations,a licensee is not authorized to transfer firearms at a gun show,even to other licensed dealers,unless the gun show is being held in the same state as the licensee business premises.in the most recent iteration,this explanation is contained in frequently asked question faq,which states 
what may a licensed dealer do at an gun show 
a licensed dealer may sell and deliver curio or relic firearms to another licensee at an gun show.with respect to other firearms transactions,a licensed dealer may only display and take orders for firearms at an gun show.in filling any orders for firearms,the dealer must return the firearms to his or her licensed premises and deliver them from that location.any firearm ordered by a nonlicensee must be delivered or shipped from the licensee premises to a licensee in the purchaser state of residence,and the purchaser must obtain the firearm from the licensee located in the purchaser state.except for sales of curio or relic firearms to other licensees,sales of firearms and simultaneous deliveries at the gun show,whether to other licensees or to nonlicensees,violate the law because the dealer would be unlawfully engaging in business at an unlicensed location.
a,b,a and j.
while faq is a summary of the relevant statutory provisions and regulations,it has its origins in revenue ruling,issued when the atf was a division of the internal revenue service.that ruling,published before the gun control act was amended in to allow a licensed dealer to sell and deliver firearms at a gun show held in the same state as its licensed premises,stated that a licensee may engage in the business covered by the license only at the specific business premises for which his license has been obtained emphasis added and that,accordingly,a licensee may not sell firearms at a gun show held on premises other than those covered by his license.the atf has published editions of its reference guide containing the substance of revenue ruling.moreover,faq has remained textually identical since the edition of the reference guide and substantively identical since the edition,the first edition published after the act amendment.
additionally,in a letter to a licensee dated september,the atf deputy assistant director,walfred nelson,took the same position expressed in faq.the nelson letter cautioned that dealing violates a a and that l icensees who engage in such transactions are subject to license revocation,forfeiture of the firearms involved in the transaction,and criminal prosecution.but it also advised that a licensee may lawfully transfer firearms from its premises to a licensee with premises in the state where the gun show is going to be held and then actually deliver the firearms to the other licensee at the gun show.that licensee could then sell the firearms to purchasers at the gun show and transfer any unsold firearms back to the original licensee at the end of the show.
golden and zimmerman,llc,obtained a federal license in july that authorizes it to deal in firearms from its business premises in ivor,virginia.robert privott obtained a federal license in september that authorizes him to deal in firearms from his business premises in powells point,north carolina.a few months after obtaining their licenses,golden zimmerman and privott commenced this action against the atf for a judgment declaring that privott,the north carolina licensee,can lawfully transfer firearms at gun shows in virginia to golden zimmerman,the virginia licensee,for subsequent transfer at the shows to virginia residents.in their complaint,golden zimmerman and privott alleged that they attend gun shows in virginia but that privott has refrained from selling firearms at the virginia gun shows and that golden zimmerman has refrained from receiving firearms at such gun shows from licensed dealers with business premises outside of virginia,such as privott,because the atf has taken the position in faq of the reference guide that such conduct violates the gun con
