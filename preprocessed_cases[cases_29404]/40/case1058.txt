opinion of the court 
in december,a car accident paralyzed a foster care child.a jury found that his foster father negligent driving caused injury.the single issue before us in this tragic case is whether a private foster care agency can be vicariously liable for the ordinary negligence of a foster parent.the district court held no,and granted the foster care agency motion for summary judgment on this issue.we affirm.
in november,a court determined,then three years old,was a dependent child.as a result,lehigh county took legal and physical custody of him.
with the lutheran home at topton assistance,lehigh county placed with foster parents,peter and atlanta norton the county had contracted with the home to aid with foster child placement and related supervision.the contract of service the service contract between the parties imposed several obligations on the home,including 
supervising each foster child placement submitting to the county individual service plans,progress reports,discharge summaries,and other written reports required by the county or regulations pertaining to each foster child submitting to the county medical,dental,and educational information and providing notification to the county if it proposes changing a foster child placement from one foster home to another.
in exchange for providing these services,the home received a daily fee of for each child under its supervision.in turn,it paid its foster parents per day.
prior to placement,the home entered into a foster care placement contract of agreement the placement agreement with the nortons.in it,the nortons promised to receive a foster child into their home and to be responsible to meet his physical,social,and emotional needs.it also contained baseline requirements intended to guide care.many of these provisions incorporated specific items from the service contract including various state regulations.however,the placement agreement included additional requirements imposed by the home itself.the nortons also received a foster care handbook the handbook,which outlined the family obligations in greater detail.in the end,the parties agreed that it is the responsibility of the home and foster family to work together on behalf of importantly,both the home and the nortons had the power to terminate the placement agreement with reasonable notice.
at various times the home was quite active in supervising care.for instance,shortly after placement,the home received reports that the nortons were using inappropriate methods to discipline and toilet train him.these methods violated the nortons obligations under their placement agreement,as well as related pennsylvania law in response,the home met with the nortons and counseled them on proper disciplinary methods.
a few months later,and his foster brothers were swimming in the nortons pool.they had just returned home from a party.while unsupervised,nearly drowned.norton pulled the child from the pool,and norton administered cpr.as a result of this incident,the county and guardian instructed the home to increase the frequency of its visits with the foster family.they also directed the home to provide additional training to the nortons and use their supervisory authority to intervene further,as needed.
in december,norton was bringing home from daycare.during that trip,norton was momentarily distracted when bit thomas norton son on the arm.norton glanced in his rearview mirror to see what was happening and to reprimand the boys.with this distraction,he crossed the center line of the road and hit an oncoming car.thomas was killed,and norton was severely injured.was rendered paraplegic.
ii.procedural history 
in august,through his guardian ad litem,filed an action against norton,lehigh county,and the home to recover for his injuries.brought the following claims in his initial complaint ordinary negligence against norton constitutional violations against lehigh county for alleged deliberate indifference and direct liability against the home for negligent placement and supervision.even an amended complaint did not allege that the home was vicariously liable for norton negligence,but later summary judgment motion referred to it 
in march,filed a motion for partial summary judgment.the district court denied his motion on the ground that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether norton was negligent.in october,the home and lehigh county filed motions for partial summary judgment.the district court granted both motions.in its opinion,the court addressed the merits of vicarious liability claim,concluding that it fails as a matter of law because the requisite relationship does not exist between the home and peter norton.the court reasoned that most of the rules imposed on norton in the placement agreement and the handbook were the product of state regulations.it added that this setting of standards and goals addressed the results of the work and not the manner in which it was conducted,leaving the nortons free to make the same decisions for that they would make for their own children on a daily basis.the court further held that the home actions were not the proximate cause of injuries.thus,it was not directly liable for them,either.
in march,filed a motion requesting that the district court certify its decision for immediate appeal.specifically,sought review of the court determination that there were no genuine issues of material fact with respect to the existence of a relationship between the home and norton.after initially denying this request,the court sua sponte vacated its decision and certified this matter for appeal.we denied the request.
claim against norton continued to trial.the jury returned a unanimous verdict,finding norton negligent and awarding in damages.after entry of a final judgment,appealed the district court summary judgment order from february.limited his appeal to the court dismissal of his vicarious liability claim against the home.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction to hear this case under.we have jurisdiction under.
the standard of review for a grant of summary judgment is plenary.michael shiley,cir.when considering a grant of summary judgment,we employ the same legal standard as the district court.kelley tyk refractories,cir.summary judgment is only proper where,when viewing the record in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c 
iv.analysis 
to repeat,the single issue before us is whether a private foster care agency can be vicariously liable for a foster parent act of ordinary negligence.although this is an issue of first impression under pennsylvania law our conclusion is dictated by legal principles.
a.the master servant relationship and the right of control test 
in pennsylvania,only a relationship gives rise to vicarious liability for negligence.smalich westfall.as a general rule,a master may be held liable for the acts of the servant when those acts are committed during the course of his employment and within the scope of his authority.valles albert einstein med.the rationale for this rule is simple b ecause a master has the right to exercise control over the physical activities of the servant within the time of service,he is vicariously liable for the servant negligent acts committed within the scope of his employment.smalich,at emphasis in original.
in a relationship,a master not only controls the results of the work but also may direct the manner in which such work shall be done.see also universal am can,workers comp.appeal,c ontrol over the work to be completed and the manner in which it is to be performed are the primary factors in determining employee status.a servant,in rendering the agreed services,remains entirely under the control and direction of the master.smalich,at.when determining whether a relationship exists,a ctual control of the manner of work is not essential rather,it is the right to control which is determinative.drexel union prescription,cir.
under this right of control test,t he control of the principal does not include control at every moment its exercise may be very attenuated and,as where the principal is physically absent,may be ineffective.smalich,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.although this passage might suggest a lenient right of control test,the right to exercise control remains an important factor in the inquiry.see,smith exxon,myszkowski penn stroud hotel,burnatoski butler ambulance serv.the party seeking vicarious liability bears the burden of proving a relationship.see basile h r block.
applying the right of control test 
in this context,the dispute between the parties focuses on the scope of control that the home could exercise over norton not the level of control that the home actually exercised during placement.argues that,because norton was in the act of caring for him at the time of the accident,the home should be held vicariously liable for any injuries caused by norton conduct.under this theory,a private foster care agency liability would extend to all acts of ordinary negligence committed by a foster parent in the provision of foster care which is defined by relevant regulations as a t hour commitment.
such a theory would impose a considerable financial burden on the pennsylvania foster care system more importantly,it is also contrary to established pennsylvania law.in reaching this conclusion,we first consider the terms of the service contract between lehigh county and the home.from there,we analyze the placement agreement between the home and norton.throughout,we consider these agreements in light of the regulatory scheme enacted by the commonwealth,as well as related pennsylvania caselaw.
the service contract 
stakes much of his argument on a single passage from the independent contractor provision of the service contract.in relevant part,this provision states that the home is deemed an independent contractor and shall not during the term of this contract assign,subcontract,transfer,or otherwise delegate all or part of its obligations or responsibilities without prior written approval of lehigh county.from this,argues that the home had a duty to exercise all control necessary to ensure his safety.on this reading,the home committed itself to providing more than initial placement and ongoing monitoring of established goals it also must exercise additional control over the manner of its foster parents care on a daily basis,if necessary.according to,it is thus no argument that the home did not exercise this control,including when supervising care by the nortons.the home had the duty to exercise whatever level of control was necessary to keep safe 
scattered provisions of the service contract strengthen this reading.for instance,the purpose of the contract between the home and lehigh county was defined quite broadly as care,while the home elsewhere agreed to provide foster care services.furthermore,the home promised to promote each child growth and development by providing the physical care,nurturance,and opportunity necessary for individual,social,emotional,and intellectual development.finally,the home agreed to accomplish these goals by provid ing a temporary living environment in the form of foster family care retain ing responsibility of physical custody throughout his placement and actively participat ing in the delivery of related foster care services.
given these provisions,concludes that the home was charged with running a foster care program,with responsibilities that extended beyond mere placement and supervision to additional control over the manner in which the nortons cared for on a daily basis.these textual arguments,simple and supportive,nonetheless fall short.
first,reads too much into the independent contractor provision.recourse to it merely begs the key question on appeal.it provides that the home shall not delegate all or part of its obligations or responsibilities without prior written approval.this provision says little about what those obligations and responsibilities are.as the illinois supreme court recently noted in a similar context,whatever duty there is to provide placement,to institute procedures,or even to exercise general authority over foster children,is not the same as a continuing,nondelegable duty to provide for the care of children placed in foster homes.nichol stass.
furthermore,many of the provisions that cites apply equally to a service contract providing for foster care placement and ongoing monitoring rather than one including additional responsibilities for directing the manner of care the foster parents need to provide on a daily basis.for instance,the home purported duty to provide a temporary living environment in the form of foster family care can be met through placement services.the same is true of the home obligation to promote a child growth and development by providing the physical care,nurturance,and opportunity necessary for individual,social,emotional,and intellectual development.and while the home agreed to actively participate in the delivery of services,this need not extend to all or even most of the nortons parenting decisions.indeed,this passage itself is part of a larger paragraph on the role of caseworkers in monitor ing foster families.
the home level of control is further clarified by the following passage,which was part of a program description incorporated into the service contract by the parties the lutheran home strives to provide the most stable and caring environment for children.proper recruitment and training of foster parents,careful matching of children and families,and viable accessible supports for foster parents and foster children are in place in order to avoid multiple placements.emphasis added.in this passage,the home defined its key duties as foster family recruitment,foster child placement,and ongoing supervision.
other passages in the program description also aid this account of the home responsibilities.among them,the home pledged to provide supportive services to its foster families,which were intended to the foster parents effectiveness in providing a stable,nurturing environment for the foster children in their care.in addition,the home put in place a referral procedure for processing requests from lehigh county a referral for foster care placement can be made by the county by contacting the foster care supervisor.a verbal description of a child characteristics is necessary in order to provide the most appropriate foster family setting.importantly,a cceptance of the referral is contingent upon whether a suitable match can be made between the child and a foster family and the availability of an opening.therefore,if a suitable match with a family were not made,the home would not accept a referral from lehigh county 
moreover,within the home program approved foster families agree to provide,basic physical care,health care,and supervision,as well as provide for the child developmental needs.in this role,foster parents must participate in the development of the child i ndividual s ervice p lan and facilitate many of the objectives outlined in the plan.
related regulations provide further support for this account.pennsylvania law defines a foster family care agency as a public or private agency which recruits,approves,supervises,and places children with foster families.see.in this capacity,it is a for the county,which would typically be responsible for these tasks.at the same time,a foster family is defined as t he living unit,including the foster family residence and foster parent,approved by a foster family care agency to provide foster family care to children.id.similarly,a foster parent is defined as a n individual responsible for providing foster family care to children placed by a foster family care agency.id.within this scheme,foster families are tasked with p rovid ing temporary,substitute care for each child in need.id.at.
in addition,the service contract itself suggests that it should be read in light of these regulatory goals,as the contract interpretation provision provides that it is the intention of the parties that the public health,safety,and welfare be protected and furthered by the c ontract.therefore,this c ontract is to be interpreted in such manner as to favor such public interest as opposed to any private interest.as the home counsel explained at oral argument,the service contracts are written in light of related code provisions.oral arg.tr.analyzing the service contract in light of related regulations,the home argues that its duty is to provide foster care indirectly through a foster family and assist the county in placing children in foster families.id.at.the pennsylvania children and youth administrators association pcyaa similarly explained,private foster care agencies can not and do not supervise and control the care that a foster parent provides a foster child.foster care agencies do not have the power or authority to exercise this type of control over foster parents.pcyaa br.these accounts are consistent with the role of a foster family care agency as defined by pennsylvania regulatory scheme.
taken together,these passages suggest that the home duties extended only to initial placement and ongoing supervision of established goals,not to the manner in which the nortons chose to achieve each of these goals.therefore,the service contract,standing alone,is insufficient to establish a relationship.yet this does not end the inquiry.it is still possible that the home related supervisory responsibilities give rise to a relationship.to that end,we turn to the placement agreement and accompanying handbook.
the placement agreement and the handbook 
under the placement agreement and the handbook,the home had the right to control many facets of care.under the agreement,norton was assigned a topton foster care caseworker.in addition,norton agreed that f requent contacts between the caseworker and the foster parents we re necessary so both c ould discuss observations,difficulties,general development,and future plans regarding.to that end,the agreement provided for biweekly visits by the caseworker to the foster home for the first two months of placement and monthly visits thereafter at the discretion of the caseworker and supervisor.
apart from these ongoing visits,the home also set various standards for care.in its handbook,the home detail ed foster care practices,foster roles and responsibilities,and current foster care regulations.as new foster parents,the nortons were required to participate in an orientation,which outlined topton philosophy,practices,foster parent and topton roles and responsibilities,and applicable regulations for foster care.these practices and regulations included rules dealing with a foster child money,clothing,medical and dental treatment,education,employment,transportation,recreation,religious practices,tobacco use,and vacations.they also included standards that governed its foster parents on everything from disciplinary practices to the frequency of.the home even reserve d the right to question the adequacy of meals,clothing,recreational opportunities,or other needs being provided by the foster family.in addition to these paper provisions,the level of control that the home actually exercised during placement further suggests the limited scope of foster parent autonomy within the home foster care program with the home frequent phone calls and visits to say nothing of their direct interventions involving the nortons and.
while true that the relationship between norton and was not that of a biological parent and his children this does not settle the question.the test is not whether norton retained as much control over as a biological parent it is whether the home had sufficient control over norton to result in a relationship.we hold that it did not.
first,in the placement agreement,norton agreed to be responsible for meeting the physical,social,and emotional needs of on an ongoing basis,leaving the home with the related responsibility of assisting norton in achieving these goals.this passage alone suggests a division of labor inconsistent with a relationship,with norton responsible for daily parenting decisions and the home merely responsible for setting goals and providing additional support as needed.under pennsylvania law,that the home set certain standards in order to maintain a uniform quality of service only addresse d the result of the work and not the manner in which it wa s conducted.myszkowski,at emphases in original.this is insufficient to establish a relationship.
second,in the specific context of transportation,the home responsibilities under the service contract were narrow,and its control over norton attenuated the home simply agreed to guarantee all drivers hold a valid,appropriate driver license.the placement agreement is not in tension with this.rather than exerting continuous control over norton manner of driving,the home stipulated that anyone driving had to have a driver license and adequate insurance coverage subject to certain and safety guidelines indeed,the home even permitted other adults to drive,at the discretion of norton,subject only to the expectation that norton knows the driver,the destination,and is able to validate that the driver has a current motor vehicle driver license and adequate insurance coverage.taken together,these requirements fulfilled the home obligations under the service contract and established less extensive control over norton transportation responsibilities than in other areas.
finally,the source of many of the more invasive requirements within the placement agreement was the commonwealth itself either through statute or regulation not the home.under pennsylvania law,these requirements alone do not result in a relationship.in universal am can,the pennsylvania supreme court held that an agreement between a hauling company and the of a did not establish a relationship.on examining the agreement between the parties,the court observed that its provisions were for the most part governed by federal regulations,including requirements for mandatory inspections,for observing speed limits,and for covering loads with tarps.universal am can,at.it added 
factors which demonstrate compliance with government regulations do not assist in the application of the test.the existence of the regulations precludes the parties from negotiating any terms subject to the regulations.neither party has bargaining power,or the ability to control the work to be done,when dealing with matters subject to regulation.
id.at.as a result,the court concluded that the regulations were not probative of the issue,as they reflect the control of the government,not the motor carrier.id.at.
because federal and state regulations controlled the essential elements of the trucker work,the court concluded that other features of the agreement which were not dictated by government regulations also fell short of establishing a relationship.these additional features included requirements to communicate with the dispatcher every or hours,submit fuel and toll receipts,and take a mandatory stop for meals.see id.at cappy,concurring in part and dissenting in part 
the home argues that the same is true here.and,indeed,the placement agreement and handbook do overlap with state regulations in many key areas.for instance,the pennsylvania administrative code reads the county agency shall provide an opportunity for a child placed in a foster home or child care facility which it administers to participate in religious activities,services,and counseling,taking into account the choices specified by the parents or guardian or the child.the placement agreement largely tracks the code language,providing that a ll children are to be given reasonable opportunities for religious expression within the broad religious preferences of their choice or that of their parents.this is only one of several examples of how the placement agreement and the handbook track state regulations.others include the regulation of a foster child money education safety medical and dental care residence grievance procedures transportation requirements and constraints on parental autonomy including methods of discipline and training requirements.
counters that not every provision in the placement agreement and handbook was a product of state regulations.for instance,the home included certain disciplinary practices beyond those enumerated under pennsylvania law.the home also exercised final authority over whether a child could partake in certain childhood,including holding a summer job and driving a car.finally,foster parents were prohibited from sign ing any papers or documents other than school absence excuses,report cards,or items of a routine nature.contends that,even if universal am can applied,these additional provisions,among many others,would be enough to establish a relationship.we disagree.
universal am can does not mean that all requirements within an agreement must be the product of government regulations.instead,in this case we must consider the foster care parent relationship in light of related state regulations,as well as the provisions imposed by the home itself.
the relationship between foster care agencies,foster parents,and foster children under pennsylvania law 
the relationship between a foster care agency and a foster parent is unlike that of the typical master and servant within the framework provided by the agency,foster parents are given considerable latitude in meeting the goals of each child individual service plan.this is by design,as the commonwealth requires placements that,as much as possible,replicate the traditional family setting.b i.implicit in the foster child relationship is a level of parental autonomy that permits foster parents,on a daily basis,to adjust their care to the individualized needs of their foster child,just as biological parents would in a traditional family setting.
the pennsylvania supreme court has recently provided guidance in assessing relationships that are similarly individualized and dynamic.in valles,the plaintiff brought a claim against a hospital premised upon a theory of vicarious liability for the battery committed by the doctor due to his failure to obtain informed consent prior to performing an aortogram.at.the plaintiff argued that,b ecause a hospital has an obligation to oversee all persons who practice medicine within its walls,it as an employer and health care provider in its own right maintains a right of control in the relationship sufficient to justify the imposition of liability.id.at.
the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the hospital,concluding that the relationship between it and a staff radiologist in the context of informed consent was not that of a master and its servant.this was despite the hospital exercising much control over the radiologist,including 
its provision of the instrumentalities,place to work,support staff,patient base and wages its right to require the employee presence at a particular time,and to terminate his employment its retention of revenues for the employee professional services and its use of departmental organization,peer review,rules and regulations,credentialing,and privileging practices.
id.at.as the plaintiffs argued,the doctor exercise of independent medical judgment was subject to the hospital right of control because his work may not be delegated to others his medical findings must be reported in a manner set by hospital policy and he must perform the requested study according to departmental protocols id.
the court nonetheless declined to recognize a relationship,holding as a matter of law that a medical facility lacks the control over the manner in which the physician performs his duty to obtain informed consent so as to render the facility vicariously liable.id.at.it explained that a medical facility can not maintain control over this aspect of the relationship,since i nformed consent flows from the discussions each patient has with his physician,based on the facts and circumstances each case presents.id.the baseline was that it would be improvident and unworkable to interject an element of a hospital control into this highly individualized and dynamic relationship.id.
we conclude that the pennsylvania supreme court analysis in valles should apply equally to the relationship between a foster care agency and its foster parent.given the highly individualized and dynamic adjustments that foster parents must make in fulfilling the ongoing obligations to their foster children,it would be similarly improvident and unworkable to interject an element of the foster agency control into such a relationship 
conclusion 
under its service contract,lehigh county assigned to the home the duty of selecting and approving prospective foster parents,assisting the county with suitable placements,monitoring these placements,and submitting to the county individual service plans and various reports tracking each foster child.although this provided the home with a great deal of control over its foster parents,it fell short of imposing a right of control over the manner in which foster parents provided foster care to their foster children on a daily basis.the home placement agreement with the nortons presented general guidelines for foster care and incorporated specific provisions of the service contract and state regulations.instead of subjecting norton to the continuous control of the home,these documents generally addressed the results of the work and not the manner in which it was conducted.it gave the home a broad supervisory role,but not the right to control the daily activities of the norton family.on a daily basis,the nortons decided how to meet physical,social,and emotional needs themselves.this was by design.
one of the key goals of the pennsylvania foster care system is to replicate as closely as possible the traditional family settings in which children are cared for and raised.leshko servis,cir.this goal limits the scope of control that the foster care agency may exercise over its foster parents on a daily basis.indeed,too much control over the activities of foster families would make it impossible to replicate the traditional family setting.id.therefore,even with the level of control that the home may have exercised under the placement agreement,the nortons still exercised largely the same level of control over life as they did over their biological children.as the district court noted,the nortons still decided the activities would engage in,the food he would eat,and the books he would read.in addition,n o one controlled what time the nortons must awake in the morning,what time they must feed him,what time he must go to sleep,and what tasks or activities he should be doing at any given moment.for goals outlined by the home,the nortons were largely free to accomplish them as they saw fit.for items not contained in the placement agreement or the handbook,the nortons were free to treat as they would their biological children.
of course,the nortons were constrained in important ways by the placement agreement,and they were subjected to consistent monitoring by the home.nonetheless the nortons still had a great deal of discretion on a daily basis over how to care for much as the relationship in valles,the foster child relationship in this case was highly individualized and dynamic,making it similarly improvident and unworkable to exercise a high level of control over the relationship.moreover,such control would be inconsistent with the regulatory regime imposed by the commonwealth.
for these reasons,we hold that a relationship did not exist between the home and norton.hence the home was not vicariously liable for norton ordinary negligence at issue in this appeal.
we therefore affirm.
in his amended complaint,labeled topton house,llc,topton management services,and the lutheran home at topton,collectively,as the topton defendants.topton house,llc and topton management services,were subsequently dismissed from the suit.only the lutheran home at topton is before us on appeal.
under pennsylvania law,foster children may not be punish ed for bedwetting or actions related to toilet training.
we may address this issue because the home was on notice of the claim,did not argue in our court that the issue was waived,and addressed the issue on the merits in its brief to us.see hedges musco,cir citing johnson horn,cir and venuto carella,byrne,bain,gilfillan,cecchi stewart,cir.
