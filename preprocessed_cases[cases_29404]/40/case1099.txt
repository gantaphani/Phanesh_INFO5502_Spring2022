opinion of the court 
the united states secretary of labor appeals an order from the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania dismissing the secretary complaint under the labor management reporting and disclosure act lmrda,et seq,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court determined that john johnson administrative complaint,underlying the secretary lmrda enforcement action,had not been timely filed and that,therefore,the secretary effort to seek relief for johnson against local of the transit workers union twu could not proceed.for the following reasons,we will reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
throughout april,local accepted candidate slates for its upcoming election of officers.johnson,a candidate for president of the local,submitted a slate nominating mickey ostrowski for two different positions,recording secretary and secretary treasurer on may,local election committee sent ostrowski a letter informing him that he had been nominated for two positions and that he had to choose which to pursue,because multiple candidacies are forbidden by the union.when ostrowski nevertheless submitted acceptance letters for both positions,the committee informed him that he had violated twu nomination procedures and was thus ineligible to run for office.the committee then informed johnson that,as a result of ostrowski disqualification,he no longer had a full slate of candidates and his entire slate was disqualified under twu election rule prohibiting partial candidate slates.
article xv,section,of the twu constitution establishes procedures for members pursuing election protests.it reads,in relevant part,as follows 
any member in good standing who believes that has been improperly denied the opportunity to be a candidate for an elective 
office or position,or who believes that an election in which was a candidate was improperly conducted,may file a complaint with local executive board.if is dissatisfied with the action of the local executive board on complaint,may,within days thereafter,or within days after filing complaint with the local executive board if the board has not taken final action thereon within that time,file an appeal to the international union 
evidently relying on that provision,johnson and ostrowski filed a complaint on may,with the local executive board the protest,challenging both the disqualification of ostrowski as a candidate and the resulting disqualification of the entire johnson slate.on june,the executive board rejected the protest but advised johnson and ostrowski that they could appeal the decision to the international union under article xxii of the twu constitution johnson,for himself and on behalf of his slate of candidates,then filed a timely appeal with twu international secretary treasurer,who forwarded the appeal to the international committee on appeals ica.the ica denied johnson appeal on september,
local held its election on september,without johnson as a candidate.afterward,on october,johnson filed another protest with the executive board the protest.when the executive board failed to act on that protest,johnson filed another appeal with the international union on november.the ica also failed to act on his appeal,and,on january,johnson filed an administrative complaint with the secretary of labor,under title iv,of the lmrda,alleging that local had violated the lmrda by disqualifying his slate of candidates 
title iv of the lmrda allows aggrieved union members to file administrative complaints directly with the secretary of labor,provided that the member has satisfied the exhaustion requirement contained in of the statute,which states 
a a member of a labor organization 
who has exhausted the remedies available under the constitution and bylaws of such organization and of any parent body,or 
who has invoked such available remedies without obtaining a final decision within three calendar months after their invocation,
may file a complaint with the secretary within one calendar month thereafter alleging the violation of any provision of section of the lmrda 
if the member remains aggrieved after exhausting the remedies available through the union,the secretary is required to investigate the member complaint.id.b.upon a finding of probable cause to believe that a violation of the lmrda has occurred and has not been remedied,the secretary must bring a civil enforcement action on behalf of the member against the union.id.following statutory protocol,the secretary investigated johnson complaint,found probable cause to believe that there had been a violation of the lmrda,and commenced the present enforcement action on behalf of johnson against local in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.
local responded by filing a motion to dismiss,arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the timing of johnson administrative complaint to the secretary.on november,the district court granted the motion to dismiss.the court determined that johnson filing of his administrative complaint with the secretary was untimely under the lmrda and hence could not be a predicate for the secretary enforcement action against the union.according to the court,because the twu constitution does not expressly give its members the opportunity to file both protests and protests,johnson had just one opportunity to file a protest,which he took when he filed his protest.app.at a.having thus concluded that johnson protest was invalid,the district court held that johnson protest must serve as the pertinent point of reference for determining whether johnson administrative complaint to the secretary was timely under the lmrda.id.at.the court alternatively held that,even if johnson protest had been valid under the twu constitution,our precedent requires that the timeliness of an lmrda administrative complaint be measured from a union member protest and not a later protest.id.at.when measured from the date of johnson protest,johnson administrative complaint was,the court said,invalid because it was untimely under a and therefore could not serve as the foundation for the secretary enforcement action against twu.the district court accordingly dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction id.the secretary timely appeal followed.

the secretary argues that the district court dismissal of her enforcement action was error because johnson postelection protest is allowed by the text of the twu constitution and,hence,constitutes an available internal union remedy that can serve as the relevant event for determining the timeliness of johnson administrative complaint under the lmrda.specifically,the secretary argues that t he twu constitution nowhere prohibited johnson from filing his protest,and that precedent dictates that union complaint procedures must be liberally construed in favor of a complaining union member.appellant op.br.at.she further contends that,as long as the protest is valid under the twu constitution,nothing in the lmrda or in our case law prohibits a union member from filing a complaint with the secretary based on a protest simply because a protest had also been filed.id.at.the union,of course,responds that the district court interpretation of the twu constitution is correct and that johnson protest was invalid and can not support the secretary enforcement action.appellee ans.br.at.
congress enacted the lmrda to remedy abuses in union elections without departing from the longstanding congressional policy against unnecessary governmental interference with internal union affairs.hodgson local,united steelworkers of,d citation omitted steelworkers,local.congress thus included in the act a requirement that union members protesting the conduct of elections exhaust their internal union remedies before complaining to the secretary id.at.see also a.in an early case involving the lmrda,the supreme court held that any interpretation of the exhaustion requirement must reflect the needs of rank and file union people the requirement is designed ultimately to serve.steelworkers,local,at.the court admonished that members should not be held to procedural niceties while seeking redress within their unions id.at.we have likewise emphasized that internal union protest procedures are designed ultimately to serve rank and file union members,and that any ambiguities must be liberally construed in favor of the complaining member.donovan local,int l of workers,cir citations omitted workers,local.our sister circuits have similarly held that when a rank and file union member is faced with internal union protest procedures that may be unclear or ambiguous,the member need only do what is reasonable under the circumstances.see,dole united auto.aerospace and agric.implement workers of,cir finding that union members efforts at obtaining internal resolution of their complaints were reasonable under the circumstances and thus sufficient to meet exhaustion requirements stevens nw.dist.council,united broth.of carpenters,cir noting that,while failure to properly exhaust should lead a federal court to stay its hand until exhaustion can be completed,the exhaustion requirement must nevertheless be a reasonable one donovan sailors union of the,cir holding that a union member protest was reasonable under the circumstances,and thus timely under the lmrda,where the union was unclear about its own protest procedures.
in evaluating whether,under the lmrda,a union member has properly exhausted remedies available within the union,courts look to the union constitution.see hodgson dist,united steelworkers of,cir steelworkers,district in order to decide whether the secretary position is correct,we must examine the international constitution to determine if avenues were open within the union.thus,we must review the relevant provision from the twu constitution.article xv,section of that charter governs election protests.as earlier noted,it provides,in part,that 
a ny member in good standing who believes that has been improperly denied the opportunity to be a candidate for an elective office or position,or who believes that an election in which was a candidate was improperly conducted,may file a complaint with local executive board.
working from this provision,the district court held that the twu constitution,in article xv,section,gives its union members only one opportunity to file a complaint.that complaint may be either or.app.at.the court concluded that the secretary had failed to demonstrate that johnson filed a valid protest,because johnson had already filed a one.it appears,then,that the district court interpreted the clause stating that a member may file a complaint as meaning that a member may file one and only one election protest.while the secretary concedes that this is one plausible interpretation of the text of the relevant constitutional provision appellant op.br.at,she argues that it is not the only plausible interpretation,and we agree.the same language can reasonably be understood to mean that a member is entitled to file at least one protest,not only one protest.in other words,the provision is ambiguous.
in interpreting the twu constitution as it did,the district court did not heed the mandate that ambiguous constitutional provisions must be liberally construed in favor of the complaining member.workers,local,at.when confronted by the ambiguity in article xv,section,johnson was only required to interpret the language in a way that was reasonable under the circumstances.see donovan,at holding that a union member method of election protest was reasonable under the circumstances and thus constituted a reasonable attempt to invoke his union remedies steelworkers,local,at.c ourts should impose a heavy burden on the union to show that it could not in any way discern that a member was complaining of the violation in question.his actions demonstrate that he interpreted the provision as permitting an aggrieved union member to file both a and a postelection protest,which is a legitimate interpretation for at least three reasons.first,as already mentioned,the words a complaint need not mean just one election protest.second,the provision itself does not specify whether protests must be filed pre or.and third,moving from this particular provision to the constitution as a whole nowhere does the twu constitution bar a union member from filing a protest because he has already filed a protest thus,the language of the twu constitution itself,ambiguous though article xv,section is,supports johnson interpretation as reasonable,particularly in light of the rule that union constitutions are to be liberally construed in favor of rank and file members like johnson.
local argues,however,that to interpret the twu constitution as johnson did and as the secretary suggests would permit the serial filing of identical complaints by different members of a disgruntled election slate over an extended period of time with each successive complaint restarting the lmrda clock,which would be absurd.appellee ans.br.at.the district court was persuaded by that argument.it said,t he secretary seems to advance a reading of the twu constitution under which union members may file a protest,pursue appeals,and then refile the same protest app.at.
in adopting the union argument,the district court failed to recognize that there are legitimate reasons why a labor organization may want to provide its members with more than one opportunity to raise the same or similar protests.for example,a union may wish to prioritize the goal of member satisfaction over the goal of internal efficiency,and so afford members more than one opportunity to be heard.a union may also decide that a member could legitimately buttress a preelection protest with additional information available only after the contested election.in addition,a union may want to give itself a second opportunity to consider a protest,particularly when the protest has been developed and refined by further evidence.
local invokes principles of res judicata to explain why its protest rule is required.just as courts should not have to hear a complaint twice,local argues that unions should not be burdened with repetitive election protests.appellee ans.br.at noting that res judicata precludes the of claims already raised and adjudicated.that is not a sound analogy,however,as internal union dispute mechanisms do not implicate the public policy considerations behind the doctrine of res judicata.courts operate on public funds for the benefit of the general public.unions operate on the dues of their members and for the benefit of their members.imposing a judicial model onto union dispute resolution would be at odds with longstanding policy against unnecessary governmental interference with internal union affairs.steelworkers,local,at.
moreover,the union hypothetical of an endless series of cloned complaints is not an adequate reason to deprive one of its members of the benefit of a reasonable interpretation of rights provided in the twu constitution.there will be time enough to deal with the extreme case when and if it arises.for now,it is sufficient to note that johnson efforts to obtain redress are comfortably within the bounds of existing precedent.see usery local div,amalgamated transit union,cir considering an lmrda challenge based on a protest after finding that a union member had not exhausted his internal union remedies with his protest see also lawyers guild,employee and union member guide to labor law elise gautier ed.west noting that a preelection protest will normally not be either sufficient or necessary exhaustion.
there is another compelling reason why johnson postelection protest should be considered valid as a foundation for the secretary enforcement action.this court has long held that,in the context of the lmrda exhaustion requirement,a union failure to object to a member efforts to exhaust can be interpreted as acquiescence or waiver.workers,local,at.our decision in workers,l
