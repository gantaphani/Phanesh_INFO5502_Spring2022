before us is a petition for a writ of mandamus brought by alba inés rendón galvis rendón pursuant to d seeking to have this court reassess her entitlement to certain rights afforded by the crime victims rights act of cvra,and the victim and witness protection act vwpa.the petition was filed on april.the court heard oral argument on april,within three days not counting the intervening weekend of the filing,and that day we issued an order denying the petition,noting that this opinion would follow.in essence,rendón appeals from the march,ruling of the united states district court for the southern district of new york berman,denying her status as a crime victim in the case united states.because the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that rendón was not a crime victim as defined by the cvra,and because she has no standing to challenge the district court ruling under the vwpa,we deny the petition.
background 
in,rendón son,juan fernando vargas rendón vargas,was murdered in the comuna section of medellín,colombia,by paramilitaries affiliated with the autodefensas unidas de colombia auc classified by the united states department of state as a terrorist organization.his body was discovered in a mass grave.
diego fernando,an auc leader and commander of the auc subgroup operating in comuna,cacique nutibara bloc bcn,was charged in a colombian criminal proceeding with conspiring to commit the aggravated homicide and forced disappearance of residents of comuna,including vargas.although he had not perpetrated the crimes directly,he pled guilty to the charges,confessing to being responsible for the crimes in his capacity as bcn commander.he was later extradited in to the united states,where he was charged in a indictment with conspiracy to import into the united states,and to distribute with the intent that it be imported,at least five kilograms of cocaine,in violation of,a,a,b b ii,and and conspiracy to commit money laundering,in violation of a b and h.after initially entering a plea of not guilty,he has now pled guilty in the district court to the first count of the indictment,with the agreement that the government would move to dismiss the second count at sentencing.neither the federal indictment charging,nor his plea agreement,aside from a stipulation that he possessed a firearm in connection with the conspiracy offense,nor colloquy at the proceedings makes reference to his engaging in any violent conduct.
in february,rendón filed a motion in the district court seeking to enforce her rights as a crime victim under the cvra,the vwpa,and the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,to be allowed to confer with the government,to be heard before sentencing,and to receive restitution.she argued that participation in the charged conspiracy was the actual and proximate cause of her son death because the auc had targeted comuna for its importance as a corridor,using disappearances and executions to gain control of the area,and because the auc had financed its terrorist activities with drug proceeds.she argued that the cvra should be interpreted to include the victims of any acts related to the charged conspiracy,regardless of whether the acts were described in the indictment or plea agreement,and also to include the victims of acts of the defendant.rendón claimed that a broad interpretation of the definition of crime victim under the cvra is consistent with its underlying legislative intent.see cong.rec.daily ed,statement of kyl a ll victims of crime deserve to have their rights protected,whether or not they are the victim of the count charged.
the government and opposed rendón motion.the government argued that congress had intended to limit the definition of crime victim to those affected by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense.the government also argued that,even under a broader interpretation of crime victim,the court would have to determine whether vargas murder was related to the auc narcotics operations,rather than to its other activities such as its conflict with the fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de colombia farc,and the government pointed to evidence in the record showing that the auc had not received all of its financing from narcotics.the government further argued that rendón was not entitled to restitution under the vwpa because she had not shown that her son murder was in furtherance of the narcotics conspiracy.the government also noted that although it was not obligated to do so,it had offered to confer with rendón in advance of sentencing and,at the court discretion,to facilitate her participation in the sentencing process.for his part,argued that there was no evidence that vargas murder had been committed in furtherance of the drug conspiracy to which he had pleaded guilty.he suggested that vargas death had taken place in the course of a series of military operations in which an alliance of police,military,and local security forces had seized control of comuna from the farc.he claimed that,despite the fact that the order was not to commit any unnecessary serious crimes,excesses were committed,and he noted that he had previously accepted responsibility for his failure as a military boss,to properly control his troops.
after hearing oral argument on the motion,the district court found that rendón had not met the statutory definition of a victim under any of the statutes.in making its findings of fact,the district court credited assertions that excesses had been committed despite his orders,as the bcn commander,that unnecessary serious crimes be avoided in comuna.the district court further found that had accepted responsibility for vargas death based on his failure to control his troops,and had surrendered numerous properties to the colombian justice and peace process for victim compensation.as background for its ruling,the district court referred to evidence in the record stating that comuna had been overrun with l guerillas,paramilitaries and well armed drug gangs and that i n,the casualty count for comuna chaotic street fights,targeted assassinations and cleansings numbered in the hundreds.based on these facts,the district court held,quoting from united states sharp,d,that the movant is not a victim as that term is used in the cvra because she is not a person directly and proximately harmed by the federal crime committed by defendant.the district court also denied rendón motion with regard to restitution under the mvra and the vwpa,indicating that the denials follow ed from the denial under the cvra.
rendón now argues to this court that the district court abused its discretion by applying an approach to analyzing whether she is a crime victim.she also argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to assess independently her eligibility for restitution under the vwpa.
the government and oppose the petition,arguing that the district court correctly found that the cvra requires a putative victim to have been directly and proximately harmed as a result of the conduct underlying the elements of the offense to which the defendant has pled guilty and that,even if the district court erred in undertaking an approach,it found correctly that rendón has failed,as a matter of fact,to establish causation.the government further argues that rendón vwpa claim is not governed by the cvra mandamus provisions and fails under the conventional mandamus standard and that the district court properly ruled,in any event,that the denial of the vwpa claim followed from denial of the cvra claim because rendón had failed to show that vargas murder was causally linked to the drug conspiracy
