maría was discharged from public employment in puerto rico in february,shortly after the governorship of the commonwealth changed hands from one political party to another.according to her later complaint,peñalbert had been employed since as a receptionist in an office building annexed to the puerto rico governor executive mansion from to,she worked in a communications office within the same complex.neither position,she asserts,entailed formulating policy or handling confidential information.
the new governor,luis,candidate of the new progressive party npp,was elected in november and assumed office in january.several weeks later,member of the popular democratic party pdp received a letter terminating her employment.the letter described her position as one of trust that is,one subject to termination under puerto rico law,laws ann.tit,see segarra,cir,but it contained no criticism of her work or explanation for her firing.
on april,peñalbert brought the present civil rights action,alleging that the termination violated her federal constitutional rights to freedom of speech and association,due process,and equal protection she also invoked supplemental federal jurisdiction over various claims arising under puerto rico law.the complaint named as defendants governor fortuño fortuño chief of staff,juan carlos blanco and the administrator of the governor mansion,velmarie in his or her individual and official capacities.
the central claim was that fortuño and the two others fired peñalbert because of her political affiliation to the pdp and gave her position to an npp member.the complaint sought million in compensatory damages as well as preliminary injunctive relief,which was denied.ultimately,the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim under federal law.b the claims under puerto rico law were dismissed without prejudice.
peñalbert now appeals,focusing only on the political discrimination claim under the first amendment and the denial of preliminary injunctive relief she also says her local law claims should not have been dismissed with prejudice,but the district court dismissed them without prejudice.our review of a judgment of dismissal for failure to state a claim under the federal statute is de novo,power,cir,accepting the allegations of the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in peñalbert favor,otero indus.comm n,cir.
as construed by several decisions,the first amendment prohibits government officials from taking adverse employment actions against public employees because of the employees political affiliations,unless partisan considerations are a legitimate requirement for the position in question.branti finkel,elrod burns,plurality opinion.subject to the latter exception,the plaintiff meets the test by showing that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in the employment decision,cir.
the complaint adequately alleges a claim that someone discharged peñalbert in violation of the first amendment.presumably,whoever discharged her was acting as a state actor,and no basis has yet been asserted for exempting peñalbert from the protections of branti and elrod.while there may have been some reason independent of political party for the firing,the opposite inference may be drawn from the timing of the discharge,the lack of explanation and the replacement by a member of the opposing party.
the trouble with peñalbert complaint is not that the charge is implausible political firings after elections in puerto rico are not uncommon.but,save under special conditions,an adequate complaint must include not only a plausible claim but also a plausible defendant.yet there is nothing in the complaint beyond raw speculation to suggest that the named defendants as perpetrators or the decision to dismiss peñalbert.
to be sure,the complaint asserts that governor fortuño approves or disapproves of all personnel decisions at the governor mansion,including the personnel decisions concerning the termination of peñalbert that the two named subordinate officials participated in these decisions that the defendants knew or assumed that peñalbert belonged to the pdp was not a member of the npp and ultimately that all three conspired to dismiss peñalbert because she was a member of the pdp.all except that conspiracy charge are at least couched in factual terms 
the plaintiff factual allegations are ordinarily assumed to be true in passing on the adequacy of the complaint,which need not plead evidence.see,dep t of educ,wl,at cir,sandler airlines,cir per curiam.but ordinarily does not mean always some allegations,while not stating ultimate legal conclusions,are nevertheless so threadbare or speculative that they fail to cross the line between the conclusory and the factual.bell atl.twombly.
thus,in ashcroft iqbal,the complaint charged that two government officials knowingly condoned harsh detention conditions for the plaintiff as a matter of policy,solely on account of his religion,race,national origin,id.at quoting complaint.although this was patently a factual claim about the named defendants state of mind,the supreme court held that the bare allegation of intent was inadequate absent more specific factual assertions 
to be clear,we do not reject these bald allegations on the ground that they are unrealistic or nonsensical.we do not so characterize them any more than the court in twombly rejected the plaintiffs express allegation of a contract,combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry,because it thought that claim too chimerical to be maintained.it is the conclusory nature of respondent allegations,rather than their extravagantly fanciful nature,that disentitles them to the presumption of truth.

iqbal could be viewed as emergent law,see.at souter,dissenting,but we ourselves had earlier said a complaint that rests on bald assertions and unsupportable conclusions may be subject to dismissal,aulson blanchard,cir and our decisions since iqbal have several times found unadorned factual assertions to be inadequate without trying to lay down a mechanical rule,it is enough to say that sometimes a threadbare factual allegation bears insignia of its speculative character and,absent greater concreteness,invites an early can be countered by a plaintiff supplying of the missing detail.
here,peñalbert complaint does allege that personnel decisions in the executive mansion are within the authority of the governor,but nothing beyond speculation supports the further assertion that the governor or his chief of staff participated in the decision to dismiss peñalbert.someone denominated the administrator of the governor mansion might more plausibly be involved,but nothing in the complaint indicates the administrator actual duties or that the administrator ordinarily passes on the selection or discharge of a receptionist.
a defendant could be liable,even without knowing of peñalbert or her position,if for example on some generic basis that defendant authorized the impermissible firing of pdp supporters because of their party membership or beliefs,cir discussing alleged statement by mayor of his intention to rid city hall of npp employees.but,again,mere possibility is not enough to state a claim and again no facts are stated in the complaint to show that in this instance any of the three gave such an order or that it is even plausible that they did.
if peñalbert had any basis beyond speculation for charging any one of the named defendants with knowing participation in the wrong,it seems almost certain that this would have been not in the complaint at least in the opposition to the motion to dismiss.specific information,even if not in the form of admissible evidence,would likely be enough at this stage pure speculation is not.this may seem hard on a plaintiff who merely suspects wrongdoing,but even discovery requires a minimum showing and fishing expeditions are not permitted.dm research,at.
however,peñalbert position is in one respect different the complaint adequately on the facts already someone fired peñalbert based on party membership.of course,the factu
