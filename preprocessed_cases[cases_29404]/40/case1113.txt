opinion of the court 
appellant robert dee,appeals from the final order of the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania granting summary judgment in favor of appellees the borough of dunmore,the borough of dunmore council,and various borough officials joseph loftus,thomas hennigan,joseph talutto,frank padula,and leonard verrastro collectively the borough.in june of,after approximately eighteen years of service with the borough of dunmore fire department,dee was suspended without notice by the borough council based on its determination that he had failed to complete two training requirements.days later,news of dee suspension was published in the borough local paper.eight days after the suspension was initially announced,the borough council held a hearing,at which it concluded that dee was in fact in compliance with all applicable training requirements.
dee brought suit under,alleging violations of his first,fifth,and fourteenth amendment rights as a result of the borough conduct he also included several causes of action under state law.on appeal,dee challenges the district court conclusion that his allegations were insufficient to state a claim against the borough for violating his right to procedural due process as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.specifically,dee argues that the district court erred in determining that the property and liberty interests alleged in his complaint did not warrant constitutional protection.
we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to.for the reasons stated below,we will vacate the district court entry of judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
at all times relevant to his complaint,dee was employed as a firefighter by the borough of dunmore fire department.after serving as a volunteer firefighter for approximately three years,dee was eventually hired full time and,over a span of fifteen years,was promoted through the ranks of the department,from lieutenant to captain to assistant fire chief.as a firefighter,dee employment with the borough was not at will rather it was governed by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement cba between the borough and local union of the international association of fire fighters,of which dee was a member.
on may,joseph loftus,the borough manager,requested from frank arnone,the borough fire chief,a list of the necessary qualifications and certifications for work in the fire department according to the cba,along with documentation that each firefighter had met these qualification.on may,arnone sent loftus a memo with the requested list and notified loftus that all certification information was kept in the department personnel file.three days later,on may,loftus inquired of arnone as to whether all of the firefighters had completed the identified requirements and then went back to arnone once again,seeking some additional information.after reviewing the materials he received from arnone,loftus determined that dee had failed to complete two weeks of required training at the pennsylvania state fire academy and did not have the required emt certification.without contacting dee,and without conducting any further investigation,loftus conveyed this information to the borough council.
on june,relying only on the information provided by loftus,the borough council voted to suspend dee with pay pending a hearing to be held eight days later.dee was not present at the council vote,nor was he even aware that his personnel file was under review.once the decision to suspend dee had been made,loftus sent a letter to arnone on june,informing him of the suspension and of the scheduled hearing.arnone in turn informed dee,who learned then for the first time of the charges against him.dee was immediately removed from the schedule and prohibited from returning to work unless and until his suspension was lifted.
on june,after receiving a copy of loftus june letter to arnone,the published a story entitled firefighters suspended for not completing required training.app.the article named dee and captain edward smith as the firefighters with incomplete training records.it also included,inter alia,a quote from councilman paul nardozzo,who stated that he voted against the suspensions because he d id think this was looked at and researched enough.app.five days after the article was published,on july,dee filed this lawsuit.
on july,the borough council met.dee attended the meeting,together with union counsel,who presented evidence as to the true facts.the council then determined that dee had in fact completed all required training,and that,under the terms of the cba,he was not required to have the emt certification for which he had been suspended,because the requirement only applied to those hired after a certain date.after the meeting,dee was notified by fire chief arnone that he would be permitted to return to work.on july,the ran a story entitled dunmore firefighters reinstated.app.
after a period of discovery in the district court,the borough moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted the borough motion.the court concluded,without analysis,that dee did not have a property interest cognizable under the fourteenth amendment,and found,after considering the elements of a liberty interest claim,that his asserted interest did not warrant constitutional protection.having dismissed dee federal causes of action,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.dee filed a timely notice of appeal.
on appeal,dee contends that he was denied procedural due process that should have been afforded by virtue of his asserted property and liberty interests,and that,accordingly,he was entitled to survive summary judgment.
standard of review 
we exercise plenary review over a grant of summary judgment,viewing the facts in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party,and applying the same standard that guides our district courts.erie telecomms.city of erie,cir.under that standard,a party is entitled to summary judgment only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
discussion 
originally enacted as part of the civil rights act of,provides a private right of action against anyone who,acting under the color of state law,deprives another of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.see also nextel partners kingston,cir.in this case,the right upon which dee bases his claim is his fourteenth amendment right to procedural due process 
in order to determine whether the borough actions,as outlined above,deprived dee of due process,we must first ask whether the asserted individual interests are encompassed within the fourteenth amendment protection of life,liberty,or property.robb city of,cir see also board of regents roth,d the requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the fourteenth amendment protection of liberty and property.stana sch.dist.of pittsburgh,cir the predicate for requiring a government entity to comply with the rudiments of procedural due process is a determination that some constitutional interest is at stake.if protected interests are implicated,we then must decide what procedures constitute due process of law.robb,at.
as recognized above,dee argues that he was deprived of a constitutionally protected property interest and a constitutionally protected liberty interest without due process as a result of the borough actions.we will address each of dee asserted interests in turn.
property interest 
dee defines his asserted property interest as the interest in not being suspended without just cause.appellant br.to determine whether such an interest exists,we will first look to state law.see board of regents roth,d property interests are not created by the constitution.rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.see also kelly borough of sayreville,cir state law creates the property rights protected by the fourteenth amendment.brown trench,cir state law determines whether a property interest exists.
a review of the civil service provisions of the pennsylvania borough code reveals that,indeed,a borough fireman such as dee may only be suspended for cause.stat.specifically states that n o person employed in any fire force of any borough shall be suspended,removed or reduced in rank except for one of six enumerated reasons as there is no dispute that dee is and was at all times relevant to his complaint a person employed in a fire force of a borough,there can be no dispute that.stat.creates for him a property interest triggering the protections of the fourteenth amendment.as the supreme court recognized in logan zimmerman brush,d,t he hallmark of property is an individual entitlement grounded in state law,which can not be removed except for cause.that is precisely what we have here.
the fact that we are dealing with a suspension and not a termination is of no moment at this point in our analysis it is the pennsylvania statute that defines the property interest,and the statute explicitly states that it applies to those suspended,removed or reduced in rank.stat.given the unambiguous language of.stat,which was before the district court during the summary judgment proceedings see app,this is not a close call dee has clearly demonstrated an entitlement to fourteenth amendment protection.
even without.stat,however,dee had a constitutionally protected property interest based on the terms of the cba.today it is beyond dispute that a contract with a state entity can give rise to a property right protected by the fourteenth amendment.unger residents matching program,cir see also stana sch.dist.of city of pittsburgh,cir acknowledging that,while p roperty interests are often expressly created by state statutes or regulations,they can also arise from mutually explicit understandings between a government employer and employee quoting perry sindermann,d.and even though the supreme court has never held that every state contract gives rise to a property interest protected under the fourteenth amendment,unger,at emphasis added,we have recognized that employment contracts that contain a just cause provision create a property interest in continued employment.wilson mvm,cir internal citation omitted see also unger,at recognizing that a property interest protected under the fourteenth amendment arises where the contract itself includes a provision that the state entity can terminate the contract only for cause.
here,the cba that governed dee employment with the borough contained such a provision.article xiv,section b of the cba,explicitly states it is agreed that the borough council has the right to discipline discharge employees for just cause.app.the borough does not dispute that dee was an employee under terms of the cba,nor does it argue on appeal that dee suspension did not qualify as a form of discipline discharge.thus,again,we reach our conclusion with relative ease.dee employment contract with the borough created a constitutionally protected property interest in not being suspended without just cause.he was therefore entitled to due process before this interest was abridged 
as we did above,we reject any argument that dee lacks a property interest because suspension appears to be a less drastic form of discipline than termination.we find no legal basis for such an argument,and the borough provides us with none.in the state employment context,an employee property interests are created and defined by the terms of his appointment,roth,at,and,in this case,the terms of the cba secure for dee an interest in not being discipline d discharge d without just cause app.as the borough has affirmatively chosen to grant dee this entitlement,it is not for this court to say that it is unworthy of constitutional protection 
in light of the above analysis,we hold that.stat.and article xiv,section b of the cba,together and standing alone,created for dee a constitutionally protected property interest in not being suspended without just cause.we will reverse the district court holding to the contrary.
having determined that dee did in fact have a property interest protected by the fourteenth amendment,we must next determine the level of process he was constitutionally due.see cleveland bd.of ed.loudermill,d o nce it is determined that the due process clause applies,the question remains what process is due.quoting morrissey brewer,d see also robb,at if protected interests are implicated,we then must decide what procedures constitute due process of law.
in mathews eldridge,d,the supreme court held that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires the consideration of three distinct factors.those factors are 
first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.
in this case,it is undisputed that the borough provided dee with neither notice nor a hearing prior to being suspended.certainly,when an individual is not provided with any form of process,as in this case,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of his constitutionally protected,the second factor of the mathews heightened considerably.as the supreme court has made clear,w hen protected interests are implicated,the right to some kind of prior hearing is paramount.roth,at.see also id.at.while m any controversies have raged about the due process clause,it is fundamental that except in emergency situations due process requires that when a state seeks to terminate a protected interest,it must afford notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case before the termination becomes effective.internal quotation marks omitted third ellipsis added loudermill,at.an essential principle of due process is that a deprivation of life,liberty,or property be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.quoting mullane central hanover bank trust.id.we have described the root requirement of the due process clause as being that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant property interest.quoting boddie connecticut,d emphasis in original id.at.the opportunity to present reasons,either in person or in writing,why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement.only in extraordinary situations where some valid government interest is at stake is it permissible to postpone the hearing until after the deprivation has already occurred.roth,at.quoting boddie,at.see also loudermill,at.gilbert homar,d.
here,the borough argues that this was one of those extraordinary situations.according to the borough,dee was not provided with a hearing because dunmore feared the potential harm of having a firefighter working for the borough without proper certification.appellees br.at.the borough contends that its interest in protecting the safety of its citizens far outweighs dee interest in avoiding suspension with pay and no loss in benefits or seniority.
dee responds that the borough failed to provide him with a hearing,not because it feared for the public safety,but because the council feared for its own public image.in support of this contention,dee cites the deposition testimony of defendant joseph talutto,one of the borough council members,who indicated that the council acted with such immediacy,at least in part,because the members d id want to get blasted in the press.appellant br.citing app.dee also challenges the credibility of any suggestion that he could have possibly been considered a threat to public safety,pointing out that,as of the time of his suspension,he had served honorably with
