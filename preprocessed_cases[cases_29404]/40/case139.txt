the united states appeals from judgments awarding damages to the families and estates of two women,deborah hussey and debra davis,killed by james bulger and stephen flemmi in the.litif united states,d.it also appeals from an award of in attorney fees in the davis case as sanctions against the united states.davis united states,d.the families and estates of the murder victims,seeking an increase in damages for the victims pain and suffering.
this appeal is one of a number of cases in this circuit in which families of victims murdered by members of a boston organized crime gang have brought suit under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,b,et the suits have aimed to impose liability on the united states for the actions of federal bureau of investigation fbi agents for protecting gang members who were also fbi informants.unlike a number of such suits,the timeliness of the hussey and davis claims is not disputed.
the claims stem from the murders in and or,respectively of debra davis davis,flemmi girlfriend,and deborah hussey hussey,the daughter of marion hussey with whom flemmi had a relationship and lived for some years.both davis and hussey,then in their mid,were murdered in the same fashion on separate occasions bulger and flemmi lured each one into a house and then strangled her.the district judge found that the motive for the murders was primarily domestic rather than to kill business associates of,or potential witnesses against,flemmi and bulger.litif,d at.
the bodies of the women were not discovered until,and flemmi pled guilty to their murders in.litif,d at.the davis and hussey families filed complaints in the district court against the united states under the ftca in and the gist of the claims,drawing upon massachusetts tort law,was that the fbi had caused the women deaths through their flagrant negligence in utilizing flemmi and bulger as informants,continuing to do so even after becoming aware of the pair dangerousness,shielding them from prosecution,and failing to control them.
the cases were consolidated and they were tried by the district judge in a bench trial.at the conclusion,the district court found the government liable for negligence.it awarded the davis estate million for her mother loss of consortium,the davis and hussey estates each for pain and suffering resulting from their murders,and much smaller amounts for funeral expenses.litif,d at.later,the court added sanctions against the government as described more fully below.davis,d at.

b.thus,the legal questions in this case centering on principles of causation and damages are primarily those of massachusetts law.
on appeal,the government challenges both the district court reading of massachusetts case law on proximate cause as well as its factual findings underlying causation and the award of damages to davis deceased mother.it also contests the sanctions against it.the davis and hussey families have,seeking an increase in the respective awards of damages for conscious pain and suffering.

the district court found that the fbi handling of flemmi and bulger was negligent,litif,d at but,as the facts demonstrate and the district judge closing denunciation confirmed,id.at,it was negligence of a wildly reckless flavor.see also note,above.no detailed recitation is required here because the government makes no attempt to challenge the findings of wrongdoing by fbi handlers its attack is on findings of but for and proximate causation.
the government first disputes but for causation,saying that proof is lacking that fbi negligence more likely than not led to the deaths of the two women.the district judge,by contrast,found that the fbi handlers kept flemmi and bulger in play and on the street,and deliberately interfered with attempts by prosecutors or other law enforcement entities and agents to arrest and prosecute flemmi and bulger.litif,d at.the chronology set forth above bears out these premises.
yet the question remains whether any specific sequence of events or a cumulation of them makes it more likely than not,enrich windmere,that the fbi actions were causal steps leading to the women deaths.after hearing flemmi testimony at the bench trial,the district court explicitly accepted the finding made by another district judge in a sentencing hearing for flemmi 
it is clear to me that flemmi would have either been killed or in prison if paul rico had not tipped him off and encouraged him to flee just before flemmi was indicted for the bombing of john fitzgerald and the murder of walter bennett i f flemmi had been prosecuted in for the fitzgerald bombing or the william bennett murder,his role as an fbi informant might have been disclosed and examined more than years ago.but rico prevented that from happening.
litif,d at quoting united states flemmi,d,internal footnotes omitted.
flemmi francis salemme was convicted of the bombing in and sentenced to a substantial term.united states salemme,d.the district judge concluded in substance that,but for rico tip and flemmi flight,flemmi would likely have suffered the same fate and been in jail when the two women were later killed.although bulger as well as flemmi participated in the actual murders,it was flemmi who had the relationship with the women,had the clearer motive,and lured them into the houses where they were strangled.
the government says that salemme conviction does not show that flemmi too would have been convicted.it points to an important witness who testified that salemme had participated in the attempted murder and that his the witness previous statements that flemmi was involved were false.salemme,d at.flemmi,it notes,agreed during his testimony with the statement that salemme had a much more substantial role in the planning and execution of the attempted murder than did flemmi.overall,the government suggests that flemmi,even if convicted,might have received a shorter sentence.
yet the government indicted flemmi and had evidence against him even if part of it later proved to be unreliable flemmi also admitted in his testimony at this trial that he assisted in placing the bomb in the murder attempt and the government continued to assert his involvement when it prosecuted him in the.salemme,d at.reconstructing now just what evidence the government might have presented many years ago is difficult,but the district court finding is not clear error.
the determination is reinforced by evidence of the other episodes described in the chronology above in which the fbi frustrated the capture and prosecution of flemmi and bulger.even if each of the others is attended by more doubts as to consequences than rico original warning to flee,each adds something to the overall percentage chance that but for the fbi misconduct these murders would not have occurred.that no one can assign exact probabilities is beside the point,and does not prevent an ultimate more likely than not finding.
the government also contests whether,even if the fbi actions were a cause of davis and hussey murders,the government can be held liable for the murder of victims whom the fbi could not,in the district court words,have particularly foreseen.litif,d at.here,the primary question is whether the district court correctly discerned,and then properly applied,the proximate cause concept under massachusetts law the first is reviewed de novo on the second,the district court judgment is reviewed with more deference.wojciechowicz,at.
that the fbi agents could not have foreseen that davis and hussey were going to be victims is true in one narrow sense there is no evidence that the agents focused on these two women or had special reason to believe that flemmi or bulger would act violently toward them.what the agents knew,as the prior chronology demonstrates,is that the agents were protecting extraordinarily violent men who had already seemingly murdered others.to this extent,it was foreseeable that bulger and flemmi might well kill anyone who threatened or seriously inconvenienced them.davis and hussey were not random victims they had close and prolonged associations with flemmi.the district judge thus found 
given massachusetts definition of foreseeability,it is easy to conclude that davis and hussey deaths were the type of potential risks violent crimes by bulger and flemmi that made the fbi conduct negligent in the first instance.
litif,d at.
the massachusetts case most closely in point is jupin kask.there,a homeowner had provided unsupervised access to a gun collection to a young adult whom she knew had a history of violence,had recent problems with the law,and had been under psychiatric observation and therefore might use one of the guns in the commission of a violent crime.id.at.the young man fatally wounded a police officer with one of the guns,and the state supreme judicial court sjc reversed a grant of summary judgment for the homeowner and remanded for trial.id.at.
jupin is also on point on a closely related issue,for it declares 
it is irrelevant whether the defendant foresaw or should have foreseen the specific danger that occurred it is sufficient that the same general kind of harm was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant conduct.
at quoting andrew mcclurg,armed and dangerous tort liability for the negligent storage of firearms.accord carey new yorker of worcester,the specific kind of harm need not be foreseeable as long as it was foreseeable that there would be violence toward others.
massachusetts case law is equivocal where mere carelessness creates a hazard to an unlimited class of potential plaintiffs.in kent commonwealth,a police officer,shot by a released parolee serving a life sentence in prison for second degree murder,sued massachusetts,arguing that the parole board had been negligent in releasing the prisoner.although the sjc said that the parole board action was not the proximate cause,it stressed that before the shooting,custody of the parolee had been transferred by the state to the immigration and naturalization service to effectuate his deportation.id.at.
leavitt brockton hospital,is a similar example of a hedged denial of liability where the harm was more immediately due to the negligence of a third party.there,a police officer was injured while responding to an emergency call where a patient was struck by a car when walking home from the hospital the officer argued that the hospital had negligently released the patient without an escort.id.at.the sjc pointed to the negligent driver as an intervening cause,adding that liability might have existed had the patient directly injured a third party for example,by driving a car home from the hospital that struck a pedestrian.id.at.
the latter caveat could easily capture our own case,so leavitt is far from helpful to the government.nor is the government helped by incautiously quoting leavitt statement that there is no duty to control another person conduct to prevent that person from causing harm to a third party,at affirmatively empowering known killers to remain at large is unlikely to be what the sjc had in mind in the quoted statement.
although foreseeability is a prime element in proximate cause,palsgraf long island railroad,the concept is freighted with policy concerns about liability for remote effects,which courts may cut off under a variety of labels lack of duty,unforseeability,intervening cause,scope of the risk,mccloskey mueller,cir.the concerns are especially acute where official or institutional actors are engaged in inherently dangerous activities,such as law enforcement or custodial care.
but here,as in jupin,this is not a case.the fbi agents affirmatively intervened to protect bulger and flemmi both by tips to the men and by blocking law enforcement measures that would likely have brought them to justice before the murders of the two women.see mccloskey,at a defendant duty is more limited when negligence consists of an omission rather than an act of commission.given the agents knowledge of their charges murderous inclinations,the threat to others was in broad terms foreseeable and the fbi agents actions were not merely negligent but reckless in the extreme.
