this case presents the familiar conflict between the legal principle of and the political principle of.new directions treatment services,a reputable and longstanding provider of methadone treatment,sought to locate a new facility in the city of reading.a pennsylvania statute that facially singles out methadone clinics gave the city of reading the opportunity to vote to deny the permit.the city of reading availed itself of that opportunity.
new directions and individual methadone patients brought suit on constitutional and federal statutory grounds,raising both facial and as applied challenges to the statute.the city of reading successfully moved for summary judgment against all of plaintiffs claims.new directions and the individual plaintiffs appeal is before us.
summary of facts and procedural history 
new directions treatment services ndts operates several methadone clinics throughout pennsylvania,including one in west reading ndts provides methadone maintenance for adults who have been addicted to heroin for at least a year.ndts executive director,glen cooper,contacted the city of reading the city to discuss opening an additional treatment center,as their west reading facility had developed a waiting list for treatment.ndts met with city officials on january,to discuss potential sites within the city.ndts met with the city council two months later to continue the discussion.although ndts had not yet obtained an operating permit from the city,ndts signed a lease on a property located at lancaster avenue.ndts then submitted a zoning permit application.
the lancaster avenue property is located on a commercial highway that is interspersed with private residences.the berks counseling center previously occupied the site,providing treatment to patients with mental health problems and drug addictions.it did not provide methadone treatment ndts intended to serve a couple hundred or so methadone patients at the new facility.ndts proposed a square foot addition to the property to accommodate this increased usage.ndts planned to operate the new facility from to on weekdays,as well as more limited hours on weekends.
in,pennsylvania adopted.ann,a zoning statute regulating locations of methadone treatment facilities the statute provides that a methadone treatment facility shall not be established or operated within feet of an existing school,public playground,public park,residential housing area,facility,church,meetinghouse or other actual place of regularly stated religious worship established prior to the proposed methadone treatment facility,unless,by majority vote,the governing body for the municipality in which the proposed methadone treatment facility is to be located votes in favor of the issuance of an occupancy permit.id.at a and b.the lancaster avenue property falls within the ambit of the statute.when ndts inquired about sites not covered by the statute,a city zoning official referred them to three sites,including a cemetery and a heavy industrial area,all of which ndts considered unsuitable.
the city notified ndts that it would hold a hearing on january.glen cooper,the executive director of ndts,appeared at the hearing and described ndts history and its proposed treatment center.he also answered questions from the city council.ndts acknowledged that it had experienced some loitering and littering at its west reading facility.at a second hearing on february,the council heard additional public comments.at a march,council meeting,the city heard more comments and then unanimously voted against ndts application.
ndts filed complaints with the pennsylvania human relations commission phrc and the department of housing and urban development office of fair housing and equal opportunity hud.the phrc dismissed ndts complaint in a letter stating that,the facts of the case did not establish that probable cause exist ed to credit the allegations of unlawful discrimination.ndts and several individual plaintiffs proceeding in pseudonym filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on march.
the complaint states four counts.first,ndts alleged violations of the fourteenth amendment guarantees of due process and equal protection,stating that the pennsylvania statute was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the proposed reading facility.second,ndts alleged that the statute,both facially and as applied,violates of the rehabilitation act.third,ndts alleged that the statute,both facially and as applied,violates title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada.fourth,ndts alleged that the statute,both facially and as applied,contravenes the federal scheme for regulation of methadone treatment and is therefore preempted.ndts sought declaratory and injunctive relief for harm resulting from the city purportedly discriminatory action.individual plaintiff methadone users also sought damages.
the city moved on september,to dismiss individual city officials on the grounds of common law immunity and qualified immunity.see.c.the district court granted the motion on october.ndts does not appeal this decision.
the city moved for partial summary judgment with respect to the fourth count of the complaint,in which ndts argued on supremacy clause grounds that the statute was preempted by federal law.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the fourth count on october.ndts does not appeal this decision.
ndts and the individual plaintiffs filed the complaint as a class action and moved to certify the class on september,as all persons residing in the city of reading and its surrounding community who have been,are currently,or will be at risk of being on the waiting list to receive methadone treatment and,all residents of the city of reading and its surrounding community who have needed,now need or in the future may need methadone treatment.see.b.the district court denied the motion without prejudice,reasoning that the court lacked adequate information to determine if the individual plaintiffs could adequately represent the class.
the city moved for summary judgment.ndts filed a for partial summary judgment on their claims against the validity of the statute.the district court granted the city motion in its entirety and denied ndts on august.ndts timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction over an appeal from the district court final order under.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.union pac.greentree transp.trucking,cir.this court has conclusively settled that the proprietors of a proposed methadone treatment facility have standing to seek relief both on their own behalf and on behalf of their clients under both the ada and rehabilitation act.see addiction specialists,twp.of hampton,cir.
ndts raises a myriad of issues on appeal.they argue that.ann.facially violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,the ada,and the rehabilitation act,that the individual plaintiffs have standing to make out ada and rehabilitation act challenges,that the city violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,the ada,and the rehabilitation act by denying ndts a permit,and that the district court abused its discretion by denying the motion for class certification.
whether.ann.facially violates the ada and the rehabilitation act 
ndts and the individual plaintiffs argue that.ann.facially violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,the ada,and the rehabilitation act.the district court did not engage in a detailed analysis of the statute validity under either title ii of the ada or the rehabilitation act.rather,the court focused on the equal protection inquiry however,these inquiries are analytically distinct and must be approached accordingly 
the principal difference between the equal protection and the ada inquiry is that,in an as applied or facial equal protection challenge,the plaintiff bears the burden of negating all conceivable rational justifications for the allegedly discriminatory action or statute,board of trustees of the of alabama garrett,d,whereas to make out a claim under the ada,the plaintiff need only show that intentional discrimination was the but for cause of the allegedly discriminatory action.newman ghs osteopathic,cir a facially discriminatory statute based on a class such as.ann.will survive an equal protection challenge unless it is based on a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group or a classification whose relationship to an asserted goal is so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.city of cleburne cleburne living center,d.a statute that facially discriminates against disabled individuals,however,faces a far different and more skeptical inquiry under the ada and rehabilitation act.
section of title ii of the ada provides that s ubject to the provisions of this subchapter,no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.this statement constitutes a general prohibition against discrimination by public entities,regardless of activity bay area addiction research and treatment,city of antioch,cir striking down a ban on methadone clinics within feet of a residential area.section of the rehabilitation act similarly provides that n o otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall,solely by reason of her or his disability,be excluded from the participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.a.we have noted that a s the ada simply expands the rehabilitation act prohibitions against discrimination into the private sector,congress has directed that the two acts judicial and agency standards be harmonized and we will accordingly analyze the two provisions together.newman,at see also innovative health,city of white plains,cir.
the sixth and ninth circuits have considered the issue of whether a municipal ordinance prohibiting methadone clinics within feet of a residential area violated the general proscription contained in the ada and rehabilitation act.see mx group,city of covington,cir bay area,at.both courts concluded that the ordinances were facially discriminatory laws and therefore present ed per se violations of.bay area,at see mx group,at 
the ninth circuit confronted many of the issues presented in this case when the bay area addiction research and treatment,baart and california detoxification programs,cdp tried to relocate their methadone clinic to the city of antioch,california.bay area,at.baart had been operating a methadone clinic near the courthouse in pittsburg,california for years.baart and cdp received notice from antioch that the proposed location could be used for a methadone clinic under antioch zoning plan.however,the antioch city council enacted an urgency ordinance banning methadone clinics within feet of residential areas,thereby barring use of the proposed site.baart and other plaintiffs alleged that antioch had violated both title ii of the ada and of the rehabilitation act.the district court denied bay area motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining the ordinance.baart appealed.see id.
after disposing of issues not contested in the instant case,the ninth circuit analyzed whether the district court had abused its discretion by denying the preliminary injunction in part because baart did not have a likelihood of success on the merits.id.at.the ninth circuit held that the district court had abused its discretion by applying an erroneous legal standard and remanded the case.id.the ninth circuit first held that the district court erred by applying the reasonable modification test to a facially discriminatory law.see id.at.department of justice regulations require that plaintiffs request reasonable modifications to avoid discrimination unless the modification would fundamentally alter the program,activity,ordinance,or statute.b.however,where the statute discriminates against qualified individuals on its face rather than in its application,the applicable regulation interpreting title ii,which only requires reasonable accommodation,makes little sense.bay area,at.the only way to alter a facially discriminatory ordinance is to remove the discriminating language.the antioch ordinance could only have been rendered facially neutral by expanding the class of entities that may not operate within feet of a residential neighborhood to include all clinics at which medical services are provided,or by striking the reference to methadone clinics entirely,and,e ither modification would fundamentally alter the zoning ordinance,the former by expanding the covered establishments dramatically,and the latter by rendering the ordinance a nullity.id.therefore,the reasonable modifications test could not apply to a facially discriminatory ordinance.see id.at holding that facially discriminatory laws present per se violations of.
the ninth circuit noted that this determination does not end the inquiry,however,as both statutes withhold protection from any individual who poses a significant risk to the health or safety of others that can not be ameliorated by means of a reasonable modification.id.the supreme court developed the significant risk test in school board of nassau county arline,a case involving a teacher who alleged a violation of of the rehabilitation act after she was discharged because she had an active case of tuberculosis,d.the supreme court held that a person who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to others in the workplace will not be otherwise qualified for his or her job if reasonable accommodation will not eliminate that risk.id.at.the court essentially incorporated a significant risk test into the rehabilitation act definition of a disabled person qualified to receive protection.the court noted that this test effectuates goal of protecting handicapped individuals from deprivations based on prejudice,stereotypes,or unfounded fear,while giving appropriate weight to such legitimate concerns as avoiding exposing others to significant health and safety risks.id.at.
although the ninth circuit disclaimed any conclusion about the outcome of this inquiry or the ultimate merits of the claim,it repeatedly emphasized that arline was designed to ensure that decisions are not made on the basis of the prejudiced attitudes or the ignorance of others,and that t his is particularly important because,as with individuals with contagious diseases,f ew aspects of a handicap give rise to the same level of public fear and misapprehension,as the challenges facing recovering drug addicts.bay area,at internal citations omitted citing arline,at.the ninth circuit held that,in order for a methadone clinic to fail the significant risk test,it must present severe and likely harms to the community that are directly associated with the operation of the methadone clinic.id.at.such alleged harms must be supported by evidence and may include a reasonable likelihood of a significant increase in crime.id.the ninth circuit noted that courts should be mindful of the ada and rehabilitation act goals of eliminating discrimination against individuals with disabilities and protecting those individuals from deprivations based on prejudice,stereotypes,or unfounded fear.id.at citing arline,at.therefore,it is not enough that individuals pose a hypothetical or presumed risk the evidence must reflect a risk that is significant and harm that is serious.id.
three years later,the sixth circuit invoked bay area and reached a similar result in mx group city of covington,cir.mx group is a operator of methadone clinics.id.at.in,they began the process of locating a suitable site for a methadone clinic in covington,kentucky.mx group selected a location and covington zoning administrator issued them a permit.public outcry spurred the covington board of adjustment to overrule the issuance of the permit.mx group located another suitable site,prompting the city solicitor to inform the zoning administrator that methadone clinics were not a permitted use anywhere in the city.shortly thereafter,covington adopted an amendment to the zoning code expanding the definition of addiction treatment facility in the zoning code to include any place whose primary function is to care for the chemically dependent.this term had applied only to programs that provided overnight or housing accommodations.the ordinance limited the number of all such facilities to one facility for every persons in the city.this amendment prevented mx group from locating a facility in the city.id.at.however,the zoning administrator testified at trial that it was his impression from the city solicitor that amendments permitting individual clinics would be considered on a basis.id.at.mx group brought suit pursuant to the ada and rehabilitation act.the district court held that covington denial of the permit and the subsequently enacted amendment violated both federal statutes.id.at.
covington alleged that the district court had committed various errors of law,of which only one is relevant the district court correctly concluded that mx group was not required to request a reasonable modification.id.at.the sixth circuit cited bay area approvingly and rejected the reasonable accommodation argument because it is inapplicable inasmuch as the ordinance at issue is facially discriminatory.id.the sixth circuit noted that the district court found that the blanket prohibition of all methadone clinics from the entire city is discriminatory on its face,agreed with that conclusion,and also agreed with the ninth circuit that it would make little sense under these circumstances to require plaintiff to seek an accommodation,when the only accommodation,a fundamental change to the ordinance,could not be considered reasonable.id.at.
although bay area and mx group dealt with outright bans,we believe that the reasoning of those cases is equally applicable here.the pennsylvania statute imposes a ban on the establishment of methadone clinics within feet of many structures,including schools,churches,and residential housing developments.see.ann.a.the pennsylvania law differs from those in bay area and mx group in that the the governing body for the municipality in which the proposed methadone treatment facility is to be located can waive the ban if,and only if,it approves the issuance of a permit by majority vote.ann.b.however,this ability of municipalities to waive the statutory ban in no way alters the fact that.ann.facially singles out methadone clinics,and thereby methadone patients,for different treatment,thereby rendering the statute facially discriminatory.
we agree with the sixth and ninth circuits that a law that singles out methadone clinics for different zoning procedures is facially discriminatory under the ada and the rehabilitation act.we also agree that it is inappropriate to apply the reasonable modification test to facially discriminatory laws.see mx group,at bay area,at.the only way to modify a facially discriminatory statute is to remove the discriminatory language.however,amending.ann.to remove the facial discrimination against methadone clinics would fundamentally alter the statute.bay area,at.
having concluded that.ann.is facially discriminatory and that the reasonable modification test does not apply,we proceed to inquire whether ndts clients pose a significant risk.this inquiry is also referred to as the direct threat defense in cases arising under title i of the ada.bragdon abbott,d stevens,concurring.the court analysis of the rehabilitation act in arline remains the guiding precedent.see arline,at.the court concluded that contagious diseases such as tuberculosis fit within the rehabilitation act definition of handicapped,and then addressed the question of whether the plaintiff was otherwise qualified for her job as an elementary school teacher.id.at.the court held that a person who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to others in the workplace will not be otherwise qualified for his or her job if reasonable accommodation will not eliminate that risk.id.at.the court adopted the language proposed by amicus curiae the american medical association,stating the significant risk inquiry should include consideration of four factors the nature of the risk,the duration of the risk,the severity of the risk,and the probability that the potential harm will occur.donahue consol.rail,cir citing arline,at.
the arline court limited its decision to cases where a significant risk is alleged on the basis of an infectious disease.see at.the ada and subsequent cases expanded the significant risk test to cases where a disability created a significant risk to the health or safety of others,such as attention deficit hyperactive disorder,see robertson neuromedical,cir,depression,see eeoc amego,cir,diabetes,see turco hoechst celanese,cir,violent employees,see palmer cir.of cook county,cir,or epileptics whose jobs involve operating potentially dangerous machinery.see donahue,at.
the supreme court emphasized in bragdon abbott that the significant risk test requires a rigorous objective inquiry,d.in bragdon,a dentist refused to fill a cavity for an asymptomatic aids patient.see id.the court held that 
the existence,or nonexistence,of a significant risk must be determined from the standpoint of the person who refuses the treatment or accommodation,and the risk of assessment must be based on medical or other objective evidence as a health care professional,petitioner had the duty to assess the risk of infection based on the objective,scientific information available to him and others in his profession.his belief that a significant risk existed,even if maintained in good faith,would not relieve him of liability.
id.at.accordingly,we can not base our decision on the subjective judgments of the people purportedly at risk,the reading residents,city council,or even pennsylvania citizens,but must look to objective evidence in the record of any dangers posed by methadone clinics and patients.the purported risk must be substantial,not speculative or remote.see id.at.because few,if any,activities in life are risk free,arline and the ada do not ask whether a risk exists,but whether it is significant.the plaintiffs are not required to show that they pose no risk at all see id.
the record contains ample evidence that ndts clients,and methadone patients as a class,do not pose a significant risk.neither the city nor its amicus,the commonwealth,have offered any evidence to the contrary.the city refers to the deposition of glen cooper,the executive director of ndts,in which he estimated that to percent of the clinic patients would test positive for illegal drugs.however,ndts also submitted the results of drug screens at its west reading and bethlehem clinics showing that only patients enrolled for less than six months test positive at the percent rate,whereas less than six percent of patients enrolled for more than six months test positive for illegal drugs.
more importantly,the record demonstrates no link between methadone clinics and increased crime.cooper testified that there had been no criminal incidents at ndts west reading facility.the commonwealth offered no evidence to support its contrary assertion that there is a frequent association between methadone clinics and criminal activity.in depositions,city council members expressed concerns about heavy traffic,loitering,noise pollution,littering,double parking,and jaywalking.however,the city offered no evidence to support an association between these concerns and methadone clinics.even if such connections existed,we are skeptical that they would qualify as the substantial harms contemplated by the arline and bragdon courts.
the brief legislative history of.ann.provides no further evidence that methadone patients pose a significant risk.representative platts,the bill principal sponsor,stated that the legislation would protect children from the high crime rates associated with heroin addicts,that,o n average heroin addicts before treatment commit a crime on average days of the year,and that e ven after months of methadone treatment,they still average once a month committing a crime.representative platts offered no source for this statistic.we find it difficult to place much weight on this unsupported statistic given cooper unrebutted testimony that other ndts facilities had experienced no criminal incidents and the extremely positive reports of the national institute on drug abuse and the office of national drug control policy.in addition,the statement of representative serafini betrays the generalized prejudice and fear warned against by the arline court 
it is unfortunate that we have to have methadone treatment facilities at all,but to locate them in areas that are residential or close to where young people might congregate or the community might meet and gather is a definite mistake,and these facilities,in my opinion,do not benefit anyone but the heroin addict,and they should be located either in a community that welcomes this kind of facility or out in an area away from people who have kept themselves clean and free of drugs and should not be confronted by this kind of a pollution in their community.
on one hand,we have before us uncontroverted testimony that ndts methadone treatment facilities have not experienced any criminal incidents or other potentially dangerous behavior.we have the objective viewpoints of the national institute on drug abuse and the office of national drug control policy,brought to our attention by amicus curiae,the pennsylvania community providers association.on the other hand,neither the city nor amicus,the commonwealth of pennsylvania,offered any evidence in the proceedings below or in the statute legislative history demonstrating that methadone patients pose a significant risk.the arline court specifically recognized that the rehabilitation act was meant to protect disabled individuals from deprivations based on prejudice,stereotypes,or unfounded fear.at.see also innovative health,at.the speculative,hypothetical,and unsupported statements in.ann.legislative history and in the record of the reading city council meeting do not suffice to create a triable issue of fact as to whether ndts clients,or methadone patients generally,pose a significant risk.
we have no doubt that some methadone patients are inclined to criminal or otherwise dangerous behavior.however,in the words of the arline court 
the fact that some persons who have contagious diseases may pose a serious health threat to others under certain circumstances does not justify excluding from the coverage of the act all persons with actual or perceived contagious diseases.such exclusion would mean that those accused of being contagious would never have the opportunity to have their condition evaluated in light of medical evidence and a determination made as to whether they were otherwise qualified.rather,they would be vulnerable to discrimination on the basis of the type of injury congress sought to prevent.
we will reverse the order of the district court and remand with instructions that it grant ndts motion for partial summary judgment because.ann.facially violates the ada and the rehabilitation act.we need not reach the question of whether.ann.facially violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,as the statute fails the less stringent tests required by the ada and the rehabilitation act 
whether the individual plaintiffs have standing to make out ada and rehabilitation act challenges 
the pennsylvania statute is facially invalid under the ada and the rehabilitation act.because of that,the individual plaintiffs standing has no impact on the issue of injunctive relief.however,the individual plaintiffs also assert claims to damages under the ada and the rehabilitation act.the district court must reach the issue of the individual plaintiffs standing in order to resolve their claims for damages 
the parties do not dispute that recovering heroin addicts are presumptively qualified persons under the ada and rehabilitation act.see a.however,both the ada and the rehabilitation act contain stating that individuals are not deemed qualified if they are currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs when the covered entity the city acts on the basis of the plaintiff drug addiction.see a c i.plaintiffs are not considered qualified under the statutes if they have used illegal drugs recently enough so that continuing use is a real ongoing problem.brown lucky stores,cir.this statutory exception is an odd fit for the instant case.it was intended to ensure that employers could discharge employees who were actually under the influence while at work and that employers could not discharge employees who were recovering addicts but were,at the time of any personnel action,drug free.see id.quoting,at,code cong.this provision makes its first appearance at a,where it applies to subchapter i of the ada,concerning employment.however,this provision reappears verbatim in subchapter iv miscellaneous provisions,which makes it applicable to the entire ada.this perplexing draftsmanship,which appears to make surplusage of the provision in the employment section,mandates that we apply this provision to subchapter ii,a even though it is unclear how the provision should apply outside the employment context.
first,ndts contends that the appropriate time frame for this inquiry is,when it filed the complaint in the district court,similar to a traditional standing analysis.the city responds that the statutory text specifies that the relevant time frame is when the covered entity took its allegedly discriminatory action.we agree with the city inasmuch as both the ada and rehabilitation act both state that an individual does not enjoy these statutory protections if currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs,when the covered entity acts on the basis of such use.a see c i same.
less clear is the question of whether the city acted on the basis of the individual plaintiffs addictions.see a c i.the city asserts that it acted on the basis of reasons,such as traffic and loitering.ndts contends that the city acted on the basis of general fear and prejudice associated with recovering heroin addicts.ndts wants to have its cake and eat it too.it claims that the city allegedly discriminatory motive does not constitute action on the basis of a drug addiction,but action against recovering addicts.however,much of the evidence in the record to which ndts refers illustrates the city concern about the possibility of ndts clients relapsing into drug use.
the ada and rehabilitation act specifically provide that a person who has completed a supervised rehabilitation program or is currently participating in such a program and is no longer engaging in drug use shall be deemed a qualified individual.a and b c i and c ii i.the ninth circuit has observed that m ere participation in a rehabilitation program is not enough,and that covered entities are entitled to seek reasonable assurances that no illegal use of drugs is occurring.brown,at.these statutory qualifications weigh against the logic of deeming the city to have acted solely on the basis of the plaintiffs status as recovering if we accept ndts version of the city motivation.
the second circuit has recognized that the question of whether drug use is effectively ongoing or a serious problem is a fact bound inquiry best left to the district courts.teahan commuter,cir.this determination requires detailed knowledge of methadone treatment protocols to assess whether a currently enrolled methadone patient who relapsed,for example,three months ago,is likely to relapse again.the parties do not dispute that one plaintiff,coe,has been drug free for some time.however,three other plaintiffs,joe,loe,and poe,had been drug free for only three months prior to the permit denial.id.we will remand with instructions that the district court closely consider whether the individual plaintiffs drug use posed a real ongoing problem.brown,at.
whether the city violated the fourteenth amendment guarantee of equal protection 
the district court should also consider ndts as applied challenge under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment if it finds that any of the individual plaintiffs lack standing under the ada and the rehabilitation act.ndts alleges the city improperly administered.ann.as applied to their permit application for the reading facility.the city replies that ndts failed to show that prejudice was a motivating factor and,in the alternative,that the city met its burden of demonstrating a legitimate,purpose.
the parties agree that classifications based on disabled individuals,such as recovering heroin addicts,are reviewed under the rational basis test which requires a rational means to serve a legitimate end.city of cleburne cleburne living,d holding that the decision to refuse a permit to a home for the mentally retarded failed the rational basis test.yet the city asserts that cleburne is distinguishable because unlike ndts,the appellants in cleburne had presented evidence that the decision to deny the special use permit for homes for the mentally retarded was based on mere negative attitudes and fear that was unsubstantiated by factors which are properly cognizable.ndts has adduced evidence of a similar character.the records of the city council hearings contain numerous statements by both public participants and council members expressing opposition based on what can only be characterized as generalized prejudice,stereotypes,and fear of ndts clientele 
we have suggested,albeit in a different context,that a factually similar claim would have a likelihood of success.see sullivan city of pittsburgh,cir.we considered in sullivan a request by recovering alcoholics for a preliminary injunction requiring issuance of a permit for the operation of a treatment center for alcoholics.id.the sullivan court observed that 
appellees showed that the city alleged concern about a drop in property values was irrational since arc the operator of the treatment centers had operated in the neighborhood for some years and adduced evidence indicating that property values would not be adversely affected by the center presence.appellees also established that the city alleged concern with orderly development was irrational since arc was already located in the north side section.additionally,appellees demonstrated that arc facilities met lot size and other zoning requirements and that the city alleged concerns about density were addressed by density ordinances with which arc had complied.and finally,here as in cleburne,appellees demonstrated that the city took its essentially unjustified action in an atmosphere charged with hostility towards a minority group.these proofs,and their lack of contradiction by the city,lead us to conclude that,in light of cleburne,class action are likely to prevail on the merits of their equal protection claim.
id.likening the recovering alcoholics claim to that made in cleburne.
the city claims that it met its burden of showing legitimate purposes motivating its decision.the district court observed that the city council expressed concerns about heavy traffic,loitering,noise pollution,littering,double parking,and jaywalking.yet we consider it inexplicable that the city failed to offer any evidence to support these concerns.indeed,the district court appears to have relied on depositions of the council members which are not supported by the records of the three city council meetings.records of these meetings contain no reference by the council members to jaywalking,loitering,littering,double parking,or increased traffic.the only reference appears in cooper response to council member figueroa general question about problem s with citizens of west reading,to which he responded that loitering and littering problems at its west reading facility were minimal.the concern raised by council member reed in her deposition about double parking does not account for ndts statement that the new facility would have parking spaces.
the able district judge also failed to adequately consider whether any of these asserted legitimate concerns differentiated the proposed ndts facility from permitted uses of the lancaster avenue site.see cleburne,at.holding that the city of cleburne could not treat the facility for the mentally retarded differently unless it would threaten legitimate interests of the city in a way that other permitted uses such as boarding houses and hospitals would not.on remand,the district court should consider whether asserted legitimate purposes apply equally to permitted uses when deciding whether the purported legitimate purposes are.id.the lancaster avenue site is zoned commercial highway and therefore includes among its permitted uses gas stations,beer distributors,convenience stores,emergency health care facilities,motels,nightclubs,and miniature golf courses.the prior occupant,the berks counseling center,treated recovering drug and alcohol addicts as well as mentally ill patients.the record contains no evidence of complaints from nearby residents.the district court should focus particularly on whether there is any rational reason to differentiate methadone treatment centers,such as those operated by ndts,from drug treatment centers,such as the berks counseling center.
a reasonable trier of fact could conclude,on the present record,that no reasonably conceivable state of facts could provide a rational basis for denying ndts requested permit.bd.of trustees of the of garrett,d.what is presented,then,is a triable issue of material fact.
whether the district court abused it discretion by denying the motion for class certification.
ndts argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying without prejudice their motion for class certification.the district court only stated reason was that ndts had failed to provid e defendant with the information necessary for defendant to determine whether the named class representatives can represent the class adequately.it is not clear what further information is required,as ndts responded to all the city requests for information on the named plaintiffs,including their identities 
the named plaintiffs bear the burden of showing class eligibility and failed to file affidavits specifically in support of their motion for class certification.however,the district court denial of class certification does not provide sufficient information for us to engage in meaningful appellate review.we have held that a dequate representation depends on two factors a the plaintiff attorney must be qualified,experienced,and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation,and b the plaintiff must not have interests antagonistic to those of the class.wetzel liberty mut.ins,cir.
the city does not dispute that plaintiffs counsel are able to handle the litigation,supporting the conclusion that the class would be adequately represented.see grasty amalgamated clothing textile workers union,cir noting that the assurance of vigorous prosecution by class counsel is a significant factor in the rule a analysis greenfield villager industries,cir experience teaches that it is counsel for the class representative,and not the named parties,who direct and manage these actions.
the record is sufficiently developed to support the conclusion that the named plaintiffs could adequately represent the class.rule a requirement that a class representative fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class mainly seeks to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the class they seek to represent.in re warfarin sodium antitrust,cir see fed.civ.a.a class representative need only possess a minimal degree of knowledge necessary to meet the adequacy standard.szczubelek cendant mortgage.conflicts of interest are rare in rule b class actions seeking only declaratory and injunctive relief see.b.further discovery is unlikely to reveal any actual or potential conflict.the parties do not dispute that all of the class representatives records were produced.
we are unable to perceive from the record or the briefs what additional information might be required to establish that there is no conflict of interest between the named individual plaintiffs and the other members of the putative class.however,the district court did not rule on the other rule a factors,numerosity,commonality,and typicality.accordingly,we will vacate the district court order denying the motion for class certification.
iii.conclusion 
neither the record nor the legislative history of.ann.contain any evidence that would preserve the statute against the guarantees provided by the ada and the rehabilitation act.we will reverse the judgment of the district court denying summary judgment for ndts with respect to the claim that.ann.facially violates these federal statutes and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the national institute on drug abuse part of the national institutes of health describes methadone treatment methadone treatment has been used for more than years to effectively and safely treat opioid addiction.properly prescribed methadone is not intoxicating or sedating,and its effects do not interfere with ordinary activities such as driving a car.the medication is taken orally and it suppresses narcotic withdrawal for to hours.patients are able to perceive pain and have emotional reactions.most important,methadone relieves the craving associated with heroin addiction craving is a major reason for relapse.among methadone patients,it has been found that normal street doses of heroin are ineffective at producing euphoria,thus making the use of heroin more easily effects last four to six times as long as those of heroin,so people in treatment need to take it only once a day.also,methadone is medically safe even when used continuously for years or more.combined with behavioral therapies or counseling and other supportive services,methadone enables patients to stop using heroin and other opiates and return to more stable and productive lives.gov research reports heroin heroin.html office of national drug control policy of the executive office of the president provides further information on methadone treatment background informationmethadone is a rigorously
