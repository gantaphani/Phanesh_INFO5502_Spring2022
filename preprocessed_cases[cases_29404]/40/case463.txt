a jury sitting in the district of massachusetts found that the city of quincy,massachusetts,violated title vii of the civil rights act,et,and.laws ch,by unlawfully retaliating against police officer john mcdonough for assisting a fellow officer in pursuing an employment discrimination claim.the jury awarded mcdonough in compensatory damages.the parties.the city challenges the verdict on several grounds,including that the action was barred by the claim preclusion doctrine and that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict.mcdonough challenges the district court refusal to instruct the jury on awarding punitive damages.we reject the city appeal but remand for further proceedings concerning punitive damages.
background 
we present the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict,reserving certain details for the discussion.see am.airlines,cir.mcdonough joined the quincy police department in,subsequently held various ranks and was promoted to lieutenant in.in he was assigned to command the drug unit,where he has remained since.
in,mcdonough wrote to the then mayor of quincy,james sheets,questioning certain decisions made by police department management.in response,sheets arranged a meeting with mcdonough to discuss his grievances.at the meeting,mcdonough presented sheets with a packet of materials highlighting his concerns.one page of the packet included a compilation of allegations that mcdonough had heard from other officers about sexual harassment by department employees against police officer nancy coletta.sheets took no action on the coletta matter.
in late,mcdonough learned from other officers that coletta was planning to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against the city.mcdonough did not know coletta but wanted to help her pursue her claim.he therefore provided susan perch,another officer who knew coletta,with a copy of the page of allegations that he previously had presented to sheets.this page of allegations was eventually given to coletta.
on april,the massachusetts commission against discrimination held a hearing on coletta claim against the city.captain william falco,then administrative assistant to chief of police thomas frane,attended the hearing at frane request.at the hearing,coletta presented the hearing officer with the page of allegations that mcdonough had passed to her and mentioned mcdonough name.
after the hearing,falco reported to frane about the hearing and indicated that the police department or city had some problems because of coletta suit.frane instructed falco to investigate the matter further.
on may,falco contacted mcdonough to discuss the page of allegations that coletta had presented at the hearing.mcdonough explained that he had given it to mayor sheets in and that,if falco wanted to obtain a copy,he could contact the mayor office.falco unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the page from the mayor office.
the members of the drug unit,including mcdonough,worked the night shift and as compensation received fifteen percent higher pay than employees.three days after falco talked to mcdonough about the coletta matter,frane reassigned mcdonough to the day shift.as a result,mcdonough lost the pay differential and was essentially stripped of his supervisory duties because the officers he supervised worked on the alternate shift.at the time that mcdonough was reassigned,another officer was placed in the drug unit and assumed most of mcdonough supervisory responsibilities.
shortly after the reassignment was announced,mcdonough,who was on medical leave at that time,called frane to inquire about the transfer.frane told him that he had ordered it because mcdonough had trouble communicating.when mcdonough objected to this characterization,frane told him in everyone life a little rain must fall.you can always retire.on another occasion,frane told mcdonough that he placed him on the day shift because several city councilors had indicated that they wanted to increase funding for the drug unit and that he wanted mcdonough available to answer questions from the councilors.at trial,frane testified that he had transferred mcdonough as part of a reorganization and because he wanted to better integrate mcdonough into the department management team.
mcdonough returned from his medical leave in august and assumed duties,where he had no one to supervise and nothing to do.he served in this role without significant incident until march,when he signed several court slips authorizing extra pay for officers required to attend court proceedings for officers of the drug unit.mcdonough learned the next day that the court slips that he had signed were denied because he no longer was authorized to sign such slips.
mcdonough immediately called acting chief of police terrence kelly chief frane was on a leave of absence after suffering a heart attack he never returned to his position to ask why the court slips were denied.kelly told him that captain robert crowley,mcdonough direct supervisor,had removed mcdonough signing authority.mcdonough proceeded to explain that the drug unit was investigating crowley for potential corruption and that kelly therefore had to overrule crowley order.kelly refused,and mcdonough very heatedly screamed at him that he would go to the newspapers and city hall if kelly did not act.mcdonough gave kelly a short deadline to change his position before kelly hung up the phone.after this conversation,kelly described to falco the heated exchange with mcdonough and told falco that he was afraid that mcdonough might suffer a heart attack but kelly took no immediate action.
immediately thereafter,mcdonough authored a letter to kevin madden,the director of personnel for the department,alerting him to the incident and other workplace grievances.mcdonough stated that he had given relevant documents to another officer to be used in the case of his sudden or suspicious death.
after madden received this letter,he met with kelly and falco to discuss the situation.it was agreed that mcdonough should be placed on paid administrative leave and that his service weapon should be taken pending a evaluation by a mental health provider.
after the meeting,kelly and falco summoned mcdonough to kelly office to inform him that he was being placed on administrative leave.they then took his firearm and told him that he had to leave the police headquarters immediately and could not return unless and until he passed a mental health evaluation.after mcdonough was placed on leave,no one from the department checked to make sure that mcdonough had no other weapons in his possession,contacted mcdonough family to alert them to the concerns about his mental health,or arranged to ensure that mcdonough made it home safely.
mcdonough subsequently met with a psychiatrist who concluded that mcdonough was fit to return to his post.mcdonough returned to his position in may and several weeks later was returned to the night shift by falco,who in the interim had been appointed chief.
in october,mcdonough filed this action claiming that the city had retaliated against him by,inter alia,transferring him to the day shift and placing him on administrative leave.after a trial,the court submitted the case to the jury but declined to allow the jury to consider awarding punitive damages.the jury returned a general verdict for mcdonough and awarded him in lost wages and emotional distress damages.the city moved for judgment as a matter of law on the ground that mcdonough had not presented sufficient evidence to ground the jury retaliation finding and,alternatively,moved to have the damage award remitted.the district court denied the motion and entered judgment.
ii.the city appeal 
claim preclusion 
the city asserts that mcdonough action should have been dismissed as it was barred under the claim preclusion doctrine as a result of an unsuccessful massachusetts state court action that mcdonough filed against the city in.in,mcdonough was passed over for promotion to police captain and subsequently sued the city in massachusetts superior court,claiming that he had been denied the promotion in retaliation for his complaint to sheets in.the case went to trial in,and a state court judge entered judgment for the city at the close of mcdonough.the city argues that the state and federal actions are identical and that the federal action is therefore barred.it bases this argument on a foundational assertion that both cases center on the page of coletta allegations that mcdonough first presented to sheets at their meeting.
the district court rejected this argument on the ground that the federal and state actions are distinct.the court viewed the state action as based primarily on the alleged retaliatory conduct by sheets after the meeting,while the federal action is based primarily on retaliation perpetrated by members of the department after mcdonough helped coletta in.we review this determination de novo.see maher gsi lumonics,cir.
under federal law,a federal court must give to a judgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that judgment under the law of the state in which that judgment was entered.torromeo fremont,cir internal citations omitted.thus,the effect the massachusetts court final judgment has on mcdonough federal action is determined by applying the massachusetts law of claim preclusion.id.
claim preclusion doctrine in massachusetts prohibits the maintenance of an action based on the same claim that was the subject of an earlier action between the same parties or their privies.bagley moxley.c laim preclusion makes a valid final judgment conclusive on the parties or privies,and bars further litigation of all matters that were or should have been adjudicated in the action.id.there are three essential elements to the doctrine of claim preclusion the identity or privity of the parties to the present and prior actions identity of the cause s of action and a prior final judgment on the merits.bui ma.causes of action are identical if they derive from the same transaction or series of connected transactions.tlt const.anthony tappe.what factual grouping constitutes a transaction is to be determined pragmatically,giving weight to such factors as whether the facts are related in time,space and origin or motivation,whether they form a convenient trial unit,and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties expectations.mancuso kinchla.
there is no question that the parties to the state and federal actions are the same and that the state action resulted in a final judgment on the merits adverse to mcdonough.thus,the only issue is whether the causes of action share sufficient identity.
we agree with the district court that they do not.the transaction on which the state action was based was mcdonough failure to be appointed captain in,which he attributed to retaliation orchestrated by sheets for exercising his first amendment rights in.the transactions on which the federal suit is based were mcdonough transfer and his placement on administrative leave,which he claims were ordered by members of the department after they learned in that he had assisted coletta in her lawsuit.mcdonough suits against the city were premised on separate acts of protected conduct that occurred years apart.moreover,the allegedly retaliatory actions were ordered by different city agents over a several year period.these differences support the district court ruling that the federal action is not barred.see,rodriguez,cir concluding,in an employment discrimination case,that subsequent conduct,even if it is of the same nature as the conduct complained of in a prior lawsuit,may give rise to an entirely separate cause of action herrmann cencom cable assocs,cir posner,concluding that claim preclusion did not bar two tangentially related employment claims because the essential facts underlying the claims were distinct manning city of auburn,cir ruling that claim preclusion did not bar a second employment discrimination claim,where the facts underlying the second suit had not occurred when the first suit was filed 
the page of allegations that mcdonough gave to sheets was,of course,relevant evidence in each case.but the district court correctly recognized that this is too tenuous a connection to warrant a finding of claim preclusion and to deprive mcdonough of his day in court.see herrmann,at refusing to find claim preclusion when the claims had only limited shared facts see also andersen chrysler,cir cautioning that a claim preclusion analysis should not proceed at too high a level of generality because of the risk of unfairly precluding a litigant from having her day in court.
sufficiency of the evidence 
the city argues that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because mcdonough failed to present sufficient evidence to warrant the jury retaliation finding.it claims that the evidence demonstrates,at most,that the actions taken against mcdonough were based on personal conflicts with city officials,and that such evidence is inadequate to sustain a retaliation verdict.the district court rejected this argument,concluding that there was sufficient proof from which a jury could infer that the city actions against mcdonough were motivated by retaliatory animus stemming from his assisting coletta.
we review de novo the denial of the city motion for judgment as a matter of law,see marrero goya of,cir,and we examine the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to mcdonough.see white dep t of,cir.we may not consider the credibility of witnesses,resolve conflicts in testimony or evaluate the weight of the evidence.katz city metal,cir.our review is weighted toward preservation of the jury verdict,for we must affirm unless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdict that no reasonable jury could have returned it.crowley bean,cir.
the jury was instructed to consider mcdonough claim under the mcdonnell douglas framework.see mcdonnell douglas green,d.under mcdonnell douglas,the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that i he engaged in protected conduct,ii he was thereafter subject to an adverse employment action,and iii a causal connection exists between the protected conduct and the adverse action.see ramirez rodriguez boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals,cir.if the plaintiff makes this showing,the burden of production shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.see id.finally,if the defendant presents such a reason,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant proffered reason is pretext masking illegal retaliation.see id.evidence that the defendant reason was pretext may,but need not,ground a finding of liability.fite digital equip,cir.
the city has not presented in its main brief a developed argument that mcdonough failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.it focuses instead on the evidence that mcdonough presented to undermine the city asserted reasons for taking the challenged employment actions.as discussed above,the jury was presented with two adverse employment actions mcdonough reassignment to the day shift and his placement on administrative leave.we consider whether mcdonough presented sufficient evidence of pretext such that the jury could conclude that retaliation was the real motive for each of the challenged actions 
chief frane ordered mcdonough transfer to the day shift within days of learning that mcdonough had assisted coletta in pursuing her sex discrimination claim.at trial,the city claimed that frane decision to transfer mcdonough was part of a reorganization and that the timing was coincidental.
there is no mechanical formula for determining pretext,che.bay transp,cir internal citation omitted,and we have recognized that pretext can be proven in many ways,see centennial wireless,cir.one way is for the plaintiff to show that the employer gave different and arguably inconsistent explanations for taking the adverse employment action.suttle caribe,cir.
here,there was evidence that frane provided several,arguably inconsistent,explanations for transferring mcdonough.when mcdonough first confronted frane about the transfer,frane told him that it was because he had trouble communicating and that,if he did not like it,he could retire.several months later,when mcdonough again asked frane why he had been transferred,frane stated that some city councilors wanted to put additional funding into the drug unit,and that the transfer was intended to help secure this funding.at trial,frane testified that the transfer was part of a major transformation of the department and that it was designed to integrate mcdonough into the department management team.these shifting explanations provided a basis for the jury to conclude that the reason the city presented at trial was false.
moreover,there was testimony from two police captains,who attended management meetings with chief frane just before the transfer,that there was no discussion of restructuring the drug unit.the jury could have concluded that this evidence was inconsistent with the city contention that the transfer decision was a part of a systemic restructuring process.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d stating that a jury can find pretext where the employer proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.
there also was evidence from which the jury could have found pretext masking retaliation in the city claim that it placed mcdonough on administrative leave because it perceived him to be a safety risk.acting chief kelly,the person who decided to place mcdonough on leave,testified that it was common knowledge that mcdonough often became highly emotional but that he would quickly calm down.this testimony was given during kelly account of his conversation with mcdonough that led him to be primarily concerned that mcdonough might have a heart attack.kelly admitted that he did not perceive mcdonough to be a safety threat when this conversation occurred.moreover,no one in the department investigated mcdonough letter to madden to determine the basis and motivation for his statements.from this evidence,the jury could infer that kelly,madden,and falco used mcdonough phone call and letter to establish a pretextual safety rationale for the decision to put mcdonough on administrative leave.
in addition,a jury could view the actions that kelly and falco took when they informed mcdonough that he was being placed on leave as tending to undermine the asserted safety rationale.falco testified that he was so concerned about the possibility of mcdonough becoming violent that he wore a vest to the meeting at which kelly informed mcdonough of the decision to place him on leave.but kelly did not take any such precautions for himself or his secretary who was sitting directly outside of the door to the office in which the meeting was held.nor did kelly or falco arrange to have an officer on alert in case the meeting turned violent.and,after the meeting,no one at the department checked to see if mcdonough had other weapons in his possession,alerted mcdonough family that he was a potential danger to himself or others,or arranged to ensure that mcdonough traveled home safely.indeed,the next contact between the department and mcdonough did not occur until several days later,when someone from the department called to provide him with the details of his evaluation.though the inference is not inevitable,the jury reasonably could have concluded that this is not how experienced police officers would have handled placing an officer on leave if they truly believed that he posed a safety risk.see hodgens dynamics,cir stating that pretext may be proven by showing weaknesses,implausibilities,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons.
in assessing pretext,everything depends on the individual facts.thomas eastman kodak,cir.as such,we are particularly cautious about setting aside a jury determinations that an employer proffered explanation was pretext.hodgens,at.determinations of motive and intent,particularly in discrimination cases,are questions better suited for the jury.ponte,cir.while the jury could have accepted the city explanations for its actions,we can not say that it was irrational for the jury to have concluded that the explanations were pretextual and that retaliation was the motivation for the city actions 
evidentiary claims 
the city challenges several evidentiary rulings.we review these claims for an abuse of discretion.see ramirez,cir.erroneous evidentiary rulings are harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case.see,cir.
the city first claim is that the district court abused its discretion by declining to allow it to introduce evidence that mcdonough had lost his previous lawsuit against the city see supra at.the city argues that this evidence was relevant because it showed that mcdonough was litigious and had a history of bringing meritless lawsuits.
because the charge of litigiousness is a serious one,likely to result in undue prejudice against the party charged,outley city of new york,cir,ordinarily proof that the plaintiff filed prior similar lawsuits is admissible to show the plaintiff litigiousness only if there is also evidence that the prior lawsuits were fraudulently filed,see mccormick on evidence,at ed.here,there is evidence that mcdonough filed one prior lawsuit against the city after he was denied a promotion.but,while that lawsuit was unsuccessful,there is nothing suggesting that it was fraudulently filed.see mathis phillips chevrolet,cir concluding that there was no abuse of discretion in declining to admit evidence of prior lawsuits where the evidence was in dispute whether the prior suits were fraudulently brought or merely unsuccessful.the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence about the result of mcdonough prior lawsuit against the city.
the city next contends that the district court improperly precluded it from questioning mcdonough about his contentious relationship with the mayor and the police department.we disagree with the city characterization of the district court ruling.the city was permitted to ask mcdonough about his strained relationships with certain department officials,to introduce the fact that mcdonough had sued the city on a prior occasion,and to present documents highlighting various points of dispute between mcdonough and the department.the ruling in question involved the court telling the city to move on after counsel had asked mcdonough several repetitive questions about his relationship with captain falco.
under,the district court retains discretion to prevent the needless presentation of cumulative evidence.donovan burger king,cir.the court provided the city with ample opportunity to highlight mcdonough sour relationship with the city.it was within the court discretion to draw the line where it did.
the city third evidentiary argument is that the district court abused its discretion by permitting mcdonough to present a chalk to the jury stating that coletta had settled her lawsuit for.even if this information should not have been presented to the jury,the city did not timely object to the chalk,and the court sua sponte explained that the jury should not infer anything from the amount of the coletta settlement.we have held,that the potential for prejudice often can be satisfactorily dispelled by appropriate curative instructions,as j urors are presumed to follow such instructions,except in extreme cases.united states richardson,cir.given the tangential relevance of the coletta settlement and the court timely limiting instruction,we are confident that the verdict was not swayed by the chalk.
finally the city argues the district court wrongly admitted statements by falco and madden concerning the decision to place mcdonough on administrative leave.the city contends that these statements were hearsay and could not be received as admissions under.d d because the declarants were not policymakers,which the city would limit in this case to the chief of police and the mayor.
for a statement to be an admission under.d d,it must be made by a party,a party agent,or a servant within the scope of an agency or employment.see gomez rivera rodriguez,cir.the employee station within the organization is not relevant to the rule d analysis.see woodman haemonetics,cir rejecting argument that statements by supervisor with no firing authority could not be admissions under rule d
