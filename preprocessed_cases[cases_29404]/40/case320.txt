this case concerns whether the free speech clause of the first amendment compels the postal service to allow campaigning activity for election to public office on a post office sidewalk,constructed and used to give postal patrons access to the door of the post office and distinguishable from neighboring public sidewalks.
plaintiff rinaldo del gallo,iii,a candidate for public office in massachusetts,brought suit in seeking to prevent the pittsfield post office from enforcing a postal service regulation that restricted his ability to collect signatures for his campaign on its sidewalk.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants,pittsfield postmaster roger parent and the pittsfield post office,finding that the restriction did not violate the first amendment.see del gallo parent,d.we affirm.
a.the modern postal service and the regulation 
the constitution empowers congress to establish post offices and post roads and to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for executing this task.postal serv.council of greenburgh civic ass ns,d quoting const.art.i.congress has directed the postal service to plan,develop,promote,and provide adequate and efficient postal services at fair and reasonable rates and fees,a,and to maintain an efficient system of collection,sorting,and delivery of the mail nationwide,id.b.congress expressly authorized the postal service to adopt rules and regulations to accomplish these ends.id.see also council of greenburgh civic ass ns,at.
the postal service has regulations concerning conduct on its property,which are set forth at.at issue is the application of paragraph h of that regulation,which bans campaigning for election to any public office on post office property.the regulation was applied to stop plaintiff from campaigning on the pittsfield post office sidewalk.along with the ban on election campaigning,which is at issue here,the regulation also bans collecting signatures on petitions,s oliciting alms and contributions,vending for commercial purposes,and other related conduct on postal property,but these bans are not at issue.
significantly,the postal service regulation itself draws distinctions based on the character and location of its property.the ban on election campaigning applies to sidewalks on post office property.a.but the ban explicitly does not apply to postal sidewalks along the street frontage of postal property that are not physically distinguishable from adjacent municipal or other public sidewalks.id.a ii 
as the supreme court noted in another first amendment challenge to a postal service restriction,only by review of the history of the postal system and its present statutory and regulatory scheme can the constitutional challenge to the restriction be placed in its proper context.council of greenburgh civic ass ns,at.the regulation at issue relates to one of the postal service longstanding problems and grows out of congress and the service attempts to address this problem.
through much of its history,the post office was closely tied to partisan politics.until,the post office was organized as a department within the executive branch of the federal government.see,reprinted in.the postmaster general was appointed by the president,and his presence in the president cabinet creat ed a link between partisan politics and the post office.id.at.congress was deeply involved in the management of the post office,including rate setting,selection of local postmasters,and the details of labor relations.see id.at,geddes,saving the mail.as one aspect of the political entanglement,the post office was also an important source of political patronage jobs,reprinted in at stating that vestiges of century political patronage practices have persisted in the post office department geddes,supra,at p ostmasters were often chosen to provide political patronage under a system that allowed members of congress and occasionally local party officials to choose the local postmaster.calabresi yoo,the unitary executive during the second,harv.pub.pol y,describing the nineteenth century post office department as being heavily kernell mcdonald,congress and america political development the transformation of the post office from patronage to service,am.pol.sci,stating that t hroughout the nineteenth century the political fortunes of members of congress depended heavily on their ability to send patronage home to their states and that m ost of these patronage jobs were located in the post office kramer,putting the politics back into the political safeguards of federalism,colum,state and local parties exerted influence over federal administration through spoils rotation,providing personnel to staff local federal post offices mashaw,administration and the democracy administrative law from jackson to lincoln,yale,noting the massive use of patronage in the post office department in the nineteenth century.these historic associations between the post office and electoral politics are no longer considered acceptable.
in,congress passed the postal reorganization act,stat,to deal with the problems of increasing deficits and shortcomings in the overall management and efficiency of the post office,council of greenburgh civic ass ns,at.in doing so,congress recognized that partisan political entanglement was one of the foremost problems facing the post office.see,reprinted in at o ne of the cardinal needs of postal reform is to seal off the postal service from partisan political influence.the close connection between partisan politics and post office department contributed to inefficiencies and to problems in rate setting and management.see id.at,geddes,supra,at.
congress was also concerned with the effect that the connection between electoral politics and the post office had on public perception.see,reprinted in at d etailed congressional involvement in the technical details of postal economics led to a widespread public impression that the influence of special interests has a determining effect on the structure of today postal rates.moreover,congress determined that political patronage practices had persisted in the post office department too long,reprinted in at see also,reprinted in at nineteenth century customs of political patronage have no place in a late century postal system.
thus,congress sought to have the post office taken out of politics and politics out of the post office,reprinted in at.the postal reorganization act abolished the post office department as a department and established in its place the united states postal service as a corporation.id.at see also council of greenburgh civic ass ns,at.significantly,congress directed the new postal service be funded by its own revenue and run more like a business than had its predecessor,the post office department.franchise tax bd.postal,d.in an increasingly competitive market,congress directed the service to become a service industry and to seek out the needs and desires of its present and potential american public.united states kokinda,d plurality opinion quoting,reprinted in at.
congress sought to insulate the postal service from electoral politics by establishing institutional buffers between the president and the congress on the one hand,and the officers and employees of the postal service on the other,reprinted in at.the postal reorganization act distanced elected officials from rate setting and the management of the postal service and put additional protections in place to address the problem of patronage.see id.it also empowered the postal service to adopt rules and regulations in furtherance of these objectives.see,reprinted in at.
in,shortly after the enactment of the postal reorganization act,the postal service published a set of regulations governing conduct on postal property.see conduct on postal property.five years later,in,the service proposed a number of amendments to these regulations,including a prohibition on campaigning for election to public office.see conduct on postal property.the proposed campaign amendment was said to be consistent with existing regulations prohibiting the display on bulletin boards of photographs and other materials designed to influence elections.id.this was part of a set of amendments based on the experience of the postal service.see id.at.the new regulations were adopted in.conduct on postal property.the stated purpose of the ban on campaigning for election to public office was to prevent abuses and to preclude any appearance of partisan endorsement or preference.id.
thus,the regulation was intended to further address the problems of political entanglement with which congress was concerned in passing the postal reorganization act.see longo postal serv.longo i,cir.stating that the primary justification for the prohibition against campaigning on postal property is that it enables the postal service to avoid both actual entanglement in partisan politics and the appearance of political favoritism and that without the prohibition,postmasters would be hard pressed to avoid the sort of embroilment in partisan politics that congress tried to prevent when it reorganized the postal service in,vacated on other grounds,d.
del gallo election campaigning activity at the pittsfield post office 
the pittsfield post office sits at the corner of fenn street and willis street in downtown pittsfield.the building is shaped roughly like a sideways l,with the short portion pointing north toward fenn street and the long portion pointing west toward willis street.between the two portions is a parking lot for postal customers.the parking lot extends north up to the fenn street municipal sidewalk.motorists enter and exit the parking lot from fenn street through two driveways that intersect the municipal sidewalk.to the west of the parking lot is a small patch that slopes downward to the willis street municipal sidewalk.pedestrians get to the post office from the municipal sidewalk on fenn street by using the post office sidewalk,which follows the shape of a u with an elongated base,running south from fenn street between the parking lot and the grassy patch,then east along the front of the post office and past the front door,then turning north along the eastern side of the post office back to fenn street.both times it meets the fenn street sidewalk at a right angle.the post office sidewalk is also accessible from the willis street sidewalk through a short flight of concrete stairs that intersect the grassy patch and lead directly to the bottom portion of the 
beyond providing access for postal customers,the post office sidewalk and stairs may also be used by pedestrians as a shortcut between the willis street and fenn street sidewalks.this path is no shorter than simply walking along the municipal sidewalks,and it involves walking up or down stairs.it is possible for a pedestrian,however,to avoid the two driveways that intersect the fenn street sidewalk by taking the stairs and walking along the front of the post office.one post office employee,ronald ricci,who worked as a customer service supervisor since,stated that he has never seen the post office sidewalk actually used in this manner.
in april,plaintiff was running for a position on the massachusetts governor council he attempted to solicit signatures for his election campaign in the lobby of the pittsfield post office.a customer complained.supervisor ricci,who did not know of the regulation,instructed plaintiff that he could not solicit signatures inside the post office,but that he could do so outside on the post office sidewalk,so long as he did not block the doorway or bother people.plaintiff went outside and campaigned.a number of customers complained to ricci that plaintiff was harassing them,stepping in front of them and pressing them for signatures one woman said plaintiff was intimidating and scaring her.ricci went outside,explained to del gallo that customers were complaining,and asked del gallo to stop harassing customers.ricci did not ask del gallo to leave or to stop campaigning.
the following day,del gallo returned and solicited signatures for his campaign inside the post office.ricci again told him he could not solicit signatures in the lobby.del gallo left.ricci was not aware of del gallo doing any soliciting outside it was raining.
later that month,del gallo again returned to solicit signatures for his campaign.that morning,he encountered paula cooke,a post office supervisor,as she approached the front door of the post office.cooke work ordinarily did not take her to the front door or lobby of the post office.she was filling in as officer in charge that day due to the absence of a coworker.del gallo asked cooke to sign his petition and cooke,who was aware of the postal regulation,informed plaintiff that it was impermissible for him to campaign on the post office sidewalk.when del gallo ignored her,cooke went inside and asked james curley,another customer service supervisor,to tell del gallo he could not continue his campaigning in that location.as he was leaving to speak with del gallo,curley was informed by the window clerks that customers were complaining that del gallo had been harassing them outside.curley told del gallo that he would need to move his campaigning to the nearby public sidewalk del gallo refused to do so.later,more customers complained that del gallo was harassing them after reviewing the postal operations manual,cooke and curley decided to call the pittsfield police department.police officers arrived and asked plaintiff to stop campaigning on the post office sidewalk plaintiff refused,and he was arrested.he did not file suit at the time.
before plaintiff arrest on or about april,the pittsfield post office sidewalk had been used by people campaigning for public office and gathering signatures for nomination papers and ballot initiatives,although the extent of such usage is unclear from the record.del gallo claimed that before this time,countless candidates for political office were allowed to gather signatures at the pittsfield post office.jonathan levine,the publisher of the pittsfield gazette,stated in his affidavit that over the years he had seen numerous potential candidates for office gathering nomination paper signatures on trips to the pittsfield post office.and jonathan melle,who had been a candidate for state senator,stated that on or about the time period of the entire month of february and up to the middle of march,he gathered signatures on the sidewalk of the pittsfield post office.none of the affidavits state that the observed campaign activities before april took place with the permission of postal service officials,that permission of officials was requested,or that such officials were aware of the activity.none of the affidavits state that any such activities took place after april.
affidavits filed by postal employees provide a framework for the observations contained in the affidavits of del gallo,levine,and melle.the affidavits demonstrate several different things.to the extent postal officials were aware of such election campaigning activities,there was irregular enforcement of the regulation before april due to a lack of knowledge of the regulation by some employees.the postal service officials who were aware of the regulations enforced it.ricci was unaware at that time that the postal service had a regulation barring campaigning and collecting signatures on postal sidewalks.he stated that,on occasion,he received requests from individuals seeking to conduct campaigning activity on pittsfield post office property.he admittedly,in his ignorance of the regulation,had told some individuals before del gallo arrest in april that they could conduct such activities on the sidewalk outside the post office.after april,when he was aware of the regulation,he enforced it.
curley,who was aware of the regulation,enforced it before april.he described two occasions in which he instructed individuals that they were not allowed to campaign on the postal sidewalk and that they would have to move to one of the public sidewalks.curley also told del gallo in april to stop soliciting signatures on the sidewalk because it was contrary to regulations.curley said his usual duties did not involve his being in the lobby or interacting with customers.when he went out to tell del gallo to stop,it was not because he saw del gallo on the sidewalk,but because he was told to do so by cooke,who was the officer in charge that day.cooke stated that o ther than del gallo,she was not aware that any political candidates had used the postal service sidewalk to campaign and solicit signatures.further,she was aware of his sidewalk activities because she was returning to the post office through the front door.cooke job mostly kept her in a work room at the rear of the post office,where she could see neither the sidewalk nor the lobby.
it is undisputed that following del gallo arrest in april,the regulation has been consistently enforced.ricci stated that since april,two individuals asked to solicit signatures to run for public office on the postal sidewalk he told both they could do so only on the public sidewalk.
in,plaintiff once again ran for governor council,his prior effort having failed.plaintiff was required to gather a thousand certified signatures for his campaign by may.he conferred on a number of occasions that year with postmaster roger parent,to request permission to gather signatures for his campaign on the post office sidewalk.del gallo told parent that,in his view,under the circuit decision in initiative referendum institute postal service,it was illegal for the post office to prevent him from campaigning on its sidewalks.parent conferred with counsel and denied plaintiff requests.
on march,plaintiff and a companion were gathering signatures for plaintiff campaign on the fenn street municipal sidewalk,near the post office.at some point that day,police officers told plaintiff that he was not allowed to campaign on the post office property.plaintiff asked the officers whether he would be allowed to do so if he merely stood on the post office sidewalk and directed those interested in signing his petition to the public sidewalk,where his companion would be standing.after consulting with post office staff,the officers informed plaintiff this was not allowed.
plaintiff brought suit on april,before a single justice of the massachusetts supreme judicial court.the suit sought to enjoin the pittsfield police and postmaster parent from preventing plaintiff campaigning on the post office sidewalk it also sought a declaration that it was unconstitutional to prevent plaintiff from gathering signatures for his campaign on that sidewalk.the case was removed to federal district court on april.on march,plaintiff moved for summary judgment.on april,defendants also moved for summary judgment.the parties filed various affidavits.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.del gallo,d at.the court found,first,that h was applicable to the activity at issue in this case because plaintiff was engaged in campaigning,see id.at,and because the sidewalk on which he was attempting to do so was distinguishable from the surrounding municipal sidewalks,thus bringing it into the purview of the regulation as amended in,see id.at.second,the court held that the sidewalk outside the pittsfield post office was neither a traditional nor a designated public forum.see id.at.in light of the nature of the forum,the court found that the postal service ban on campaigning for election was constitutional because it was reasonable and viewpoint neutral.see id.at.finally,the court rejected plaintiff claim of selective enforcement,finding that there was no evidence,beyond plaintiff speculation,of any pattern of unlawful favoritism.see id.at.
plaintiff timely appealed.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.new eng.reg l council of carpenters kinton,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see also kinton,at.we engage in de novo review of ultimate conclusions of law and mixed questions of law and fact in first amendment cases.ridley.bay transp,cir.
as an initial matter,to the extent plaintiff has raised not only an challenge but also a facial challenge to the pertinent provision of h,we quickly dispose of this claim.in a facial attack case,it is plaintiff burden to show that the law has no constitutional application.naser jewelers,city of concord,cir.plaintiff has not come close to meeting this burden.see mcguire reilly,cir see also united states bjerke,cir.nor has plaintiff attempted to establish that the regulation is overbroad.see virginia hicks,d see also initiative referendum,at longo i,at.we thus turn to the challenge.
plaintiff attempts to gather signatures for his election campaigns is undoubtedly a form of speech protected by the first amendment.see burson freeman,d plurality opinion longo i,at.this protection,however,is not absolute.even protected speech is not equally permissible in all places and at all times.cornelius naacp legal def.educ.fund,d see also kinton,at knights of columbus,council town of lexington,cir longo i,at monterey county democratic cent.comm.postal,cir.
it is well settled that the government need not permit all forms of speech on property that it owns and controls.int l soc y for krishna consciousness,lee,d citing council of greenburgh civic ass ns,at.accord,kokinda,at.plurality opinion united states belsky,cir.the government,no less than a private owner of property,has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.greer spock,d quoting adderley florida,d accord council of greenburgh civic ass ns,at.

the parties and the district court approached this case as one to be analyzed under the forum analysis doctrine the supreme court has adopted a forum analysis as a means of determining when the government interest in limiting the use of its property to its intended purpose outweighs the interest of those wishing to use the property for other purposes.kokinda,at.plurality opinion quoting cornelius,at.accord,int l soc y for krishna consciousness,at.knights of columbus,at.under this approach,the validity of a restriction is determined by examining the nature of the forum in which a restriction applies and the type of restriction.kinton,at.we will utilize forum analysis since the supreme court has continued to utilize the doctrine and has used it twice in first amendment challenges to postal service regulations,see kokinda,at.plurality opinion council of greenburgh civic ass ns,at.
plaintiff correctly says that since kokinda was a plurality opinion,its forum analysis does not dictate our analysis of the forum question.in kokinda the supreme court upheld a separate restriction on s oliciting alms and contributions,h,on a sidewalk in front of a post office,see kokinda,at.plurality opinion.the plurality found that the postal sidewalk in kokinda was a forum,id.at.plurality opinion,and the dissent came to the opposite conclusion,id.at.brennan,dissenting.the deciding concurring opinion withheld judgment on the forum issue id.at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment.
as such,this plurality decision is instructive,but not dispositive of the forum analysis.other courts agree.see initiative referendum,at finding that kokinda provides no definitive guidance on the forum status of postal sidewalks jacobsen,at finding that kokinda does not give a definitive answer on whether postal sidewalks are public fora longo postal serv.longo ii,cir stating that the court was not necessarily bound by the supreme court plurality opinion in kokinda but choosing to follow that analysis.
a.the nature of the forum 
our first inquiry is whether the sidewalk at issue in this case is a traditional public forum,of the sort that has immemorially time out of mind been held in the public trust and used for purposes of expressive activity.int l soc y for krishna consciousness,at.omission in original quoting hague comm.for indus.r egulation of speech on government property that has traditionally been available for public expression is subject to the highest scrutiny.id.at.we examine both the characteristics of the property and its history and purpose.see id.at.kinton,at see also kokinda,at.plurality opinion t he location and purpose of a publicly owned sidewalk is critical to determining whether such a sidewalk constitutes a public forum.
it is quite clear that the first amendment would not entitle plaintiff to campaign inside the postal service building or in its doorway.it is also quite clear that first amendment expression would be protected on the municipal sidewalks on fenn street and willis street,just as it is on the large public sidewalks at the base of the many steps leading up to the majestic colonnade of the supreme court,united states grace,d.the sidewalk at issue in this case is in between those two different ends of the spectrum.
we have previously said that some spaces,such as public streets,sidewalks,and parks,are presumptively public fora,such that in most cases no particularized inquiry into their precise nature is necessary.kinton,at.but kinton observation must be understood in the context of the supreme court recognition that the first amendment does not guarantee access to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the government.council of greenburgh civic ass ns,at.not all sidewalks owned by the large variety of government bodies are alike and not all sidewalks are public fora.that conclusion is mandated by the court decision in greer,at.see kokinda,at.plurality opinion holding that t he presence of sidewalks and streets within the base in greer did not require a finding that it was a public forum kinton,at.a particularized inquiry is required here.in this case,the nature of the locus and its history do not support a finding that sidewalk outside the pittsfield post office is a traditional public forum.kinton,at.
the postal service sidewalk here does not have the characteristics of public sidewalks traditionally open to expressive activity.kokinda,at.plurality opinion.in analyzing the physical nature of this forum,the fact that the nearby municipal sidewalk may well be a public forum is not the critical issue.rather,the supreme court has emphasized that separation from acknowledged public areas may serve to indicate that the separated property is a special enclave,subject to greater restriction.int l soc y for krishna consciousness,at.accord grace,at.focusing on whether there was any separation or any indication whatever to persons stepping from the street to the curb and sidewalks that they had entered some special enclave see also kinton,at monterey county democratic cent,at bjerke,at.in this case,the postal sidewalk was physically distinguishable,such that a person stepping onto the post office property would be aware he had departed from the municipal sidewalk.
the record also establishes that the postal service sidewalk on which plaintiff attempted to campaign is clearly separate from the nearby municipal sidewalks.the postal service sidewalk meets the municipal sidewalk on fenn street twice at right angles,but the sidewalks are otherwise separated by the post office parking lot.the postal service sidewalk is separated from the municipal sidewalk on willis street by an inclined area the two sidewalks are connected only by a short flight of concrete stairs.the fact that postal sidewalks almost inevitably touch municipal sidewalks can not be the basis for a finding that the two are indistinguishable,as the district court properly noted,see del gallo,d at.here,the divide between post office property and the municipal sidewalks was obvious.see grace,at.greer,at.paff kaltenbach,cir jacobsen,at longo ii,at monterey county democratic cent,at belsky,at bjerke,at.
the past uses and purpose of this postal service sidewalk also support the conclusion that it is not a traditional public forum.traditional public forums are places which by long tradition or by government fiat have been devoted to assembly and debate.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.in contrast,the pittsfield post office sidewalk has not consistently,historically been used for public assembly and debate,nor was it intended to be used as such.see frisby schultz,d.
as for purpose,the postal service sidewalk in question is there to provide customers access to the entry to the pittsfield post office.it is neither a public thoroughfare nor a gathering place.see kokinda,at.plurality opinion t he postal sidewalk was constructed solely to provide for the passage of individuals engaged in postal business and not to facilitate the daily commerce and life of the neighborhood or city.heffron int l soc y for krishna consciousness,d describing a public street as a necessary conduit in the daily affairs of the locality citizens and a place where people may enjoy the open air or the company of friends and neighbors in a relaxed environment lederman united states,contrasting the postal sidewalk in kokinda from the sidewalk surrounding the capitol east front,which facilitat es tourist access to a centerpiece of our democracy and serves as a place from which tourists may view and photograph the capitol belsky,at these walkways are intended to accommodate traffic to and from the post office for the conduct of postal business and have not traditionally been sites for expressive conduct.bjerke,at the walkways in question were not dedicated to serve the traditional functions of streets or parks but rather for the particular function of accommodating post office patrons on official business.
as to past usage,this postal service sidewalk,unlike ordinary municipal sidewalks,has functioned historically not as a place to promot e the free exchange of ideas but to allow customers to have easy access to the pittsfield post office products and services,as is necessary for a business that must provide services attractive to the marketplace.int l soc y for krishna consciousness,at.quoting cornelius,at.accord kokinda,at.plurality opinion belsky,at bjerke,at t he function of postal service property is to facilitate the provision of efficient postal services,and not to provide a public platform for political advocacy.citing a.
notwithstanding this,plaintiff argues this postal service sidewalk must be considered a traditional public forum because it had been used for political election campaigning before april,when plaintiff was first arrested for refusing to leave the postal service sidewalk,and because pedestrians may at times use the postal sidewalk as a shortcut between the two municipal sidewalks.there is no claim it was used for election campaigning after april.plaintiff evidence,even taking all inferences in his favor,is not sufficient to change the dominant character of this forum.see kinton,at holding that even if the public had regular access to fish pier,and even if massport policy was erratically enforced,this was not enough to convert the fish pier into a traditional public forum see also ridley,at.
the pittsfield post office sidewalk is also not made into a designated public forum by this past usage because there was no affirmative intent to create such a forum.the government does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse,but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse.ridley,at quoting cornelius,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the record reveals no evidence of such affirmative intent by the postal service in this case.see kokinda,at.plurality opinion ridley,at monterey county democratic cent,at belsky,at bjerke,at.
b.the reasonableness of the regulation 
although the pittsfield post office sidewalk is a forum,the regulation must still be both viewpoint neutral and reasonable to be constitutional.ridley,at kinton,at.the regulation,which bars election campaign
