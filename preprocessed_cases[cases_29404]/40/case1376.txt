mark mcburney,roger hurlbert,and bonnie stewart collectively,the appellants appeal the district court dismissal of their action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the attorney general of virginia,the deputy commissioner and director of virginia division of child support enforcement dcse,and the director of the real estate assessment division in henrico county,virginia collectively,the appellees.before the district court,the plaintiffs alleged that virginia freedom of information act vfoia or the act violates the dormant commerce clause and the privileges and immunity clause of the constitution.the district court dismissed all parties from the suit on jurisdictional grounds,from which order this appeal arises.
for the following reasons,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
the vfoia provides citizens of the commonwealth of virginia with a right of access to all public records held by the commonwealth,its officers,employees,or agents.ann.to.in relevant part,the act provides as follows 
except as otherwise specifically provided by law,all public records shall be open to inspection and copying by any citizens of the commonwealth during the regular office hours of the custodian of such records.access to such records shall not be denied to citizens of the commonwealth,representatives of newspapers and magazines with circulation in the commonwealth,and representatives of radio and television stations broadcasting in or into the commonwealth.the custodian may require the requester to provide his name and legal address.the custodian of such records shall take all necessary precautions for their preservation and safekeeping.
on january,mcburney and hurlbert sued the attorney general of virginia,currently kenneth cuccinelli,ii the attorney general nathaniel young,deputy commissioner and director of virginia dcse the deputy commissioner,and the director of the real estate assessment division in henrico county,virginia,currently thomas little the county director pursuant to.they sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the enforcement of the vfoia,which they claim violates the privileges and immunities clause and the dormant commerce clause of the constitution.the district court later allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint to add an additional plaintiff,bonnie stewart.
plaintiffs claims 
each plaintiff alleges different facts to support the common argument that the vfoia violates the constitution.
mcburney claims 
mcburney,a citizen of rhode island,and his wife lore mills were divorced in.mcburney filed an application for child support with virginia dcse in july and,as a result of dcse alleged failure to file the proper petition,mcburney claims he was denied nearly nine months of child support payments.
in,mcburney submitted a vfoia request to the dcse seeking disclosure of certain documents that he believed would help resolve this dispute.specifically he requested all emails,notes,files,memos,reports,policies,and opinions pertaining to him,his son,or his former wife.the dcse denied his request on two grounds first,because the information was confidential and protected under the virginia code,and and second,because he was not a citizen of the commonwealth of virginia.mcburney sent a second request,identical to the first except that he listed a virginia address instead of his rhode island address.the dcse again denied his request.this time,the dcse only listed mcburney citizenship as its reason for the denial.however,the dcse did inform mcburney of his right to obtain this information under a different statute,the government data collection and dissemination practices act,ann.to.later,mcburney submitted a request under this act and obtained over eighty requested documents.
mcburney contends that he did not receive all the documents he could have received under the vfoia.he also contends that the dcse denial obstructed his right to advocate on his own behalf and prohibited him from utilizing virginia dispute resolution procedures,thus violating the privileges and immunities clause.
hurlbert claims 
hurlbert,a citizen of california,is the sole proprietor of sage information services.he is in the business of requesting real estate tax assessment records for his clients from state agencies across the united states,including virginia.on june,hurlbert submitted a vfoia request to henrico county assessor office,which the office denied on the basis of his citizenship.on february,after litigation in this case had commenced,the county provided hurlbert with an electronic copy of its real estate assessment subject of the vfoia request.hurlbert counsel returned this information without reading or reviewing it.
hurlbert argues that the denial of his vfoia request was unconstitutional,because it prevents him from pursuing his common calling on an equal basis with virginia citizens in violation of the privileges and immunities clause,and because it gives virginia citizens an exclusive right of access to virginia public records,in contravention of the dormant commerce clause.
stewart claims 
stewart,a citizen of west virginia and assistant professor of journalism at west virginia university,submitted her vfoia request in february to virginia commonwealth university and virginia polytechnic institute and state university virginia tech.stewart request sought information about the salaries and benefit packages awarded to the presidents of virginia public universities and was made in conjunction with a course project on the administration of public universities in other states.both institutions denied her request,because she was not a citizen of virginia 
stewart claims that the denial of her vfoia request violates the privileges and immunities clause because it prevents her from pursuing her common calling as an educator on an equal basis with virginia citizens.
district court opinion 
the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss.first,it held that the attorney general was not a proper party under the eleventh amendment.because stewart only alleged claims against the attorney general,it correspondingly dismissed her as a plaintiff.second,it held that both mcburney and hurlbert lacked standing,and dismissed them as plaintiffs.because mcburney was the only plaintiff to assert claims against the deputy commissioner,the district court also dismissed the deputy commissioner as a party.similarly,because only hurlbert had sued the county director,the court dismissed him as well.consequently,no parties remained before the court,and it dismissed the case.
w e review de novo a district court legal determination of whether ex parte young relief is available.franks ross,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.similarly,w e review a district court dismissal for lack of standing de novo.bishop bartlett,cir citations omitted.
this case presents two threshold questions first,whether the attorney general is immune from suit under the eleventh amendment and second,whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue.as to the first question,we agree with the district court that the attorney general was not a proper party.we disagree,however,with the district court ruling on standing,so we reverse that part of its judgment,and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
sovereign immunity 
the district court concluded that the attorney general was not a proper party to the suit under the eleventh amendment and the exception announced in ex parte young.the appellants appeal this ruling and the district court consequent dismissal of stewart.
the eleventh amendment provides that t he judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.
the present suit is thus barred unless it falls within the exception announced by the supreme court in ex parte young,which permits a federal court to issue prospective,injunctive relief against a state officer to prevent ongoing violations of federal law,on the rationale that such a suit is not a suit against the state for purposes of the eleventh amendment.id.at.the requirement that the violation of federal law be ongoing is satisfied when a state officer enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional state law is threatened,even if the threat is not yet imminent.waste mgmt.holdings,gilmore,cir citation omitted.the ex parte young exception is directed at officers of the state who are clothed with some duty in regard to the enforcement of the laws of the state,and who threaten and are about to commence proceedings to enforce against parties affected by an unconstitutional act.ex parte young,at emphasis added.thus,we must find a special relation between the officer being sued and the challenged statute before invoking the exception.id.at gilmore,at.this requirement of proximity to and responsibility for the challenged state action,wildlife fed limehouse,cir,is not met when an official merely possesses g eneral authority to enforce the laws of the state,id.at citation omitted.the requirement protects a state eleventh amendment immunity while,at the same time,ensuring that,in the event a plaintiff sues a state official in his individual capacity to enjoin unconstitutional action,any federal injunction will be effective with respect to the underlying claim.id.at.
in dismissing the attorney general because he lacked a specific relation to the vfoia,the district court took judicial notice of the attorney general web site,which states that the attorney general duties include,in pertinent part,providing legal advice and representation to the governor and executive agencies,state boards and commissions,and institutions of higher education defending the constitutionality of state laws when they are challenged in court and enforcing state laws that protect businesses and consumers.the appellants now contend that the special relation requirement is met,because the attorney general has a specific statutory duty to enforce the vfoia against state officials and even if he does not,his authority to issue official opinions and advice creates the requisite enforcement connection.in response,the attorney general disputes the appellants interpretation of the vfoia enforcement provision,and posits that his general authority to issue advisory opinions is not sufficient to abrogate sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment.
we agree with the attorney general.first,he does not have a specific statutory duty to enforce the vfoia against state officials.although the vfoia contains an enforcement provision that grants the attorney for the commonwealth authority to petition for an injunction against a state official for a violation of the act ann.a,as used throughout the code,the term attorney for the commonwealth,refers not to the attorney general,but rather to the commonwealth attorneys,who are elected local prosecutors.compare ann.stating that the attorney general is the chief executive officer of the department of law with,providing that every county and city shall elect an attorney for the commonwealth,and setting forth the office local prosecutorial duties.see also ann.distinguishing between the duties of the attorney general and the attorney for the commonwealth.see generally in re hannett,addressing the question of whether,pursuant to ann.provides for the appointment of a local attorney to serve as the attorney for the commonwealth due to the prolonged absence of the elected commonwealth attorney.thus,contrary to the appellants characterization,the attorney general does not possess a specific statutory duty to enjoin violations of the act pursuant to a.
second,the attorney general duty to issue advisory opinions is,like the governor duty to uphold the state laws in gilmore,not sufficient to make him the proper part y to litigation challenging the law.gilmore,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.our decision in limehouse does not change this result.in limehouse,the plaintiffs sought to enjoin the director of south carolina department of transportation the director from continuing a project to construct a bridge before the final environmental impact statement feis was reconsidered pursuant to federal law.f d at.in discussing the contours of the ex parte young doctrine,we stressed the following principles 
this special relation requirement ensures that the appropriate party is before the federal court,so as not to interfere with the lawful discretion of state officials.primarily,the requirement has been a bar to injunctive actions where the relationship between the state official sought to be enjoined and the enforcement of the state statute is significantly attenuated.such cases have been dismissed on the ground that general authority to enforce the laws of the state is an insufficient ground for abrogating eleventh amendment immunity.thus,the director connection to the state statute need not be qualitatively special rather,special relation under ex parte young has served as a measure of proximity to and responsibility for the challenged state action.this requirement ensures that a federal injunction will be effective with respect to the underlying claim.
id.at internal quotations,citations,and alterations omitted.
we then rejected the director argument that he did not have a special relation to the national environmental policy act and its analogues.we noted the director supervisory authority over the state participation in the feis process,his deep involve ment in preparing the challenged feis and procuring permits to proceed with the construction of the bridge on the basis of the feis and,pursuant to federal law,his authority as head of the joint lead agency with the federal highway administration fhwa,given that the two agencies cooperated to draft any environmental document required for the feis for the proposed bridge.id.at.thus,we concluded that the director possessed a sufficient connection to the alleged violation of federal law to establish a special relation under ex parte young.id.in contrast,the attorney general authority over the vfoia is significantly more attenuated.id.as discussed supra,the attorney general has no specific statutory enforcement authority under the vfoia.in addition,he has not issued any advisory opinions specifically directing state agencies to deny vfoia requests by nor has he participated in the decisionmaking process of those agencies.thus,his general authority to issue advisory opinions,in the abstract,is not sufficient to establish a special relation for ex parte young purposes.
in addition,our holding is consistent with those of our sister circuits that have dismissed the attorney general when no special relation existed between his office and the challenged statute.see okpalobi foster,cir en banc plurality opinion holding that attorney general was not a proper party where plaintiffs challenged a louisiana statute that provided a private cause of action against doctors who performed abortions,because the attorney general did not have a special enforcement connection to the statute smith beebe,app x cir holding that attorney general was not a proper party in a action,because he did not bear a special relation to a challenged tolling provision.we express no opinion on whether a special relationship would exist if an agency relies on an advisory opinion explicitly interpreting vfoia to apply only to virginia citizens.see gay lesbian bisexual alliance evans,holding that the attorney general of alabama was a proper party in a suit challenging an alabama statute that prohibited universities from allocating public funds to support any group that promoted lifestyles prohibited by sodomy and sexual misconduct laws,because the university enforced the statute allegedly in reliance on an advisory opinion from the attorney general aff sub nom.gay lesbian bisexual alliance pryor,cir affirming,without discussing,this holding.
finally,even were we to find a special relation,we can not apply ex parte young because the attorney general has not acted or threatened to act.see ex parte young,at gilmore,at.the attorney general has neither personally denied any of the appellant vfoia requests nor advised any other agencies to do so.minner lee,cir holding that delaware foia violated the privileges and immunities clause and affirming the district court injunction barring the attorney general from enforcing the law where plaintiff requested records from the attorney general.moreover,the appellants do not allege that the deputy commissioner or the county director relied on the attorney general advice in denying their vfoia requests.see pryor,affirming,without discussing,the district court decision that the attorney general of alabama was a proper party,because the university relied on a specific advisory opinion from the attorney general.because the attorney general has not enforced,threatened to enforce,or advised other agencies to enforce the vfoia against the appellants,the ex parte young fiction can not apply.see ex parte young,at.we affirm the district court dismissal of the attorney general and stewart from the suit.
mcburney and hurlbert next argue that the district court improperly dismissed them on standing grounds.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing requires an injury in harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical fairly traceable connection between the plaintiff injury and the conduct of the defendant and likelihood that the requested relief will redress the alleged injury.steel citizens for a better env t,internal quotation marks and citations omitted see friends of the earth,gaston copper recycling,cir en banc same.the standing doctrine,of course,depends not upon the merits,but on whether the plaintiff is the proper party to bring the suit.white tail park,stroube,cir internal quotation marks,citations,and alteration omitted.indeed,i f a plaintiff legally protected interest hinged on whether a given claim could succeed on the merits,then every unsuccessful plaintiff will have lacked standing in the first place.id.at.
the vfoia contains several exemptions to protect confidential information,including an exemption from disclosure of a ll records that pertain to child support enforcement.ann.the district court concluded that mcburney lacked standing because he failed to allege an injury,based on its conclusion that the records requested were not available under the vfoia.specifically,the district court concluded that the dcse denied mcburney request because all the requested materials were confidential and thus exempt from disclosure under the act regardless of his citizenship.mcburney now argues that some of the requested documents were not confidential documents and that the dcse denial with respect to these documents was based solely on the grounds of his.
it is undisputed that although mcburney received more than eighty documents related to his child support case under a different statute,he did not receive general policy information,documents discussing how the dcse administers cases like his,information that would arguably not fall within the act exemption for confidential documents.the deputy commissioner insists that mcburney never made a request for such general policy information.however,mcburney request sought a ny and all treatises,statutes,legislation,regulations,administrative guidelines,or any other reference material that the dss dcse relies upon in actioning or administering child support cases where one parent is overseas.thus,he has article iii standing to sue,because he has shown injury in fact lack of possession of the requested general policy information causation the deputy commissioner continues to deny access to these records,although the basis for such denial is not clear and redressability for which release of the information would remedy.see pub.citizen dep t of justice,recognizing that the court decisions interpreting the foia have never suggested that those requesting information under it need show more than that they sought and were denied specific agency records.the district court thus erred in dismissing mcburney.
the district court held that hurlbert did not have standing because he failed to plead either monetary relief or an ongoing injury as required for declaratory or injunctive relief.the district court acknowledged that hurlbert counsel in responsive briefs and documents alludes to hurlbert making future v foia requests,but it refused to credit such assertions and held that the pleadings did not support a finding of article iii jurisdiction.
on appeal hurlbert argues that the district court erred.he asserts that the court should have considered evidence outside of the pleadings,specifically,his affidavit submitted to support his for a preliminary injunction.in this affidavit,he averred that after his vfoia request was denied he was dissuaded from making any further vfoia requests in henrico county.he also contends that even if the court properly confined its analysis to the pleadings,it ignored portions of his complaint that implied an ongoing injury.the county director argues that t he existence of facts not pled are irrelevant when considering a motion to dismiss,citing bishop bartlett,cir,in support.
here,the amended complaint itself is best read to plead an ongoing injury in paragraph hurlbert alleged that the act makes it impossible for him to pursue his common calling by obtaining virginia public records through the vfoia on an equal basis with virginia citizens.given that the complaint stated sufficient facts to support standing the district court erred in dismissing mcburney for lack of standing 
constitutional claims 
we decline to address the merits of the appellants claim,and instead remand for the district court to consider hurlbert and mcburney claims in light of our holding that they have standing to sue.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded for the district court to proceed consistent with this opinion.
after erroneously concluding that appellant hurlbert lacked standing to proceed with his claim,the district court stated that even if hurlbert had standing it is unlikely that he would have succeeded on the merits.mcburney mims,dist.lexis,at.may.in my view,this conclusion is based on a clearly incorrect interpretation of the privileges and immunities clause.so while i join judge siler opinion in full,i write separately to address a legal error that appears likely to recur without further guidance from this court.see levy lexington county,sch.dist.three bd.of,cir.
the privileges and immunities clause in article iv section of the constitution requires that states treat their residents and nonresidents alike in matters bearing on the vitality of the nation as a single entity.sup.of piper,u,quoting baldwin.fish game comm n.the clause protects several rights,including the right of one state citizens to engage in economic activity in another state on terms of substantial equality with the citizens of that state.toomer witsell.specifically,the supreme court has held that under the privileges and immunities clause,states may not discriminate against nonresidents when distributing professional licenses,nor may they prohibit nonresidents from engaging in economic activity that residents may engage in.see piper,at explaining the court precedent and holding that states may not prohibit nonresidents from practicing law in the state.stated differently,the clause prohibits states from discriminating against nonresidents pursuing a common calling.baldwin,at bd.of appeals,cir.
though this prohibition is not absolute,a state attempt to burden a right protected by the privileges and immunities clause triggers heightened judicial scrutiny.a state may only discriminate against another state citizens on matters that implicate the privileges and immunities clause if it has a substantial reason for the discriminatory practice and that practice bears a substantial relationship to the state objectives.piper,at,at.
notably,the only circuit to consider an analogous provision found that the provision did violate the privileges and immunities clause.lee minner,cir.the third circuit in lee held that the provision in delaware freedom of information act violated the plaintiff fundamental right to engage in the political process with regard to matters of national importance on equal terms with state residents.id.at.though the court noted that delaware had a substantial interest in establishing and defining its own political community,it dismissed the state argument that the provision bore a substantial relationship to that interest,and held that denying noncitizens information did nothing to make the citizenry more cohesive.id.at.
the district court apparently gave little or no weight to our sister circuit rationale.rather,it interpreted our decision in as requiring a particularly high level of interference with a noncitizen common calling by the state to implicate the privileges and immunities clause.the district court also interpreted the supreme court decision in piper to mean that a state must burden the right with the aim of improving the competitive advantage of its citizens over noncitizens in order to violate the constitution.mcburney,dist.lexis,at.neither of these readings is correct.
in,we held that a maryland licensing regulation burdened the right to pursue a common calling and violated the privileges and immunities clause where it prohibited nonresident cab drivers from picking up fares in a specific county.at.at no point did we suggest that the state had to severely burden that right in order to implicate the constitutional protection instead we invalidated the regulation simply because it burdened the plaintiff right,without regard to the burden severity or degree.id.the extent of any burden might well be an appropriate consideration when analyzing whether the challenged action bears a substantial relationship to a state important interest,but generally is not relevant in deciding whether there is a burden in the first instance.after all,the framers did not view one state discrimination against another state citizens in isolation,but rather considered the prospect of other states responding with reciprocal and retaliatory burdens that,in the aggregate,could threaten the nation economic unity.see toomer,at.
likewise,nowhere in in any other case of which i am the supreme court limited application of the privileges and immunities clause to those instances in which a state passes a statute with the aim of improving the competitive advantage of its citizens over noncitizens.mcburney,dist.lexis,at.emphasis added.the court in piper did not find that new hampshire refused to license attorneys with the aim of benefiting resident lawyers,but rather found that it impermissibly burdened nonresidents right to pursue their common calling even assuming the state aim was unrelated to any desire to regulate economic competition.see at.again,the state goal is surely relevant when determining whether any burden on nonresidents pursuit of a common calling is justified by the state substantial interest,id.at,but is of no moment when determining whether the challenged statute burdens a fundamental right in the first instance.
appellant hurlbert operates a business in california that collects and synthesizes information for a particular audience and sells it for profit.he alleges that from time to time he seeks access to information contained in virginia official records as part of the services he provides to clients.and,as judge siler opinion quite correctly notes,he claims that virginia will continue to deny him access to much of this information while providing it to virginia residents.these allegations,if true,make out a classic claim under the privileges and immunities clause.
the ability to quickly and efficiently gather and disseminate information is central to a great deal of economic activity in our information age.the individual or business that can access relevant information quickest and most efficiently has a distinct advantage when competing in the advertising,technology,entertainment,and business arenas.a statute that discriminates against a nonresident ability to access information therefore implicates the right to pursue a common calling in the century in much the same way that it would if it burdened an angler ability to catch fish,see toomer,at,or a cabby ability to drive fares in the twentieth,see,at.because such a statute burdens a protected right,it is then incumbent upon the state to prove that the statute withstands heightened scrutiny.
the district court did not properly engage in this analysis below.in my view,it must do so on remand when fully considering the plaintiffs substantive legal claims and factual contentions in order to avoid committing reversible error.as nothing in judge siler opinion suggests otherwise,i join in that opinion.
i concur in the majority opinion except as to section iii b.i write separately as to that section because i do not find that roger hurlbert has adequately pled an ongoing injury sufficient to confer standing.accordingly,i respectfully dissent as to section iii b of the majority opinion and i would affirm the district court judgment with respect to hurlbert.
in june hurlbert made a telephone request pursuant to vfoia for real estate records in the possession of the director of the real estate assessment division of henrico county,virginia the director.when that request was denied,hurlbert filed suit against the director,who filed his answer to hurlbert initial complaint on february.by letter dated the next day,february,the director provided hurlbert with the requested data.
on march,the director filed a motion to dismiss hurlbert suit pursuant to rule c and rule h based,in part,on a l ack of j urisdiction.in the memorandum of law accompanying his motion,the director specifically argued that hurlbert lacked standing based on the incongruence between his allegations of past injury and his request for prospective relief it is clear from the record that,at least by march,hurlbert was aware that his standing was at issue.despite this knowledge,the plaintiffs,including hurlbert,filed an amended complaint on march,that did not materially alter hurlbert allegations and,indeed,repeated them almost verbatim.the specific allegations in the amended complaint pertaining to hurlbert are as follows 
plaintiff roger hurlbert is the sole proprietor of sage information services.hurlbert is in the business of obtaining real estate tax assessment records.hurlbert obtains these records by submitting foia requests to state governmental agencies.
hurlbert submitted a foia request to the henrico county real estate assessor office pursuant to virginia code.the request was made by telephone on june.in that telephone conversation,an official from the assessor office denied hurlbert foia request.the only reason the official gave for denying the request was that hurlbert is not a citizen of virginia.
a state law that denies the right to pursue their common calling violates article iv privileges and immunities clause.the henrico county assessor office denied hurlbert access to public records based on the provision in virginia code.section makes it impossible for hurlbert to pursue his common calling by obtaining virginia public records through virginia foia on an equal basis with virginia citizens.this discrimination contravenes the privileges and immunities clause.
the final paragraph of the amended complaint contains a vague general statement alleging irreparable harm 
deprivation of a constitutional right constitutes irreparable harm.the provision in virginia code denies the plaintiffs access to information.as a result,the provision bars the plaintiffs from participating in a range of economic,political,and social activities 
the director argues that hurlbert lacks standing because hurlbert alleged only one discrete instance where his alleged constitutional rights were violated.br.of appellee at.in other words,the director asserts there is a fatal variance between the past injury alleged and the prospective remedies sought.i agree.
it is elementary that the burden is on the party asserting jurisdiction to demonstrate that jurisdiction does,in fact,exist.lovern edwards,cir adams bain,cir the burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction on a motion to dismiss is on the plaintiff,the party asserting jurisdiction.
in this case,the director challenged hurlbert standing by filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c.w e review the district court dismissal under rule c de novo and in doing so apply the standard for a rule b motion.edwards city of goldsboro,cir.the purpose of a rule b motion is to test the sufficiency of a complaint importantly,a rule b motion does not resolve contests surrounding the facts,the merits of a claim,or the applicability of defenses.id.quoting republican party martin,cir alteration in original.
clearly,by moving for judgment on the pleadings,the director motion to dismiss was designed to test the sufficiency of hurlbert allegations as a basis for subject matter jurisdiction.in his memorandum of law submitted to the district court the director argued that 
hurlbert complaint does not allege that denial of the data caused him any particularized harm,nor has he requested monetary damages.more tellingly,hurlbert has also failed to allege that he intends to make a similar request of davis in the future or is otherwise likely to again be denied public records by davis or the county of henrico real estate assessment division.
dist.docket at.the director did not challenge the veracity of the facts pled and,indeed,had already admitted in his answer to the initial complaint that his office had received a written request from hurlbert seeking records pursuant to vfoia.
on appeal,hurlbert first puts forth a procedural argument,claiming t he district court erred when it confined its standing inquiry to the amended complaint alone br.of appellant at.specifically,hurlbert avers that the district court should have considered his declaration,filed after his initial complaint,in which he stated that after the director denied his request for data,he was dissuaded from making any further foia requests in henrico county.however,the district court was not obligated to go beyond the pleadings in resolving the director motion to dismiss.
hurlbert cites warth seldin,in support of his position that the district court was required to consider materials outside the pleadings in adjudicating the motion to dismiss.warth stands only for the proposition,clearly in accord with our precedent,that a district court may,but is not required,to consider such materials.see warth,at explaining that while both the trial and reviewing courts must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint,it is within the trial court power to allow or to require the plaintiff to supply,by amendment to the complaint or by affidavits,further particularized allegations of fact deemed supportive of plaintiff standing.
hurlbert also relies on our statement in richmond,fredericksburg potomac united states,cir that i n determining whether jurisdiction exists,the district court is to regard the pleadings allegations as mere evidence on the issue,and may consider evidence outside the pleadings without converting the proceeding to one for summary judgment.at emphasis added.not only did that case also make the district court consideration of material permissive rather than mandatory,it also involved a motion under rule b which,unlike the rule c motion to dismiss filed in this case,is unaffected by rule d.rule d specifically addresses a district court consideration or exclusion of materials outside the pleadings 
for the first time on appeal,hurlbert argues in his reply brief that b y submitting materials with his motion,the director expanded the scope of the standing inquiry beyond the logical sufficiency of the complaint to include factual evidence bearing on the truth of hurlbert allegations.reply br.of appellant at.we need not address any such argument,however,as any argument raised for the first time in a reply brief has been abandoned.edwards,at see also ex rel.vuyyuru jadhav,cir citing yousefi ins,cir united states,cir.
in my view,hurlbert argument would have no merit in any event.a plain reading of the district court opinion reveals that it did not rely on materials submitted by either party in reaching its decision regarding hurlbert standing.therefore,rule d simply would not apply 
as is true of practice under rule b,it is that it is within the district court discretion whether to accept matter on a motion for judgment on the pleadings and treat it as one for summary judgment or to reject it and maintain the character of the motion as one under rule c.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.as the eleventh circuit has recently explained,a judge need not convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment as long as he or she does not consider matters outside the pleadings.harper lawrence county,cir.i agree with our sister circuit view that not considering such matters is the functional equivalent of excluding is no more formal step required.id.
for the reasons set forth above,the district court was not required to consider hurlbert declaration nor was it required to convert the proceeding to one for summary judgment.
to possess the constitutional component of standing,a party must meet three requirements 
the party has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.

of course,plaintiffs need not await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.blum yaretsky.instead,where a party seeks prospective relief,t he question becomes whether any perceived threat to the plaintiff is sufficiently real and immediate to show an existing controversy.see also lujan,at examining imminence of asserted injury city of los angeles lyons,examining likelihood that plaintiff would suffer future injury.
long beach area chamber of commerce city of long beach,cir.
to meet the injury in fact requirement,hurlbert bears the burden of proving an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at internal citations and quotations omitted.while hurlbert arguably pled a concrete and actual denial of his vfoia to confer standing at the time he filed suit,he did not plead any ongoing injury sufficient to maintain standing for declaratory and injunctive relief.
the allegations in paragraphs and of the amended complaint clearly indicate that hurlbert pled only that he suffered an alleged past injury as a result of the director denial of his june request.he pled no future harm that he might reasonably expect to suffer as a result of virginia residency requirement.even though hurlbert pled a past injury and knew that his standing had been challenged,he nonetheless filed an amended complaint that did not request compensatory damages for his losses arising out of the director june denial.instead,he sought a court order 
declaring that virginia code violates the privileges and immunities clause of article iv and the dormant commerce clause of the united states constitution 
enjoining the defendants from enforcing the provision of virginia code 
awarding the plaintiffs their costs and reasonable attorneys fees pursuant to b and 
granting the plaintiffs such other relief as the court may deem just and proper.
the district court was therefore confronted,incongruously,with pleadings that sought prospective declaratory and injunctive relief based only on a single past and since remedied harm.as a result,i would find the district court correctly determined that hurlbert has not adequately pled an ongoing injury,but bases his claims solely on not receiving the documents he requested in june.
although hurlbert failure to plead an ongoing injury in fact is,in and of itself,fatal to his standing,his pleadings also fail to establish the element of redressability.as the district court explained 
if hurlbert had alleg
