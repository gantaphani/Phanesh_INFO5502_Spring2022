petitioner john smith seeks review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings so that he could apply for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.in his motion,smith cited changed country conditions and new evidence that was unavailable to him during the proceedings on his initial application for adjustment of status.because we conclude that the bia committed errors of law in deciding that smith had not shown changed country conditions or made a prima facie case for relief,thereby abusing its discretion,we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the evidence presented by smith is fairly summarized as follows.smith was born in zimbabwe.he is from a large family and his parents worked.he became an active member of the zimbabwe national students union zinazu,an organization that was opposed to the zimbabwe african national union government then in power in zimbabwe.smith held a position in zinazu and also joined the zimbabwe unity movement,a political movement seeking to unseat in the general election.he had a leadership role in that organization.as a result of his political activities,smith was arrested and detained multiple times,first in the early,again a few years later,and finally a few years after that.on all three occasions,he was beaten severely and threatened with further harm to himself and his family.
after his last,most severe detention and beating,smith decided to leave zimbabwe in an act of.he entered the united states in the on a visa.he attended a college and then a university and earned a degree.smith worked for two years as an environmental design engineer before becoming a civil engineer with a firm in the united states,where he worked until several years ago.during those years,he continued to pursue his education.in,he earned a graduate degree from a university.from to,he again attended a university he had previously attended while he worked towards a second graduate degree.
adjustment of status 
in the late,smith married sarah jones,an american citizen,with whom he later had a son,also named john smith and jones sought to adjust his immigration status based on their marriage by filing an visa petition and applying for adjustment of smith immigration status.smith application for adjustment of status was initially denied when jones withdrew her support,but was reopened sometime in the early after jones filed another visa petition on smith behalf.smith second application was also denied in the,after a hearing before an immigration judge.although the immigration judge found smith to be credible and that his marriage was bona fide,she cited jones failure to appear in support of smith in refusing to adjust his status.the immigration judge granted smith voluntary departure with an alternate order of removal to zimbabwe.smith appeal of that decision was dismissed by the bia.in a brief opinion,the bia stated that the outcome was an understandable and appropriate exercise of the immigration judge discretion to deny adjustment of status.
motion to reopen 
in the late,more than a year after his appeal was dismissed,smith filed a pro se motion to reopen his removal proceedings with the bia so that he could apply for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.in the motion,smith stated that he feared being persecuted and tortured if returned to zimbabwe.that argument was based,in part,on his past persecution by the reigning regime.as required to excuse his failure to file a motion to reopen within the statutory window,see c ii,smith argued that in the time since the bia dismissed his appeal in the,conditions in zimbabwe had changed dramatically for the worse for those who,like him,had been active opponents of the or whose families had been labeled as opposition.
in support of his motion to reopen,smith submitted an affidavit describing his earlier persecution for his earlier activism against the.he also detailed more recent violence against his family in zimbabwe according to smith,his family has been harassed,intimidated,and physically attacked for allegedly sympathizing with neighboring white farmers.he described two violent attacks in the,one in which his father was attacked violently,and another in which a cousin who lived with close family was killed by the youth militia.in the late,the family was targeted once again for its political sympathies.the april elections in zimbabwe resulted in the withdrawal of the candidate of the opposition,movement for democratic change mdc,due to violence that made it impossible to conduct a free and fair election.according to smith,his family did not vote in the elections.nevertheless,shortly after the election,youth militia invaded smith parents home in retaliation for the heavy support the mdc received in the elections in the area where they lived.the family home was destroyed and his family members were attacked.another individual was killed.smith family members escaped to another country 
smith also submitted evidence that failed asylum seekers who were returned to zimbabwe were being subjected to harsh interrogation by the government central intelligence organization cio.he included a judicial opinion from the united kingdom in which the court concluded,based on extensive testimony,that because failed asylum applicants are not channeled to the immigration authorities,but are instead immediately screened and interrogated by the central intelligence arm,they face a heightened risk of physical violence.the court made this finding after hearing credible testimony that beatings are a systemic feature of a cio investigation,particularly for opponents of the.
finally,smith motion to reopen included country reports and other documents showing that both government and organization observers agreed that human rights abuses by the were worsening in zimbabwe.for example,a state department country report on human rights practices in zimbabwe shows,among other things,that torture in zimbabwe increased almost threefold between and from incidents to incidents.the state department reports also describe a systematic campaign to dismantle the opposition party structures prior to the elections through violence directed at supporters,expulsion of villagers who supported the mdc,and withholding of food aid from mdc supporters.a report from human rights watch concluded,similarly,that v iolent repression of civil society activists by state authorities in zimbabwe continues to escalate.
c.the bia order 
the bia denied smith motion to reopen,concluding that it was not timely because it had not been filed within ninety days of the final decision on his application for adjustment of status,as required by c.although recognizing that there is an exception to the time limit for motions to reopen where an alien is seeking asylum and withholding of removal based on changed circumstances in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered,see c ii,the bia found that smith had not demonstrated that conditions have materially changed for him in zimbabwe.
the bia rejected smith claim that conditions in zimbabwe worsened for opposition supporters before and after the elections.the board found that e vidence that the has been abusing individuals who voted for the mdc in the april elections is immaterial to smith because he was not even present in zimbabwe during the elections and does not claim to have voted in them.the bia dismissed smith evidence of violence against his family,noting the mere fact that smith family was targeted standing alone,does not make a prima facie showing that the respondent himself may face persecution on account of a protected ground under the act or torture upon his repatriation.
similarly,the bia reasoned that evidence that abuse of opposition activists in zimbabwe has increased in the last few years,standing alone,does not reflect material sic changed country conditions for the respondent.the bia found that smith had not identified evidence that would indicate that conditions have deteriorated or otherwise changed for individuals like himself who were politically active in zimbabwe so long ago.
finally,the board rejected the evidence smith introduced showing that britain had granted asylum to a zimbabwean national because of the danger to rejected asylum seekers who are returned to zimbabwe.the bia called that information immaterial to the respondent because he would not be removed under that process.the bia asserted that smith claim was also speculative because united asylum proceedings are required by law to remain confidential.the bia noted that the fact that the government is suspicious of the united states does not necessarily mean that smith may face persecution and torture upon his removal.again,the bia found that standing alone,smith evidence was insufficient to make a prima facie showing that he may be subject to persecution if returned to zimbabwe 
smith filed this timely petition seeking review of the board denial of his motion to reopen.
the bia has jurisdiction over motions to reopen removal proceedings under a.we,in turn,have jurisdiction over smith petition for review under.see neves holder,cir finding that,under the supreme court recent decision in kucana holder,courts generally have jurisdiction to review the bia decision to grant or deny motions to reopen 
the scope of our review of the board order denying smith motion to reopen is limited.see ins doherty.the bia has broad discretion,conferred by the attorney general,to grant or deny a motion to reopen.kucana.at quoting a.we therefore review for abuse of discretion the bia denial of smith motion.fesseha ashcroft,cir.under the abuse of discretion standard,we uphold the agency subsidiary findings of fact as long as they are supported by substantial evidence,we review embedded legal conclusions de novo,and we review judgment calls for abuse of discretion.vaz dos reis holder,cir.a material error of law is an abuse of discretion.id.
this appeal turns on two related but distinct questions first,whether smith has presented sufficient evidence of changed country conditions to permit him to file a motion to reopen more than ninety days after the bia rejected his claims and second,whether the new evidence smith has presented,together with the evidence already in the record,shows that he has a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on his asylum,withholding of removal,or cat other words,whether he has presented a prima facie case for any of those types of relief.while the first question goes to smith procedural right to bring his motion to reopen,the second goes to the merits of his claim.we conclude that the decision of the bia,which answered both questions in the negative,was based on legal error thus,the bia abused its discretion.
there are both substantive and procedural bars to reopening removal proceedings.substantively,federal regulations create two threshold requirements for a motion to reopen that it establish a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought and that it introduce previously unavailable,material evidence.fesseha,at quoting ins abudu,see also c.the bia may deny a petition if it determines that the movant has failed to meet either of those requirements.in addition,the bia may leap ahead,as it were,over the two threshold concerns prima facie case and new explanation,and simply determine that even if they were met,the movant would not be entitled to the discretionary grant of relief.abudu,at.
procedurally,a petitioner is limited to a single motion to reopen a removal proceeding which must be submitted within ninety days of the rendition of the final administrative decision.raza gonzales,cir citing c.these limitations are relaxed only if a petitioner makes a convincing demonstration of changed conditions in his homeland.tandayu mukasey,cir quoting raza,at see also c ii.the change in conditions must be material to the underlying substantive relief that the alien is seeking and the evidence tendered in support thereof must have been unavailable during the prior proceedings.raza,at.
changed country conditions 
smith brought his motion to reopen more than ninety days after the board final administrative decision.because he missed the procedural window for filing his motion,smith must demonstrate changed conditions in his homeland that are material to his claim of eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.tandayu,at raza,at.his evidence of changed country conditions also must have been unavailable during the prior proceedings.raza,at.
as detailed above,to show changed country conditions,smith presented evidence that in the time since his hearing before the immigration judge and the bia rejection of his appeal human rights abuses,particularly directed at supporters of the opposition to the government,have,in smith words,gone from general but not systematic to general,pervasive and systematic.incidences of torture essentially tripled from to.in particular,the government targets those it suspects of supporting the opposition party.violence of that nature struck smith family at that time,when his cousin was murdered and his father was attacked violently,and again a few years later,when the family members were driven from their property in a ward that had heavily supported the opposition in the elections.
in its opinion,the bia did not dispute smith assessment of conditions in zimbabwe,which he supported with his own affidavit and reports from human rights organizations,the united states government,and the press.rather,the bia only explanation for its rejection of smith changed country conditions evidence was that neither the evidence of attacks against his family nor of increased violence against opposition activists indicate s that conditions have deteriorated or otherwise changed for individuals like smith who were politically active in zimbabwe so long ago or who were not even present in zimbabwe in april and did not vote in the elections that were held that year.in effect,the bia seems to conclude that smith had not made a showing of a material change in country conditions primarily because he was not in zimbabwe to experience the changed conditions that he describes.
this is an untenable construction of the changed country conditions requirement.by the bia logic,smith would need to show that he himself had been present in zimbabwe during the rise in persecution of opposition activists and the attacks against his family in order for those changes in country conditions to be considered material to him.in so holding,the bia essentially would require a petitioner who,by definition has not resided in a country during the relevant change in conditions,to show that he was present in the country,engaged in political activity there during the period of change,and experienced personally the violence endured by his family.such a rule of materiality is both logically unsound and incorrect as a matter of law,and we can find no support for such a rule in our case law.
to the contrary,numerous cases establish that a petitioner who had previously been politically active in his home country may successfully show that conditions have materially changed when an opposition political party comes to power and begins persecuting supporters of the petitioner party.see,shardar attorney general,cir finding materially changed country conditions for former local leader of a political party when the opposition party regained power and began abusing those holding the petitioner political opinions citing in re hossin,bia,unpublished habchy filip,cir finding bia erred in failing to consider materially changed country conditions for petitioner,a lebanese man who had years earlier been accused by hizballah of being an israeli collaborator,who submitted reports showing upswing in violence against supporters of israel by hizballah in lebanon kebe gonzales,cir holding that ethiopian who had been imprisoned and beaten because of his opposition political party affiliation while living in ethiopia had potentially demonstrated materially changed country conditions when he submitted human rights reports and news articles showing that violence against opposition groups had increased in ethiopia surrounding elections in larngar holder,cir finding that the rise to power in liberia of an enemy of the petitioner,a liberian man who had resided in the united states for almost thirty years,was a material change in country conditions 
the case law also shows that recent violence against a petitioner family members can constitute a material change in country conditions for a petitioner seeking to reopen his or her removal proceedings.for example,in malty ashcroft,cir,the ninth circuit found that a petitioner who submitted a declaration detailing six separate incidents of persecution of his family members in of which occurred subsequent to his asylum hearing had successfully shown a material change in country conditions.id.at.the court found not only that the beatings of his relatives constituted changed country conditions,but also that the petitioner had demonstrated a pattern and practice of persecutions by introducing evidence of beatings,arrests,and threats against his similarly situated family members.id.at see also ins,cir breyer,finding that petitioner evidence of the house arrest of her parents,the beating of her nephew,the seizure of the family bank account,and the persecution of petitioner tribe,social class,and political persuasion supported her asylum claim.
given the primary discernable basis for the bia rejection of smith changed country conditions violence against his family and the rise in persecution of opposition activists did not relate to him because he was not in the country to experience bia misapplied the standard of materiality in assessing smith evidence of a change in country conditions.c ii see also fergiste ins,cir finding error in the bia determination that general changes in conditions in a petitioner home country rebutted his presumptive fear of future persecution because the bia did not discuss how or whether petitioner particular situation may be affected by the changed country conditions that it recognized.in finding that smith evidence was not material to his own fear of future persecution,the bia abused its discretion 
prima facie showing 
in order to establish eligibility for asylum,one of the forms of underlying relief sought by smith,an applicant must demonstrate a fear of persecution on account of one of five enumerated grounds,namely,race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.raza,at quoting b i a the applicant may meet this burden either by proving past persecution,which gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution,or by showing that a the alien genuinely fears such persecution and b an objectively reasonable person in the alien circumstances would fear such persecution.holder,cir.
to make a prima facie case for asylum in the context of a motion to reopen,the applicant need only produce objective evidence showing a reasonable likelihood that he will face future persecution based on a statutory ground.larngar,at quoting sevoian ashcroft,cir.a reasonable likelihood means showing a realistic chance that the petitioner can at a later time establish that asylum should be granted.guo ashcroft,cir.to make a showing of either past persecution or a likelihood of future persecution,an applicant testimony,if credible,may be sufficient.fesseha,at citing a.
smith asserts that he is eligible for asylum because he has a fear of persecution based on his political affiliation.he argues that his past persecution at the hands of the contributes to his fear of future persecution.he also cites more recent events to support his claim that he will face persecution if returned.as described in detail earlier in this opinion,his prima facie case consists of evidence of his beatings by the when he was a student in zimbabwe,the recent escalation of violence against opposition activists,the recent violent persecution of smith family by the government,and the hostile treatment of failed asylum seekers when they are returned to zimbabwe,all of which combine to give him a fear of persecution if he is sent back to zimbabwe.
the bia gave two primary reasons for its determination that smith had not made a prima facie case for asylum.first,it found that evidence of smith past mistreatment does not warrant reopening because it could have been presented at the former hearing before the immigration judge.turning to smith new evidence showing the targeting of his family,the increase in abuse of opposition activists,and the interrogation and mistreatment of deportees,the bia found that each additional piece of evidence,standing alone,did not make a prima facie showing that the respondent himself may face persecution on account of a protected ground under the act.
there are two flaws in this reasoning.first,the bia evaluated each piece of evidence in isolation to determine if it alone was enough to establish a prima facie case.that is clearly error.the bia must consider the material evidence as a whole when assessing a petitioner prima facie showing,rather than taking each individual piece and looking at it standing alone.
second,the bia erred in refusing to consider smith claim of past persecution as part of his prima facie showing.on a motion to reopen,an alien must both introduce material,previously unavailable evidence and make a prima facie showing of eligibility for the underlying relief sought.c.these requirements do not mean,however,that the bia is limited to considering evidence that was unavailable at the prior hearing when it determines whether a petitioner has made a prima facie case for the relief sought.p rima facie scrutiny of a motion to reopen means an evaluation of the evidence that accompanies the motion as well as relevant evidence that may exist in the record of the prior hearing,in light of the applicable statutory requirements for relief.sevoian,at see also in re,bia june,en banc w e have been willing to reopen where the new facts alleged,when coupled with the facts already of record,satisfy us that it would be worthwhile to develop the issues further at a plenary hearing on reopening.quoting in re sipus,bia.because a petitioner filing a motion to reopen must produce new,material evidence,it follows that the prima facie showing will always include some new evidence.that showing does not,however,need to be made entirely through new evidence.instead,it may be based on the new evidence coupled with the facts already of record.in re,at.in other words,although previously available evidence of past persecution can not be the sole basis for reopening,it may be relevant to the petitioner prima facie case for asylum.norani gonzales,cir.
the principle that previously available evidence may be considered part of the prima facie showing on a motion to reopen applies with equal force to a petitioner like smith who seeks to reopen proceedings to make his first application for asylum although the record contains no evidence previously submitted in support of his asylum claim,prima facie scrutiny of his motion to reopen must nonetheless include an evaluation of all of the currently available evidence.norani,at e vents from a petitioner past are relevant to his present asylum application even though he previously did not apply for asylum based solely on these events.
in refusing to consider smith evidence of past persecution as part of his prima facie case,the bia conflated smith burden to make a prima facie showing of eligibility for relief with the requirement that he produce previously unavailable evidence in order to justify reopening.that conflation was erroneous.see abudu,at holding that it would be error for an appellate court to conflate the quite separate issues whether the alien has presented a prima facie case for asylum with whether the alien has offered previously unavailable,material evidence.
this circuit has not previously had occasion to enunciate this principle.we have indicated that the two burdens are separate.see,fesseha,at citing the two threshold requirements for a motion to reopen that it establish a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought and that it introduce previously unavailable,material evidence.i
