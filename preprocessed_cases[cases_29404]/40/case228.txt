plaintiff althea booker filed suit against her employer,the massachusetts department of public health the lemuel shattuck hospital,the executive office of health and human services,and certain individual defendants.a jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on booker claims of retaliation under federal and state law,see a.laws ch,and tortious interference with contractual employment relations.the court then denied booker motions.
on appeal,booker first contends that the court jury instruction on the meaning of a materially adverse action misstated the legal standard governing her retaliation claim.although we conclude that the adverse action instruction was problematic,we reject that claim of error.
booker also argues that the court erroneously refused to instruct the jury on the doctrine of spoliation.booker requested an instruction that the jury could draw an adverse inference based on the deletion of emails concerning booker by certain hospital employees.we conclude that booker failed to lay a proper evidentiary foundation for a spoliation instruction and therefore the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give it.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
booker,an woman,began working at the lemuel shattuck hospital the hospital as a telephone operator in the late.in,she was promoted to communications dispatcher ii.booker responsibilities in her new position included dispatching the hospital campus police officers and supervising the telephone operators,or communication dispatcher i,who staffed the communications department.the communications department performed functions such as screening and receiving incoming calls,transferring calls to other departments,receiving emergency calls from within the hospital,assisting with dispatching,and greeting visitors.
on september,booker met with shawn mcmullen,then her immediate supervisor,and edward nicosia,then the hospital deputy director of facilities management to express concern that she was receiving telephone calls from her staff while she was off duty.nicosia explained that under her collective bargaining agreement she was entitled to pay for calls received at home.later that day,nicosia and mcmullen circulated a memorandum to booker staff discouraging them from calling their supervisor at home except in emergency situations,and copied booker.
several months later,on december,booker a letter to nicosia complaining that the hospital had discriminated against her based on race by failing to compensate her for calls.in the letter,booker asserted that she was owed pay for calls she had received at home over the past two years,and that mcmullen,who is white,was receiving calls from booker staff that should have gone to her.she stated that the sole reason for this unequal treatment was race and that her letter represented a relatively whispering salvo in what could become a vigorous public challenge of rampant institutional racism at the hospital.
later that same day,booker confronted mcmullen in the campus police department,located in the hospital main lobby.in a raised voice,booker asked mcmullen why members of her staff were calling him after hours instead of her and whether the hospital had a policy of only paying white supervisors for calls.she asserted that this was racism and she would speak with a lawyer.in early january,nicosia and mcmullen had a meeting with booker to discuss the december incident.booker apologized for confronting mcmullen in such a public setting,but did not retract her complaints.ultimately,in late january,she was issued a written warning for her behavior.on february,booker filed the first of several administrative complaints with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging race discrimination and retaliation 
in the months that followed booker december letter of complaint,nicosia took several actions related to payroll and timekeeping procedures that displeased booker.in january,nicosia removed the communications logbook from booker desk and replaced it with a new logbook.members of the communications department used the log to record information such as shift assignments,staff absences,and phone calls to staff at home,and the logbook removed by nicosia contained entries related to booker claim for pay.the following month,booker and nicosia had a disagreement about allocation of personal time.noticing that booker had missed twelve hours of work but had not reported the absences on her timesheet,nicosia deducted twelve hours of her personal time.when booker discovered this deduction,she informed nicosia that she preferred to use a combination of sick time,vacation time,and leave without pay to cover the time off.although nicosia asked booker to make this correction by submitting a payroll adjustment form,she instead called the payroll department and had them make the change.after discovering that booker made the payroll change without the appropriate paperwork,nicosia submitted a payroll adjustment form again designating booker absences as personal time.booker complained,but nicosia refused to have her personal time returned.
finally,in february,nicosia learned that booker was logging her time in the communications log and reviewing her own timesheets as well as those of her staff.nicosia directed human resources to make changes so that booker was required to enter her time in the steward log and submit her weekly timesheets to her immediate supervisor for review.
changes were also made to booker job responsibilities over the period.in the fall of,richard wong joined the hospital as the director of safety and security and replaced mcmullen as booker immediate supervisor.sometime thereafter,wong hired additional police officers and informed booker that whenever at least five officers were on duty,an officer would perform dispatching duties.booker continued to fill in as a dispatcher on an basis,around four or five times per month,but it was no longer a regular part of her job duties.wong also requested that booker get trained to perform mailroom duties,which consisted of sorting incoming mail in the morning and metering outgoing mail in the afternoon,so that she could cover the mailroom on occasion.other employees,including wong,covered the mailroom when the regular mailroom clerk was out,and the job description for booker position,communications dispatcher ii,listed sorting and delivering mail as one of her job responsibilities.however,booker refused the mailroom training and resisted performing mailroom duties,viewing them as less prestigious than her other duties.as a result,she rarely covered the mailroom,filling in there for the first time on december.
finally,in june,booker was suspended for one day without pay following a confrontation with a campus police officer.the officer,hurrying to get to an assigned location at the hospital on time,exchanged his radio for the radio on booker desk,which had a belt clip.raising her voice,she chastised him for taking her radio and called him derogatory names.people passing through the busy hospital lobby observed the incident.
in october,booker filed this action in federal district court against the massachusetts department of public health dph,the executive office of health and human services eohhs,and four individual defendants,including nicosia booker alleged,inter alia,that defendants retaliated against her for complaining about discriminatory withholding of callback pay and for filing complaints with the mcad and that the individual defendants intentionally interfered with her contractual employment relationships.following pretrial dispositions not at issue in this appeal booker proceeded to trial on her retaliation claims against dph,eohhs and nicosia hereafter,defendants,and her tortious interference claim against nicosia.
at trial,the court instructed the jury as to the actions that booker maintained were retaliatory 
t he written warning issued in january of the removal of the communications logbook from the desk where she worked the february incident involving nicosia reduction of her personal time for an unreported absence the requirement that she sign for her time on the stewards log rather than the communication dispatchers log the reduction in her police dispatching duties her assignment to mailroom duties and training,and her suspension in june of.
after a trial,the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants on all claims.the district court denied booker motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial.on appeal,booker contends,as she did in her motion for a new trial,that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the required showing of a materially adverse action for purposes of her retaliation claim,and the court erred in refusing to give a spoliation jury instruction.we address each contention in turn.
retaliation jury instruction 
at trial,the district court instructed the jury on the requisite showing of a materially adverse action under title vii 
under federal and state law,booker must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the desire to retaliate because of her complaints of discrimination was a motivating and determinative factor in any decision to alter booker terms and conditions of employment in a materially adverse manner 
an employment action to be adverse must materially change the terms and conditions of the plaintiff employment.examples the law gives include demotions,disadvantageous transfers or assignments,the loss of promotions,unwarranted negative evaluations,toleration of harassing conduct by,and reprisals intended to discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful practices or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other employees looking at them reasonably.
emphasis added.
booker contends on appeal that this instruction misstated the legal standard applicable to her retaliation claim as set forth in burlington northern santa fe railway white.first,she contends that the instruction erroneously required a showing that an adverse action affect the terms and conditions of her employment.second,she argues that the final phrase in the exemplary list of adverse actions,beginning with and reprisals,improperly required her to demonstrate that the reprisals be intended to discourage,or reasonably be perceived as intended to discourage,employee complaints.

in this case,the court discussed its tentative jury instructions with the parties at a sidebar conference held before the jury was charged the court stated that it planned to add,at the end of the adverse action instruction,the phrase reprisals intended to discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful practices.booker counsel objected,stating 
i am concerned that,as i heard the instruction,that the employer intended to deter other employees,i do think it necessary that he intended to deter,so long as it was reasonably foreseeable that it would deter.in other words,i do believe there is an intention requirement as to the deterrence.it only that it be a deterrent.he must intend to retaliate but the effect must,in effect,deter a reasonable employee,not that he intended to deter others 
the burlington court,talked about and used language,an adverse action consists of any action that may dissuade a reason able employee from engaging in protected activity.
in response,the court noted that it might add,or reasonably would have been perceived by the employe e,but i just do want to turn this into a tort.booker counsel did not voice any further objection.the court gave the modified instruction to the jury,stating that examples of adverse actions include reprisals intended to discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful practices or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other employees looking at them reasonably.emphasis added.the court held a sidebar conference after the charge,inviting any new objections,but booker counsel raised no objection to the instruction as given.
as this account makes clear,booker never objected in the district court on the first ground she presses on the instruction improperly stated that an adverse action must materially change the terms and conditions of the plaintiff employment.that objection is therefore forfeited.see boston gas century indem,cir holding that objection was forfeited where party made an objection to court proposed instruction,but on grounds unrelated to the aspect it criticized on appeal.
booker did object at the precharge conference on the ground that the tentative instruction improperly required that a materially adverse action be intended to discourage employee complaints.however,the court then proposed adding instructional language to address booker concern,and booker did not object after being apprised of the court proposed modification or after hearing the modified instruction given to the jury.the purpose of a sidebar objection is to inform the judge exactly what he got wrong and what he should do to remedy the incipient harm.decaro,at.by failing to object to the modified instruction either before or after the charge,booker failed to inform the court that she believed the instruction was still problematic,specify the grounds for her objection,or give the court an opportunity to correct any error.therefore,this objection is also forfeited.see,kirk reed tool,app x,cir per curiam unpublished w hile plaintiff may have objected to the original jury charge,he did not object to the supplemental charge.therefore,our review is only for plain error.cooney booth,app x,cir unpublished reviewing instruction for plain error because absent a specific objection following the actual charge,the court had no way of knowing that its efforts to accommodate the general objection made at the precharge conference had not been wholly successful 
noting that rule was amended effective december,booker argues that her objections were properly preserved under the amended rule.we have acknowledged that the amendments to rule made changes to the procedure for lodging objections.under the former version of the rule,objections were not preserved unless they were taken at sidebar after the trial judge had charged the jury.surprenant,at emphasis added.thus,even if a party properly objected to a proposed instruction prior to the jury charge and the court then gave the challenged instruction,that objection was forfeited unless the party renewed the objection after the jury charge.see,mcgrath spirito,cir.we have also noted that the amendments were designed in part to ease the burden on parties in preserving their objections to instructions where the district court had already made a definitive ruling,on the record,rejecting a request for a particular instruction.sears roebuck de puerto rico,f d,cir.however,the amendments do not assist booker here.nothing in the amended rule suggests that a party may preserve a claim of error by objecting to a tentative instruction at the precharge conference,but then failing to object after the instruction is modified to accommodate the initial objection 
therefore,we review the legal standards stated in the jury instructions only for plain error.in doing so,we bear two precepts in mind.the first is that the district court has wide discretion over the particular words it chooses to convey those standards.see johnson spencer press of,cir interstate litho brown,cir.the second is that jury instructions must be viewed as a whole.see hopkins jordan marine,cir.
in order to make out her retaliation claim under title vii,booker had to show that she engaged in protected activity she suffered some materially adverse action and the adverse action was causally linked to her protected activity.dixon int l of police officers,cir.in burlington,the court clarified the legal standard for the required showing of an adverse action under title vii antiretaliation provision.burlington first addressed the question of whether the antiretaliation provision forbids only those employer actions and resulting harms that are related to employment or the workplace.at.recognizing that an employer can effectively retaliate against an employee through actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm outside the workplace,the court held that title vii antiretaliation provision,unlike the statute substantive antidiscrimination provision,is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment.id.at.
the court next addressed the question of how harmful an act of retaliatory discrimination must be in order to fall within the provision scope.id.at.the court held that the antiretaliation provision covers those employer actions that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee,that is,actions that are harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.id.at.thus,whether an action is materially adverse is judged by an objective rather than a subjective standard.id.at.
instruction language regarding reprisals intended to discourage employees or reasonably perceived in that way 
relying on burlington,booker primarily challenges the final clause of the adverse action instruction,reprisals intended to discourage other employees from complaining about unlawful practices or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other employees looking at them reasonably.
booker claims that the first clause reprisals intended to discourage other employees erroneously conflated the adverse action element of a title vii claim,which she says does not look to the employer intent,with the retaliation element,which considers the employer retaliatory motive.she concludes that the instruction imposed a higher burden of proof on the adverse action element by requiring her to show that her employer intent was to discourage other employees complaints.burlington,booker says,only required her to show that the employer actions might dissuade a reasonable employee from complaining of discrimination.
while the language in this phrase of the instruction was awkward and created numerous potential issues,including some not raised by booker we can not say that the instruction on adverse action was error.when evaluating claims of error in jury instructions,our task is not to parse particular phrases,but to look at the instructions as a whole in light of the relevant standard of review.taken together,the adverse action instructions were not so clearly divergent from the burlington standard as to constitute plain error.
the challenged portion of the instruction was part of a longer sentence listing examples of materially adverse actions it was not the lone basis given to the jury to understand the legal definition of an adverse action.whatever objection there might be to the challenged phrase of the reprisals portion of the instruction,the instruction was saved by the alternative formulation at the end of the sentence or reprisals that might be perceived in that way by other employees looking at them reasonably.
given its placement,the likely reading of the final phrase and the meaning ascribed to it by the district court was that it referred to reprisals that might be perceived in that way that is,as discouraging complaints about unlawful practices by other employees looking at them reasonably.
that interpretation accurately captures the burlington standard it conveys that the standard is an objective one,based on the vantage of a reasonable employee,and that the critical inquiry is whether the reprisals might deter a reasonable employee from complaining of discrimination.that interpretation is also reinforced by the context of this phrase in relation to the rest of the jury instructions it immediately preceded a paragraph further explaining to the jury that adverse actions did not include things like hurt feelings and subjective disappointments that might dissuade a employee but would not deter a reasonable employee.viewed as a whole,the adverse action instruction was not plainly erroneous.we do,though,recommend that instructions on retaliation hew more closely to burlington and dixon.
instruction language that employment action to be adverse must change the terms and conditions of employment 
booker also contends that the adverse action instruction erroneously stated that an adverse action must change the terms and conditions of the plaintiff employment.however,while booker correctly notes that the antiretaliation provision of title vii is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment,burlington,at,the district court was entitled to tailor its instruction to the evidence presented at trial.each of the allegedly retaliatory acts against booker,including written warnings,personal time allocation,modifications in payroll procedures,changes or reductions in job duties,and suspension without pay,were related to her employment and occurred at the workplace.burlington,at citing examples of actionable retaliation causing harm outside the workplace,including fbi refusal to investigate death threats against employee and employer filing of false criminal charges against former employee.on the facts of this case,the court properly confined its instruction to actions.therefore,we can not say that this portion of the instruction was erroneous.
spoliation jury instruction 
booker next contends that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jurors that they could draw an adverse inference if they found that defendants destroyed documents relevant to booker claims.
evidence and requested instruction on spoliation 
at trial,booker three hospital employees about their deletion of email correspondence concerning booker.wong,who became booker immediate supervisor in the fall of,testified that shortly after he began working at the hospital,he was informed that booker had filed an administrative complaint against the hospital and that it was possible he could become a defendant,although he did not know the subject matter of her claims.wong further testified that he regularly deleted all of the emails in his sent and deleted email folders every thirty days,and did not do anything in particular to preserve emails concerning booker.paul romary,the hospital executive director,testified that he received a copy of booker december letter of complaint.he explained that he received a hundred emails a day,some of which he deleted,and made no special effort to preserve his emails concerning booker.barbara mclaughlin,an executive vice president of the hospital and wong supervisor beginning in december,testified that she never deleted any emails concerning booker.
prior to trial,booker submitted a proposed jury instruction on the spoliation of evidence
