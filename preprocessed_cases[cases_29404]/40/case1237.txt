since,the city of scranton,pennsylvania,has maintained an ordinance requiring city employees to reside within the city.in,a group of police officers sought to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional.the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania dismissed the suit and we affirmed.after an investigation in,the city terminated four of these officers,as well as a police mechanic,who was not a party to the suit,for failing to comply with the ordinance.the terminated officers brought a new suit,alleging that the city had infringed their first amendment freedom to petition the government and had violated their right to equal protection of the laws by enforcing the ordinance against them in retaliation for their participation in the suit.the mechanic also brought suit,alleging that he was terminated in retaliation for complaining about the condition of the department of public works garage.three of the four officers cases were consolidated for purposes with the mechanic case.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city on the three officers claims but allowed the mechanic claims to proceed to trial 
we conclude that the district court should not have granted summary judgment on the police officers retaliation claim.the officers presented enough evidence to raise a dispute of material fact as to whether the city impermissibly targeted the plaintiffs.first and foremost,the officers presented evidence that other city employees,who were not parties to the suit,were permitted to keep their jobs despite the city knowledge that they were not city residents.further,it is undisputed that,prior to the officers terminations in,no city employee had ever been fired for with the residency ordinance.
we further hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion or otherwise err in denying officer hickey leave to amend his complaint to add a due process claim that his municipal service commission hearing has been unreasonably delayed.we also reject the officers contention that the district court improperly and unnecessarily entered a final judgment on january.finally,we reject without substantive discussion all of the remaining issues raised in these appeals 
facts and procedural history 
in,a group of scranton police officers filed a complaint alleging that the city residency ordinance was unconstitutional on its face and as applied.with certain exceptions,the ordinance requires all city employees to maintain a residence within the corporate limits of scranton during their time of employment.see scranton,file of the council,the district court dismissed the complaint in december of.the court rejected the officers facial due process and equal protection challenges to the ordinance,holding,among other things,that the ordinance was rationally related to one or more legitimate government purposes and that the term residence is not unconstitutionally vague because it is synonymous with legal domicile,a legal concept the district court also held that the officers and procedural due process challenges were not ripe for adjudication.the officers alleged that,despite the ordinance general applicability,only police officers had received threats of impending enforcement and requests for documents establishing residency.however,the district court reasoned that none of these claims were ripe because the city had not yet formally enforced the ordinance against any employee or group of employees,nor had the officers alleged that waivers had been granted in an arbitrary or discretionary manner.we affirmed in an unpublished decision.kreischer city of scranton,wl cir.june.
in late december,shortly after the district court dismissed the police officers challenge,the city controller issued a memorandum to all city employees requesting documentation and affidavits verifying each employee residency in october,several months after we had affirmed the dismissal,the city and the police union agreed to incorporate the residency ordinance into the new collective bargaining agreement cba,which was ratified later that month.the cba specified that the term bona fide residence means sole legal residence or domicile.it also provided for a grace period for all police officers to come into compliance.while the precise language varied,the residency ordinance was also incorporated into other collective bargaining agreements between the city and other unions representing city employees.
in may,the city hired a private investigation firm to investigate certain employees who were suspected of living outside the city.the city initially sent a list of eight names to the investigator,seven of whom were police officers who had sued the city in and one of whom was a firefighter.ultimately,between and,the city investigated about individuals but only terminated five donald hickey,phyllis hill,paul graham,jason gnall,and robert murray.hickey,hill,graham,and gnall were police officers involved in the suit against the city.all were offered hearings with the mayor.hickey and gnall sought hearings before the municipal service commission of the city of scranton but as of early had yet to receive their hearings.
in april,hickey,hill,graham,and murray brought this suit under against the city of scranton and mayor james connors hereinafter the city,alleging among other things that the city selectively enforced the residency ordinance against them in retaliation for exercising their first amendment rights hickey,hill,and graham alleged that the city retaliated against them for suing the city in,while murray alleged that the city terminated him for complaining about the condition of the department of public works garage.in july the district court consolidated these cases for all pretrial purposes.in july,the parties filed for summary judgment.in hickey brief opposing the city motion for summary judgment,he argued for the first time that the lengthy delay in his municipal service hearing violated his right to procedural due process.in september,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city against hickey,hill,and graham but denied summary judgment with respect to murray claims.the court denied the plaintiffs motions for summary judgment.the court treated hickey new argument concerning hearing delay as a constructive motion to amend his complaint and gave the parties additional time to brief the issue whether leave to amend should be granted.in october,the court denied leave to amend after finding that the amendment would be futile and would be made in bad faith.hill and graham appealed the september order and hickey appealed both the september and october orders 
in november the city filed a motion for partial final judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted this motion over the plaintiffs opposition,reasoning that a final judgment under rule b was necessary to terminate hickey,hill,and graham claims because the september order was not final as to murray claims.hill,hickey,and graham appealed this decision as well.we consolidated all of the appeals for purposes of oral argument and resolve all of them in this opinion.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs federal claims and pendent state claims under and,respectively.we have appellate jurisdiction to review the district court final decisions pursuant to.as noted,this case involves consolidated appeals.because the officers appeal of the district court january rule b order implicates our jurisdiction over the officers other appeals we consider it in this section.
federal rule of civil procedure b provides a mechanism for rendering a partial final judgment as to some,but not all,parties or claims in a single action see berckeley inv.group,colkitt,cir.without a valid rule b order,we do not ordinarily have appellate jurisdiction over a district court order that resolves fewer than all the claims of all the parties in a single action because such orders do not constitute final decisions per.id.as explained below,we hold that the district court properly directed entry of partial final judgment in this case.accordingly,we have jurisdiction over all of the consolidated appeals.
the officers claim that rule b is not applicable here because the three cases brought by the officers and robert murray case had been consolidated only for discovery purposes.according to the officers,therefore,the september and october orders terminated three of these four cases and the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter a separate final judgment in these cases in january.however,the officers argument depends on what appears to be a deliberate misreading of the record.in july the district court ordered that the four cases shall be consolidated for all pretrial proceedings,with a determination to be made at the final pretrial conference as to whether there will be more than one trial.emphasis added.the court further provided that all four cases are consolidated into as the surviving case.thus,the four cases were not consolidated only for discovery were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings,including summary judgment proceedings.thus,as the city correctly argues,a partial final judgment under rule b was necessary to terminate hickey,hill,and graham claims because the september order granting summary judgment to the city was not final as to murray claims.if the district court had not entered partial final judgment pursuant to rule b in january,we would not have had jurisdiction over the officers appeals of the september and october orders.see berckeley inv.group,at see also in re unisys.retiree med.benefit erisa,cir.we affirm the district court decision to enter partial final judgment in january.

iv.discussion 
a.the officers first amendment and equal protection claims 
the officers allege that the city terminated them not because they failed to comply with the residency ordinance but because they exercised their first amendment right to petition the government by suing the city in.we follow a test to evaluate a public employee claim of retaliation for engaging in activity protected under the first amendment.see baldassare state of new jersey,cir san filippo bongiovanni,cir holder city of allentown,cir.first,the employee must show that the activity is in fact protected.pickering bd.of,d.second,the employee must show that the protected activity was a substantial factor in the alleged retaliatory action.healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.third,the employer may defeat the employee claim by demonstrating that the same adverse action would have taken place in the absence of the protected conduct.id.
the officers further allege that the city violated their right to equal protection of the laws under the fourteenth amendment by selectively enforcing the ordinance against them while failing to terminate other similarly situated city employees who did not bring suit in.as noted above,we affirmed the district court dismissal of the claim that the residency ordinance violated the equal protection clause on its face.however,discriminatory enforcement of a facially valid law is also unconstitutional under the equal protection clause.yick wo hopkins.holder,at applying yick wo to a claim of discriminatory enforcement of a residency ordinance.to establish their selective enforcement claim,the officers must demonstrate that other similarly situated employees were not terminated despite their with the ordinance and that this selective treatment was based on an unjustifiable standard,such as race,or religion,or some other arbitrary factor,or to prevent the exercise of a fundamental right.holder,at citing united states schoolcraft,cir internal quotations omitted.here,the officers seek to demonstrate that the city singled them out for exercising their fundamental first amendment right to petition the government when they brought suit against the city in.
the officers first amendment and equal protection claims are functionally identical and it would be redundant to treat them separately as a leading treatise explains,i t is generally unnecessary to analyze laws which burden the exercise of first amendment rights by a class of persons under the equal protection guarantee,because the substantive guarantees of the amendment serve as the strongest protection against the limitation of these rights.ronald rotunda john nowak,treatise on constitutional law substance and procedure,at ed.if a law passes muster under the first amendment it is also likely to be upheld under the equal protection clause.id.likewise,if a law violates first amendment rights there is no need to resort to the equal protection clause to redress the constitutional violation.see also sherbert verner,d no need to examine equal protection claim based on denial of unemployment benefits to individuals whose religious principles prohibit saturday work where court held same practice unconstitutional under free exercise clause.we will examine the officers first amendment retaliation claim directly rather than as a component of their derivative equal protection claim 
the first the relevant activity is protected under the first not contested here.in this circuit,any lawsuit brought by an employee against a public employer qualifies as a protected petition under the first amendment so long as it is not sham litigation.san filippo,at.the city does not argue that the police officers suit against the city was a sham.as for the second and third prongs,we will consider them together because we conclude that the same evidence is sufficient to defeat the city summary judgment motion with respect to each prong see san filippo,at,holding that evidence supporting professor claim that his protected activities were a substantial factor in his termination also rebutted employer claim that the professor would have been terminated regardless of his protected activities.
we reject the officers contention that courts may never grant summary judgment on either the second or third steps of this analysis.although we have often noted that the first prong of the first amendment retaliation test presents questions of law for the court while the second and third prongs present questions of fact for the jury,curinga city of clairton,cir citing baldassare,at,only genuine questions of fact should be determined by the jury.for example,in ambrose township of robinson,cir,we held that judgment as a matter of law under rule b should have been granted to the defendant where the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence that his protected activity was a substantial factor in his suspension.the same principle applies in the summary judgment context under rule,watters city of philadelphia,cir noting district court concluded that plaintiff made sufficient showing that speech was substantial factor motivating termination to submit question to jury.
in this case,the officers satisfied their evidentiary burden on the substantial factor prong and sufficiently rebutted the city evidence that they would have been terminated anyway.the officers strongest evidence suggests that several employees who did not participate in the lawsuit were not terminated despite the city knowledge or unrebutted suspicions that they lived outside the city.
the district court in its opinion gives an example of such an employee.after holding that the officers could not substantiate their claim that similarly situated employees were allowed to keep their jobs,the court held that robert murray had successfully done so.murray alleged that his neighbor robert warner,a firefighter for the city,was not terminated even though they both lived outside the city.the court found that whether warner actually lived outside the city and whether the city knew of warner possible were genuine issues of fact for the jury.the court then determined,however,that neither warner nor any other officer could be similarly situated to the police officer plaintiffs because the language defining residence in the police cba made the cba more strict than the residency ordinance itself.the court also found that the city terminated the police officers because of their with the cba,not because of their with the residency ordinance.we conclude,however,that the court erred in reaching both conclusions.
first,based on the record on appeal,all city employees subject to the residency ordinance are similarly situated for purposes of the first amendment analysis.the ordinance requires all city employees to establish a residence in the city of scranton,but does not define the term.the police cba explicitly defines residence to mean sole legal residence or domicile.however,the police cba does not purport to alter or augment the residency ordinance by providing this definition.in fact,the police cba definition of residence appears to be lifted directly from city of meadville,firemen civil service commission neff,a pennsylvania commonwealth court decision construing a municipal residency ordinance,reference to a bona fide residence in a municipal ordinance establishing a residency requirement for municipal employees means the sole legal residence or domicile of the employee.citation omitted,emphasis added.see also mccarthy phila.civil serv.comm n,aff,d holding that bona fide residence in municipal residency ordinance means domicile,and further explaining that a person can have more than one residence but only one domicile.thus,the residency requirement in the police cba is not more strict than the is exactly the same for that reason,the court erred in holding that other city employees were not similarly situated to the officers simply because they were not subject to the police cba 
second,the district court erred by finding that the officers were terminated because of their failure to comply with the police cba rather than their failure to comply with the ordinance.as just explained,there is no difference between the residency requirements imposed by the police cba and the ordinance.the distinction made by the district court could still be relevant,however,to the extent it reflects the city subjective intent.for example,the city might argue that it only investigated and terminated employees whose unions had agreed to include the residency ordinance in their cba.this would supply a explanation for any evidence that certain employees were not terminated if those employees unions had not agreed to such inclusion.
under the facts before the court,however,the question whether the city was willing to enforce the residency ordinance without the supplemental authority of a collective bargaining agreement is a genuine factual issue that the district court should not have resolved at the summary judgment stage.in late may,the city sent letters to eleven police officers and two firefighters threatening immediate termination if the recipients failed to provide updated documents and affidavits establishing their residency in the city.these letters referred to both the residency ordinance and the relevant cba incorporating that ordinance however,the letters issued to hill,hickey,and graham cite only the residency ordinance.further,other evidence in the record suggests that the city was willing to rely solely on the residency ordinance.for example,in,long before the ordinance had been incorporated into any cba,the city controller issued a request for documentation of residency that threatened termination for.
in addition to robert warner,the officers provided evidence that at least three other city police officers who did not sue the city in allowed to remain employed despite the city knowledge or suspicions that they were not in compliance with the residency ordinance in june,ray mountford,the lead private investigator working on the residency investigation for the city,was asked to investigate police officers donald pettinato and anthony gillette.just after the investigation of pettinato got underway,however,mountford was told by the city that pettinato lived in old forge,pennsylvania,that he was not moving back to the city,and that the investigation should be discontinued.mountford also testified that his associate determined based on surveillance and public records that gillette lived in jessup,pennsylvania.mountford notes from july,indicate that the city had decided to set hearings for pettinato,gillette,and paul graham,one of the appellants in this case.however,of these three only graham was terminated for with the residency ordinance and it appears that no hearings ever took place with respect to pettinato and gillette 
the officers also showed that the city suspected police officer patrick tobin of residing outside the city but may have called off the investigation without adequately rebutting those suspicions.in june,the city asked the private investigators to investigate tobin,but mountford and his associate were never able to determine tobin residence despite multiple days of surveillance over the course of four months city records custodian conall kolleen later averred that tobin now resides at a specific address in scranton.however,the investigators conducted surveillance on this mountford identified as tobin could not determine whether tobin resided there.
for all the above reasons,the district court conclusion that the plaintiff police officers were the only ones that did not come into compliance with the terms of their cba was an improper resolution of a genuine factual dispute.
the officers further contend that they were actually in compliance with the residency ordinance.the officers certainly do not need to allege or prove compliance with the ordinance to prevail on their first amendment claim.discriminatory enforcement of a statute or ordinance is not justified simply because the enforcement is otherwise valid.see desi pizza,city of,cir.evidence of the officers compliance with the ordinance would nonetheless be powerful evidence that their termination was.on this record,no reasonable could conclude that either hill or hickey came into compliance with the ordinance within the time provided by the city 
graham,however,should be permitted to argue his case for compliance to the jury.as discussed above,a scranton employee residence is his domicile.in pennsylvania t he domicile of a person is the place where he has voluntarily fixed his habitation with a present intention to make it either his permanent home or his home for the indefinite future.in re mckinley estate.a new domicile can be acquired only by physical presence at a new residence plus intent to make that new residence the principal home.in re prendergast.graham has established that he became domiciled in scranton shortly after he was hired as a police officer in.it is the city burden to demonstrate that graham changed his domicile to nicholson,pennsylvania,when he in see in re prendergast,at noting that the burden of showing changed domicile rests upon whomever makes the allegation.
the city has introduced more than enough evidence to meet its burden.first and foremost,the city has shown that graham second wife and were domiciled in nicholson during all times relevant to this dispute.the location of an individual family is very strong evidence of the location of his domicile.indeed,the pennsylvania supreme court has defined domicile as the place at which an individual has fixed his family home and principal establishment for an indefinite period of time.in re prendergast,at citing in re dorrance estate,see also in re nomination petitions of mcintyre.the city also provided other evidence of changed domicile,including mountford testimony that graham scranton apartment was just a mail drop being used by both graham and hill in an attempt to achieve technical compliance with the residency ordinance despite actually living outside the city.
nevertheless,graham has introduced enough evidence to create a genuine factual dispute on this issue.graham testified that he moved into scranton within six months of being hired as a police officer in to come into compliance with the residency ordinance.he rented various apartments there until approximately six months after his termination in october.graham claims that he and his new wife lived apart from the time of his marriage until after his termination because of his job he explained that he never believed that merely renting an apartment and paying city taxes was sufficient to comply with the residency ordinance rather,he thought he had to stay in his scranton apartment three to five nights a week.at his hearing graham called four witnesses who attested that they were graham neighbors when he lived in the scranton apartment also claimed by phyllis hill.finally,graham claims that his wife solely owned the nicholson home.
graham account is and somewhat unlikely.a person intent to change domicile is based on the actual state of facts,not what one declares them to be.in re prendergast,at.however,courts do not weigh evidence or determine credibility questions at the summary judgment stage.reeves sanderson plumbing,d citation omitted.viewed in the light most favorable to graham,a reasonable could conclude that graham made his home in scranton when he moved there after being hired as a police officer and that he never made nicholson his principal home after he because he knew that if he did so he would be in violation of the residency ordinance 
the officers also presented additional evidence of retaliation.without the evidence regarding specific employees described above,we doubt whether this additional evidence would be sufficient to meet the officers burden of rebuttal.however,we need not resolve this question because the sum of all the evidence supporting the officers is sufficient to carry their burden.
first,viewed in the light most favorable to the officers,the residency ordinance had been enforced and sporadically at best prior to the residency investigation.since the ordinance passage in,the city has attempted only twice to collect residency information from all and more important,there is no evidence that prior to june any employee was disciplined or terminated for failure to comply with the ordinance.the city sudden vigilance could suggest that the city was motivated at least in part by the officers participation in the lawsuit.see holder,at noting holder allegation that no other city employee had been fired for with residency ordinance in ordinance existence 
next,the officers showed that of the initial list of eight names sent to the private investigation firm in may,seven were police officers who sued the city in.the city could respond that shortly thereafter four more police officers were added to the list and that three of these four were not plaintiffs in the suit however,the officers evidence could still reasonably suggest that the city prioritized and targeted the plaintiffs,especially considering the fact that no police officer who did not sue the city in was ever terminated for with the ordinance.
the officers also showed that the investigation was not conducted in a systematic fashion.despite the city controller attempt to gather residency information from all city employees in,mayor connors was unsure whether his office used that information to determine which employees warranted further investigation.rather,mayor connors and city attorney james mulligan testified that the lists of suspicious employees were generated largely from tips from the public or from other city employees.mayor connors testified that he was very satisfied that the investigation produced a complete list of suspected violators and explained that the city may have used the results of the request to eliminate from suspicion the majority of city employees.the officers presented evidence,however,that approximately two hundred employees failed to respond to the request for residency were only respondents out of approximately city employees.the city makes no attempt to either contradict or explain this shortfall.the city failure to conduct a systematic and thorough investigation of all employees,especially of those who raised red flags by failing to respond to the mandatory request,is consistent with the alleged retaliatory motive.
further,the temporal proximity between the officers protected activity and their termination supports an inference of retaliation.the officers lost their case in the district court in december,but we did not deny their appeal until june.hickey and hill were fired within one year of our decision,while graham termination followed four months later.we need not,however,decide whether a gap is sufficient to support an inference of retaliation.we have explained that a retaliatory inference based on temporal proximity is strengthened where the decisionmaker lacked a pretext on which to dismiss the plaintiff until shortly before the time of dismissal.san filippo,at.after the city prevailed in the district court and before us,it apparently decided to strengthen its position by incorporating the residency ordinance into all of its collective bargaining agreements with the various unions representing city employees the police cba containing the new residency provision was ratified on october,and included a grace period to run from the date of ratification.hickey and hill were investigated in may and terminated in early june,just a few weeks after the expiration of this grace period.further,although graham was not terminated until october,there is evidence that his hearing was originally scheduled for july.under these circumstances there is enough evidence to support a slight inference of retaliation.as in san filippo,we need not determine whether this evidence would be sufficient absent the additional evidence of retaliation detailed in this opinion.at.
finally,the officers presented some evidence that mayor connors was particularly concerned with the officers who sued the city in.hickey testified that connors asked him at his hearing why he participated in the lawsuit.further,another police officer testified that connors had sought stronger language regarding residency in the police cba to ensure that the officers would not be able to further resist the city enforcement efforts.while these comments are amenable to a interpretation,a reasonable could also conclude,in light of all the other evidence discussed above,that mayor connors was unfavorably disposed towards the officers who participated in the lawsuit.
for all the above reasons,we conclude that the police officers have presented sufficient evidence that the city used the residency ordinance as a pretext for retaliatory terminations in violation of the officers first amendment right to petition the government.
hickey hearing delay claim 
as noted in part ii,hickey argued in opposition to the city motion for summary judgment that the lengthy delay in providing his municipal service hearing violated his right to procedural due process.the district court treated hickey argument as a constructive motion to amend his complaint under federal rule of civil procedure a,which it ultimately denied.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion or commit any legal error in reaching this decision.
first,we reject hickey frivolous argument that his complaint gave effective notice to the city of his hearing delay claim.hickey is correct that notice pleading requires only a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a,but hickey complaint falls far short of this low threshold.nowhere in the complaint does hickey even allege that he requested a municipal service hearing,much less that the city failed to timely provide such a hearing.in fact,hickey complaint does not allege any facts at all relating to the period after he w
