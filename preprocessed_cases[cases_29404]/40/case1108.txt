opinion of the court 
this appeal,the most recent chapter in a nearly legal battle over the assessment of commercial real property taxes in the united states virgin islands,requires us to reassess the jurisdictional foundations of our previous decisions in light of intervening congressional action 
the government of the virgin islands appeals two orders,both entered on september,by the chief judge of the district court of the virgin islands.in the first order,the district court partially vacated its may,decree.in the second order,the district court found the government of the virgin islands had violated the parts of the may,decree and held it in contempt.the government of the virgin islands challenges both the jurisdiction of the district court and its contempt order.we will affirm.
the initial suit in this litigation,brought under,was filed in july by owners of commercial real estate subject to commercial real property taxes levied by the government of the virgin islands plaintiff taxpayers alleged violations of the act,repealed,which required real estate tax assessments for the territories be made at actual value.they also alleged violations of the revised organic act of,as well as infringements of their procedural and substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution.berne gov t of the,d.plaintiffs sought to enjoin the government of the virgin islands from assessing real property taxes except in accordance with the act,which required assessment by fair market value.the district court granted a preliminary injunction against the government of the virgin islands,finding continuing violations of the act and a tax system that was neither credible nor reliable enough to provide taxpayers their constitutionally mandated due process rights.from this earlier litigation emerged the berne settlement agreement which was approved by the district court in december.
under the settlement agreement,the government of the virgin islands agreed to reform its real property tax assessment system.the district court appointed a special master to monitor the government procedures and to report on the level of achievement.the court granted the government two years to bring its assessment system into compliance with constitutional requirements and the act.berne gov t of the berne ii,d,aff.cir.
in the intervening years,old and new parties to the litigation filed motions to compel the government of the virgin islands to comply with the settlement agreement.on may,the district court entered a decree the may decree to enforce the berne settlement agreement.berne ii,d at.the may decree permanently enjoined the government of the virgin islands from assessing all real property in the virgin islands until the district court found the government had established the property tax system mandated by the act,and the board of tax review was consistently holding hearings and making determinations within a reasonable amount of time after an appeal.id.at.the district court extended this injunction to all similarly situated taxpayers in the virgin islands but allowed the government of the virgin islands to issue tax bills to taxpayers based on assessment values for so long as it provided a mechanism to retroactively apply those assessment values.in response,the virgin islands legislature enacted act to provide a mechanism to collect taxes from taxpayers based on a assessment until the injunction was dissolved.accordingly,in august,the district court modified the may decree to allow the government to collect these property taxes.in re tax,d.
on june,congress repealed the act and made the repeal retroactive to the enactment of the revised organic act of,stat.the senate committee report stated t he assessment and collection of real property taxes is fundamentally a local government issue with no federal impact,at.in response to the repeal,in december,the government of the virgin islands moved to vacate the may decree under.b,contending it was based upon no longer valid law 
before the district court decision on the status of the may injunction,the virgin islands legislature convened a special session on march,and passed act,sess.laws,which permitted the governor,john dejongh,to issue real estate tax bills for during the fiscal year,in contravention of the may decree act was silent with respect to the proper functioning of the board of tax review,aside from appropriating a sum of money to the board to hire administrative assistants and hearing officers and to pay for stenography services.id.
while the district court review of the status of the may injunction,in light of the repealed act,was pending,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on july,to determine how the board of tax review was functioning.without waiting for the district court determination on the status of the injunction,the government of the virgin islands apprised the court on august,via an informative notice,of its intention to issue the tax bills.immediately thereafter,berne moved for an order to show cause why the government of the virgin islands should not be held in contempt.the government of the virgin islands,nevertheless,sent out its tax bills,even as it filed an opposition to the motion to show cause for contempt.after a hearing on the motion,the district court,on september,found the government of the virgin islands in contempt of the may decree.the court ordered it to rescind all tax bills and to establish a special fund to satisfy any possible payment obligation imposed by the district court in connection with this matter the court also vacated the part of the may decree that relied upon the repealed act,but retained jurisdiction over the rest of the may decree,which ordered reform of the operation of the board of tax review 
at the threshold,we must determine whether the district court still had jurisdiction over the may decree when it entered the two orders the government of the virgin islands contends the district court was divested of jurisdiction because its jurisdictional basis for the may decree,the act,had been repealed.the presence or absence of jurisdiction is governed by the complaint rule,which provides that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiff properly pleaded complaint.caterpillar,williams,d.in the initial complaint in this matter,filed july,berne pleaded,under the second cause of action,deprivation of its substantive and procedural due process rights guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.
in bluebeard castle,government of the virgin islands,a precursor to the present case,we held the district court had federal jurisdiction because taxpayers properly pled a federal claim namely,violations of the act,cir.in berne government of the virgin islands,cir,we jurisdiction not only because of alleged violations of the act,but also because t he record shows that the plaintiffs pleaded in their complaint that their rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of the united states constitution were violated.while the repeal of the act removed one of the bases for jurisdiction,the district court would still retain jurisdiction over this matter because of the constitutional violations alleged on the face of the initial complaint.
the government of the virgin islands challenges the district court jurisdiction on an alternative ground.it contends the senate report accompanying the repeal of the act reveals congressional intent to apply the tax injunction act to united states territories,the virgin islands in particular.see,at the assessment and collection of real property taxes is fundamentally a local government issue with no federal impact.the tax injunction act deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to enjoin,suspend or restrain the assessment,levy or collection of any tax under state law where a plain,speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such state.in,we held the tax injunction act does not apply to the virgin islands.pan am.world airways gov t of the,cir.we generally do not revisit decided issues except under special circumstances like an intervening chan
