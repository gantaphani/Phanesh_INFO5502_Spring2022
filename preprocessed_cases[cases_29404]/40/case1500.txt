anthony andrews,an inmate in the federal correctional,va fci petersburg,appeals the district court dismissal of his suit brought under the federal torts claim act ftca,and west supp,against the united states alleging that the negligence of a bureau of prisons bop officer caused the loss of his property.the district court concluded that the united states had not waived its sovereign immunity because the bop officer was covered by the exception to the ftca set forth in c,and it therefore dismissed andrews complaint for lack of jurisdiction.because we conclude that the bop officer here is not covered by c,we reverse.
on august,andrews was temporarily transferred from fci petersburg to the eastern district of north carolina for a hearing.andrews had accumulated nearly two duffle bags of legal materials related to his case.recognizing that he could not take all of this material with him to north carolina,andrews took only a stack of legal materials and left in his cell locker all his other remaining legal materials and personal property.while he was in north carolina,fci petersburg needed additional cell space,so a bop officer packed andrews belongings and prepared an inmate personal property record.when completing the form,the bop officer erroneously indicated that andrews had been permanently transferred from fci petersburg.because of this error,andrews property was shipped from fci petersburg and lost.
on january,andrews returned to fci petersburg and found his possessions missing.on january,he filed an administrative claim with the bop seeking damages for the missing property.the bop denied his claim,and he filed suit against the united states under the ftca.on april,the united states moved to dismiss andrews suit on the ground of sovereign immunity.
on july,the district court granted the government motion to dismiss.the court concluded that bop officers were law enforcement officer s for purposes of c exception to the waiver of sovereign immunity.as a result,the court held that the united states had not waived sovereign immunity for suits against bop officers for the detention of property,and it dismissed andrews suit for lack of jurisdiction.andrews noted a timely appeal.
we review de novo the district court interpretation of c and its resulting conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction.see treacy newdunn,llp,cir.the first step in determining the meaning of a statute is to examine the statute plain language.united seniors ass n,social sec,cir.in doing so,we look at the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil,d.
we begin our analysis with the text of c and its context in the ftca statutory scheme.the ftca broadly waives the sovereign immunity of the united states for monetary claims for injury or loss of property caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.b.congress limited this broad waiver,however,by retaining sovereign immunity in thirteen distinct areas.one such area is described in c,which states 
the provisions of the ftca shall not apply to 
c any claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty,or the detention of any goods,merchandise,or other property by any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer 
neither andrews nor the government disputes that andrews negligence claim aris es in respect of the detention of property.rather,the single point of disagreement is whether the bop officer here is a law enforcement officer within the meaning of the subsection.if he is not such a law enforcement officer,then sovereign immunity does not bar andrews complaint.if he is,the united states has retained sovereign immunity from andrews suit,and the district court lacked jurisdiction to hear it.
although the supreme court and this circuit previously have addressed c,neither court has decided the meaning of the phrase any other law enforcement officer.see kosak united states,d holding that c exception for claims arising in respect of the detention of goods includes a claim for damage to the goods during the detention perkins united states,cir holding that c reference to the assessment or collection of any tax bars only those claims that are related,however,remotely,to a bona fide effort to assess or collect a particular tax debt.in fact,in kosak the supreme court reserved the question of precisely what types of law enforcement officers are covered by c.see at.we have no occasion in this case to decide what kinds of officer s,other than customs officials,are covered by the exception.quoting c.
although the court in kosak did not determine the meaning of the phrase any other law enforcement officer,the court did establish an important interpretative method by which we should construe the phrase.although it is a familiar canon of statutory construction that ambiguities in waivers of sovereign immunity are to be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign,see lane pena,d,in kosak,the court rejected the government argument that the corollary of this canon was also exceptions to waivers of sovereign immunity should be broadly construed in favor of the sovereign.at.instead,the court instructed that the correct approach in construing the meaning of c is to identify those circumstances which are within the words and reason of the less and no more.id.internal quotation marks omitted.otherwise,unduly generous interpretations of the exceptions run the risk of defeating the central purpose of the ftca.id.under kosak,then,our task is to interpret the phrase any other law enforcement officer without placing a thumb on the scale for the benefit of the sovereign instead,we must determine precisely who is a law enforcement officer under c.
andrews claims that his property was lost due to the negligence of a bop officer,who in the abstract is assuredly a law enforcement officer.but before we can conclude that the bop officer here is a law enforcement officer within the meaning of c,we must determine whether the context of the statute limits the any other law enforcement officer phrase.examining the phrase in context is necessary because w e do not construe statutory phrases in isolation we read statutes as a whole.united states morton,d.in fulfilling this requirement,we find particularly applicable the ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis canons of statutory construction.these related canons remove the phrase from the abstract and give it the meaning the context demands.state dep t of soc.and health servs.keffeler,d concluding after applying the canons of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis that the contextual meaning of the term other legal process is more restrictive than the meaning the term would have in the abstract.applying these canons,we conclude that the meaning of law enforcement officer in the context of c is narrower than its meaning in the abstract.
according to the ejusdem generis canon,a general word or phrase that follows a list of specifics will be interpreted to include only items of the same type as those listed.black law dictionary ed.in other words,we apply the ejusdem generis canon to determine the meaning of a phrase by looking to the common elements among the specific things mentioned in the list.for example,if a statute lists fishing rods,nets,hooks,bobbers,sinkers and other equipment,other equipment might mean plastic worms and fishing line,but not snow shovels or baseball bats.bazuaye united states,internal citation omitted see also reiche smythe,wall.applying the ejusdem generis canon to conclude that birds are not other live animals for the purpose of a statute establishing customs duties for all horses,mules,cattle,sheep,hogs,and other live animals.in these examples,isolating the general phrase from the specific things mentioned would result in the statute encompassing far more than the context of the statute suggests the legislature intended.
section c presents a textbook ejusdem generis scenario.it contains a general phrase any other law enforcement officer that follows a recitation of specific things any officer of customs or excise whose similar characteristic is that they are charged with the function of enforcing the revenue laws customs and tax,respectively of the united states.applying the ejusdem generis canon to c,a dea officer detaining property to enforce the customs laws is a law enforcement officer because he is performing a function similar to an officer of customs or excise,see,formula one motors,united states,cir,but the bop officer moving andrews belongings to make room for another inmate would not be a law enforcement officer because he is not performing a customs or excise function.
similar to the canon of ejusdem generis is the canon of noscitur a sociis.according to the noscitur a sociis canon,the meaning of an undefined word or phrase should be determined by the words immediately surrounding it.black law dictionary ed.this canon infuses into law enforcement officer a meaning gathered from the words around it.jarecki searle,d concluding that in a statute referring to i ncome resulting from exploration,discovery,or prospecting the word discovery is limited to only drilling and mining activities because the other words strongly suggest that a precise and narrow application of the word discovery was intended.a more recent example of the application of the noscitur a sociis canon is found in gutierrez ada,d,in which the supreme court examined the meaning of the phrase in any election as used in the guam organic act.id.at.despite the unqualified language of the phrase,the court instructed that t he key to understanding the phrase is to look at the references surrounding it in the statute.id.at.because the other words in the statute related solely to gubernatorial elections,the court determined that congress did not shift its attention from the context of gubernatorial elections when using the unqualified general phrase in any election but instead intended for the phrase to refer only to gubernatorial elections.id.at.
applying the noscitur a sociis canon here,we are convinced that c s specific references to the enforcement of tax and customs laws indicates that the law enforcement officer referenced therein should be limited to those officers acting in a tax and customs enforcement capacity.the opening clause of c refers solely to claims arising from the specific actions of assessing or collecting a tax or customs duty.c any claim arising in respect of the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty.we have interpreted this clause to mean that the exemption applies only to those actions that are related,however remotely,to a bona fide effort to assess or collect a tax or customs duty.see perkins,at.the next clause of c makes reference to the detention of property by specific government officials whose job is to enforce the tax and customs laws.c any officer of customs or excise.these clauses both dwell exclusively on customs and taxes,secret service,cir tang,concurring,and the fact that they have a clear and defined meaning limited to the enforcement of the tax and customs laws confirms that congress did not shift its attention outside of the tax and customs context when it added the unqualified any other law enforcement officer phrase.instead,the limitation of c to tax and customs activities indicates that congress intended the meaning of law enforcement officer to be limited to the specific focus of the rest of c the assessment or collection of tax or customs duties or the detention of property associated with these activities.because the bop officer was not performing such a function,he is not a law enforcement officer for purposes of c 
our reading of c is in accord with a principal reason for the subsection to avoid extending the ftca to suits for which adequate remedies were already available.kosak,at.before the ftca enactment,a property owner was able to bring suit against individual customs or tax officers for property damage,for which the united states provided indemnification through west supp under certain conditions not relevant here,and this right of action exists even now.id.at.bazuaye,at discussing the history of the rights of action against customs and tax officers.the effect of this statutory indemnification is to skirt the united states sovereign immunity by providing a entry to the federal fisc to obtain monetary damages the historical suit is against a customs or tax officer,but the united states pays the judgment.because adequate remedies existed for claims arising from the enforcement of the customs or tax laws,it was unnecessary to include those claims within the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity.conversely,at the time of the ftca enactment,plaintiffs enjoyed no similar right to sue law enforcement officers acting outside a customs and tax enforcement capacity.holding that bop officers are law enforcement officer s under c would,at the time of the ftca enactment,not have denied plaintiffs a duplicate remedy,but rather would have denied them of any remedy at all 
the government argues that the meaning of law enforcement officer in c should be determined by construing that subsection in light of h,which defines an investigative or law enforcement officer in terms that encompass bop officers under the in pari materia canon,neighboring statutory subsections that refer to the same subject matter must be read as if they were a single statute.virginia int l terminals,edwards,cir.the government proposed application of the in pari materia canon is erroneous,however,because congress expressly limited the definition of investigative or law enforcement officer to h.see h for the purpose of this subsection,investigative or law enforcement officer means emphasis added.to apply the h definition beyond that subsection would make meaningless the limitation that congress placed on the definition.united states amada,cir refusing to apply the in pari materia canon to define a term in another statute when the definition of the term in one statute was expressly limited to that statute.
the government also contends that the amendment to c in the civil asset forfeiture act of cafra,stat.april,compels us to conclude that bop officers are law enforcement officer s for purposes of c.cafra created an exception to c that sovereign immunity for claims for property damage occurring while property was detained for an ultimately unsuccessful civil forfeiture the government argues that interpreting law enforcement officer to encompass only those law enforcement officers acting in a tax or customs capacity would make the cafra amendment meaningless because adequate remedies already existed for property damage claims arising from tax and customs enforcement.we disagree.the remedy created by cafra is different from the historical remedy against customs and tax officers.to recover against the united states through the historical remedy,a plaintiff must show,inter alia,that the customs or tax officer acted without probable cause.the cafra remedy,however,has no such requirement.instead,if a plaintiff satisfies cafra showing,he only need show that the customs or tax officer acted negligently.see c.we therefore reject the government argument that our interpretation of law enforcement officer renders cafra superfluous 
in accordance with the text of and reason for c,we conclude that the phrase any other law enforcement officer is limited to those officers acting in a tax or customs capacity.because the bop officer who moved andrews property was not acting in this capacity,c does not bar andrews complaint.
our decision places us in agreement with three courts of sixth,seventh,and district of columbia have held that law enforcement officer in c refers only to those law enforcement officers acting in a tax or customs capacity.see kurinsky united states,cir fbi agents not included ortloff united states,cir bop officers not included bazuaye,at postal inspectors not included these courts reached their decisions,as we have,after applying the canons of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis and after examining the reason congress included the exception of c in the ftca.kurinsky,at ortloff,at bazuaye,at.
