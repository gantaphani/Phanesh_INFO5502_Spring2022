myrna gómez was a window distribution clerk for the united states postal service usps.gómez alleges that she was subject to retaliatory treatment after filing an age discrimination complaint against her supervisors.she then filed suit against the usps and john potter potter in his capacity as postmaster general,alleging,inter alia,violations of section of the age discrimination in employment act adea.the district court granted summary judgment to the usps and potter on gómez adea claim on the ground that the united states had not waived sovereign immunity as to retaliation claims under the adea.gómez appeals from this decision.after careful consideration,we conclude that the usps and potter have waived sovereign immunity with respect to adea suits,but that section of the adea does not provide a cause of action for retaliation by federal employers.
background 
we briefly recount the facts relevant to gómez claim.gómez began working for the usps in new york in.in,gómez was transferred to the caribbean district,and began working in puerto rico.gómez was working at the dorado post office in october as a window distribution clerk when she requested a transfer to the moca post office in order to be closer to her mother,who was ill.gómez supervisor approved the transfer,and gómez began working at the moca post office as a window distribution clerk.approximately one month later,in november,gómez requested a transfer back to the dorado post office as a window distribution clerk.on the same day,gómez supervisor converted the dorado window distribution clerk position to a position and filled it with another employee.gómez supervisor denied gómez transfer request.
after filing a grievance which was denied,gómez filed an equal employment opportunity complaint with the usps,alleging that she had been discriminated against on the basis of her age.gómez was years old at the time.after gómez filed her complaint,she alleges that she was subject to various forms of retaliation.gómez alleges that her supervisor called her to meetings during which groundless complaints were leveled against her.in addition,gómez alleges that usps posters related to sexual harassment were defaced and that her name was written on the posters.gómez also alleges that her supervisors complained that she was sexually harassing her,when in fact she was not.gómez states that her began to harass her and tell her to go back where you belong.finally,gómez states that her work hours were drastically reduced after she filed the complaint.
gómez filed suit against the usps and potter in his official capacity in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico on november,alleging,inter alia,that she had been retaliated against for filing her eeo complaint,and that this retaliation constituted a violation of the adea.on july,the usps and potter filed a motion for summary judgment.the court referred the matter to a magistrate judge,and on january,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the motion for summary judgment be granted on the grounds that the united states had not waived sovereign immunity for retaliation suits under the adea.gómez filed an objection to the report and recommendation,but the district court adopted it and granted summary judgment to the usps and potter on february.gómez now appeals from the grant of summary judgment.
ii.discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the.iverson city of boston,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
sovereign immunity 
the united states is entitled to immunity from suit without its consent.muirhead mecham,cir see also united states horn,cir discussing the historical background of sovereign immunity.although the usps is independent from the executive branch,the supreme court has held that the postal service enjoys the federal government immunity from suit because of its significant government powers.dolan postal,d.potter,in his official capacity as postmaster general,enjoys similar immunity.see loeffler frank,d whenever the head of the postal service acts in his official capacity,he is acting in the name of the postal service.thus,here the acts of the named defendant are always chargeable as acts of the person or entity subject to the waiver of immunity.therefore,in order for gómez to bring suit against the usps and potter,we need to find an unequivocal waiver of immunity that is expressed in specific statutory language.united states mitchell,d united states king,d.the postal reorganization act,however,generally waives the immunity of the postal service from suit by giving it the power to sue and be sued in its official name.postal serv.flamingo indus,d quoting.accordingly,sovereign immunity does not present a bar to bringing an adea suit against the usps or potter.
substantive cause of action 
our inquiry does not end here.as the supreme court stated in flamingo industries,once we have determined that sovereign immunity has been waived,we must proceed to determine whether the substantive law in question is intended to reach the federal entity.id.thus,we must determine whether congress intended for the adea prohibition on discrimination based on age to allow a plaintiff to bring a cause of action against the federal government for retaliation.
we begin with the plain text of we presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bank germain,d.section a states all personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least years of age shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.the text of clearly prohibits discrimination against federal employees over forty years old based on age,but says nothing that indicates that congress meant for this provision to provide a cause of action for retaliation for filing an related complaint.the question is,did congress mean discrimination and retaliation when it said discrimination 
the difference between these two causes of action is clear,and was recently explained in the context of title vii by the supreme court in burlington santa fe ry.white 
the provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their racial,ethnic,religious,or status.the provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering through retaliation with an employee efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the act basic guarantees.the substantive provision seeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are,their status.the provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do,their conduct.
d internal citations omitted.the clear difference between a cause of action for discrimination and a cause of action for retaliation leads to the conclusion that if congress had meant to provide for both causes of action,it would have said so explicitly in.
gómez responds that,notwithstanding the differences between discrimination and retaliation,the court also recently held in jackson birmingham bd.of,that when a funding recipient retaliates against a person because he complains of sex discrimination,this constitutes intentional discrimination on the basis of sex,in violation of title ix,d emphasis omitted.gómez argues that the logic the court used in jackson to find that a retaliation cause of action could be implied from a statute which prohibited only discrimination is equally applicable to the adea retaliation is an intentional act,it is discriminatory in that it treats the complainant differently than others,and it is discrimination based on age because the nature of the complaint for which the defendant is retaliating is age discrimination.id.at.
we are not persuaded by this argument.first,we note that in jackson,the court was interpreting a cause of action that was implied from title ix of the civil rights act of.id.at.citing cannon university of chicago,d.the court is the primary entity involved in defin ing the
