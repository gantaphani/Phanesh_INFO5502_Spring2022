in this action,solers,a virginia corporation,challenges the irs response to its request for documents under the freedom of information act foia.the irs identified pages that were responsive to solers request and ultimately produced unredacted copies of all but pages.solers challenged the irs reasons for withholding of those pages and for producing other pages with redactions.
after reviewing the documents in camera,the district court sustained the irs position and granted the irs summary judgment.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
solers,an information technology company,was audited by the irs for its tax year,and,pursuant to the audit,the irs proposed adjustments to solers tax liability and potential penalties.not long after the irs closed the audit,solers submitted a foia request to the irs for all documents in the irs administrative file pertaining to its tax liabilities and potential penalties for the tax year,specifically requesting d ocuments,notes,and internal irs correspondence related to the irs audit the irs notice of proposed tax adjustment solers response to the notice solers protest of the proposed adjustment the quality control that was performed on the notice of proposed adjustment and guidance received by two irs agents regarding intentional disregard penalties.solers also requested all correspondence between specified individuals that related to it.
the irs located pages that were responsive to solers request and initially provided solers with most of these pages,withholding pages and producing pages with redactions.
solers commenced this action,alleging that the irs was unlawfully withholding records and seeking an order requiring it to disclose any redacted materials to the extent that those materials are not subject to a proper exemption under.after solers filed its complaint,the irs determined that of the pages previously withheld could be released in full that additional pages previously withheld could be released with redactions and that of the redacted pages could be released in full.solers eventually agreed that the irs had properly redacted pages,leaving only pages at issue in this case pages that the irs withheld and pages that it produced with redactions.
at the outset of the proceedings,solers filed a motion to obtain a vaughn index a list describing the documents withheld and information redacted and giving detailed information sufficient to enable a court to rule on whether the withholdings fall within a foia exemption.see rein patent trademark office,cir.vaughn rosen,cir.the district court granted the motion in part,directing the irs to provide all information required in a vaughn index for each document withheld or produced with redactions.
thereafter,the parties filed for summary judgment,and,in support of its motion,the irs attached two affidavits from one of its attorneys that provided the following information about the pages withheld or redacted 
handwritten notes four of the six withheld pages are handwritten notes made by revenue agent arun sharma,the agent primarily responsible for conducting solers examination,during a conversation he had with solers accountant on april.according to the irs attorney,the notes consist of agent sharma thoughts,impressions,and indicate the possible direction of the examination.the irs attorney also stated that n o decision was made at that time with regard to the issues discussed by revenue agent sharma and the cpa,and the examination was not closed until almost a year later on march.the irs withheld the pages of notes pursuant to the deliberative process privilege that is incorporated into b exemption.the irs attorney also stated that he had determined that the notes do not contain any segregable information.
summary report the irs also withheld a summary report prepared by agent sharma on october.the report discusses agent sharma review of returns of certain individual taxpayers,whose tax returns were considered in conjunction with solers examination.the irs withheld the summary report pursuant to b exemption,in conjunction with a,as well as exemption deliberative process privilege it also maintained that portions of the report were subject to withholding under b and c exemptions and c.
graph the irs also withheld a graph prepared by agent sharma on july.agent sharma generated the graph from the irs database,which stores information about which individuals and entities are related to each taxpayer.the graph shows the identity of individuals and entities whose tax returns were considered in conjunction with solers examination.the irs withheld the graph in full pursuant to exemption,in conjunction with a,and exemption deliberative process privilege it also maintained that portions of the graph were subject to withholding under exemptions and c.
checksheet the irs produced most of a closed case review checksheet,which was completed by agent sharma manager on march,making a redaction only on a line of the form identifying related returns.the irs attorney stated that the agency had redacted only the portion of the checklist that reflects the identity of a third party whose return information was considered in conjunction with solers examination.the irs maintained that the redaction of this information was justified under exemption,in conjunction with a,as well as exemptions and c.
activity record the irs also redacted a single entry from one page of agent sharma activity record.the irs attorney stated that the deleted entry,from july,reflects that agent sharma communicated with the irs office of chief counsel with respect to a specific issue in the examination,explaining that disclosure of the redacted entry would reveal an area of the exam for which the revenue agent sought legal advice.the irs invoked exemption incorporation of the privilege to justify the redaction.
two emails finally,the irs also redacted from two emails the names and contact information of irs personnel consulted in connection with solers examination.both emails were sent from the irs specialist referral system to revenue agent dennis cohen,an agent who worked on solers exam prior to revenue agent sharma.the first email,dated july,indicates that agent cohen had requested a consultation with a computer audit specialist and a tax computation specialist from this email,the irs redacted the names and contact information of the managers to whom the requests were referred.the second email,dated july,informed agent cohen that his request for a computer audit specialist had been assigned from this email,the irs redacted the name and contact information of the computer audit specialist who had been assigned to consult on the case,as well as the name of the manager who had made the assignment.the irs maintained that its redactions of these emails were justified under exemptions and c.
before the hearing on the parties for summary judgment,the district court directed the irs to submit unredacted copies of the pages at issue for in camera review.and at the hearing,the court ruled,based on the record and its in camera review,that the irs withholdings were justified.as a preliminary matter,the court ruled that because it had thoroughly reviewed the records directly,solers challenge to the sufficiency of the irs vaughn index was no longer an issue.and as to the withheld or redacted pages,the court concluded that the irs had properly withheld four pages consisting of the agent handwritten notes,based on exemption,b,because the notes reflect the mental processes of the revenue agent and his thoughts on the possible direction of the investigation that the irs had properly withheld the graph and summary report,based on exemption,id.b,and a,because t hose two documents contain identifying information for third parties and that the irs had properly redacted identifying information of other individuals from the checksheet and the two emails,based on exemptions and c,b,c.the court accordingly entered judgment for the irs.
from the court judgment dated may,solers filed this appeal.
as a general,preliminary matter,solers contends that the irs produced generic and inadequate affidavits that provide d no justification for the withholding of any document,thereby disregard ing the district court order that the irs provide all information required in a vaughn index.it argues that because the irs failed to provide a sufficiently detailed justification for withholding the documents,it was thwarted in its efforts to challenge those withholdings and that this failure remained meaningful even after the district court in camera review because the district court ruling from the bench did not provide solers with a detailed analysis and rationale regarding its decision to sustain the irs claimed exemption s.in essence,solers challenges the sufficiency of the irs vaughn index.
solers argument,however,fails to appreciate the role of a vaughn index.a vaughn index is designed to enable the district court to rule on a privilege without having to review the document itself and thus functions as a surrogate for the production of documents for in camera review.ethyl epa,cir.emphasis added see also rein,at describing a proper vaughn index as a substitute for in camera review.
in this case,because the district court reviewed the documents in camera,it correctly concluded that its own thorough review had completely eradicated any issue about an inadequate vaughn index.stated otherwise,the issue of whether the irs provided a vaughn index sufficient to enable the district court to evaluate the irs claimed exemptions became irrelevant and moot after the irs complied with the district court order to produce the records for in camera review and the court completed its own review of the records.
turning next to the merits of solers challenge to the irs withholdings,foia requires generally that federal agencies make their internal records available to the public upon request.see a a.the act,however,exempts certain categories of records from disclosure.see id.b listing what are referred to as exemptions through.if an exemption applies only to a portion of a document,foia requires that a ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided after deletion of the portions which are exempt.id.b.
in this case,the irs relied on exemptions,and c to withhold or redact the pages at issue.we address the irs claimed exemptions in the following four categories the agent handwritten notes the summary report,graph,and checksheet the activity record and the two emails.
a.the agent handwritten notes 
the first category consists of four pages of handwritten notes made by revenue agent arun sharma during a conversation he had with solers accountant on april.to justify withholding the notes,the irs relied on exemption incorporation of the deliberative process privilege,b,maintaining that the notes consist of agent sharma thoughts,impressions,and indicate the possible direction of the examination.the irs also took the position that the notes do not contain any segregable information.
upholding the irs position,the district court observed that,while the notes were very difficult to read,they were nonetheless covered by the deliberative process privilege because they do represent the agent thought process,adding that they reflect the mental processes of the revenue agent and his thoughts on the possible direction of the investigation.
solers contends that the information with which it has been provided about the notes does not establish the notes deliberative nature,leaving unclear whether the notes were somehow related to the process by which any agency policy was formulated or whether the notes played a role in reaching an agency decision.solers also asserts that the irs did not provide any information to support its conclusion that the documents were not segregable.
exemption shields or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.b.among the privileges exemption encompasses are the privilege and the deliberative process privilege.rein,at.and the deliberative process privilege,on which the irs relies to withhold the notes,rests on the obvious realization that officials will not communicate candidly among themselves if each remark is a potential item of discovery and front page news.dep t of interior klamath water users protective ass n.the privilege thus encourages discussion of alternatives prevents public confusion that might result from the premature release of such nonbinding deliberations and insulates against the chilling effect likely were officials to be judged not on the basis of their final decisions,but for matters they considered before making up their minds.city of virginia beach dep t of commerce,cir.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
to justify application of the deliberative process privilege,the government must show that,in the context in which the materials were used,the documents were both predecisional and deliberative.city of virginia beach,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.predecisional documents are those prepared in order to assist an agency decisionmaker in arriving at his decision,renegotiation bd.grumman aircraft eng g,and deliberative documents are those that reflect the of the consultative process by revealing the manner in which the agency evaluates possible alternative policies or outcomes,city of virginia beach,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the privilege thus protects recommendations,draft documents,proposals,suggestions,and other subjective documents which reflect the personal opinions of the writer rather than the policy of the agency.id.emphasis added internal quotation marks and citation omitted.but the privilege does not protect a document which is merely peripheral to actual policy formation the record must bear on the formulation or exercise of judgment.ethyl,at.in addition,since the prospect of disclosure is less likely to make an advisor omit or fudge raw facts than opinions,purely factual material does not fall within the exemption unless it is inextricably intertwined with policymaking processes such that revelation of the factual material would simultaneously expose protected deliberation.city of virginia beach,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in this case,after the district court conducted its in camera review and its review of the sworn statement of an irs employee,it concluded that the four pages of handwritten notes represent the key or salient points that that agent was writing down and reflect the mental processes of the revenue agent and his thoughts on the possible direction of the investigation.the court also determined that the four pages could be withheld in their entirety,effectively ruling that there were no segregable portions that could be produced.
we conclude that the district court factual findings regarding the content of the notes are amply supported by the record which includes the irs representative statement that the four pages of notes consist of agent sharma thoughts,impressions,and indicate the possible direction of the examination and therefore are not clearly erroneous.see ethyl,at noting that,in foia cases,factual conclusions are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard.moreover,because the notes were the agent preliminary evaluation of issues implicated by the audit,the court did not err in concluding that they were predecisional and deliberative,thus satisfying the criteria for withholding them under exemption.see whistleblower ctr.dep t of health human,supp,handwritten notes may be deliberative or part of the agency deliberative process where they contain the author opinions,analysis,or impressions of the event he or she describes carter,fullerton hayes llc ftc,supp,upholding agency invocation of the deliberative process privilege to withhold a set of handwritten notes of a senior ftc employee taken during meetings based on agency description of the notes as representing the employee thoughts and impressions of the meeting judicial watch,clinton,supp,concluding that handwritten notes reflecting preliminary thoughts of agency personnel were covered by the deliberative process privilege.we also affirm the district court implicit ruling that there are no segregable portions of
