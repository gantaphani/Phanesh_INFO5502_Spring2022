opinion of the court 
shortly after commencing his first term in office,virgin islands governor john de jongh,fired claude gerard and charles iles,two public employees in the department of planning and natural resources.both employees sued the governor and the government of the virgin islands,claiming that their terminations deprived them of their property interests in public employment without due process of law.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court agreed and issued a preliminary injunction directing that gerard and iles be reinstated and that they be compensated for lost wages.governor de jongh and the government of the virgin islands appeal the order granting the preliminary injunction.we will reverse.
in june,then governor charles turnbull signed two notices of personnel action nopa relevant to this case.in one notice,he transferred appellee charles iles from his previous government position to that of permits coordinator for the division of coastal zone management,within the department of planning and natural resources.the nopa listed iles new position as exempt.thereafter,iles signed a letter addressed to the acting director,division of personnel,which stated 
in accordance with act,section c and section a,i am electing to be placed in the exempt service of the government of the virgin islands by accepting the position of permits coordinator,division of coastal zone management at per annum,in the department of planning and natural resources.
this request is voluntary as certified by witness.
in the other notice,governor turnbull transferred appellee claude gerard from his previous position to that of assistant director for the division of coastal zone management,within the department of planning and natural resources.the nopa also stated that gerard position was exempt.gerard then signed a letter to the acting director,division of personnel that was identical to the one signed by iles,except for its statement that gerard new position was assistant director,division of coastal zone management at per annum.
in january,de jongh succeeded turnbull as governor of the virgin islands.shortly after taking office,and without prior notice or a hearing,governor de jongh terminated both gerard and iles from further government service.in a letter to iles,he said 
you are hereby advised that your services as permits coordinator of the coastal zone management in the department of planning and natural resources will no longer be necessary.therefore,your employment with the government of the virgin islands is terminated effective february.
on behalf of the people of the virgin islands,i would like to thank you for your service.i wish you the best in all your future endeavors.
governor de jongh also terminated gerard,writing him the same letter he wrote to iles,except for substituting the position of assistant director for permits coordinator.
gerard and iles filed complaints in the district court for the virgin islands,alleging,among other things,that governor de jongh and the government of the virgin islands had deprived them of their property interests in public employment without due process of law.thereafter,gerard and iles moved for a preliminary injunction seeking immediate reinstatement and back pay.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court granted gerard and iles motions for preliminary injunctions and ordered that governor de jongh reinstate gerard and iles to their prior positions.the district court also ordered that gerard and iles be compensated for the wages they would have otherwise received from the date of their termination to the date of their reinstatement.governor de jongh and the government filed appeals from the preliminary injunction 
to determine whether to grant a preliminary injunction,a district court must consider whether the movant has shown a reasonable probability of success on the merits whether the movant will be irreparably injured by denial of the relief whether granting preliminary relief will result in even greater harm to the nonmoving party and whether granting the preliminary relief will be in the public interest.mcternan city of york,cir quoting united states bell,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
although this case comes to us from the appeal of the grant of a preliminary injunction,governor de jongh only challenges the district court ruling as to the first element of the preliminary injunction likelihood of success on the merits of gerard and iles procedural due process claim.
we have explained that to establish a procedural due process claim,a plaintiff must demonstrate that he was deprived of an individual interest that is encompassed within the fourteenth amendment protection of life,liberty,or property,and the procedures available to him did not provide due process of law.biliski red clay consol.school dist.bd.of,cir quoting hill borough of kutztown,cir the question of whether an employee has a property right in continued employment is a question of state or territorial law.mcdaniels flick,cir citing board of regents of state colleges roth.however,before determining whether gerard and iles have a property right in their employment under virgin islands law,it is helpful to examine the various statutory provisions governing public employment in the virgin islands.employee classifications contained in the statutory provisions are important because they determine which employees are entitled to due process protection before termination.
beginning with the two broadest categories under virgin islands law,public employees are divided into career service and exempt service employees.see martinez sanes turnbull,cir thus,employees of the virgin islands are divided into two categories,the career service entitled to civil service protection,and the exempt service not so entitled.the division between these two categories is set forth in c,which provides that a ll positions in the executive branch of the united states virgin islands government not exempted under subsection b of this section shall be in the career service.in other words,an employee is in the career service unless the employee holds an exempt position described in b.because the parties agree that subsections through of a b are not applicable here,we focus our analysis on subsection.under subsection,an employee is exempt if he or she is 
an officer or employee in a position of a nature when the position is so designated by the governor and submitted to the legislature and an employee who is a special assistant,or who is on special assignment to,or whose position requires a confidential relationship with a official when the position is so designated by the governor and submitted to the legislature.
emphasis added.thus,a position is exempt and not in the career service category when the governor designates it as a position of a nature and it is submitted to the legislature.the exempt designation is important because employees in that category can be terminated without cause.employees who are not exempt are then considered career service employees.
the career service category is further divided by into two subcategories employees who are regular and those who are not regular,respectively.thus,the categories of career service employees and regular employees are not interchangeable.richardson felix,cir.as we explained in richardson,a regular employee is one who has been appointed to a position in the career service in accordance with this chapter relating to the personnel merit system after completing his working test period.richardson,at citing alterations in richardson.therefore,a career service employee is also a regular employee only if he has been appointed to his position in accordance with the personnel merit system and has completed his probationary period.
further,in interpreting virgin islands law,we have previously held that under the employee termination procedures of,employees who are regular employees may be terminated only for cause,thus granting them a property interest in continued employment.see also martinez sanes,at stating,in interpreting virgin islands law,that o nly regular ployees had civil service protectio
