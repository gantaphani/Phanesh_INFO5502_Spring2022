the municipality of aguadilla,puerto rico,and one of its police officers,justo cruz,appeal from respective jury awards against them totaling over million.the sums were awarded to blanca,a municipal police officer,on her title vii,et,and puerto rico law,laws ann.tit,et,claims of sexual harassment,retaliation,and violation of due process.
the defendants argue that the evidence was insufficient to support either liability or the damages awarded,and,as a result,the district court erred in denying their motion under federal rules of civil procedure b and a for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,remittitur,or a new trial.
the municipality also attacks the verdict form,arguing that it led the jury to award duplicate damages,and the court failure to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense recognized in faragher city of boca raton,d,and burlington industries ellerth,d.the municipality concedes that it has forfeited these claims by decisions it made at trial.
the defendants also mount unsuccessful attacks on the district court rulings that the law claim against cruz was not,that certain evidence was inadmissible,and that reinstatement was proper.in short,the defendants lost this case at trial and they can not win it here.we affirm.
we recount the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.see,cir.
valentín worked for the municipal police of aguadilla from february,until january,when her employment was terminated she was trained at the police academy,where she graduated at the top of her class.she worked for a probationary period before she became a permanent employee.her supervisors,including cruz,and her coworkers agreed she was a good police officer.
cruz was an administrative sergeant whose duties included checking the officers entry and exit logs.he kept track of attendance and could impose sanctions for attendance problems.at times,he had direct supervisory authority over valentín.he also had some power to affect her work assignments.he worked in a small shared space with a secretarial pool of four or five secretaries,including norma gonzalez and norma ortiz.
in february,valentín,then aged,separated from her husband they ultimately were divorced in march.in august,cruz began a crude campaign to win her affections.his comments were mild initially.he told her on several occasions that she had pretty eyes and nice hair and that her husband did not appreciate what he was leaving behind.he also told her she looked beautiful in the morning.valentín objected to cruz remarks.but instead of stopping,cruz escalated matters in september and october of.he told valentín she had great legs and twice told her she had horny eyes.although valentín was upset and tried to discourage him,he persisted,telling her many times that she was.he then told her that her legs were pretty enough to have hooked over his shoulders.
a number of people at the station knew that cruz was chasing valentín.norma ortiz,one of the secretaries,confirmed that cruz made the reported comments about valentín hair,smile,and legs that cruz made such comments only to valentín and that valentín looked upset because of his approaches.
valentín complained to officer hector villanueva,a friend of hers and a foot patrolman in the municipal police department,that since her divorce,cruz was constantly after her.villanueva observed valentín become upset after cruz said something to her in the hallway.he noticed that cruz always went out of his way to be near valentín and to sidle up next to her.
cruz took to driving by valentín house multiple times on the same day and honking his horn.he admitted doing this to villanueva,who also observed him do it 
although the defense denied that the police commissioner,reynaldo fernández,was aware of the situation,that was contradicted by villanueva testimony that the commissioner told cruz,in front of villanueva and another officer,to get that little girlfriend of yours emphasis added under control.the other officer was david ferrer,who was second in the police hierarchy and cruz good friend.
valentín testified that in early october,she complained about cruz comments to norma gonzalez,the secretaries supervisor and designated.the commissioner had told the female police officers that if they had any problems with male officers,they should go to gonzalez,who reported directly to him.after that complaint,cruz approaches to valentín stopped for a few weeks 
also in october,valentín attempted to meet with the commissioner to complain about cruz,who had become upset with her because she never greeted him with a kiss on the cheek.she testified that this was the first,but not the only,occasion on which she tried to meet with the commissioner.the commissioner greeted her at the door,but instead of hearing her complaints against cruz,he told her to meet with juan vélez,an internal affairs investigator charged with handling equal employment opportunity charges for the municipal police.she met with vélez that same day he put his arm over her shoulders and said cruz was not at fault,that it was her fault because she had him bedazzled.cruz and vélez were good friends.the mayor,carlos méndez,testified that vélez and the commissioner did not at that time bring the allegations to his attention,even though vélez job was to bring sexual harassment allegations to the commissioner,who was supposed to bring them to the mayor.
after her first attempt to complain to the commissioner,valentín testified,she suffered two forms of retaliation.between october and january,she was assigned more than five double shifts,although such assignments were uncommon in the aguadilla police force.she was also transferred in october from the traffic unit,which was regarded as privileged,to the rotating shifts assignment and then to las cascadas water park,which was regarded as punishment because it was remote and the work was solitary.although it was common for officers working shifts to be assigned to las cascadas a few times per week,valentín was permanently assigned there for a period spanning the holidays,ending in early january two weeks into her posting at las cascadas,while she was on duty,cruz visited and told her that w henever she stop ped being such a spoiled rotten kid,he could get her out of there.
cruz approaches recommenced in november,when he left a note under the wiper of valentín car saying that she was his and that she should not be giving rides to fellow officers.in december,he began to repeatedly ask valentín if her divorce was final yet,telling her that he wanted to marry her and offering her money to help finalize the divorce.
valentín felt uncomfortable and continued to rebuff cruz approaches.in approximately january,when valentín again said she was not interested in him,he became angry and told her she would be screwed that she had to be more affectionate with him or else he and his friend ferrer would exact retribution ferrer was in charge of work assignments,and cruz also had some assignment authority.
in january,valentín attempted to complain directly to the mayor.she told him she wanted to discuss cruz,and that she had already attempted to speak with the commissioner,who had paid no attention.the mayor told her he would have anything to do with her,because the commissioner was like his brother.
on february,valentín was at the mall with her son,and she noticed that cruz was behind her.she accused him of following her,saying this was the third or fourth time such a thing had happened,but cruz denied any such thing.valentín told him she might complain again to the commissioner.by this time valentín had already tried to complain to the commissioner twice in october and on another date unclear from the record.
on february,valentín went to the station house,intending to try yet again to meet with the commissioner and to pick up her paycheck before beginning her shift in the town square.just before noon,as she was en route,cruz called her on her cellular phone and told her not to show up.he told her that she had to go to las cascadas and should not come to the station house.valentín told cruz that she was going to meet with the commissioner.she did go to the station house,where she collected her paycheck,but was thereafter prevented from complaining to the commissioner by the trio of cruz,ferrer,and vélez.
ferrer told her not to leave,whereupon cruz gave her a warning letter about her tardiness on an earlier occasion.valentín said she wanted to speak with the commissioner,and cruz told her he was not in.ferrer told her to wait at the dispatch officer station,because he had to give her other documents.vélez then called valentín into his office and told her she was the subject of an internal complaint pertaining to valentín allegedly telling officer wilfredo nieves to go to hell a month and a half earlier,on december.ferrer then came into vélez office and gave valentín another admonishment letter,this one pertaining to an allegedly unauthorized absence.
after ferrer left,valentín started to tell vélez who was in charge of conducting sexual harassment investigations about the situation with cruz,noting that she had not received any admonishments until that very day,just when she was planning to file a grievance.she told vélez that she was being sexually harassed he asked her if she was going to file a complaint against officer nieves,and she told him he knew very well who it was going to be against she had already complained to vélez about cruz in october.vélez told her that the commissioner was not present and she would have to wait to meet with him.
after a frustrating hour during which she got nowhere and received documents pertaining to three separate disciplinary matters,an agitated valentín went to the dispatch area.there she attempted to call an organization that provides legal services to police officers,but ferrer took the telephone from her hands.there are varying accounts of her behavior and that of other participants,but the upshot is that she left the station by ambulance,having suffered what she calls a nervous breakdown.
she did not return to her job until october.between february and october,she received psychiatric treatment from the state insurance fund sif,which referred her for rest.it is unclear whether she received some disability payments during this period.she testified that she exhausted sick leave and vacation leave,ceased earning a salary in,and fell behind on her mortgage.she asked for permission to return to work because she needed the money.she continued treatment once she returned to work.
on february,valentín filed an administrative complaint before the unit of the puerto rico department of labor the complaint was referred to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc under a agreement.on the complaint,valentín lists the municipality,cruz,and vélez as having discriminated against her.the complaint alleges sexual harassment by cruz and retaliation by cruz and other supervisors.it was only after valentín filed the administrative complaint that there was any investigation of her claims of harassment the mayor then ordered an internal investigation 
valentín returned to work on october,and was assigned to the san antonio station house.she and another officer were assigned to do foot patrols.the other officer was armed valentín was not.her psychiatrist recommended that she work at an office or on dispatch,to avoid having to intervene with people.after eighteen days of foot patrol,valentín was assigned to a state police station classifying complaints,which she did until january.valentín testified that she was supervised there by a state police sergeant,but also that she was visited once or twice a week by the commissioner,ferrer,and cruz.she left because of these visits,which made her too uncomfortable to continue working and forced her to once again seek time off and treatment from the sif.
on january,while away from work and under treatment,valentín filed this lawsuit in the puerto rico federal district court,alleging violations of title vii and law.she named as defendants the municipality,cruz,and vélez.she later added méndez,the mayor,as a defendant.
on january,she received clearance from sif to return to work.she returned that very day,signing in for duty and remaining at the station house until noon,when she was summoned to the human resources department.there she was given a letter written by the mayor,dated january.it was a letter of intent to lay off the reason given was that she had not reported to work for over days.the parties stipulated that valentín was terminated from employment as per this letter.in response to this discharge,valentín amended the complaint that she had already filed in the federal district court to include an additional retaliation claim and a due process claim.
the district court dismissed valentín title vii claims against méndez,cruz,and vélez,applying district court precedent to the effect that title vii does not impose liability on individuals.valentín does not appeal this determination.this left,as to the individual defendants,the law claims.the district court denied the individual defendants motion to dismiss these claims as,holding that valentín had tolled the statute of limitations on her law claims when she filed her administrative complaint on february.the court did grant méndez motion to dismiss the claims against him in his personal capacity.after valentín rested her case at trial,the court dismissed the claims against vélez.
the jury found the municipality liable for in compensatory damages on the title vii claim.the jury awarded against the municipality and against cruz individually in compensatory damages on the law claims.finally,the jury found the municipality liable for in compensatory damages on the due process claim.the total initial jury award was.after the verdict,valentín sought and obtained reinstatement and doubling of the damages on the law claims this doubling of the law amounts resulted in a total jury award that just topped million.the court denied the defendants joint motion requesting judgment notwithstanding the verdict,remittitur of the damages award,or a new trial.cruz and the municipality appeal.
legal standards 
valentín title vii and law claims alleged both sexual harassment and retaliation for her complaints about the harassment the sexual harassment case encompassed both the theories of hostile work environment and quid pro quo.the claims also invoke the law on employer liability for the harassing acts of a and a supervisor.
under title vii of the civil rights act of,it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge or otherwise to discriminate against a person with respect to compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of the person sex.a.
one way of violating title vii is requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.harris forklift,d.in city of providence,cir,we described the essence of a hostile work environment claim title vii allows a plaintiff to prove unlawful discrimination by showing that the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.id.at quoting harris,at.some internal quotation marks omitted.in,we described the sufficiently severe or pervasive element as one of several a plaintiff must establish to show a hostile work environment 
that she or he is a member of a protected class that she was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment that the harassment was based upon sex that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of plaintiff employment and create an abusive work environment that sexually objectionable conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive,such that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive and the victim in fact did perceive it to be so and that some basis for employer liability has been established.
application of the hostile work environment test requires an assessment of the totality of the circumstances,including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.harris,at.although offhand remarks and isolated incidents are not enough,e vidence of sexual remarks,innuendoes,ridicule,and intimidation may be sufficient to support a jury verdict for a hostile work environment,at.
quid pro quo sexual harassment also violates title vii.in this form of harassment,an employee or supervisor uses his or her superior position to extract sexual favors from a subordinate employee,and if denied those favors,retaliates by taking action adversely affecting the subordinate employment.id.at see also universidad metropolitana,cir under title vii,quid pro quo sexual harassment can be shown where a supervisor uses employer processes to punish a subordinate for refusing to comply with sexual demands.
retaliation,yet another basis for liability under title vii,is discrimination against an employee because the employee has,inter alia,opposed an unlawful employment practice under title vii or made a charge or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under title vii.a.a retaliation claim requires a showing that the plaintiff engaged in protected conduct she was subjected to an adverse employment action and there was a causal connection between the first and second elements.noviello city of boston,cir.protected conduct includes not only the filing of administrative complaints,but also complaining to one supervisors.benoit technical,cir.an employment action,to be adverse,must materially change the conditions of the plaintiff employment examples include disadvantageous transfers or assignments and unwarranted negative job evaluations.gu boston police dep t,cir quoting intercontinental trading,cir.
once the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of retaliation,the defendant must articulate a legitimate,reason for its employment decision.if the defendant meets this burden,the plaintiff must now show that the proffered legitimate reason is in fact a pretext and that the job action was the result of the defendant retaliatory animus.dep t of justice,cir.the defendant burden is one of production only the burden of persuasion remains on the plaintiff.provencher cvs pharmacy,cir.
where the plaintiff has shown sexual harassment by a supervisor,the employer is not necessarily strictly liable for the supervisor misconduct.under ellerth and faragher,where a supervisor here,cruz is involved,there are a series of specialized rules and defenses depending on whether there has been a tangible employment action.we recently summarized the rules for cases of actionable discrimination by supervisors 
an employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the employee.
where no tangible employment action is taken,a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages,subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
no affirmative defense is available when the supervisor harassment culminates in a tangible employment action,such as discharge,demotion,or undesirable reassignment.
the affirmative defense,when available,comprises two necessary elements a that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior,and b that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.the employer bears the burden of proof as to both elements.
as to the first element of the defense,proof of an policy with a complaint procedure available to employees,while not necessarily dispositive,is relevant.
as to the second element of the defense,proof that the employee failed to meet his obligation of using reasonable care is not limited to an unreasonable failure to use such a procedure,although such proof will normally suffice to meet the employer burden.

sufficiency of the evidence of harassment and retaliation 
we review de novo the district court denial of the defense motions under rule for judgment as a matter of law.white dep t of,cir.we review the evidence and draw inferences from it in the light most favorable to the verdict,making no determinations of our own as to the credibility of witnesses or the weight of the evidence,reversing only if a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion of the jury.id.the jury was not asked to distinguish among hostile work environment,other forms of sexual harassment such as quid pro quo,and retaliation in finding liability under title vii and law.each and every potential basis of liability was supported by ample evidence.
harassment 
there are two themes to the defendants arguments.the first is that the incidents here were too minimal to support a hostile work environment or quid pro quo claim as a matter of law.the second is a attack on valentín credibility.the second can be quickly dispatched.credibility of witnesses is simply not a basis for attacking a jury verdict in a sufficiency of the evidence challenge.see id.
as for the first defense theory,the jury,which heard the witnesses,rejected the defense of triviality and,on the facts here,was entitled to do so.the picture painted by the defense focuses on cruz comments and argues that any woman,particularly a police officer,could handle them.the defense ignores the conduct of constant efforts at physical proximity,his repeatedly cruising by valentín house,the chance meeting at the shopping mall,his leaving a note under the windshield wiper of her car saying she was his.the defense also ignores that the repeated visits of the commissioner,cruz,and ferrer while valentín was working at the state police station made her so uncomfortable that she was unable to continue working.
the defense ignores that cruz threatened to and did make compliance with his demands a condition of avoiding punishment at work.he threatened valentín that she would be screwed if she would not react more affectionately to his unwanted advances.the threat was not an empty one.he had already seen to it that she received unfavorable work assignments he effectively admitted to her at las cascadas that her continued posting there was his doing through his and his friend ferrer mutual control over the work assignments,and that it could be avoided if she would acquiesce.valentín was removed from the privileged traffic division and singled out for extra double shifts and for extended posting at las cascadas,above and beyond what ordinarily would be expected.and the jury could conclude that cruz delivered an admonishment letter to valentín,had his friend ferrer do the same,and had his friend vélez simultaneously deliver news of a internal complaint,as a form of reprisal for her refusal to give in to his demands and as a method of deterring her from complaining to the commissioner.
retaliation 
the municipality argues that there was insufficient evidence of retaliation this argument is without merit.
in october,valentín engaged in protected conduct by complaining about cruz sexual harassment to norma gonzalez,attempting to complain to the commissioner,and complaining to vélez.all three were proper people to whom to complain.and beginning in that very same month,valentín was assigned extra double shifts,removed from her favorable traffic duty,and given an unusually long posting at las cascadas,where the work was remote and solitary.the jury could easily regard the totality of these assignments,following swiftly on the heels of her complaints,as well as the disciplinary letters,as adverse employment actions caused by valentín complaints.
on february,valentín said she was going to complain to the commissioner,and cruz responded as soon as she arrived by giving her an admonishment letter.when valentín reiterated her desire to speak with the commissioner,vélez gave her a document about an alleged disciplinary problem,and ferrer gave her another admonishment letter.the letters were adverse employment actions.see,at memorandum of admonishment is adverse employment action.the jury could find that they were causally related to valentín protected conduct,both in the recent past and as contemplated in the immediate her stated intentions to pursue the matter that very day never came to fruition,because she was driven past the breaking point by these very tactics.
the municipality does not,on appeal,address any of these incidents.it focuses only on termination.even assuming this narrow focus to be warranted,it fails.
on february,valentín filed an administrative complaint about the sexual harassment and retaliation that she had suffered to date.on january,she filed this lawsuit.by the end of that month,she had been terminated the municipality says this was not an adverse employment action because it was a statutory termination that became when valentín failed to avail herself of certain procedures under puerto rico law.the municipality relies on laws ann.tit,part of the workmen compensation act.that provision provides that an employer must reserve the position of an employee out on disability as valentín was here and reinstate her,provided,inter alia,that the employee demands reinstatement within a year of the date her disability began.id.the municipality argues,on the basis of this provision,that valentín termination was statutory because she took too long to seek reinstatement the municipality uses this same argument to say that even if valentín made a prima facie showing of retaliation,it rebutted that showing by proving that it had a legitimate reason for the termination and that it would have taken the same action in any event,to comply with.
nothing in this provision of puerto rico law means that the employer is obliged to terminate an employee,even after a year has elapsed.the municipality suggests that this provision,meant to protect disabled workers,somehow creates a duty to fire them if they have not requested reinstatement by a certain time,even if the employers are willing to grant extra time.the suggestion that the municipality had to terminate valentín to comply with this provision,or that hers was a statutory termination,contravenes the supreme court of puerto rico clear policy that the workmen compensation act must be liberally construed in favor of those whom it seeks to protect.garcía díaz darex,certified translation supplied by defendants see also,cir.the municipality was free to reinstate valentín at any time,whether or not a year had passed.
although the municipality did not have to fire valentín,we assume arguendo that the duration of valentín second,extended absence from work could have been a legitimate reason for termination of her employment.even so,the jury was not compelled to find that this was in fact the cause of her termination,or that the termination was not an adverse employment action 
lack of jury instruction 
the municipality argues that the court should have given it the benefit of a instruction.the municipality has taken the position that cruz was valentín supervisor.it argues that even if the record shows that there was severe and pervasive harassment,there still was no tangible employment action taken against her,and so it was entitled to assert the affirmative defense under 
the municipality has not pointed to where in the record it ever requested a instruction.such a request does not appear in the defendants joint proposed jury instructions,submitted before trial.in any event,the matter arose before the court instructed the jury,when the court noted that the municipality policy itself was not in evidence.the court reasoned that this omission meant the jury had no way of knowing what opportunities,provided by the municipality,valentín had failed to pursue.counsel for cruz said w e have no objections to the court not giving a faragher instruction we know the manual is not in evidence.counsel for the municipality stood silently by,as the municipality concedes in its reply brief.there were no objections after the jury charge was given.
valentín argues that the municipality expressly waived the faragher ellerth defense.the municipality counters that cruz attorney did not speak for it.although valentín asserts that there was a arrangement under which cruz waiver was binding on the municipality,and it appears that defense counsel did de facto divide up many tasks,she has not pointed to any record evidence of a binding arrangement.we therefore give the municipality the benefit of the doubt and treat the issue as forfeited,not waived,and we review for plain error.see.d.
this means the municipality must show that an error was committed,that it was plain meaning obvious,that the error was prejudicial meaning it affected substantial rights,and that review is needed to prevent a miscarriage of justice meaning that the error seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.rivera castillo autokirey,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting smith kmart,cir muñiz rovira,cir.
the municipality does not explain why the failure to give the instruction is plain error,and in any event it can not make such a showing.plain error review requires that there be an error.there was none.as this court recently observed,w here the evidence shows that the defendant can not prove an affirmative defense under the faragher standard,there is no reason to remand for the giving of a faragher instruction,at.although there was testimony that the municipality had an policy,there is no evidence that it was distributed or that employees of the police department knew about it until after several of the crucial events in this case there is no basis in the evidence that would permit a finding that the municipality exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior.
further,the municipality has made no case that valentín unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.assuming such opportunities were even open to valentín,in fact and not just on paper,she pursued them.she attempted to,to several different individuals who were proper people to whom to complain.she was ignored or worse at every turn.the municipality point that none of her complaints were in writing is a non sequitur in light of its failure to show that complaints had to be in writing.
due process claim 
the jury awarded valentín in compensatory damages for the municipality failure to comply with her federal due process rights.the basis of this claim was that valentín,as a tenured municipal employee,was entitled to a hearing before she was deprived of her employment,and that the municipality did not provide such a hearing.
the municipality argues that the issue was a pure one of law for the court and it was an error to submit it to a jury.it argues that valentín has no due process claim because even if she originally had a property interest in the position as a permanent employee,she lost that interest.that,it argues,is because as a matter of law,she lost her job by operation of the workmen compensation act,laws ann.tit,when more than as a year under,see torres gonzález star kist caribe,official translation available at wl elapsed since she last reported to work and because this statutory discharge became final and when she failed to take an administrative appeal.according to the municipality,the district court erred as a matter of law in creat ing the impression of voluntary discharge.the argument fails for two reasons the municipality never presented it to the district court,and the premise of the argument itself is wrong.
the municipality did not object to the jury instruction on due process,either before or after it was given.the municipality says that its failure to preserve the issue as to the jury instructions does not matter,because this matter was brought up by the defendants at trial as an issue of law that should have been resolved by the district court and should have not been an issue for the jury to resolve.the municipality does not support this claim of preservation at trial with any citations to the record the municipality can not sandbag the court and its opponent by not raising the issue and then saying the court should have seen it.
we have already rejected the municipality reading of.i t is merely the employee absolute right not to be terminated on account of her disability,rather than her property interest in her employment position,which lapses under the workers compensation caducity provision,at.valentín did have a property interest in her employment.that interest could not be taken away without the provision of procedural due process,including a hearing,the right to which did not lapse automatically on any particular date.see id.at.
the evidence permitted the jury to find that valentín had an ongoing property interest in her job and that she was terminated from her job without an opportunity for hearing 
statute of limitations defense as to law 
the district court denied the individual defendants motion to dismiss the law claims as time barred.cruz,who raises a timeliness challenge on appeal,is affected because law was the only basis for the damages award against him,and for the doubling of the award 
under puerto rico law,law claims must be brought within one year.see laws ann.matos ortiz puerto rico,d,collecting cases.cruz argues that the last act of sexual harassment was in november of,that the statute ran in november of,and that the civil complaint was filed in january of.there are several responses,including the response that cruz ignores the fact that valentín also complained of an ongoing pattern of harassment and retaliation well after november.
in order to resolve what may be a recurring issue,though,we focus on the legal ground used by the district court to reject cruz argument.the court held that valentín tolled the statute of limitations on the law claim when she filed her administrative complaint on february,because the complaint contained the identical cause of action as that later raised in the civil suit.
under puerto rico law,the statute of limitations is tolled by a plaintiff extrajudicial claim.laws ann.tit.the tolling is effective with regard only to identical causes of action.puerto rico,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting rodriguez narvaez nazario,cir.the relief sought in the extrajudicial claim must be the same as that later sought in court.id.at.
cruz argues that,as a matter of law,valentín charge before the eeoc can not be identical to the district court complaint against him,because it is doubtful there can be a title vii complaint against an individual because a cause of action against him could not have been brought under title vii,he says,the eeoc complaint could not have been identical with,and did not toll the statute of limitations on,valentín law claim against him.
cruz entire argument rests on the premise that valentín administrative claim was originally brought before the eeoc under title vii exclusively.this premise is incorrect.the claim was originally filed before the unit of the puerto rico department of labor and it was not brought exclusively under title vii.
valentín listed cruz among those who had discriminated against her.she alleged,inter alia,that she had been the victim of sexual harassment and reprisals by cruz.valentín cause of action under law is identical to that raised in the administrative complaint.the administrative charge does not explicitly cite any vii,law,or otherwise.but except for the fact that law expressly allows for individual liability,see laws ann.tit,puerto rico interprets law as congruent with title vii.the administrative complaint stated all the elements necessary for a law claim and put cruz on notice of the discrimination claim against him,as an individual.as for remedy,valentín asked for various forms of relief,including compensatory same thing she sought from cruz in the civil suit.
this was enough to toll the statute of limitations.the tolling effect continued until the conclusion of the administrative proceeding.see caribbean forms,cir.here,that conclusion was no earlier than april,the date on which the eeoc issued a determination that there was reason to believe the alleged sexual harassment and retaliation had in fact occurred.valentín had a year from that date and arguably from a later date,for reasons which are unnecessary to elaborate here to file this lawsuit,and she did so with months to spare see rodriguez narvaez,at stating that the statute of limitations begins to run anew when the tolling ends.
remittitur 
defendants argue that the damages awarded are duplicative and in any event excessive.
the municipality argues that the compensatory damages award is duplicative in two senses there is an overlap between the title vii and law claims and,second,there is an overlap between the due process claim and the title claims.in the municipality view,valentín was awarded damages for the same basic harassment and eventual times,under different legal theories.
the municipality concedes that to the extent damages are properly awarded under law,they are subject to mandatory doubling.see laws ann.tit.as to any possible overlap in damages between or among the title vii,law,and due process claims,in this circuit,the primary mechanisms to avoid impermissible duplicate awards for damages are the jury instructions and the structure of the verdict form.to the extent that a jury award on both claims would be duplicative,the proper practice is to ensure that the verdict form is structured so as to allow the jury to recompense the plaintiff injuries just once.monroig,cir.defendants should request instructions clearly directing the jury to compensate the plaintiff injuries just once.id.at.
once again,this is a defense which was given away at trial.the municipality concedes that it never objected at trial to the proposed verdict form or to the court failure to charge the jury as to any possible overlap.nor did it raise the argument after the jury returned the verdict and before the jury was discharged and the judgment was entered.in the motion seeking remittitur or a new trial,there was no argument as to duplication the only argument raised was that the damages were simply excessive in light of the evidence.
the municipality falls back,in its reply brief,on plain error review.see chestnut city of lowell,cir en banc.but it still does not explain how the doctrine helps it.that argument is waived for lack of appellate development.see united states zannino,cir.
we turn,then,to the claim that,aside from any possible duplication,the sums awarded were simply too great in light of the evidence.even if we viewed the award as quite generous,that is not the test.the award will not be overturned unless it is grossly excessive or so high as to shock the conscience of this court,at.further,w e accord broad discretion to the trial court decision to affirm the jury award of damages because of that court greater familiarity with local community standards and with the witnesses demeanor at the trial.brown freedman baking,cir.
there was,to begin with,evidence of serious economic damages.valentín was wrongfully deprived of her salary,both when she was driven by defendants conduct to take disability leaves,and later when she was terminated outright moreover,while she was out of work,she lost her house and her car,and she and her children were forced to move into an abandoned house,at jury may consider secondary economic injuries flowing from the plaintiffs loss of earnings.because of these damages and because of the harassment and threat of reprisals,valentín suffered various forms of emotional damages and mental anguish,including,inter alia,insomnia,anxiety,guilt,and depression.the jury could believe this suffering was real and severe,based not only on valentín testimony that it was,but also on the fact of the nervous breakdown and the fact that she received extended psychological treatment from the sif.see,at upholding award based on similar emotional distress,and collecting cases.there was ample evidence that it was defendants own continued and varied misconduct which caused the harms suffered by valentín.the award was not excessive.
cruz adds his own argument that even if he harassed valentín,it was only from august of to november of,or at most to february of,and she did not suffer any financial damages or adequately proven emotional distress during this time.the argument ignores both the ample evidence of emotional damages during that very period and the fact that the evidence supported a conclusion that cruz instigated and participated in later harassment and retaliation.more fundamentally,cruz artificial time limit is based on the mistaken legal premise that a defendant is not liable for damages which flow from his own actions in violation of law and are reasonably foreseeable.see laws ann.tit,person responsible for harassment is liable for the damages that the action has caused,plus mandatory doubling emphasis added.
denial of motion for new trial 
decisions by the trial court to deny a motion for a new trial are reviewed for abuse of discretion,at.trial judges have more leeway to grant new trials than to set aside verdicts based on insufficiency of the evidence under rule.they may consider their view of the credibility of the witnesses in doing so,but must be careful not to invade the jury province.see macquarrie howard johnson,cir.and they may grant a new trial only if they are convinced that the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence,such that letting it stand would result in a miscarriage of justice,at,at.given our account of the evidence supporting liability and damages,and the absence of any error at trial the trial judge certainly did not abuse her discretion in denying a new trial.
reinstatement 
we review a district court decision to award equitable relief for an abuse of discretion.selgas am.airlines,cir.we review deferentially,keeping in mind the purposes of the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions,such as title vii dual purposes of eliminating discrimination and making its victims whole.id.
the municipality argues valentín was not entitled to reinstatement,largely on the basis of its theory that valentín claim to her job automatically expired as a matter of law our earlier discussion disposes of that.
a second argument is made that a federal court,remedying a violation of a federal employment statute,may not order reinstatement because a state,the puerto rico agency known as exclusive jurisdiction over a personnel claim.not surprisingly,there is no support offered for the municipality confusion of basic principles.the municipality cites a statute,laws ann.tit,which does not establish jasap exclusive power at all.it also relies on municipality of comerio,cir,a political discrimination case,which lends no support to the municipality position.the plaintiffs in lost before jasap,which found that their dismissals were not politically motivated,and the puerto rico supreme court affirmed.id.at.this court held that puerto rico issue preclusion doctrine ended the matter for purposes of the lawsuit in federal courts.id.at.here,of course,there can be no argument that valentín is collaterally estopped by any factual finding of jasap or the puerto rico courts.did not in any way limit the principle that congress specifies the remedies for violation of federal law such as title vii and has not ceded that power to the states or to puerto rico 
the district court took into account the requisite equitable considerations,including the fact that valentín original hiring was valid,that she met the eligibility requirements for her job,and that she had not found comparable work.the municipality cites not a single equitable factor in support of its position.there was no abuse of discretion in the decision to order reinstatement,which is,after all,the preferred remedy under title vii.selgas,at.
the judgment is affirmed.costs are awarded to plaintiff.
valentín also had been a police officer from or to,leaving for reasons not material to this case.
cruz conceded frequently driving by,but he said this was because his house was nearby,and he denied honking his horn.
gonzalez denied that valentín had ever complained to her about cruz.but ortiz testified that valentín said she was going to complain to gonzalez about cruz and that valentín did tell gonzalez that she needed to talk to her about cruz.
cruz testified that valentín did not complain.all the officers had to work at las cascadas once in a while.but long assignments there were seen as punishment.
valentín testified that cruz told her that ferrer had it in for her,that so far he cruz had been protecting her from ferrer,and that this supposed protection would cease if she would not be more affectionate.
the mayor denies this he testified that valentín never came to complain about sexual harassment before february.
the mayor testified that he initiated the internal investigation after learning that valentín had complained to the state police.neither party has called this complaint to our attention.we need only note that,from the record,it appears that this complaint the events of february,and was essentially contemporaneous with the administrative complaint.
cruz and the municipality say the standards for liability governing title vii claims are the same as those governing law claims,see universidad metropolitana,cir,and they argue only under title vii standards.as this approach only simplifies matters for valentín,we proceed solely under title vii.
cruz makes no such argument,apparently on the assumption that his liability under law must have been based only on sexual harassment.this might be correct,but is not necessarily so.the jury charge was somewhat ambiguous,and the verdict form even more so the latter arguably permitted the jury to find cruz liable under law for retaliation.cruz has not argued that this did not happen,or that if it did,it would have been impermissible.in any event,cruz sufficiency challenge fails on the ground he did understand to be implicated assuming the jury held him liable only on the sexual harassment theory,that finding was amply supported.
the municipality,stressing the timing,argues that the termination was not causally connected to the administrative complaint.but the mayor conceded at trial that,in signing the termination letter,he took into consideration the fact that valentín had filed a claim against the municipality.it is unclear whether he was referring to the administrative complaint or the civil suit,filed less than a month earlier,but the municipality fails to address this point at all.
the municipality also argues that the termination became when valentín failed to contest it within the time frame prescribed by state law.it is unclear whether this argument is meant to be distinct from the statutory termination argument under.in any event,the municipality cites no additional authority for any time frame other than the one in.
the municipality goes so far as to suggest that valentín was not terminated.this contention is plainly contrary to the record,including the parties stipulations.
the municipality goes beyond seeking a new trial.it claims it was actually entitled to judgment as a matter of law against any liability for cruz conduct.it argues that a properly instructed jury not only might have found,but would have been compelled to find,that the defense was satisfied.but in the motion requesting judgment notwithstanding the verdict and other relief,the defense failed to discuss the defense at all.the argument,even if it had been preserved,fails for the reasons stated in the text.
valentín first received a copy of the municipality policy in november she had never,as an employee,attended a seminar where that policy was explained.ortiz also testified that until,she had never been given a copy of the municipality policy.vélez testified that he did not recall receiving any sexual harassment training from the municipality before february.the mayor testified that the policy should have been distributed to employees within weeks of its adoption in september,but he did not recall how the policy was actually distributed.
the municipality may be referring to an argument made by cruz attorney in support of a rule motion at the clo
