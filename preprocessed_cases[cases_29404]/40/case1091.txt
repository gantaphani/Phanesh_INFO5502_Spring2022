opinion of the court 
the plaintiffs in this special education case,patrick,a minor child,and his parents,rita and michael,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendant,the west chester area school district district.the plaintiffs made claims under the individuals with disabilities in education act idea,of the rehabilitation act of,and,alleging that the district denied patrick a free and appropriate public education fape and violated the idea obligations.the district court granted summary judgment to the district and applied the idea statute of limitations,which took effect on july,to the idea claims.it applied pennsylvania personal injury statute of limitations to the claims.the district,arguing that the idea statute of limitations should apply to the claims.we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the district,but will not reach the idea statute of limitations issue.we disagree with the district court application of pennsylvania personal injury statute of limitations to the plaintiffs claims,and hold that the federal idea statute of limitations applies to those claims.
background 
a.the idea and the rehabilitation act 
the idea requires that institutions receiving federal education funding provide a free and appropriate public education fape to disabled children.a.a school district provides a fape by designing and implementing an individualized instructional program set forth in an individualized education plan iep,which must be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive meaningful educational benefits in light of the student intellectual potential.shore reg l high sch.bd.of educ,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the school district must conduct an evaluation of the student needs,assessing all areas of suspected disability,before providing special education and related services to the child.b.
the idea also requires that a state have a system in place to identify,locate,and evaluate all children in the state who have disabilities and need special education and related services.a a.pennsylvania codifies its child find duties at.
section of the rehabilitation act,prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by programs that receive federal funds.under,recipients of federal funds must provide a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient jurisdiction,regardless of the nature or severity of the person handicap.a.the claims in this case made under are parallel to the idea claims.
in december of,congress passed amendments to the idea,which had an effective date of july.the previous version of the idea did not have a statute of limitations.the amendments,which we will refer to as,included an explicit statute of limitations 
a parent or agency shall request an impartial due process hearing within years of the date the parent or agency knew or should have known about the alleged action that forms the basis of the complaint,or,if the state has an explicit time limitation for requesting such a hearing under this subchapter,in such time as the state law allows.
f c.pennsylvania does not have a separate explicit time limitation for these types of claims.prior to,we had held that there was no federal statute of limitations for compensatory education claims,in ridgewood board of education,cir.in bernardsville board of education,cir,we held that there was a one to statute of limitations for tuition reimbursement claims.
includes two exceptions to the statute of limitations period.the period does not apply when the parent was prevented from requesting a due process hearing because of either 
i specific misrepresentations by the local educational agency that it had resolved the problem forming the basis of the complaint or 
ii the local educational agency withholding of information from the parent that was required under this subchapter to be provided to the parent.
the and michael and their son patrick,who was years old at the time the complaint was within the boundaries of the district,but patrick has never attended public school.during the school years,when he was in kindergarten through third grade,patrick went to a parochial school,maximillian kolbe max.during the summer of,and in the school year,when he was in fourth grade,he attended the benchmark school benchmark,a private school for children with disabilities.
the district is obligated under the idea to identify and locate children who need special education services.it puts annual notices in the general circulation newspaper that inform parents about the availability of evaluations and the procedures for making an evaluation request,including that requests must be in writing,that there must be written consent to evaluate,and that there are timelines for requesting due process.the district provides the same information on its website and over public access television,and puts posters and pamphlets with this information in both district school buildings and in private schools within the district.homeowners receive this information in their property tax bills.the district also trains principals and staff at private schools about the referral processes and child find issues.during the time relevant to the plaintiff case,the pennsylvania department of education found that the district was compliant with its child find obligations.
according to the plaintiffs,rita first requested that patrick be evaluated for special education services in january of,after he had shown problems with reading in kindergarten.based on his kindergarten teacher recommendation,patrick received title i reading services from the chester county intermediate unit during his first grade year,in and.title i is designed to help students reach state academic achievement levels private school students are guaranteed these services under.
rita claims that in early she contacted carol gaspar,the max guidance counselor,and michele mccann,then the district supervisor of special education,seeking evaluation for patrick.the plaintiffs contend that gaspar contacted district psychologist virginia sutton about patrick,and personally delivered referral documents to the district in april of.as noted below,these individuals have denied that these contacts occurred.carol gaspar,the guidance counselor assigned to max,testified that she had no recollection of any letter from the plaintiffs requesting evaluation,and no copy of the letter.rita could not produce a copy of the letter,either.virginia sutton,the school psychologist who facilitated school referrals in the relevant part of the district,had no record of any conversation with any of the plaintiffs or any documentation regarding patrick,despite what the appeals panel called her extraordinarily thorough and meticulous system.app.as we will discuss further below,we agree with the hearing officer,the appeals panel,and the district court that the district did not receive notice of patrick need to be evaluated in early.
the plaintiffs privately retained a psychologist,tracy burke,who evaluated patrick in april of and found that he had difficulties with reading,reading comprehension,written expression,and integration.in june of,a vision evaluator determined that patrick needed vision therapy.he received vision therapy and title i reading services through his year.
on november,during patrick year,the plaintiffs wrote directly to the district requesting an evaluation of patrick and informing the district that a private evaluator,lisi levisohn,was expected to evaluate patrick eligibility for special education services on december.susan amsterdam,a district psychologist,interpreted the letter to be a request for eligibility evaluation,and on november,the district sent two forms to the parents a release of records form and a parent input form.the release informed the plaintiffs that there would be an process before the district issued the permission to evaluate form pte and that the district receipt of the signed form would start the clock on the timeline to complete the evaluation.the plaintiffs filled out and returned the forms to the district,enclosing a copy of burke evaluation of patrick.
on december,the district sent copies of the releases to the guidance counselor at max and to levisohn.in mid to late january of,the district assembled a child study team to determine whether to issue a pte.the pte was issued on february,calendar days after the date of the plaintiff november,letter.
amsterdam,the district psychologist,suggested to the plaintiffs that they not sign the initial pte,since it would have to be amended once levisohn private evaluation of patrick was complete.she assured the plaintiffs that it would not take long to send out a new form.they did not sign the initial pte.levisohn sent amsterdam a list of the evaluation measures she had used,and noted that her report was not yet finished.amsterdam decided not to issue a new pte until the district had levisohn complete report,which it received on april.levisohn found that patrick qualified for special education services because he was both learning disabled and mentally gifted.on april,the district sent a revised pte,which the parents signed and mailed back on april,days after the first form was mailed.the form instructed the plaintiffs that the district had school days to complete its evaluation of patrick.the district began testing patrick in early june of.
before the district began testing patrick,on the advice of levisohn,the plaintiffs visited the benchmark school.they liked the school,and applied for the school year.the early admissions process required the plaintiffs to declare patrick candidacy for the fall term by april,and in the spring of,the plaintiffs asked teachers at max to complete questionnaires required by benchmark and went to a family interview.in late may or early june of,benchmark accepted patrick for both the summer program and for the school year.in early june,the plaintiffs sent a tuition deposit to benchmark.they financed the benchmark tuition through ams,a program that fronts the entire year tuition to a private school and requires that parents repay the bank on a monthly basis,with limited opportunity for parents to opt out of full payment if their child does not attend the private school.
in july of,the district completed testing patrick and produced a preliminary evaluation report er,which it sent to the family.on august,the plaintiffs wrote to dispute the draft er,because it did not identify a specific learning disability in math computation and did not include assessments of patrick social and emotional function the plaintiffs also informed the district that patrick would enroll at benchmark for the school year,and that they had no alternative because the district iep would not be offered until after the beginning of the school year.app.
the district finalized the report and sent it to the family on september,before the beginning of the school year.the report incorporated many of levisohn findings,and identified a specific learning disability in written expression and reading.although levisohn had not recommended occupational therapy,the district report included such a recommendation.
the school year began on september.patrick attended benchmark.on september or,the plaintiffs received an invitation from the district to participate in an iep meeting.on september,the individualized education program team met to develop an iep.at that meeting,rita signed the revised september,er.the iep the district developed provided for occupational therapy and small group direct instruction for language arts,math,and gifted needs.it also addressed patrick spelling and keyboard skills and noted that he qualified for enrollment in the gifted program.the iep included a long list of annual goals for patrick and specific instructions on how his progress was to be measured,in addition to specially designed instruction and program modifications.the plaintiffs did not approve the iep.
c.the administrative process and the district court decision 
the plaintiffs filed a due process complaint on october,alleging claims under the idea,of the rehabilitation act,and the pennsylvania school code.they sought compensatory education for the alleged child find violations during the and school years and for an alleged denial of a fape,payment for an independent educational evaluation iee for the due process hearing,reimbursement for the two previous iees,reimbursement for vision therapy in and,and tuition reimbursement for patrick time at benchmark in the summer of and the school year.
the hearing officer limited the idea and claims to those arising after october,applying the statute of limitations.she concluded that the district fulfilled its child find obligations and that the district er and iep were appropriate,and that the parents were not entitled to compensatory education between october and may,reimbursement for vision therapy,or tuition reimbursement.the hearing officer awarded hours of compensatory education for the period from may,to june,on the theory that if the district had been more prompt about its evaluation and iep,a fape should have been available to patrick on may,and his parents could have transferred him to a public school in the district for the last six weeks of the school year.
both the plaintiffs and the district filed exceptions before the appeal panel.the panel held that the hearing officer had erred in awarding compensatory education because it is not an available remedy for private school students who are placed there unilaterally by their parents.see.the panel wrote that 
t he record in its entirety compels a conclusion contrary to the decision of the hearing officer.the hearing officer based her decision as to compensatory education on facts not in evidence,that the student could have been enrolled in the public school during that period and,contrary to evidence presented and testimony given.the letter to the district in november as well as the parent testimony clearly demonstrates the parents were not planning to move the student to the district until at least the year therefore,because the student was enrolled in a private school,and not in the district,and because the clear testimony indicates that even if the district had completed the evaluation in a timely manner,the student would have remained in the private school leads this panel to the conclusion that compensatory education is not available.
app.the panel affirmed the rest of the hearing officer decision.
the plaintiffs then filed this federal case seeking reversal of the two prior decisions and adding a claim.on may,the district court granted the district motion for disposition on the administrative record and for summary judgment.the court granted summary judgment for the district on the plaintiffs claims,citing our decision in jersey city public schools,cir,in which we held that is not an available remedy for violations of the idea and the rehabilitation act,because both statutes have sufficiently comprehensive remedial schemes.like the hearing officer and the appeal panel,the district court applied the statute of limitations to the plaintiffs claims,barring any claims arising before october,two years before the plaintiffs requested a due process hearing.it concluded that the district did not violate its child find obligations,and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to compensatory education or tuition reimbursement.the district court denied the district request to apply statute of limitations to the claims,instead applying pennsylvania personal injury statute of limitations.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the plaintiffs made claims under the idea,of the rehabilitation act of,and.the district court had jurisdiction under i a and.we have jurisdiction under.
as discussed above,this case came to the district court after the parents filed a due process complaint before a hearing officer both parties filed exceptions to the officer decision and the case went to a special education appeals panel.the parents then filed a federal complaint.in reviewing a dispute brought under the idea administrative process,a district court gives due weight and deference to the findings in the administrative proceedings.bd.of educ.rowley,d.we have described this due weight standard as modified de novo review.sch.dist.of the city of newark,cir.factual findings from the administrative proceedings are to be considered prima facie correct,and if the reviewing court does not adhere to those findings,it is obliged to explain why.id.at citation omitted.under the special education system in place at the time this case was going through the administrative process,district courts owe more deference to the findings of the appeals panel than to those of the hearing officer carlisle area sch.scott,cir.
the statute of limitations claims and the plaintiffs claims for compensatory education and tuition reimbursement are subject to plenary review as conclusions of law.the other the family proved an exception to the statute of limitations,and whether the district fulfilled its fape subject to clear error review as questions of fact.see,at.the plaintiffs cite wexler westfield board of education,cir,for the proposition that the application of the idea requirements to a student medical and educational needs is a mixed question of law and fact,but our later precedent makes it clear that t he issue of whether an iep is appropriate is a question of fact.carlisle,at.
section of the rehabilitation act statute of limitations 
this case poses an issue of first impression whether statute of limitations should apply to parallel claims under of the rehabilitation act.section does not have its own statute of limitations.
the district court applied pennsylvania personal injury statute of limitations to the plaintiffs claims,citing the strong preference for importing an analogous state statute of limitations when federal statutes do not include an express statute of limitations.delcostello int l of teamsters,d haggerty usair,cir.the district argues that the district court erred when it applied the personal injury statute of limitations to those claims it says that the court should have imported the statute of limitations from.the district acknowledges that prior to the passage of the idea amendments in the use of the personal injury limitations period was appropriate,but argues that the idea is so analogous to of the rehabilitation act that the idea limitations period should apply.a court may borrow a limitations period from an analogous federal law where that law clearly provides a closer analogy than the available state statutes,and when the federal policies at stake and the practicalities of litigation make that rule a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.delcostello,at.see also united steelworkers of am.crown cork seal,cir,aff sub nom.star steel thomas,d.
the idea and of the rehabilitation act do similar statutory work.the idea protects the rights of disabled children by mandating that public educational institutions identify and effectively educate those children,or pay for their education elsewhere if they require specialized services that the public institution can not provide.section of the rehabilitation act is parallel to the idea in its protection of disabled students it protects the rights of disabled children by prohibiting discrimination against students on the basis of disability,and it has child find,evaluation,and fape requirements,like the idea.the rehabilitation act is certainly closer in subject matter and goals to the idea than to the pennsylvania personal injury statute,which deals with torts against person and property.
while we have held that similarity between federal statutes is not enough to justify applying the statute of limitations from one statute to claims made under the other,see kingvision,belmont,cir t he desire to unify the limitations periods of federal laws with similar purposes is not a sufficient reason to adopt federal limitations periods,the existence and availability of a more sharply focused federal analogue is an important consideration.rossiter potter,cir.here,we consider whether to apply a general state personal injury limitations period to claims made under a federal statute with very specific goals,when congress has recently acted to include a statute of limitations in a federal statute with very similar goals.see norman singer,statutes and statutory construction ed.when two or more statutes of limitations deal with the same subject matter,the statute which is more recent and specific will prevail over the older and more general one.we also note that there are few federal statutes as closely related,and under which such similar claims may be brought,as the idea and of the rehabilitation act.
as the district court pointed out,we take seriously the supreme court admonition that analogous state statutes of limitations are to be used unless they frustrate or significantly interfere with federal polices.crown cork,at.here,we fear that applying the state statute of limitations could frustrate federal policy in certain situations.the idea has two specific exceptions to the statute of limitations the limitations period does not apply if a parent was prevented from requesting a due process hearing because of either specific misrepresentations by the school that it had resolved the problem,or the school withholding of statutorily required information from the parent.f d.there are no such exceptions to the pennsylvania statute of limitations period for personal injury claims.in addition,tolling principles that affect the application of state statutes of limitations would presumably not affect the idea statute of limitations,with its express exceptions to the limitations period.
in this case,the plaintiffs make child find and fape claims under both the idea and the rehabilitation act.all of the plaintiffs claims are premised on their idea make no separate claim of disability discrimination under.it does not make sense that the virtually identical claims made under these two statutes would be treated differently from a perspective congress has expressed an interest in promptly resolving disputes under the idea,as evidenced by its passage of the amendment.if a plaintiff was barred from asserting an idea claim because the statute of limitations had run and neither of the exceptions applied,why should the identical claim,made under the rehabilitation act,be subject to different tolling principles 
we are convinced that the idea limitations period is a better fit for education claims made under the rehabilitation act than the personal injury statute of limitations.although it appears that none of our sister circuits have faced this issue,district courts confronting the issue have concluded that claims for education under the rehabilitation act should be governed by the idea statute of limitations.see,bell bd.of educ.of albuquerque pub,wl,at,holding that the idea limitations period applies to rehabilitation act claims where all claims are for education and there are no pure discrimination claims made under the rehabilitation act.
the statute of limitations from the idea provides a closer analogy to the rehabilitation act than pennsylvania personal injury statute of limitations.under delcostello,the federal policies at stake and the practicalities of litigation make that rule a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.at.therefore,we hold that the idea statute of limitations applies to claims made for education under of the rehabilitation act.
c.the district obligations under the idea and the rehabilitation act 
next,we address whether the district court was correct that the district satisfied the requirements of the idea and the rehabilitation act in its identification and evaluation of patrick for special education services.
the plaintiffs claims before november,
the plaintiffs claim that they initially sought services for patrick in early.as we discussed above,there is no evidence in the record,apart from the testimony of rita,to support this assertion.the hearing officer found that rita claim that she had initiated the evaluation process in january of was not credible she could not provide a copy of the letter she claims she wrote,and numerous district and school employees with whom she claimed to speak have no records of their conver
