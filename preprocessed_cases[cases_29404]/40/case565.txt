carol fischer is pursuing in the united states district court for the southern district of new york a claim against,her former employer whose proper name is the division of appeals and opinions of the office of the attorney general of the state of new york oag alleging discrimination in violation of of the rehabilitation act of,et rehabilitation act or the act.oag moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that fischer was employed by oag at a policymaking level and thus was subject to the government employee rights act of gera,and,which required her to pursue her claim initially through administrative agencies,with a right of review in a federal court of appeals,rather than initiating suit in the district court,see id.b and c.the district court,andrew carter,judge,denied the motion to dismiss,ruling that gera did not apply because the record indicated that fischer position was not on a policymaking level.oag has appealed from that decision,and fischer,noting that there has been no final judgment,moves to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.oag opposes the motion,citing the collateral order doctrine.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the denial of oag motion to dismiss pursuant to gera does not qualify as an immediately appealable order under that doctrine,and we grant the motion to dismiss the appeal.
background 
some of the facts,as revealed by responsive pleadings and statements pursuant to rule of the local rules for the southern district submitted by the parties in connection with a motion by oag for summary judgment,are not in dispute.it is undisputed that for more than a decade,beginning in november,fischer,an attorney,was employed as an assistant solicitor general or asg in oag division of appeals and opinions,and that at all relevant times,oag was an entity that was receiving federal financial assistance and hence was forbidden to discriminate in employment decisions on the basis of physical disability.in,fischer was counseled about her attendance and her failure to submit briefs to oag reviewers sufficiently in advance.she informed her supervisors that she had a disability a condition known as chronic fatigue syndrome that was interfering with her work her supervisors recommended that she seek an accommodation.
fischer initial request for accommodation was to work at home if and when her illness so require d that request was denied as unreasonable in light of her documented attendance and deficiencies.the parties thereafter agreed on an accommodation by which fischer would be allowed to work at home for up to three days a month.the accommodation was originally for a period but was repeatedly renewed during the next seven years.in the spring of,oag terminated fischer employment.
a.the first two years of the present litigation 
fischer commenced the present action against oag in,asserting claims under the rehabilitation act and state law.the complaint alleges,to the extent pertinent to this appeal the claim having been dismissed by the district court,that fischer was able to perform the essential functions of her job with an accommodation that would permit her to work from home for several days a month,and that,with that accommodation over a period of some seven years beginning in,she performed her role as an assistant attorney sic general complaint,and performed it well see id.fischer alleges that when she requested a further extension of the accommodation in october,oag did not grant it and never responded or communicated with her about her request.see complaint.she alleges that the lack of continued accommodation,together with an increased workload,caused her condition to deteriorate,and in march she went on an unpaid medical leave while she was on that leave,oag terminated her employment.fischer alleges that oag failed to reasonably accommodate her disability and terminated her employment because of her disability,in violation of of the rehabilitation act.
oag filed an answer admitting a the fact and duration of fischer employment,b oag accommodation of her disability by allowing her to work several days a month at home,and c oag termination of her employment in the spring of.oag denied,inter alia,that it had denied the october accommodation request see oag answer and that fischer had performed her job adequately see,id.it alleged that she had in fact been informed that her october accommodation request was granted see id.and it affirmatively allege d that,as noted in counseling memoranda,evaluations,and other documents,there were instances where plaintiff defaulted in filing appellate briefs and otherwise failed to follow office policy,including regarding supervisory review of briefs id.
following nearly a year of discovery,oag moved for summary judgment dismissing fischer claims.it contended that her rehabilitation act claim should be dismissed because oag had provided fischer with a reasonable accommodation after being informed of her disability and that she was unable to perform the essential functions of her job even with the accommodation.in support of the latter contention,oag pointed to litigations in which fischer had failed to file timely briefs to the courts and had failed to submit her briefs to reviewers in a timely and reliable manner.in opposition,fischer pointed to personnel evaluations in that rated her diligent and highly effective.the district court denied oag motion for summary judgment dismissing the rehabilitation act claim,concluding that there were genuine issues of fact as to whether accommodation had been granted in and whether,with a reasonable accommodation,fischer could perform the essential functions of an assistant solicitor general.
some two months later,oag invoked gera in order to seek dismissal of the rehabilitation act claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
oag gera motion 
gera,whose legislative antecedents are discussed in part ii below,is designed to provide procedures to protect the rights of certain government employees,with respect to their public employment,to be free of discrimination on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,national origin,age,or disability.b emphases added see id.a citing relevant sections of title vii of the civil rights act of,et title vii,the age discrimination in employment act,et adea,the americans with disabilities act,et ada,and the rehabilitation act.gera applies to 
any individual chosen or appointed,by a person elected to public office in any state or political subdivision of any state by the qualified voters thereof 
to be a member of the elected official personal staff 
to serve the elected official on the policymaking level or 
to serve the elected official as an immediate advisor with respect to the exercise of the constitutional or legal powers of the office.
a.gera allows these individuals to enforce their rights to be free from employment discrimination on any of the above bases by filing a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc or commission,see id.b,or with an appropriate state or local administrative agency,which may attempt to remedy the practice alleged within a limited time before the commission takes action,id.d see also id.b.
fischer had been appointed by new york state attorney general,an elected official.oag asserted that as an assistant solicitor general who made recommendations as to what courses of action should be pursued,determined various positions to be taken in an appeal,and drafted opinions that were issued to state agencies and local governments,fischer was employed in a policymaking position.it argued that in order to complain of employment discrimination in violation of the rehabilitation act,fischer was thus required,under gera,to pursue that claim in an administrative proceeding and that the district court lacks jurisdiction to entertain it.
in a memorandum order dated june,the district court denied the motion,concluding that fischer could not properly be considered a policymaker.the record indicated that there were numerous asgs working for oag in the division of appeals and opinions and that there were at least two levels of management between asg fischer and the attorney general fischer reported to a deputy solicitor general,who served under the solicitor general,who,in turn,was appointed by the attorney general.fischer herself had no supervisory or management authority.a policy question would normally be directed by the attorney general to the solicitor general an asg would receive an assignment to research or write on such an issue from the solicitor general and if an asg were called on to make a presentation on the issue to the attorney general,the asg would be accompanied by the solicitor general or another supervisor.further,an asg briefs and opinions were reviewed by the solicitor general or at least one deputy solicitor general.given this record,the district court rejected oag premise that fischer was employed at a policymaking level,and hence rejected oag conclusion that gera required that her rehabilitation act claim be filed with the eeoc and deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction.
oag has appealed from the denial of that motion to dismiss.oag also asked the district court to certify its order for interlocutory review under b,a request that has been denied.fischer has moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
oag opposes the motion to dismiss its appeal,contending that denial of its motion to dismiss is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
