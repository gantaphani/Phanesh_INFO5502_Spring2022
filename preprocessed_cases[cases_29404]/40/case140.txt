early on the morning of september,agents of the drug enforcement agency dea and puerto rico police officers working as part of a joint task force went to the residence at i alondra,brisas de canóvanas,puerto rico.whether this address is technically in carolina or the adjacent town of canóvanas is not clear.one officer knocked on the door,which was opened by the home owner,silvio solis alarcón.solis alarcón says that the officers,wielding guns,then entered the home without obtaining his consent 
the officers were there to arrest juan díaz suazo.from intercepts and surveillance,the members of the task force had ample reason to believe that díaz suazo had engaged in drug transactions as a member of a major drug ring,and a warrant had been issued for his arrest.the agents aimed to arrest díaz suazo on the same day that,in accordance with an operational plan,numerous other members of the drug ring were to be taken into custody.
the dea agents belief that they would find díaz suazo at i alondra street rested on events that occurred earlier in the year.in april,task force officers identified díaz suazo as driving a red dodge durango in the course of a drug transaction,pulled him over to identify him and the vehicle and examined his license.the vehicle turned out to be registered to plaintiff silvio solis alarcón at calle alon,urb.brisas de canóvanas.at some point in september,officers on the task force made inquiries in the neighborhood of the address on díaz suazo license and concluded that he did not live at that address.
puerto rico police officers working with the task force also reported that in september they had seen díaz suazo drive the same vehicle to solis alarcón house at alondra,open the garage door or gate,park the vehicle and close the entrance the officers also reported that the garage door or gate door had been opened by díaz suazo through some kind of automatic or electronic device.the officers remained outside for about minutes no one emerged from the house or garage.
although the dea agents who entered the house on september,had a valid arrest warrant for díaz suazo,they had no warrant to search the house.dea agents felton cameron and greg calam questioned solis alarcón and his wife migdalia márquez roberto both of whom denied that díaz suazo lived at the house and said they did not know where he was.solis alarcón then accompanied the officers as they conducted a to minute search of the house while his wife remained in the living room answering questions.díaz suazo was not found in the house but the agents did seize the dodge from the garage as one that had been used in a drug crime,although it was later returned as failing to meet the minimum value warranting forfeiture under dea policy.
two years later,in september,solis alarcón and his wife filed this action seeking million for emotional distress and punitive damages stemming from the search.the amended complaint asserted fourth amendment claims against the two dea agents named above,based on bivens six unknown named agents of fed.bureau of narcotics,d,and tort claims against the united states for the agents conduct asserted under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,
after discovery,the government and the agents sought summary judgment.in september,the district court granted summary judgment for the agents on the bivens claims,concluding that the agents were protected by qualified immunity.the court later dismissed the ftca claims,reasoning that its bivens analysis negated the fault element required for tort recovery under puerto rico law.these two legal rulings,which we review de novo,are the focus of the present appeal and we start with the bivens claims.
it is settled fourth amendment law that an arrest warrant founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to believe the suspect is within.payton new york,d.conversely,absent exigency or consent,an officer may not search a residence on the basis of an arrest warrant without having a search warrant for the premises.steagald united states,d.
what,then,if the police are mistaken as to the subject residence our own position,conforming to that of most other circuits,is that no fourth amendment violation occurs if officers enter a third party home under the reasonable belief that the target named in the arrest warrant resides at the dwelling in question and will be present at the time of the entry.united states werra,cir united states graham,cir,cert.denied,d 
it is clear that a reasonable belief requires something more than suspicion,but,even with the more demanding probable cause test used for arrests,the supreme court has not used a numerical formula.rather,it has asked whether,given the information available,a reasonably prudent man could believe that the defendant had committed the crime.beck ohio,d.so,too,the reasonableness inquiry here is whether the agents could reasonably believe that díaz suazo lived at the house and so would likely be present there in the early morning.
federal officers sued for damages in a bivens action,like state officers sued under,wilson layne,d,have a further layer of protection available to them,namely,qualified immunity where the officer acted in the absence of guidance sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that he was violating a right.anderson creighton,d.qualified immunity applies not only to the question whether a constitutional right exists but also to the judgment whether the general standard applies to the facts at hand.saucier katz,d.
this extra layer of protection does not disappear merely because the underlying fourth amendment standard is itself one of reasonableness.the supreme court has drawn attention to the potential confusion,saucier,at.reasonable mistakes anderson,at.possible to reasonably act unreasonably but,in the end,qualified immunity against personal liability exists even for constitutional mistakes and protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.ashcroft al kidd,d quoting malley briggs,d.
the fourth amendment standard is objective,united states proctor,cir,and,where qualified immunity is asserted,the district judge may apply it on summary judgment so long as any disputed facts are assumed arguendo in favor of the party.lopera town of coventry,cir.but,apart from consent,which we have assumed was lacking,plaintiffs have not seriously countered the dea agents version of the facts,especially their description of what they knew and how they knew it.
this description establishes that calam,cameron and the two police officers on the task force who furnished the information described above all worked together.the dea agents were entitled to rely on plausible information supplied to them by fellow officers,united states hensley,d,and here the latter were themselves federally deputized on the task force.w here law enforcement authorities are cooperating in an investigation the knowledge of one is presumed shared by all.illinois andreas,d.
in a nutshell,the dea agents had evidence that díaz suazo was twice seen using a vehicle registered to solis alarcón and parked at the latter house that díaz suazo had access to the garage and presumably the house and that díaz suazo did not live at the address set out in his driver license.perhaps,too,they could place weight on the judgment of the local officers that díaz suazo lived at alondra and,if he did live there,it would be reasonable to believe him in residence early in the morning.
the judgment that he did live there would perhaps be a close call if the issue before us were whether evidence seized in the search should be suppressed.in many like search cases,the police had more potent evidence of residence,such as statements of the subject himself,extensive records linking the person to the address,or a combination of a reliable tip,a recent police report,and a contemporaneous witness identification see also werra,at doubt ing that an informant tip could support a reasonable belief that suspect lived in a rooming house.
however,such searches have occasi
