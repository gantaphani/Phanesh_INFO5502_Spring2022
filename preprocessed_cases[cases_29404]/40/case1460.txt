this appeal involves challenges to the constitutionality of city ordinances requiring those who wish to picket on public ways to provide the city with prior notice of this intent and comply with certain restrictions while picketing.the district court held that the ordinances do not violate the first amendment.we affirm.
on august,dennis green and at least ten others met outside the rbc center in raleigh,north carolina the city.the group distributed flyers to attendees of a promise keepers event,carried signs,and picketed in the parking lot adjacent to the center.after approximately an hour,an police officer working security requested that green and his companions leave the area.the officer explained that the center and attached parking areas were private property and that the group could be cited for trespass violations.
the group moved to a grassy along a public street near the center and resumed picketing.upon learning of its relocation,the officer contacted the police department to ask if the group had notified the city of its intent to picket and been issued a receipt of this notice.
when the officer learned that the group had neither notified the city nor obtained a receipt of notice,he explained to the group that picketing without a receipt violated the city ordinances and that refusal to leave the area could result in citations and fines as well the confiscation of signs.green and his group left the area.
on february,green filed this action,seeking injunctive and declaratory relief,actual nominal damages,and attorney fees against the city and its chief of police,jane perlov,in both her individual and official capacities.green alleges that certain portions of the city ordinances violate his first amendment rights to free speech and peaceable assembly.specifically,green alleges in his complaint,inter alia,that the city ordinances effective at the time of his picketing in unconstitutionally required picketers to provide the police department with notice of their intent to picket the notice requirement and to submit information regarding the name of the organization demonstrating,the time and location of the event,and the name of the individual designated to carry the receipt of notice collectively,the disclosure requirement.raleigh,city code,g.green also challenges provisions that restricted picketers to signs of no larger than two feet the requirement and that required picketers to remain on the outermost part of the sidewalk the outermost sidewalk requirement.b,e.
in march,the city revised and liberalized the picketing ordinances by eliminating the notice requirement for groups of fewer than ten picketers the exception,allowing anonymous picketing by any group with only the name of the individual holding the receipt of notice required,and enlarging the allowable sign size.raleigh,city code b,b although green did not file an amended complaint challenging the new ordinances,he maintained and continues to maintain on appeal that the amended ordinances offended his right to free speech in the same manner as the original ones,and he also challenges the exception added in the amended ordinance.the city does not contend that green failure to amend his complaint bars consideration of his challenges to the amended ordinances.accordingly,we treat his challenges to the amended ordinances in all respects as if raised in the pleadings.see.b.
after discovery,the district court dismissed green claims against chief perlov,holding that the claims against her in her official capacity were indistinguishable from the claims against the raleigh police department and that she was entitled to qualified immunity for the claims against her in her individual capacity.green does not appeal these rulings.the district court then granted the city motions for summary judgment on green remaining claims.
on appeal,green challenges both the original and amended ordinances.he argues that provisions in the original ordinances were unconstitutional to his conduct on august,he has abandoned any facial challenge to the original ordinances by failing to raise this claim in his opening brief.see united states,cir.however,green does raise both facial and challenges to the amended ordinances.
we first consider preliminary questions as to green standing and the possible mootness of some of his challenges.we review de novo the district court holdings on these questions.white tail park,stroube,cir.
green contends that the district court erred in holding that he lacked standing to bring challenges to the outermost sidewalk and disclosure requirements as well as to the absence of a exception.neither green nor the city disputes that green does have standing to mount challenges to the notice and requirements.
with respect to the outermost sidewalk requirement,we agree with the district court that green does lack standing to bring an challenge.green was never ordered to remain on the outermost sidewalk because,in fact,there was no sidewalk where green group chose to picket.after leaving the rbc center,green and the other picketers moved onto the grassy along a public road.police never asked green or others to move to any section of the and indeed never referred to this requirement at any point.thus,the city never applied this requirement to green conduct.
we believe the district court did,however,err in holding that green lacked standing to bring an challenge to the disclosure requirement.although green did not comply with the requirement that he reveal his identity to the city,indisputably a security officer told green group that failure to submit a notice of intent to picket would violate the city ordinances.green could not have obtained a receipt entitling him to picket unless he informed the city of t he name,if any,of the organization or group sponsoring or proposing to picket,t he name of the person and organization giving notice of intent to picket,and t he person or persons to be in charge of the activity and who will accompany it and carry any receipt of notice at all times.b.mandating green possession of a receipt of notice hence also mandated his conformance with the ordinance disclosure requirement.the constitution can hardly be thought to deny to one subjected to the restraints of such an ordinance the right to attack its constitutionality,because he has not yielded to its demands.shuttlesworth city of birmingham,d internal quotation marks omitted.thus,green possesses standing to bring an challenge to the disclosure requirement.
the district court also erred when it held that green lacked standing to challenge the original ordinances as they were applied to his group of eleven or more persons on august.the district court reasoned that because the original ordinances contained no exception,the exception could not have been applied to green.but green challenges the absence of a exception in the original ordinances.that is,green maintains that because the original ordinances contained no exception for small groups,the ordinances were unconstitutionally applied to his group on august.clearly green has standing to bring this challenge to the original ordinances.
the city argues that the district court erred in holding that green has standing to assert a facial challenge to the amended picketing ordinances.according to the city,the amended ordinances can not be challenged for facial overbreadth unless they are substantially.
as the district court explained,the city argument confuses standing with a final determination of overbreadth on the merits.green overbreadth challenge will fail if he can not adequately demonstrate that a challenged provision reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.vill.of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d.but a plaintiff standing to bring a case does not depend upon his ultimate success on the merits underlying his case,because otherwise every unsuccessful plaintiff will have lacked standing in the first place.covenant media of,llc city of charleston,cir quoting white tail park,at.
the district court thus did not err in holding that green possesses standing to mount a facial challenge to the amended ordinances.
having resolved the standing issues,we address the city mootness contention.the city maintains that the district court erred when it held that green challenges to the original ordinances survived their amendment.substantial amendment to a statute or ordinance may moot a challenge to the original law when there is no practical likelihood that the regulation will be reenacted in its original form.see brooks vassar,cir.but a challenge survives if the amended ordinances are sufficiently similar that it is permissible to say that the challenged conduct continues.ne.chapter of the associated contractors city of jacksonville,d see also nutritional health alliance shalala,cir rosenstiel rodriguez,cir.
the amendments to the picketing ordinances here do not moot green challenges to the original ordinances.the notice,and disclosure requirements in the new ordinances are sufficiently similar to the equivalent provisions in the original ordinances that it is permissible to say that the challenged conduct continues.associated contractors,at.moreover,the addition of a exception does not moot green challenge to the original ordinances application to a group of his size.given that raleigh amended ordinances exempt groups of fewer than ten individuals,and green group was perhaps as small as eleven people,we believe that the underlying case or controversy namely,whether raleigh original ordinances could constitutionally be applied to groups of such the amendment.accordingly,the city mootness argument fails.
we turn now to the merits of green challenges.in doing so,of course,we bear in mind that,with respect to the original ordinances,green has preserved no facial challenge and has no standing to challenge the outermost sidewalk provision that they contained.therefore,to the extent that we consider the constitutionality of the original ordinances,we do so only in the context of green challenges to their notice,disclosure,and requirements,as well as his challenge to their application to a group the size of his.
an ordinance that requires individuals or groups to obtain a permit before engaging in protected speech is a prior restraint on speech.cox city of charleston,cir.however,as the supreme court has explained,even a prior restraint can survive constitutional challenge,provided that it is a time,place,and manner regulation that satisfies certain constitutional requirements.forsyth county nationalist movement,d see also thomas chi.park,d.to withstand constitutional scrutiny,such a regulation must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,forsyth county,at.leave open ample alternatives for communication,and contain narrow,objective,and definite standards to guide the licensing authority,id.at.quoting shuttlesworth,at.to be narrowly tailored,an ordinance need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of effectuating the relevant interests but it may not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government legitimate interests.city of charleston,at quoting ward rock against racism,d.
we begin by addressing whether the various provisions of the raleigh ordinances satisfy the narrow tailoring requirement.
green first attacks the notice requirement in both the original and amended ordinances as insufficiently tailored to further significant governmental interests.we have consistently recognized that a city has a legitimate interest in maintaining the safety,order,and accessibility of its streets and sidewalks.city of charleston,at.the notice requirement clearly furthers this interest by permitting the raleigh police department to allocate resources and assign officers to the site of a protest in order to protect the safety,order,and first amendment rights of both demonstrators and bystanders.thus,our inquiry is whether the notice requirement burden s substantially more speech than is necessary to further that legitimate interest.id.quoting ward,at.
it clearly does not.unlike most picketing ordinances deemed unconstitutional,see,forsyth county,at,shuttlesworth,at,niemotko maryland,the city notice requirement does not extend to municipal officials any discretion to grant,deny,or set conditions on permission to demonstrate.designated city officials must grant a receipt of notice immediately to an individual notifying them he intends to picket the official lacks any discretion to deny such a receipt.see d d.furthermore,demonstrators may notify city officials of an intent to picket at any,by telephone,or by providing advance notice,undertaking a lengthy application process,or paying fees or other costs.given these minimal impositions,we can not hold that the notice requirement burdens substantially more speech than necessary to further the city interest in protecting law enforcement officers,motorists,pedestrians,the picketers themselves,and those accessing businesses near the site of a demonstration.see city of charleston,at see also ward,at.
next,green asserts that both the original and amended picketing ordinances are not narrowly tailored because by requiring demonstrators to divulge their identities,the ordinances eliminate demonstrators right to speak anonymously in public.see b,b.certainly,forced public revelation can discourage proponents of controversial viewpoints from speaking by exposing them to harassment or retaliation for the content of their speech.buckley am.constitutional law,d.speech can also be chilled when an individual whose speech relies on anonymity is forced to reveal his identity as a to expression.see watchtower bible tract soc y of,village of stratton,d see also buckley,at.
however,the city ordinances mandate an extremely limited form of that occurs only when submitting the notice of intent to picket and not at the moment of actual speech.the original ordinances required picketers to identify the sponsoring group if any,the person giving notice to the city,and the name of the person carrying the receipt of notice.the amended ordinances require disclosure of even less the name of the person who will carry the receipt of notice.b,b.
these provisions are undoubtedly narrowly tailored to serve significant governmental interests.the amended disclosure requirement provides the city with a straightforward way to verify compliance with the notice requirement,which we have already held to be narrowly tailored.without the name of the individual bearing the receipt,it might be difficult for a single police officer to confirm that a receipt has been issued indeed,for larger groups,it might prove practically impossible to establish that no one present possesses the required receipt,in effect,rendering the notice requirement a nullity.moreover,the additional disclosure requirements in the original ordinances satisfy similar practical exigencies in issuing and verifying the notice requirement.knowing who has submitted notice could clearly aid the city in issuing the receipt,especially by mail or over the telephone likewise,knowing the name of the organization permits police to approach the correct group when searching for the person bearing the receipt.the limited disclosure required here also furthers the city significant interest in assuring financial accountability for damages caused by users of public property.see chi.park,at.
notably,both the original and amended ordinances significantly differ from the types of disclosure provisions invalidated by the supreme court.see buckley,at.village of stratton,at.unlike those provisions,raleigh ordinances require neither identification at the moment of public speech nor the identification of each individual engaged in speech.furthermore,rather than simply furthering a general interest in crime and fraud prevention as those provisions did,the raleigh ordinances are closely tied to the pragmatic necessities of regulating demonstrations on public thoroughfares.
the disclosure requirements at issue here impose a very modest burden on the prospective picketers asserted right to remain anonymous and are narrowly tailored to serve raleigh significant governmental interests.
green also contends that the outermost sidewalk provision in the amended ordinance is not narrowly tailored.d.but chief perlov testified,without contradiction,that the city instituted the outermost sidewalk requirement to prevent picketers from block ing the entrance to a building or people egress into or out of the building.the supreme court has upheld a similar statute that prohibited picketing in such a manner as to obstruct or unreasonably interfere with free ingress or egress to and from any public premises.cameron johnson,d.such a provision imposes no burden on speech.as the johnson court explained,such a provision does not abridge constitutional liberty,since obstructing pedestrian access to city or state facilities bears no necessary relationship to the freedom to distribute information or opinion.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted see also cox louisiana,d.
green further claims that the restrictions in the original and amended ordinances are insufficiently tailored to further a significant governmental interest.the original provision limited demonstrators to signs the amended provision expands the permissible size to three feet.b b.
green incorrectly asserts that the city has failed to demonstrate that the restrictions promote governmental interests in traffic and police safety.in fact,the record contains uncontroverted evidence regarding the traffic and safety interests supporting these restrictions,including the testimony of chief perlov and bruce friedman,a traffic engineer with years experience.friedman explained that limitations further safety objectives by reducing possible obstruction of official traffic control devices such as roadside signs and vehicular or pedestrian signal indications that are necessary to regulate,warn,or guide road users within the public.see also foti city of menlo park,cir upholding a sign restriction,holding that it was narrowly tailored to serve the city legitimate governmental interest in traffic safety but see edwards city of coeur,cir invalidating an ordinance that prohibited protestors from carrying signs affixed to any type of support,holding that the restriction was not narrowly tailored to the city legitimate interest in safety when the city offered no empirical evidence supporting ordinance we find these justifications persuasive and conclude that the requirements do not substantially burden speech.see ward,at.
finally,green challenges the exception,asserting that it too is not narrowly tailored to further the city significant interests.see b,f.
in city of charleston,we noted the need for a exception in an ordinance regulating assemblies,parades,processions and exhibitions.at.we held that the lack of any such exception in a city ordinance rendered that ordinance facially unconstitutional because the city failed to establish the necessity for burdening expression by small groups of demonstrators.our sister circuits have similarly held that picketing and demonstration regulations must include exceptions for small groups in order to be narrowly tailored.see comm.city of dearborn,cir grossman city of portland,cir cmty.for creative turner,see also santa monica food not bombs city of santa monica,cir.
because the above cases concerned ordinances without any exception,they provide little guidance on the question raised many persons must a municipality exempt from the general picketing regulations to satisfy the narrow tailoring requirement.indeed,in city of charleston we declined to announce a numerical floor below which a permit requirement can not apply,finding that t he relevant legislative body is the proper forum for balancing the multitude of factors to be considered in determining how to keep the streets and sidewalks of a city safe,orderly,and accessible in a manner consistent with the first amendment.at.with these principles in mind,we consider the ordinances at issue here.
with respect to the amended ordinances,the relevant legislative body,the city,has determined that an exception for fewer than ten persons suffices and has proffered numerous governmental interests in support of this determination.the city has explained that,as the state capitol,raleigh has historically been the site of public demonstrations despite being a comparatively small city.often these demonstrations involve opposing groups that insist on simultaneously appearing on the same sidewalks in order to offer competing viewpoints to the public.the city must ensure that even during such demonstrations each set of protestors can exercise its first amendment rights without impinging on the rights of others and that potentially heated speech by rival groups does not go beyond mere words.during simultaneous uses of limited public space,the city must also ensure that protesters do not spill into the city streets and impede traffic or render it impossible for pedestrians to use the sidewalks or to enter or exit buildings.in order for the city to meet these objectives,a exception must anticipate such overlapping uses of public space in a relatively confined area,thereby supporting a more modest numerical exception than might otherwise be the case.see chi.park,at.noting the legitimate governmental interest in ordinances designed to coordinate multiple uses of limited space.
moreover,as the city has emphasized,its ordinances regulate only sidewalks and other public ways,rather than parks or more capacious public fora designed to accommodate larger groups.see city of santa monica,at noting the distinct governmental interests implicated in streets and sidewalks,in contrast to public open spaces like parks.sidewalks and are not only typically smaller and more narrow than parks,but groups of picketers also more easily disrupt the everyday use of sidewalks by instance,forcing foot traffic into the streets if the sidewalk is even groups in a park are unlikely to disrupt the activities of others.
furthermore,any remaining reservations we might retain as to the size of the raleigh exception are allayed by the broader statutory context of the exception.as noted above,the city ordinances do not contain the additional restrictions present in most other municipal regulations of public demonstrations.for example,in douglas brownell,the eighth circuit noted in dicta that since the challenged ordinance required five days advance notice and invested broad discretion with the chief of police,limiting the exception to fewer than ten persons compound ed the court concerns with other unconstitutional restrictions in the ordinance,cir.in contrast,raleigh ordinances do not contain unconstitutional restrictions that are compound ed by the small group exception.city of charleston,at,invalidating ordinance that contained no small group exception and required hours advance notice and permitted city officials discretion to deny the application city of dearborn,at,invalidating ordinance that contained no small group exception and required thirty days advance notice and permitted city council discretion to deny the application grossman,at invalidating ordinance that contained no small group exception and required seven days advance notice and permitted officials discretion to deny application.
given the city justification for the size of the small group exception and the relatively slight burden imposed by raleigh ordinances as a whole,we believe the exception complies with the narrow tailoring requirement.
green also asserts that the failure of the original city ordinances to contain a exception rendered them unconstitutional as applied to his group on august.given our holding that raleigh can constitutionally apply the amended picketing ordinances to groups of ten or more,however,we must similarly conclude that the city could constitutionally apply the original ordinances to green eleven to thirteen member group.although the city has modified the original ordinances in a variety of ways,the most significant factors for purposes of this analysis are identical in the original and amended ordinances.the important governmental interests supporting the ordinances as well as the most critical aspects of the lack of any advance notice and the absence of any discretionary official the same in the original and amended versions of the ordinance
