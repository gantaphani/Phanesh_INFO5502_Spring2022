in this appeal,we consider whether a federal district court has subject matter jurisdiction to consider certain civil claims seeking damages against an american corporation for the torture and mistreatment of foreign nationals at the abu ghraib prison in iraq the primary issue on appeal concerns whether the alien tort statute,as interpreted by the supreme court in kiobel royal dutch petroleum,provides a jurisdictional basis for the plaintiffs alleged violations of international law,despite the presumption against extraterritorial application of acts of congress.we also address the defendants contention that the case presents a political question that is inappropriate for judicial resolution under our decision in taylor kellogg brown root services,f d cir.
we conclude that the supreme court decision in kiobel does not foreclose the plaintiffs claims under the alien tort statute,and that the district court erred in reaching a contrary conclusion.upon applying the inquiry articulated by the supreme court in kiobel,we hold that the plaintiffs claims touch and concern the territory of the united states with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application of the alien tort statute.see kiobel.at.however,we are unable to determine from the present record whether the claims before us present nonjusticiable political questions.therefore,we do not reach the additional issue of the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs common law claims,and we vacate the district court judgment with respect to all the plaintiffs claims and remand the case to the district court.we direct that the district court undertake factual development of the record and analyze its subject matter jurisdiction in light of our decision in taylor and the principles expressed in this opinion.
in,a force led by the united states and the united kingdom invaded iraq and deposed its sovereign leader,saddam hussein.the united states took control of abu ghraib,the site of a prison facility near baghdad,and used the prison to detain various individuals,including criminals,enemies of the provisional government,and other persons selected for interrogation because they were thought to possess information regarding iraqi insurgents.
due to a shortage of trained military interrogators,the united states hired civilian contractors to interrogate detainees at abu ghraib.during the time period relevant to this civil action,those private interrogators were provided exclusively by caci premier technology,caci,a corporation domiciled in the united states.caci corporate headquarters is located in virginia,and caci is a subsidiary of caci international,caci international,a publicly traded delaware corporation that also has corporate headquarters in virginia.
according to an official investigation commissioned by the united states department of defense defense department,numerous incidents of sadistic,blatant,and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on several detainees at the abu ghraib prison between october and december.antonio taguba,article investigation of the military police brigade hereinafter report of taguba.these atrocities were condemned by the president of the united states as being abhorrent practices that do represent america.white house,press release,president bush meets with al arabiya television,wlnr may.both houses of congress condemned the abuses,stating that those acts contradict ed the policies,orders,and laws of the united states and the united states military,res,cong,and urg ing that all individuals responsible for such despicable acts be held accountable,res,cong.investigations conducted by the defense department concluded that caci interrogators directed or participated in some of the abuses,along with a number of military personnel.see report of taguba george fay,article investigation of the abu ghraib detention facility and military intelligence brigade.
the four plaintiffs in this case are foreign nationals who allege that they were tortured and otherwise mistreated by american civilian and military personnel while detained at abu ghraib among many other examples of mistreatment,the plaintiffs describe having been repeatedly beaten,shot in the leg,repeatedly shot in the head with a taser gun,subjected to mock execution,threatened with unleashed dogs,stripped naked,kept in a cage,beaten on the genitals with a stick,forcibly subjected to sexual acts,and forced to watch the rape of a female detainee.many of the acts allegedly were perpetrated during the night shift in order to minimize the risk of detection by nonparticipants and to soften up the detainees for later interrogation.
the plaintiffs allege that caci employees instigated,directed,participated in,encouraged,and aided and abetted conduct towards detainees that clearly violated the geneva conventions,the army field manual,and the laws of the united states.in particular,the plaintiffs allege that in the command vacuum at abu ghraib,caci interrogators operated with little to no supervision and were perceived as superiors by united states military personnel.military personnel allegedly carried out orders issued by the caci civilian interrogators to soften up and set conditions for the abuse of particular detainees,contrary to the terms of caci contract with the united states government.
in that contract,which was executed in august,caci agreed to provide services to the military.this contract was not awarded by the defense department or military sources,but by the department of the interior interior department.the contract,which was issued by an interior department contracting officer in arizona,authorized caci to collect payments in excess of million by mailing invoices to interior department accounting offices in colorado.
under the terms of the statement of work sow governing caci contract with the government,caci was obligated to supply interrogation management and support and to function as resident experts in interrogation regulations and procedures.the sow stated that caci would provide interrogation support cells,as directed by military authority,to assist,supervise,coordinate,and monitor all aspects of interrogation activities.the sow further specified that t he contractor is responsible for providing supervision for all contractor personnel.
the plaintiffs allege that during caci performance of this contract,caci managers failed to hire suitable interrogators,insufficiently supervised caci employees,ignored reports of abuse,and attempted to cover up the misconduct.the plaintiffs further allege that caci site manager at the abu ghraib prison,daniel porvaznik,reviewed interrogation reports that raised concerns of potential abuse by caci employees,established daily contact with caci in the united states,and submitted reports that were reviewed weekly by caci executive team in the united states to assess the company overall worldwide business situation.the plaintiffs also claim that caci chuck mudd traveled regularly to iraq to become familiar with the interrogation operation at abu ghraib.
in addition,the plaintiffs allege that,despite troubling reports from caci employees,caci management failed to investigate or to report accusations of wrongdoing and repeatedly denied that any caci employees had engaged in abusive conduct.also,according to the complaint,caci management redacted 
the present litigation began with a civil action filed in june by plaintiff suhail najim abdullah al shimari al shimari against caci,caci international,former caci employee timothy dugan,and l services,another government contractor.the action originally was filed in the southern district of ohio,where defendant timothy dugan resided.in the complaint,al shimari alleged claims under the alien tort statute ats,including claims of war crimes,torture,and cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment collectively,the ats claims.the complaint also contained numerous common law claims,including claims of assault and battery,sexual assault and battery,intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress,and negligent hiring and training collectively,the common law tort claims.
in august,al shimari action was transferred to the eastern district of virginia,where the corporate headquarters of caci and caci international are located.the following month,al shimari submitted an amended complaint that included the similar claims of three other plaintiffs,namely,taha yaseen arraq rashid,salah hasan nusaif al ejaili,and hamza hanfoosh al collectively,the rashid plaintiffs.the amended complaint also identified the names of three caci employees who allegedly directed and caused some of the most egregious acts of torture and abuse at abu ghraib,which information was based on testimony and statements given by military personnel who had been prosecuted for their misconduct.
in october,the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on numerous grounds,including the political question doctrine,federal preemption,derivative sovereign immunity,and lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the ats.the district court denied the defendants motion and held that the plaintiffs allegations did not present a political question.however,the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiffs ats claims because of the novelty of asserting such claims against private parties as opposed to state actors,and indicated that those claims could only proceed under diversity or federal question jurisdiction rather than under the ats.caci filed an interlocutory appeal of the district court decision.
on appeal,a panel of this court concluded that the district court erred in permitting the plaintiffs claims to proceed because they were preempted by federal law under the supreme court reasoning in boyle united technologies.al shimari caci int l,cir,vacated,cir en banc.however,after granting the plaintiffs petition for rehearing en banc,this court vacated the panel decision and dismissed the defendants interlocutory appeal.see al shimari caci int l,cir en banc.
our en banc decision was based on the conclusion that we lacked appellate jurisdiction because the district court rulings were not appealable under the collateral order doctrine articulated by the supreme court in cohen beneficial industrial loan.see al shimari,at.we observed that a denial of a motion to dismiss on political question grounds does not itself constitute an immediately appealable collateral order.id.at.we also explained that we were unable to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction because there was no independent jurisdictional basis for the appeal.see id.at,rejecting existence of an independent basis for jurisdiction by virtue of the defendants asserting the defense under coleman tennessee,and dow johnson,preemption by the combatant activities exception to the federal tort claims act,as recognized by saleh titan,or absolute official immunity under mangold analytic services,cir.
the case was returned to the district court,which entered a number of orders that are relevant to this appeal.first,the district court reinstated the plaintiffs ats claims,observing that a growing body of law suggests that plaintiffs claims are within the purview of international law.the court dismissed some of the plaintiffs claims as insufficiently pleaded,but permitted the plaintiffs to amend their pleadings to allege a conspiracy between caci and the united states military.the court also dismissed the rashid plaintiffs common law tort claims with prejudice,concluding that virginia law applied to the common law claims and that those claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and by a recent decision of the supreme court of virginia holding that equitable tolling was unavailable under virginia law.
the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint against caci only,which contained all four plaintiffs ats claims and only plaintiff al shimari common law tort claims.the deadline for discovery in the case expired in april.however,the record reflects that only a limited amount of information was obtained during discovery.three of the four plaintiffs did not give deposition testimony in the case.also,no depositions appear to have been taken of any individuals who served as former interrogators at abu ghraib,including the caci interrogators who were identified specifically by the plaintiffs as participants in the alleged abuse.
within weeks of the close of discovery,the supreme court issued its decision in kiobel royal dutch petroleum.in the majority opinion in that case,the court discussed limitations on the scope of ats jurisdiction imposed by a canon of statutory interpretation known as the presumption against extraterritorial application.id.based on the decision in kiobel,the district court dismissed all four plaintiffs ats claims,concluding that the court lack ed ats jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims because the acts giving rise to their tort claims occurred exclusively in iraq,a foreign sovereign.
the district court also dismissed al shimari remaining common law tort claims,holding that governing iraqi law promulgated by the coalition provisional authority cpa precluded imposition of liability on the defendants,and awarded caci in costs as the prevailing party in the civil action.the plaintiffs timely appealed the district court entry of final judgment with respect to all four plaintiffs ats and common law claims,as well as the district court taxation of costs against the plaintiffs.
we address caci two challenges to our subject matter jurisdiction.because the district court dismissed the plaintiffs claims under the ats for lack of jurisdiction,we first consider the jurisdictional scope of the ats and whether the plaintiffs ats claims fall within the reach of the statute.based on our conclusion that the plaintiffs ats claims are within the statute reach,we also address whether those claims or the plaintiffs common law tort claims raise any nonjusticiable political questions.
the plaintiffs seek to impose liability on caci for alleged violations of international law,including torture.they assert that the claimed violations fall within the jurisdictional scope of the ats,which provides that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.the ats,which was created as part of the judiciary act of,enables federal courts to consider a limited category of claims that are defined by the law of nations.sosa alvarez machain.
the international law violations that may be asserted under the ats must be sufficiently definite in their content and acceptance among civilized nations that they reflect historical paradigms that were familiar at the time that the ats was enacted.id.at.paradigmatic violations of the law of nations that were probably on the minds of the drafters of the ats include violation of safe conducts,infringement of the rights of ambassadors,and piracy.id.at see also id.at.the supreme court also has suggested that the prohibition against torture exemplifies a norm that is specific,universal,and obligatory.kiobel.at citation omitted see also filartiga pena irala,cir holding that official torture is now prohibited by the law of nations and that federal courts may exercise jurisdiction under the ats concerning such international violations.indeed,in the present case,the district court held that the plaintiffs ats claims for torture,war crimes,and cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment alleged sufficiently definite and universal violations of international law.
we emphasize,however,that we do not have before us the question whether the plaintiffs sufficiently have stated or established claims under the ats alleging violations of international law instead,we address our subject matter jurisdiction under the ats,and decide whether the district court erred in holding that the ats does not provide a cause of action for tortious conduct occurring outside the united states.
we begin by observing that the ats is a jurisdictional statute that addresses the power of the courts to entertain cases concerned with a certain subject,and does not authorize the courts to mold substantive law.sosa,at see also id.at stating that the statute is in terms only jurisdictional id.at comparing the ats to other grants of original jurisdiction in the constitution and the judiciary act of id.at stating that the ats is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action.thus,the ats confers jurisdiction on the district courts to consider certain types of tort claims asserted by aliens based on alleged violations of the law of nations,but does not create any particular causes of action.see kiobel.at sosa,at.
in kiobel,the supreme court considered whether a claim brought under the ats may reach conduct occurring in the territory of a foreign sovereign.at.in that case,nigerian nationals the petitioners,who became legal residents of the united states after being granted political asylum,brought tort claims under the ats against certain british,dutch,and nigerian corporations.id.at.in their complaint,the petitioners contended that the corporate defendants violated the law of nations by aiding and abetting atrocities committed by nigerian military and police forces in providing those forces with food,transportation,compensation,and access to property.id.at.
all the atrocities were alleged to have been committed in nigeria,and it was undisputed that none of the conduct alleged in the complaint occurred within the territory of the united states.id.at.moreover,none of the defendants had engaged in any activities in the united states that appeared relevant to the claimed tortious acts that occurred in nigeria.the ats claims only connections to the territory of the united states consisted of the foreign corporate defendants listings on the new york stock exchange and their affiliation with a public relations office in new york city.id.at breyer,concurring in the judgment.
the supreme court held that the petitioners ats claims were barred.id.at majority opinion.in reaching this conclusion,the court primarily relied on the principles underlying an established canon of statutory interpretation,which raises a presumption against extraterritorial application of acts of congress the presumption,or the presumption against extraterritorial application.see id.at.the presumption reflects the longstanding principle of american law that legislation of congress,unless a contrary intent appears,is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states because congress ordinarily legislates with respect to domestic,not foreign matters.morrison austl.bank,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court explained that the principles underlying the presumption restrain courts in their consideration of causes of action that may be brought under the ats.kiobel.at.those principles reflect foreign policy concerns arising from potential unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations which could result in international discord,and from the danger of unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct of foreign policy.id.citation omitted.
under the presumption,w hen a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application,it has none.id.quoting morrison,at.after considering the text of the ats,the court held in kiobel that nothing in the statutory language provided a clear indication that the statute was intended to have extraterritorial reach.id.at.the court concluded that although congress,even in a jurisdictional provision,can indicate that it intends federal law to apply to conduct occurring abroad,congress failed to do so when it enacted the ats.id.at.thereafter,the supreme court held that the petitioners case seeking relief for violations of the law of nations occurring outside the united states is barred.id.at.
crucially,however,the court explained its holding by stating that o n these facts,all the relevant conduct took place outside the united states.id.the court elaborated that even where the claims touch and concern the territory of the united states,they must do so with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application.id.and,in a reference to the fact that the petitioners had not alleged any connection with the territory of the united states other than the physical presence of the foreign corporate defendants,the court explained that c orporations are often present in many countries,and it would reach too far to say that mere corporate presence suffices.id.
we observe that the supreme court used the phrase relevant conduct to frame its touch and concern inquiry,but never defined that term.under the facts presented,there was no need to do so because all the conduct underlying the petitioners claims occurred outside united states territory.we also note that the court broadly stated that the claims,rather than the alleged tortious conduct,must touch and concern united states territory with sufficient force,suggesting that courts must consider all the facts that give rise to ats claims,including the parties identities and their relationship to the causes of action.see,black law dictionary ed defining claim as the aggregate of operative facts giving rise to a right enforceable by a court.
the court choice of such broad terminology was not happenstance,as illustrated by the opinions of concurring justices who offered alternative views.for example,justice alito,in a concurring opinion in which justice thomas joined,advocated a broader view of the presumption effect on ats jurisdiction,which would bar an ats action unless the domestic conduct is sufficient to violate an international law norm that is sufficiently definite and accepted among civilized nations.kiobel.at alito,concurring.under the standard proposed by justice alito,courts could consider only the domestic tortious conduct of the defendants.such an analysis is far more circumscribed than the majority opinion requirement that the claims touch and concern the territory of the united states with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application.id.at majority opinion.
the touch and concern language set forth in the majority opinion contemplates that courts will apply a analysis to determine whether particular ats claims displace the presumption against extraterritorial application.in an opinion concurring in the judgment,justice breyer,with whom justice ginsburg,justice sotomayor,and justice kagan joined,would have allowed jurisdiction whenever the alleged tort occurs on american soil,the defendant is an american national,or the defendant conduct substantially and adversely affects an important american national interest.id.at breyer,concurring in the judgment.and,as justice kennedy observed in his concurring opinion,the supreme court evidently left unanswered significant questions regarding the reach and interpretation of the alien tort statute that may require some further elaboration and explanation of the proper implementation of the presumption in cases that are not covered by the reasoning and holding of kiobel.id.at kennedy,concurring.
in the present case,the plaintiffs argue that based on kiobel,the ats provides jurisdiction for claims that touch and concern united states territory with sufficient force to displace the presumption.see id.majority opinion.the plaintiffs contend that their claims substantial connections to united states territory are sufficient to rebut the presumption.
in response,the defendants argue that,under the decision in kiobel,the ats does not under any circumstances reach tortious conduct occurring abroad.the defendants maintain that the sole material consideration before us is the fact that the plaintiffs claims allege extraterritorial tortious conduct,which subjects their claims to the same fatal outcome as those in kiobel.we disagree with the defendants argument,which essentially advances the view expressed by justices alito and thomas in their separate opinion in kiobel.
because five justices,including justice kennedy,joined in the majority rationale applying the presumption against extraterritorial application,the presumption is part of the calculus that we apply here.however,the clear implication of the court touch and concern language is that courts should not assume that the presumption categorically bars cases that manifest a close connection to united states territory.under the touch and concern language,a analysis is required in such cases to determine whether courts may exercise jurisdiction over certain ats claims.accordingly,the presumption against extraterritorial application bars the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs ats claims unless the relevant conduct alleged in the claims touch es and concern s the territory of the united states with sufficient force to displace the presumption.at.
in kiobel,the court observation that all the relevant conduct occurred abroad reflected those claims extremely attenuated connection to united states territory,which amounted to mere corporate presence.indeed,the only facts relating to the territory of the united states were the foreign corporations public relations office in new york city and their listings on the new york stock exchange.because the petitioners in kiobel were unable to point to any relevant conduct in their claims that occurred in the territory of the united states,the presumption was conclusive when applied to the facts presented.
in the present case,however,the issue is not as easily resolved.the plaintiffs claims reflect extensive relevant conduct in united states territory,in contrast to the mere presence of foreign corporations that was deemed insufficient in kiobel.when a claim substantial ties to united states territory include the performance of a contract executed by a united states corporation with the united states government,a more nuanced analysis is required to determine whether the presumption has been displaced.in such cases,it is not sufficient merely to say that because the actual injuries were inflicted abroad,the claims do not touch and concern united states territory.
here,the plaintiffs claims allege acts of torture committed by united states citizens who were employed by an american corporation,caci,which has corporate headquarters located in fairfax county,virginia.the alleged torture occurred at a military facility operated by united states government personnel.
in addition,the employees who allegedly participated in the acts of torture were hired by caci in the united states to fulfill the terms of a contract that caci executed with the united states department of the interior.the contract between caci and the department of the interior was issued by a government office in arizona,and caci was authorized to collect payments by mailing invoices to government accounting offices in colorado.under the terms of the contract,caci interrogators were required to obtain security clearances from the united states department of defense.
finally,the allegations are not confined to the assertion that caci employees participated directly in acts of torture committed at the abu ghraib prison.the plaintiffs also allege that caci managers located in the united states were aware of reports of misconduct abroad,attempted to cover up the misconduct,and implicitly,if not expressly,encouraged it.
these ties to the territory of the united states are far greater than those considered recently by the second circuit in balintulo daimler ag,cir.in that case,the second circuit declined to extend ats jurisdiction to claims involving foreign conduct by south african subsidiaries of american corporations.see id.at.the plaintiffs in balintulo alleged that those corporations s old cars and computers to the south african government,thus facilitating the apartheid regime innumerable depredations and injustices,including rape,torture,and extrajudicial killings.id.at.interpreting the holding of kiobel to stand for the proposition that claims under the ats can not be brought for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than the united states,id.at citing kiobel.at,the second circuit construed the court touch and concern language as impacting the exercise of jurisdiction only when some of the relevant conduct occurs in the united states.id.at footnote omitted emphasis in original see also chowdhury worldtel bangl.holding,cir applying kiobel to foreclose jurisdiction over ats claims filed by a bangladeshi plaintiff who allegedly was detained and tortured by the bangladesh national police at the direction of his bangladeshi business partner.
although the touch and concern language in kiobel may be explained in greater detail in future supreme court decisions,we conclude that this language provides current guidance to federal courts when ats claims involve substantial ties to united states territory.we have such a case before us now,and we can not decline to consider the supreme court guidance simply because it does not state a precise formula for our analysis.
applying this guidance,we conclude that the ats claims connection to the territory of the united states and caci relevant conduct in the united states require a different result than that reached in kiobel.in its decision in morrison,the supreme court emphasized that although the presumption is no timid sentinel,its proper application often is not selfevidently dispositive and requires further analysis.at.we have undertaken that analysis here,employing the touch and concern inquiry articulated in kiobel,by considering a broader range of facts than the location where the plaintiffs actually sustained their injuries.
indeed,we observe that mechanically applying the presumption to bar these ats claims would not advance the purposes of the presumption.a basic premise of the presumption against extraterritorial application is that united states courts must be wary of international discord resulting from unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations.kiobel.at citation omitted.in the present case,however,the plaintiffs seek to enforce the customary law of nations through a jurisdictional vehicle provided under united states law,the ats,rather than a federal statute that itself details conduct to be regulated or enforced.thus,any substantive norm enforced through an ats claim necessarily is recognized by other nations as being actionable.moreover,this case does not present any potential problems associated with bringing foreign nationals into united states courts to answer for conduct committed abroad,given that the defendants are united states citizens.sexual minorities uganda lively,d,holding that kiobel did not bar ats claims against an american citizen,in part because t his is not a case where a foreign national is being hailed into an unfamiliar court to defend himself.
we likewise note that further litigation of these ats claims will not require unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct of foreign policy.kiobel.at.the political branches already have indicated that the united states will not tolerate acts of torture,whether committed by united states citizens or by foreign nationals.
the plaintiffs do not appear to have access to federal courts under the torture victim protection act of tvpa,presumably because they did not suffer injury under actual or apparent authority,or color of law,of any foreign nation,stat,note following emphasis added.nevertheless,the tvpa broad prohibition against torture reflects congress recognition of a distinct interest in preventing the united states from becoming a safe harbor free of civil as well as criminal liability for a torturer or other common enemy of mankind.kiobel.at breyer,concurring in the judgment.this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that congress has authorized the imposition of severe criminal penalties for acts of torture committed by united states nationals abroad.see.the supreme court certainly was aware of these civil and criminal statutes when it articulated its touch and concern language in kiobel see kiobel.at kennedy,concurring predicting that o ther cases may arise with allegations of serious violations of international law principles protecting persons that are covered neither by the tvpa nor by the reasoning and holding of today case.
we conclude that the plaintiffs ats claims touch and concern the territory of the united states with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application based on caci status as a united states corporation the united states citizenship of caci employees,upon whose conduct the ats claims are based the facts in the record showing that caci contract to perform interrogation services in iraq was issued in the united states by the united states department of the interior,and that the contract required caci employees to obtain security clearances from the united states department of defense the allegations that caci managers in the united states gave tacit approval to the acts of torture committed by caci employees at the abu ghraib prison,attempted to cover up the misconduct,and implicitly,if not expressly,encouraged it and the expressed intent of congress,through enactment of the tvpa and,to provide aliens access to united states courts and to hold citizens of the united states accountable for acts of torture committed abroad accordingly,we hold that the district court erred in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the ats,and we vacate the district court judgment dismissing the plaintiffs ats claims on that basis.
our decision regarding the ats answers only the first issue of subject matter jurisdiction presented in this appeal.we also must consider whether the record before us adequately supports a finding that litigation of the plaintiffs ats claims and common law tort claims will avoid any political questions that would place those claims outside the jurisdiction of the federal courts.
the political question doctrine is a function of the separation of powers,and prevents federal courts from deciding issues that the constitution assigns to the political branches,or that the judiciary is to address.baker carr,see also tiffany united states,cir stating that the constitutional separation of powers requires that we examine the relationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the federal government cognizant of the limits upon judicial power.the supreme court has defined a political question by reference to whether a case presents any of the following attributes a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion the impossibility of a court undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.baker,at.
in considering these issues when a defendant challenges subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b,a court may evaluate the pleadings as evidence on the issue and may consider other evidence in the record without converting the proceeding to one for summary judgment.velasco gov t of,cir citation omitted.however,when the jurisdictional facts are inextricably intertwined with those central to the merits,the district court should resolve the relevant factual disputes only after appropriate discovery.in re kbr,burn pit,cir hereinafter burn pit quoting kerns united states,cir brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.
we first observe that caci position asserting the presence of a political question was resolved by the district court in the plaintiffs favor much earlier in this litigation.in march,before any discovery had been conducted,caci challenged the court subject matter jurisdiction on political question grounds,based on the allegations in the complaint.
at that time,the district court analyzed the six factors set forth by the supreme court in baker solely by reference to the plaintiffs complaint,and rejected caci jurisdictional challenge.the court concluded that the case was not constitutionally committed to the executive branch because the case challenges not the government itself or the adequacy of official government policies,but the conduct of government contractors carrying on a business for profit.next,the court found that in view of the allegations of a conspiracy between contractors and military personnel,the court could analyze this conspiracy without questioning the interrogation policies authorized by top military and government officials.
the district court further concluded that there were judicially discoverable and manageable standards for evaluating the plaintiffs claims,citing other extensive litigation regarding the events at abu ghraib prison,the availability of eyewitness testimony based on courts martial of military personnel,and the limited nature of any classified discovery material.the court stated that manageable judicial standards are readily accessible through the discovery process,and that the court suspect ed that the contract between caci and the government details caci responsibilities in conducting the interrogations,outlines the applicable laws and rules that caci personnel are bound by,and sets further restrictions on the type of conduct permitted.
the district court also noted that the process of reviewing caci conduct would not demonstrate a lack of respect for the political branches,because matters are not beyond the reach of the judiciary simply because they touch upon war or foreign affairs.the court found that the case could be decided without the need for policy determinations clearly requiring nonjudicial discretion,see baker,at,stating that the policy determination central to this case has already been made this country does not condone torture,especially when committed by its citizens.finally,the court concluded that consideration of the other baker factors did not render the case nonjusticiable,and held that the case did not present a political question barring the exercise of its subject matter jurisdiction.
although caci appealed the district court ruling on numerous bases,including justiciability,our conclusion that we lacked jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine returned the case to the district court without a decision whether the case presented a political question.see al shimari,at.on remand,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs ats claims for lack of jurisdiction under kiobel,and also dismissed the plaintiffs remaining common law tort claims under federal rule of civil procedure b.
in this appeal,caci renews its political question challenge,contending that the treatment and interrogation of detainees during war is a key component of national defense considerations that are committed to the political branches of government.caci also asserts that there are no judicially discoverable standards for deciding intentional tort claims in the context of a war zone,and that caci interrogators were performing a common mission with the military and were acting under direct military command and control.caci further maintains that most of the alleged forms of abuse at issue were approved by the secretary of defense and incorporated into rules of engagement by military commanders at abu ghraib.
caci arguments are based on constitutional considerations and factual assertions that are intertwined in many respects.we begin our consideration of these arguments by recognizing that most military decisions are matters solely within the purview of the executive branch,taylor,at,and that the constitution delegates authority over military matters to both the executive and legislative branches of government.see burn pit,at lebron rumsfeld,cir.
nevertheless,the fact that a military contractor was acting pursuant to orders of the military does not,in and of itself,insulate the claim from judicial review.taylor,at.accordingly,before declaring such a case to be nonjusticiable,a court must undertake a discriminating analysis that includes the litigation susceptibility to judicial handling in the light of its nature and posture in the specific case,and of the possible consequences of judicial action.lane halliburton,cir quoting baker,at.such an analysis involves a delicate e
