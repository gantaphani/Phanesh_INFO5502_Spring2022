shirley presley,a resident of charlottesville,virginia,brought this action against the city of charlottesville and the rivanna trails foundation rtf,a nonprofit private corporation collectively,the defendants she alleges that,without her consent,the defendants conspired to publish a map that showed a public trail crossing her yard.presley further alleges that,even after the defendants realized their error,they did not correct it but rather criminally prosecuted her when she herself took measures to prevent trespasses on her property.presley asserts that the defendants actions violated her fourth amendment and due process rights.the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss presley complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
we must take as true the factual allegations in presley complaint.bass dupont de nemours,cir.
presley home and yard encompass less than an acre of land along the rivanna river.in,without having obtained her consent,the rtf began distributing a map that displayed a public as the rivanna a portion of presley property.the city publicized the rtf map on the city official website.relying on the rivanna trail map,members of the public began traveling across presley yard,leaving behind trash,damaging the vegetation,and sometimes even setting up overnight camp sites.initially,presley did not realize the extent of the intrusion because she was caring for her ailing husband in a nursing home.after her husband death in,however,presley became aware of the extent of the trail use and began complaining to the rtf and the city about the trespasses.
although the defendants acknowledged their error,they assertedly neither changed the map nor stopped its distribution.rather,several rtf officials and members of the charlottesville city council met with presley and asked her to give the defendants an easement across her property in exchange for favorable tax treatment and other official favors but not compensation.presley refused.
the intrusions by trespassers persisted and became more severe.presley called the city police several times to eject the trespassers,but,although the police responded regularly,they could not stem the tide.presley then posted over one hundred no trespassing signs on her property,all of which were defaced and destroyed.finally,presley installed razor wire along the perimeter of her property.city officials responded by revising a local ordinance to prohibit presley protective measures and then bringing a criminal prosecution against her for violating that ordinance.the prosecution was later dismissed.
when presley filed this action in february,the city and the rtf still had not amended the trail map.presley alleges that the defendants have engaged in a conspiracy to violate her constitutional rights.specifically,she asserts that the defendants actions constitute an unreasonable fourth amendment seizure and deprive her of procedural and substantive due process rights under the fourteenth amendment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,the defendants moved to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim.the district court granted their motions,and presley filed a timely appeal.
before addressing the merits of this appeal,we note at the outset that t he purpose of rule b is to test the sufficiency of a complaint and not to resolve contests surrounding the facts,the merits of a claim,or the applicability of defenses.edwards city of goldsboro,cir internal quotation marks omitted.for this reason,a rule b motion should not be granted unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d see also swierkiewicz sorema,d explaining that a court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,when,as here,a defendant seeks dismissal of a civil rights complaint,we must be especially solicitous of the wrongs alleged and must not dismiss the complaint unless it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief under any legal theory which might plausibly be suggested by the facts alleged.edwards,at emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.
we initially consider whether presley has stated a claim under the fourth amendment,which provides that t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable seizures,shall not be violated.const.amend.iv.presley alleges that an unreasonable seizure of her property occurred here when private individuals trespassed onto her land due to the active and knowing encouragement of the defendants.
the fourth amendment protections against unreasonable seizures clearly extend to real property.see,united states james daniel good real property,d noting that the fourth amendment applies to the seizure of a parcel of land with a house freeman city of dallas,cir en banc t he city seized the freemans real property for demolition.nevertheless,the district court held that presley had failed to allege a fourth amendment violation.the court offered two grounds for its holding we find neither persuasive.
the district court held that presley fourth amendment seizure claim was foreclosed because it merely amount ed to a fifth amendment takings claim.but the supreme court has time and again considered multiple constitutional claims based on the same facts.see,locke davey,d free exercise,free speech,and equal protection clauses jones united states,d fifth and sixth amendments alexander united states,d rejecting first amendment claim on the merits but remanding for reconsideration of eighth amendment claim.
as the court has explained,c ertain wrongs affect more than a single right and,accordingly,can implicate more than one of the constitution commands.soldal cook county,d.accord james daniel good real property,at.indeed,the court has squarely rejected the argument that,on the basis of a single set of facts,a plaintiff could only assert the violation of one constitutional provision,holding instead that the plaintiff could simultaneously bring a due process claim and a fourth amendment claim.see james daniel good real property,at.soldal,at.moreover,the court has observed that it sees no basis for doling out constitutional protections one at a time rather,a court should examine each constitutional claim in turn.soldal,at.
in just one circumstance has the supreme court held that a single set of facts may not simultaneously give rise to two constitutional violations when one of the provisions assertedly violated contains only a generalized notion of constitutional as substantive due the other provision is an explicit textual source of constitutional protection that specifically addresses the precise harm at issue.graham connor,d see also gerstein pugh,d.this is not the case the fourth amendment seizure clause and the fifth amendment takings clause address specific,rather than general,harms,and the court has never held that one specific constitutional clause gives way to another equally specific clause when their domains overlap.the supreme court conclusion in soldal that s urely,graham does not bar resort to the fourth amendment specific protection for houses,papers,and effects,at,holds true here as well.
moreover,contrary to the suggestion of the district court,recognizing that a fourth amendment claim and a fifth amendment claim may arise from the same appropriation of property does not extinguish the distinction between a seizure and a taking.many example,not takings at all.see,united states v.one parcel of real property with buildings,appurtenances,and improvements,known as plat,lot,great harbor neck,cir i t is settled that if the federal government actions comport,procedurally and substantively,with the terms of a lawfully enacted forfeiture statute,it may seize private property without compensating the owner.and many example,regulatory do not sufficiently interfere with possessory interests to constitute a seizure.see,lucas coastal council,d noting that a regulation could effect a taking even if there was no appropriation of property or ouster of the owner possession.
more importantly,even when the same appropriation does constitute both a seizure and a taking,meaningful legal differences continue to separate a fourth amendment seizure claim from a fifth amendment takings claim.to prevail on a seizure claim,a plaintiff must prove that the government unreasonably seized property.soldal,at.by contrast,to make out a takings claim,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the government took property without just compensation.williamson county reg l planning comm hamilton bank,d.because the legal elements of a seizure claim and a takings claim differ,there is no danger that one constitutional provision will subsume the other,even if a single set of facts provides the basis for a cause of action under both.
in sum,here,as in james daniel good real property and soldal,the seizure of property implicates two explicit textual sources of constitutional protection,the fourth amendment and the fifth.james daniel good real,at.internal quotation marks omitted soldal,at.in such circumstances,the supreme court has directed that the proper question is not which amendment controls but whether either amendment is violated.james daniel good real,at.
notwithstanding this clear directive,the defendants here,echoing those in james daniel good real property and soldal,assert that one amendment here,as in soldal,the fifth provides the full measure of relief.see james daniel good real,at.and echoing the lower court in soldal,the dissent accepts that argument on the rationale that to do otherwise would permit the fourth amendment to undermine the fifth.compare soldal county of cook,cir t he particular distinction that we have just elaborated between a fourth amendment seizure and other types of interference with property is necessary if the fourth amendment is not to swallow the due process clause,rev,d,with post at t o allow presley to pursue relief under the fourth amendment here would undercut fifth amendment takings jurisprudence.yet,the supreme court that view in soldal and reiterated that rejection in james daniel good real property.
the dissent ignores james daniel good real property and seeks to distinguish soldal from the case at hand on the basis of a single purported factual difference.the dissent concedes that presley,like the soldals,has alleged a seizure,but argues that in the soldal seizure there was no element of public use,post at,while the seizure here was effectuated for permanent public use,id.at.in the dissent view,the presence of a public use is a critical fact that distinguishes this case from soldal.id.at.
the dissent critical distinction fails.although the seizure at issue in assistance with an illegal not have been for a public use nothing in soldal holds,or even suggests,that the fourth amendment only applies to seizures for uses.indeed,the soldal court reached precisely the opposite the reason for a seizure is wholly irrelevant to the threshold question whether the amendment applies.soldal,at.as soldal explained,the right against unreasonable seizures would be no less transgressed if the seizure of the house was undertaken to collect evidence,verify compliance with a housing regulation,effect an eviction by the police,or on a whim,for no reason at all.id.emphasis added whether presley alleges that the defendants have seized her property for a public by mistake and for no reason at fourth amendment applies to the seizure.
like the lower court in soldal,the dissent here worries that applying the fourth amendment to seizures of real property would lead to unworkable results.compare post at,with soldal,at.but the supreme court in soldal expressly rejected this concern,explaining why it is appropriate to subject even seizures for a public purpose to constitutional scrutiny.soldal pointed out that because reasonableness is still the ultimate fourth amendment standard,numerous seizures of the type in soldal,including those pursuant to a court order,will survive constitutional scrutiny,since a showing of unreasonableness in such circumstances will be a laborious task indeed.soldal,at.thus,the soldal court itself rejected the dissent theory a seizure for a public purpose may well be reasonable and so survive constitutional scrutiny under the fourth amendment,but an allegation that a seizure was for a public purpose does not somehow eliminate fourth amendment scrutiny 
put simply,that presley may also have a claim under the fifth amendment takings clause does not bar her from bringing a fourth amendment seizure claim.
the district court alternatively held that no seizure had occurred here because presley was not completely deprived of her possessory interests in her property.but a deprivation need not be this severe to constitute a seizure subject to constitutional protections.rather,the fourth amendment also governs temporary or partial seizures.see united states place,d the intrusion on possessory interests occasioned by a seizure of one personal effects can vary both in its nature and extent.pepper village of oak park,cir noting that substantial damage to a couch was a seizure united states gray,cir holding that temporarily removing rifles from a closet to copy down their serial numbers was a seizure.
in fact,the supreme court has held that a seizure of property occurs whenever there is some meaningful interference with an individual possessory interests in that property.united states jacobsen,d.presley has alleged an interference with her possessory interests that is clearly meaningful indeed,this interference has assertedly been disruptive,stressful,and invasive.her complaint states that she has been deprived of the use of part of her property due to the regular presence of a veritable army of trespassers who freely and regularly traverse her yard,littering,making noise,damaging her land,and occasionally even camping overnight.this constant physical occupation certainly constitutes a meaningful interference with presley possessory interests in her property.
of course,it is private individuals,not city officials,who have actually interfered with presley possessory interests here.although private actions generally do not implicate the fourth amendment,when a private person acts as an agent of the government or with the participation or knowledge of any governmental official,then the private person acts are attributed to the government.jacobsen,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the government need not compel nor even involve itself directly in the private person actions.for example,in skinner railway labor executives ass n,d,the supreme court held that breath and urine tests required by private railroads implicated the fourth amendment when the railroads voluntarily complied with federal regulations governing such tests 
as in skinner,several factors in this case combine to convince us that the defendants did more than adopt a passive attitude toward the underlying private conduct and that therefore the acts of private persons are attributable to the defendants.see id.at.at some point,the defendants knew that their map was erroneous they also knew that the rivanna trail map would encourage public use of the was,after all,the map purpose.finally,defendants also knew that the city involvement would communicate to trail users that there were no legal barriers to their use of the entire trail,including the portion that cut through presley property.rossignol voorhaar,cir seizure attributable to the government when official gave significant encouragement to its allegedly private perpetrators.
nevertheless,despite this knowledge,the defendants assertedly did nothing to correct their error,and consequently,in reliance upon the erroneous map,private individuals trespassed onto presley yard.moreover,when presley attempted to protect her own property,the defendants initiated a meritless criminal prosecution against her to force her to take down the razor wire.see soldal,at.noting that fourth amendment is implicated when government officials prevent lawful resistance against seizures effected by private persons.these factors are clear indices of the defendants encouragement,endorsement,and participation,and suffice to implicate the fourth amendment.skinner,at.see also united states walther,cir noting that a private search is attributed to the government if the government is involved indirectly as an encourager of the private citizen actions.
in sum,we can not agree with the district court that presley can prove no set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to relief.conley,at.although she ultimately may not be able to prevail,presley has at least raised a fourth amendment seizure claim by alleging that private individuals,knowingly encouraged and aided by the defendants,trespassed onto her property.accordingly,we reverse the district court dismissal of this claim.
although presley fourth amendment claim survives the defendants motion to dismiss,her procedural due process claim does not.even assuming that presley suffered a deprivation in this case,the district court correctly recognized that because the only deprivation that she has alleged is effectively a physical taking an inverse condemnation action for just compensation which is clearly available to her under state law provides all the process to which she is due.
in so holding,we recognize that presley asserts that she was not afforded predeprivation notice or a hearing.ordinarily,such predeprivation process is required absent the necessity of quick action by the state or the impracticality of providing any predeprivation process,a hearing is constitutionally inadequate.logan zimmerman brush,d internal quotation marks omitted.
but a taking differs from other deprivations,both in its importance to governance and in the additional procedural protections provided whenever a taking occurs.as the supreme court explained long ago,the taking of private property for public use upon just compensation is so often necessary for the proper performance of governmental functions that the power is deemed to be essential to the life of the state.georgia city of chattanooga.and,when the facts of a case establish a taking regardless of whether the plaintiff has alleged one,the owner of the taken property is constitutionally entitled to two protections not afforded to others suffering property deprivations the government must demonstrate that the taking was for a public use,and the government must afford the owner just compensation.the government heightened interest in eminent domain and the unique safeguards surrounding takings necessarily affect any procedural due process analysis.see mathews eldridge,d noting that the probable value of substitute procedural safeguards and the government interest are two of the three distinct factors to be weighed in analyzing whether the process provided was adequate.
perhaps in light of these concerns,a century of precedent has created a distinct body of due process law for cases like the present one in which the challenged deprivation is a physical taking.under these precedents,government entities need not provide a hearing before they physically take private property,so long as the taking is for a public use.bragg weaver.a hearing thereon is not essential to due process in the sense of the fourteenth amendment.see also joslin city of providence.holding that a city is authorized to decide whether to take land ex parte,without appeal or opportunity for hearing and decision by an impartial tribunal.
nor need the government provide notice before effecting a physical taking.rather,in the takings context,the due process clause only entitles property owners to adequate notice prior to a judicial condemnation or proceeding.see schroeder city of new york,d walker city of hutchinson,d.entitlement to notice in this context merely follows the rule,articulated in mullane central hanover trust,that notice is a n elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any judicial proceeding which is to be accorded finality.thus,when a government entity condemns land,notice must precede the initiation of judicial proceedings that will finally determine the value of that land,whether those proceedings occur before the government takes physical possession of the land,see schroeder,at,or afterward,see bailey anderson.but the government need not provide notice prior to a physical taking that,as here,is not itself preceded by any judicial process.
rather,when the alleged deprivation is effectively a physical taking,procedural due process is satisfied so long as private property owners may pursue meaningful postdeprivation procedures to recover just compensation.see bailey,at.holding that it has long been settled that due process does not require a hearing in advance of land occupation provided only that the owner have opportunity to be heard prior to a final determination of the value of the land taken fulcher united states,cir en banc phillips,concurring t here can be no questions of entitlement to due process notice as an incident to the prior taking by physical seizure all the process due in respect of the right to compensation is supplied by the availability of the inverse condemnation cause of action.
these principles govern the case at hand.if we accept presley factual allegations,as we must at this stage in the proceedings,then the city has physically taken,and therefore deprived presley of,some of her property.nevertheless,presley can not show that she was denied adequate procedures to obtain just compensation.under virginia law,aggrieved property owners may file an inverse condemnation action pursuant to virginia declaratory judgment statute.see richmeade,city of richmond,citing ann.west.if they prevail,they may obtain a court order requiring that the relevant governmental body comply with virginia established procedures for determining compensation.see ann.west.because virginia law provides an adequate procedure for obtaining compensation for a procedure readily available to has alleged no denial of procedural due process.
one final note our holding today may seem to raise the specter of government entities deciding to physically take property for which no predeprivation process is due rather than pursuing the more gruelling path of condemnation proceedings.but what condemnation proceedings lack in procedural ease,they gain in security.as judge dickson phillips has noted 
while a taking by physical invasion,being completely efficacious to acquire title,might be thought preferable to the administrative difficulties attendant upon formal condemnation proceedings,there are of course overpowering reasons to prefer the latter.properly conducted,the formal proceeding can,and typically does,dispose of all issues and conclude all persons in a setting chosen by the condemning authority.taking by physical invasion on the other hand simply exposes the government to continued inverse condemnation actions by various claimants proceeding as and when they will.
fulcher,at phillips,concurring.we believe that judge phillips insight applies with undiminished force today.
finally,we turn to presley substantive due process claim.her complaint alleges an abuse of governmental power based on the defendants willful encouragement of private individuals to trespass onto her property.
graham connor controls.graham held that substantive due process can not independently support a claim when an explicit textual source of constitutional protection governs the precise conduct at issue.at.for the reasons discussed above,all of presley claims fall within the ambit of the fourth amendment seizure clause and the fourteenth amendment procedural due process protections.thus,those provisions,not the more generalized notion of substantive due process,must be the guide for analyzing presley claims.id.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing presley substantive and procedural due process claims,reverse the judgment of the district court dismissing her fourth amendment seizure and conspiracy claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.
today decision,in my view,departs from a long and body of law under the fifth amendment and drastically changes important substantive and procedural aspects of federal inverse condemnation actions.as i explain below,permitting presley to pursue her claim under the fourth amendment results in nothing less than the application of a new standard of liability,the creation of a new spectrum of damages,and the elimination of procedural prerequisites for pursuing an inverse condemnation claim in federal court.
according to presley complaint,the city seized a strip of her land for a public establish a section of a public hiking trail along the rivanna river.she does not want her land used by the public,however,and sued to stop the city from representing to the public that her property is open for public use as part of the rivanna trail system.instead of raising a fifth amendment claim that the city is taking her property without just compensation,presley asserts only that she suffered an unreasonable seizure of her property in violation of the fourth amendment.my belief is that presley allegations present a quintessential takings claim under the fifth amendment and that to allow her to pursue relief under the fourth amendment here would undercut fifth amendment takings jurisprudence 
at first glance,the fourth amendment may appear to apply in this situation.there was a seizure of her property and an easy argument can be made that the seizure was unreasonable.in my judgment,however,the fact that the city seized her real property for permanent public use puts this matter under the takings clause of the fifth amendment exclusively see nollan california coastal comm n,d explaining that a fifth amendment taking by physical occupation occurs where individuals are given a permanent and continuous right to pass to and fro,so that the real property may continuously be traversed,even though no particular individual is permitted to station himself permanently upon the premises.the supreme court fifth amendment case law establishes both procedural requirements and remedies tailored to circumstances involving landowners who are informally dispossessed of all or a portion of their real property by the government for an ongoing public use.as explained below,permitting presley to invoke the fourth amendment here would allow her to make an around this body of law.and,just as significantly,i believe that application of fourth amendment reasonableness standards to presley claim would ultimately prove to be unworkable.
first,to say the city actions may fall within the definition of a seizure does not necessarily mean presley claim arises under the fourth amendment.indeed,a seizure as defined in fourth amendment cases occurs in every case where there is a taking by physical occupation as opposed to a regulatory taking.but the application of the fourth amendment to cases like this one would upset the and clear procedure for raising constitutional challenges to this type of taking by the government,requiring the plaintiff first to seek in state court compensation for the taking and permitting the plaintiff to proceed to federal court only if just compensation is denied.see williamson county reg l planning comm hamilton bank of johnson city,d.allowing a plaintiff to bring a fourth amendment claim any time a state government physically seizes real property for public use,as presley contends we must,would severely undermine the process contemplated by the supreme court in williamson 
moreover,permitting plaintiffs like presley to proceed under the fourth amendment would expose governments to a radically different measure of damages than would be available in a traditional inverse condemnation action where the plaintiff damages are generally limited to the fair market value of the property taken.see kirby forest,united states,d just compensation means in most cases the fair market value of the property on the date it is appropriated.a plaintiff asserting a fourth amendment violation,however,would be entitled to recover the full measure of damages typically available in a action,including damages for the emotional distress caused by the government unreasonable conduct,and even punitive damages in the proper case.see memphis cmty.sch.dist.stachura,d we have repeatedly noted that creates a species of tort liability in favor of persons who are deprived of rights,privileges,or immunities secured to them by the constitution.accordingly,when plaintiffs seek damages for violations of constitutional rights,the level of damages is ordinarily determined according to principles derived from the common law of torts.footnote,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted smith wade,d a jury may be permitted to assess punitive damages in an action under when the defendant conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent,or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.to allow a plaintiff characterization of her claim to effect such a radical difference in the government potential liability seems unwise,to say the least.
i also believe that permitting presley to pursue a fourth amendment claim under the facts of this case is inconsistent with existing fourth amendment jurisprudence.most fourth amendment seizure cases involve relatively brief and completed seizures,such as traffic stops and arrests.but where the seizure is ongoing and indefinite,courts typically reject arguments that a continuing seizure can be challenged under the fourth amendment.see,lee city of chicago,cir rejecting fourth amendment claim in case where police refused to return an impounded car,concluding that such a continuing seizure must be analyzed under the due process clause fox van oosterum,cir explaining that o nce the act of taking the property is complete,the seizure has ended and the fourth amendment no longer applies riley dorton,cir en banc rejecting concept of a fourth amendment continuing seizure and concluding that the fourth amendment governed only those claims of excessive force occurring at the time of arrest claim that excessive force was used later,when plaintiff was being interviewed at the police station,is governed by the fourteenth amendment standard applicable to detainees.since the seizure at issue in this case is a continuing one,the cases rejecting the continuing seizure concept and placing a temporal restriction on fourth amendment claims would seem to foreclose presley claim that she may proceed under the fourth amendment.
even assuming,however,that the continuing nature of the seizure was not an insuperable obstacle to presley fourth amendment claim,application of the general fourth amendment standard would simply be unworkable in cases like this one.reasonableness is the overarching standard in fourth amendment inquiries.i can not envision a case where a government taking of private property for a public purpose without just compensation,which is what presley alleges happened in this case,would be anything but unreasonable per se.to accept presley characterization of her claim as arising under the fourth amendment would thus create an entire class of constitutional tort claims where liability on the part of the government would be virtually automatic and where the government would be exposed to the full panoply of damages.
presley relies almost exclusively on the supreme court opinion in soldal cook county,d.in soldal,police officers facilitated the improper repossession of a mobile home by private parties.the owner of the mobile home brought an action under alleging that the police officers violated the fourth amendment and the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.the seventh circuit rejected the plaintiff efforts to bring a fourth amendment claim against the officers,concluding that the claim was properly viewed as alleging,at most,a due process claim.the supreme court reversed,holding that c ertain wrongs affect more than a single right and,accordingly,can implicate more than one of the constitution commands.id.at.the court noted that the fo
