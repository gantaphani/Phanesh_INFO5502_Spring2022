opinion of the court 
this case requires the court to consider the contours of state sovereign immunity and under what circumstances such immunity may be waived.
alleging violations of both federal and state antidiscrimination laws,michael lombardo lombardo filed an employment discrimination complaint in the court of common pleas of luzerne county against the commonwealth of pennsylvania department of public welfare and its secretary,estelle richman,in her official capacity collectively,the commonwealth.based on the federal claim,the commonwealth removed the complaint to the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania and sought partial dismissal on sovereign immunity grounds.the parties acknowledge that pennsylvania has not statutorily waived its sovereign immunity for claims brought under the federal statute at issue,and they agree that the central question in this appeal is whether the commonwealth waived such immunity by voluntarily removing this matter from state to federal court.
the district court denied the commonwealth motion to dismiss,reasoning that the commonwealth waived its eleventh amendment immunity by removing the case.we agree that the commonwealth voluntary removal unequivocally invoked the jurisdiction of the federal courts and thereby waived the commonwealth eleventh amendment immunity from suit in a federal forum.
we hold,however,that state sovereign immunity includes both immunity from suit in federal court and immunity from liability,and that a state may waive one without waiving the other.because the commonwealth removal did not waive its immunity from liability,we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to grant the commonwealth motion for partial dismissal.
lombardo worked at the white haven center,a facility for the developmentally disabled located in white haven,pennsylvania,for more than years.in,lombardo was passed over for a promotion.lombardo,years old at the time,believed that this action was due to his age.on march,he filed a complaint asserting two grounds for relief violation of the federal age discrimination in employment act adea,and violation of the pennsylvania human relations act phra.lombardo sought equitable relief and damages.
on april,based on the adea claim,the pennsylvania department of public welfare the department removed the case to the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania and moved for dismissal.lombardo then amended his complaint to add a second secretary of public welfare,estelle richman,in her official capacity.the commonwealth moved for partial dismissal of the amended complaint on the ground that its eleventh amendment immunity barred lombardo claims under the adea,save for his claim for prospective injunctive relief against the secretary the district court denied the motion to dismiss,holding that the commonwealth voluntary removal of the case to federal court waived its eleventh amendment immunity under lapides board of regents of the university system of georgia,d,even though pennsylvania has not consented to suit or waived immunity under the adea in its own courts.this appeal followed.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to and.defendants appeal from the district court order denying a claim of sovereign immunity by the department,a state agency.we have subject matter jurisdiction under,as such orders are immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.see puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d.this court exercises plenary review over an order denying a motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity.ex rel.sch.dist.of the city of newark,cir.
our constitution established a system of dual sovereignty between the states and the federal government,gregory ashcroft,d,in which the states retain a residuary and inviolable sovereignty.alden maine,d quoting the federalist james madison see seminole tribe of florida,d acknowledging that t he constitution specifically recognizes the states as sovereign entities.an important feature of this sovereignty is state sovereign immunity.see puerto rico aqueduct,at.stating that the states,although a union,maintain certain attributes of sovereignty,including sovereign immunity.the supreme court has described sovereign immunity as based on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends.nevada hall,d quoting kawananakoa polyblank.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that state sovereign immunity is not a unitary concept.we can discern two distinct types of state sovereign immunity immunity from suit in federal court and immunity from liability.
the immunity of states from suit in the federal courts is a fundamental aspect of state sovereignty.ins.of chatham county,d see alden,at.noting john marshall comment at the virginia ratifying convention that i hope no gentleman will think that a state will be called at the bar of the federal court quoting debates on the federal constitution elliot ed.the supreme court has explained that t he founding generation thought it neither becoming nor convenient that the several states of the union,invested with that large residuum of sovereignty which had not been delegated to the united states,should be summoned as defendants to answer the complaints of private persons.alden,at.quoting in re ayers.
only five years after the adoption of the constitution,however,the supreme court in chisholm georgia,dall,determined that the diversity clause of article iii of the constitution subjected the states to federal court jurisdiction.this holding led directly to the expeditious adoption of the eleventh amendment,which provides the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.in hans louisiana,the supreme court extended the eleventh amendment reach to suits by plaintiffs,thus barring all private suits against states in federal court.
accordingly,it is clear that the states possess immunity from suit in the federal courts,also known as eleventh amendment immunity.
the supreme court has also recognized,however,that the eleventh amendment does not define the scope of the states sovereign immunity it is but one particular exemplification of that immunity.fed.comm state ports,d see id.stating that the eleventh amendment does not explicitly memorializ e the full breadth of the sovereign immunity retained by the states when the constitution was ratified.consequently,the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the states extends beyond the literal text of the eleventh amendment.id.at.see alden,at.observing that the phrase eleventh amendment immunity is convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer,for the sovereign immunity of the states neither derives from,nor is limited by,the terms of the eleventh amendment.state sovereign immunity thus comprises more than just immunity from suit in federal court.it also includes a state immunity from liability.see fed.comm n,at.sovereign immunity does not merely constitute a defense to monetary liability or even to all types of liability.dellmuth muth,d declining to overrule the longstanding holding of hans that an unconsenting state is immune from liability for damages in a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens edelman jordan,d characterizing state sovereign immunity as safeguarding states against both suits and liability.
we look to state law to determine if the commonwealth maintains a separate immunity from liability.under pennsylvania law,the commonwealth enjoys sovereign immunity unless the general assembly specifically waives sovereign immunity.the state assembly has not specifically waived immunity for adea violations,nor are such violations included in the statutory exceptions to sovereign immunity.see.listing acts by a commonwealth party that may result in the imposition of liability on the commonwealth for which the defense of sovereign immunity shall not be raised to claims for damages see also chittister dep t of cmty.econ,cir acknowledging that,with the exception of the tort claims for damages in state court listed in,the commonwealth immunity is otherwise intact.
as a result,we conclude that the commonwealth possesses immunity from liability regarding claims under the adea.
we now turn to whether,in this case,the commonwealth has waived its immunity from suit in federal court or its immunity from liability.
a state immunity from suit is not absolute.congress may abrogate a state sovereign immunity in the exercise of its power to enforce the fourteenth amendment,and a state may consent to suit by making a clear declaration that it intends to submit itself to federal court jurisdiction coll.sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d.
furthermore,a state may waive its immunity from suit by invoking federal court jurisdiction voluntarily.id.at.the voluntary invocation principle emerged in early supreme court jurisprudence and was later examined in lapides.see gardner new jersey.finding waiver of eleventh amendment immunity where a state voluntarily appeared in bankruptcy court to file a claim against a common fund gunter atl.coast line.stating generally that where a state voluntarily becomes a party to a cause and submits its rights for judicial determination,it will be bound thereby and can not escape the result of its own voluntary act by invoking the prohibitions of the eleventh amendment clark barnard.holding that a state voluntary intervention in a federal court action to assert its own claim constituted a waiver of its eleventh amendment immunity.lombardo argues that the commonwealth waived its immunity from suit in federal court by voluntarily removing this matter from state to federal court.appellee br.at.we agree.
we begin with the facts of lapides.in,paul lapides,a professor employed by the georgia state university system,filed an action against the university system board of regents in state court.georgia had already consented to suit in its own courts regarding the type of claims lapides brought.georgia attorney general removed the case to federal district court and sought dismissal on eleventh amendment grounds.the supreme court held unanimously that georgia removal from state to federal court waived its eleventh amendment immunity,but limited its holding to the context of claims,in respect to which the state has explicitly waived immunity from proceedings.at.the court did not rule on whether voluntary removal affected immunity from federal law claims,as lapides only federal claim against georgia arose under and had to be dismissed,since a state is not a person against whom a claim for money damages may be asserted.id.
despite expressly limiting its holding to claims from which immunity has been explicitly waived,the lapides court utilized broad language regarding waiver and removal.first,the court referenced the general principle that immunity is waived where a state voluntarily invokes a federal court jurisdiction.at.the court concluded that removal is a form of voluntary invocation of a federal court jurisdiction sufficient to waive the state otherwise valid objection to litigation of a matter here of state law in a federal forum,id.at,explaining that a rule of federal law that finds waiver through a state attorney general invocation of jurisdiction avoids inconsistency and unfairness.id.at.georgia allegedly benign motive for removal did not influence the court decision,since adopt ing georgia eleventh amendment position would permit states to achieve unfair tactical advantages,if not in this case,then in others.id.at.
applying these principles to the matter at hand,we conclude that the commonwealth waived its eleventh amendment immunity from private suit in a federal forum when it voluntarily removed this case to federal court when a state,facing suit in its own courts,purposefully requests a federal forum,it expresses a clear intent to waive immunity from suit.while lapides limited its holding to claims for which immunity was waived in state court,it also teaches that,generally,removal is a form of voluntary invocation of a federal court jurisdiction sufficient to waive the state otherwise valid objection to litigation of a matter in a federal forum.at.
in estes,the court of appeals for the tenth circuit held that a state removal to federal court of a case including both state law and federal law claims constituted a waiver of eleventh amendment immunity for both categories of claims.at.similarly,in embury,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit determined that the rule established in lapides applied to both state and federal claims,as well as to claims asserted after removal.at.the embury court observed that n othing in the reasoning of lapides supports limiting the waiver to state law claims only,as it would be illogical for a state to consent to having state law questions determined by a federal court where federal jurisdiction can not even be obtained but for federal claims asserted in the same case,yet oppose federal jurisdiction over those federal claims.id.we agree 
we hold that the commonwealth removal of claims to federal court effected a waiver of immunity from suit in federal court.our holding today does not affect a state ability to raise sovereign immunity when it is involuntarily brought into federal court.it is only when a state removes claims from state court to a federal forum that it submits its rights for judicial determination,gunter,at,and unequivocally invokes the jurisdiction of the federal courts.
as stated previously,the commonwealth possesses immunity from liability under,save for certain specifically enumerated tort claims for damages in state court.see.const.stat.the question we now consider is whether the commonwealth nonetheless waived its immunity from liability by removing this case to federal court 
a state may waive its immunity from liability,but such a waiver must be express and unequivocal.see coll.sav.bank,at.pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.the supreme court has noted that an effective waiver of sovereign immunity,like the waiver of other rights,must involve the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right coll.sav.bank,at.quoting johnson zerbst.accordingly,we must indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver.aetna ins.kennedy.
we hold that while voluntary removal waives a state immunity from suit in a federal forum,the removing state retains all defenses it would have enjoyed had the matter been litigated in state court,including immunity from liability the supreme court has suggested that a state may waive its immunity from liability without waiving its immunity from suit in federal court,see atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d,superseded in other respects by civil rights remedies equalization amendment of,great life ins.read,and we see no reason to prohibit the inverse.see,meyers,at concluding that state sovereign immunity is comprised of two separate and distinct kinds of immunity immunity from suit and immunity from liability that a state waiver of one does not affect its enjoyment of the other and that immunity from liability is not encompassed within a state immunity from suit ramsey,at stating,in dictum,that a state may waive its immunity from substantive liability without waiving its immunity from suit in a federal forum jonathan siegel,waivers of state sovereign immunity and the ideology of the eleventh amendment,duke,explaining that state sovereign immunity has two independent aspects it is partly an immunity from suit in a particular forum federal court and partly a substantive immunity from liability,and removal should be understood to waive only forum immunity see also bolden southeastern.transp,cir greenberg,dissenting noting that a state can enjoy state sovereign immunity protection and yet not enjoy eleventh amendment immunity carlos manuel vazquez,sovereign immunity,due process,and the alden trilogy,yale,asserting that the court in alden and college savings rejected the interpretation of the eleventh amendment,and implicitly adopted the immunity from liability interpretation,under which
