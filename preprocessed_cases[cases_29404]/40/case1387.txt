this case arises from a petition for review of the board of immigration appeals the bia denial of petitioner yi ni application for withholding of removal pursuant to section b of the immigration and naturalization act the ina.we find that the bia decision is legally sound and supported by substantial evidence.we further find that ni has procedurally forfeited his request for a remand to present additional evidence.we therefore deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.
ni,a citizen of the people republic of china,filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal with the department of homeland security on april,ni application asserted that he was eligible for relief because he had a fear of future persecution in china under that country policy.his claim was based on section of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of the iirira codified at a according to the bia interpretation at the time,section allowed an applicant to establish eligibility for asylum and withholding based on past persecution if the applicant could show that his wife had been forced by the government to have an abortion.see matter of,en banc matter of,en banc.
ni application alleged that,after marrying ni hong mei in january,he fathered a son with her in.approximately two months after the birth of the couple son,mei was forced to have an intrauterine contraceptive device an iud inserted pursuant to the population control policies of the fuzhou municipality,the area where the couple resided.those policies prohibited rural couples from having more than one child and required them to follow certain contraceptive measures.in may,during a iud checkup,mei was diagnosed as pregnant.ni asserts that the pregnancy occurred without his wife knowledge due to the dislodging of her iud.according to ni,because the pregnancy was the couple second,the clinic staff subjected mei to an involuntary abortion in accordance with the local policies.
ni asserted that following that incident,he and his wife became depressed because they wished to have more children but were too afraid to conceive out of plan.according to ni,he and his wife would never have the chance to have more children and he therefore hated the family planning policy.id.ni and mei decided that they should leave china and,shortly thereafter,ni took an opportunity and left the country.id.mei remained in china.
on june,ni appeared for a merits hearing before an immigration judge an ij in baltimore,maryland.upon conclusion of ni testimony,the ij rendered an oral decision denying ni application.the ij concluded that ni asylum application was because he had failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he filed the application within one year of his arrival in the united states.the ij also denied ni withholding of removal application,holding that there was no clear probability that the respondent would be the victim of future persecution in china on account of his political opinion.j.although she did not directly address the basis for her decision,the ij appeared to rely largely on an adverse credibility finding regarding the alleged forced abortion.she focused on the fact that mei medical examination booklet,which ni submitted in support of his application,did not make any mention of an abortion taking place in.
ni appealed the decision to the bia.on june,the bia issued an opinion affirming the ij decision in part and remanding in part.the bia affirmed the ij conclusion that ni asylum application was however,the bia remanded the matter for further analysis of the respondent claim for withholding of removal,holding as follows 
the immigration judge did not make an explicit finding with regard to the respondent credibility and provided little analysis of the merits of his claim that his wife was subjected to a forcible abortion of her second pregnancy in may.rather the immigration judge appears to have based her decision to deny relief solely on the fact that the gynecological examination booklet submitted in support of the respondent claim does not contain any reference to the alleged abortion in may.we consider the immigration judge decision in this case to be insufficient for purposes of appellate review and conclude that remand for further and legal analysis is appropriate.
citations omitted.
on remand,the ij expressly made an adverse credibility finding with regard to ni claim that his wife was forced to have an abortion.this finding was based on a material discrepancy between his oral account of what transpired and documentation which he has submitted in support of his clam.the ij again found especially relevant the fact that mei medical booklet did not make any reference to an abortion.she further noted that ni provided no explanation of why such a reference would have been omitted.the ij also highlighted that ni had failed to present any corroborative evidence for his claim,in spite of the fact that he had three years in which to do so.
ni once again appealed the decision to the bia.on april,the bia dismissed ni appeal.in affirming the ij decision,the bia held 
assuming that the immigration judge adverse credibility determination did not undermine ni application for withholding of removal,her denial of his application for such relief was not in error because his claim is primarily based on his wife alleged forced abortion.
the bia concluded that,as held by the attorney general in the decision in matter of,which overturned prior bia precedent under section of the iirira a claim of persecution based on a forced abortion can only be brought by the individual who has undergone the procedure.the bia also found that ni had not shown any other grounds for eligibility.it noted that mei forced insertion of an iud did not rise to the level of persecution and that,in any event,there was no nexus between ni alleged resistance to the policy and the insertion of the iud.finally,the bia also held that ni claim that he would face persecution when he had more children in the future was too speculative.the bia therefore affirmed the ij denial of ni claims.ni petitioned this court for review of the bia decision.
ni challenges only the bia denial of his withholding of removal claim.he presents three contentions.first,ni argues that the bia erred in relying on matter of to deny his claim because that decision concerned persecution in the context of asylum rather than withholding of removal.second,he asserts that,even if he was unable under matter of to show past persecution based on his wife forced abortion,his claim should nonetheless have been granted because he showed a clear probability of persecution on other grounds.finally,ni argues in the alternative that,because matter of changed the legal standard applicable to his case,the matter should be remanded to the ij so that he may have an opportunity to present additional evidence to support his claim in light of the new legal standard.we address each argument in turn.
in addressing ni first contention,we must consider whether his withholding of removal claim is foreclosed by the holding in matter of that section of the iirira does not permit a husband to establish past persecution or fear of future persecution based on his wife forced abortion.because the attorney general holding in matter of involves a question of statutory interpretation,we must first evaluate the validity of that interpretation,see chevron,natural res.def.council,and then determine whether it governs the present case.
we begin by exploring the relevant legal background.we then analyze the attorney general interpretation of section under chevron.finally,we determine whether section as interpreted applies to ni withholding of removal claim.
withholding of removal is available under b only to an alien who can demonstrate a clear probability of persecution on account of his race,religion,nationality,membership in a social group,or political opinion.ngarurih ashcroft,cir.to establish a clear probability of persecution,the alien must prove that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal.gomis holder,cir.
ni claim of persecution is based on his wife forced abortion pursuant to china policy.forced abortion is recognized as grounds for establishing persecution under section of the iirira,which amended the ina to include the following sentence 
for purposes of determinations under this act,a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
a b footnote call number added.congress passed section in for the express purpose of overturning the bia decision in matter of chang,which had held that involuntary sterilization pursuant to china one child policy did not constitute persecution on account of a protected ground.dong holder,cir quoting linzheng attorney general,cir en banc.
in,the bia interpreted the new section to mean that the spouse of a woman who has been forced to undergo an abortion or sterilization procedure can thereby establish past persecution.matter of.see also matter of,en banc explaining and reinforcing the holding of matter of.this interpretation was based largely on the finding that t he impact of forced abortions or sterilizations on a husband and wife shared right to reproduce and raise children is such that the forced sterilization of a wife could be imputed to her husband,whose reproductive opportunities the law considers to be bound up with those of his wife.matter of,at quoting chen ashcroft,cir internal quotations omitted.
we previously adopted this interpretation of section in a case where the government did not contest it.in gonzales,cir,we held that an applicant for withholding of removal could establish past persecution based on his wife forced abortion pursuant to china policy 
the bia interprets section to cover the spouse of a person subjected to a forced abortion or sterilization,and the government does not challenge this interpretation thus,lin may establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal by demonstrating that his wife was forced to undergo an abortion or that he himself has a fear of sterilization or other persecution if he returns to china.
id.at citations omitted.several other circuits similarly applied the bia construction.see chen attorney general,cir cao gonzales,cir zhang gonzales,cir he ashcroft,cir.
in,however,the second circuit brought the bia interpretation of section into question.in lin,cir,the court rejected the bia position that the language of section covered the spouses of women forced to abort,concluding that the bia erred by failing to acknowledge language in a,viewed in the context of the statutory scheme governing entitlement to asylum,that is unambiguous and that does not extend automatic refugee status to spouses of individuals a expressly protects.id.at.
shortly thereafter,the third circuit ordered the department of justice to submit additional briefing in its pending case of shi.attorney general.lexis cir.july,in which an applicant sought asylum based on his wife forced insertion of an iud.the government was directed to address whether it adheres to the board interpretation of section a or whether it joins the second circuit in rejecting the board construction of section a.matter of,at.in response to this request,the attorney general directed the bia to refer to him its decision in shi for review pursuant to.h i.
the attorney general then issued an order in may overruling the bia prior case law and holding that the spouse of a person who has been physically subjected to a forced abortion or sterilization procedure is not per se entitled to refuge status.matter of,at.the attorney general explained that the text and structure of section clearly indicate that it is only intended to cover the specific individual that was subjected to the forced procedure and not that individual spouse.the attorney general also noted that interpreting section to cover spouses created conflicts with several other ina provisions,including those requiring each individual asylum applicant to establish fear of persecution in his or her own right and those setting specific limits and requirements for the derivative relief available to some spouses of successful asylum applicants.
following matter of,at least three other circuits have applied the attorney general new interpretation of section in published opinions no circuit appears to have rejected it.see yu attorney general,cir jin holder,cir attorney general,cir en banc.
we turn now to the question of whether to adopt the attorney general construction of section.because in making that determination we are reviewing an agency construction of the statute which it administers,we must be guided by the application of the familiar chevron framework.chevron,at.before conducting that analysis,however,we must first determine the extent to which our consideration is affected by our precedent in,which applied a contrary interpretation to that reached by matter of.
the supreme court has addressed the precise question that confronts us a court prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,emphasis added.we have previously applied brand x in the context of a bia interpretation that is contrary to our precedent.in fernandez keisler,cir,a petitioner urged us to apply our precedent in united states morin,cir,where we held that a person qualifies as a national of the united states under a if he can establish that he owes permanent allegiance to the united states.morin,at.the bia had subsequently rejected such interpretation of the statute,finding that a b does not provide a means for acquiring national status.fernandez,at.
relying on brand x,we held that a lthough we agree with fernandez that he would qualify as a national under morin,our decision in morin did not purport to set forth the only possible interpretation of the definition of national of the united states and therefore we must afford deference to the bia contrary,interpretation of the ina if it is a permissible construction of the statute.id.quoting chevron,at.we explained that,although brand x in no way calls into doubt our many previous judicial interpretations that rested on the unambiguous words of the statute,where a prior decision of this court applied an interpretation that it merely assumed was correct without saying anything,one way or the other,about whether the statute dictated such an interpretation,that decision must yield to a reasonable interpretation by the relevant agency.id.at emphasis in the original.
here,did not hold that the interpretation it was applying followed from the unambiguous terms of the statute.brand x,at.in fact,the opinion made clear that because the bia interpretation of section was uncontested at the time,we merely assumed it was correct without saying anything,one way or the other,about whether the statute dictated such an interpretation.fernandez,at.therefore,pursuant to brand x and fernandez,our precedent in is not controlling here if our chevron review of matter of reveals that the language of the statute is unambiguous and thus the attorney general interpretation of section is correct.accordingly,as the court did in fernandez,we will guide our analysis by the application of the chevron framework.see id.at.
pursuant to chevron,we must first consider whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.united states,cir quoting chevron,at.if we determine that congress has indeed so spoken,we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.quoting chevron,at.if,however,we find that congress has not directly spoken,we must determine whether the agency interpretation of the statute in question is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.
in seeking to determine whether congress has directly spoken through section,we must begin by examining its plain language and give the relevant terms their common and ordinary meaning.reid angelone,cir internal quotations omitted.this is because we must assum e that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.gross fbl fin,internal quotations omitted.
section states in relevant part 
for purposes of determinations under this act,a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
a b emphasis added.the ordinary meaning of the word person in section is a n individual human being.webster third new int l dictionary emphasis added see also black law dictionary ed defining person as a human being.therefore,in using the word person,and omitting any reference to that person spouse,it is clear that congress intended to cover only the individual who has actually been forced to undergo the forced procedure or related persecution,or who has a fear of such persecution.see yu,at,at lin,at.had congress intended to cover couples rather than individuals,it could easily have said so.see,at had congress wished to extend protection to that person spouse,it could easily have defined refugee to include the person persecuted as well as his or her spouse.see also gutierrez ada,declining to read a word by inference into a statute that does not contain it and finding that t o argue otherwise is to tag congress with an extravagant preference for the opaque when the use of a clear adjective or noun would have worked nicely.
furthermore,as our sister circuits have noted,the fact that the statute makes reference to a person who fears that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure indicates that it intends to refer to only one person rather than a couple,for the individual pronouns he or she would not be needed if the word person was intended to automatically cover both members of a couple.a b.see yu,at,at lin,at see also lane united states,cir noting the basic principle of statutory interpretation instructing courts to avoid a reading which renders some words altogether redundant internal quotations omitted.
for these reasons,we join our sister circuits in holding that in section congress unambiguously expressed the intent to cover only the specific individual who has undergone forced abortion or sterilization,who has been persecuted for resisting,or who has a fear of such persecution.thus,as the attorney general correctly held in matter of,section clearly covers only an applicant personal,not derivative,experience or fear of persecution.see yu,at in simple terms,persecution,or the fear thereof,must be personally endured by the applicant.
even if we found that the terms of the statute were somehow ambiguous,we would still defer to the attorney general holding that an applicant who establishes that his spouse was subjected to a forced abortion is not entitled to refugee status under section based on that fact alone,matter of,at but rather must establish a fear of persecution in his own right,id.at as the supreme court has explained,the attorney general decisions regarding eligibility for withholding of removal are especially worthy of chevron deference because s ection h of title in express terms confers authority on the attorney general,making an alien entitlement to withholding turn on the attorney general determination whether the statutory conditions for withholding have been met,internal quotations omitted.the supreme court has also highlighted that judicial deference to the executive branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations.id.at quoting abudu.thus,we must give the attorney general determination controlling weight unless th e interpretation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.fernandez,at quoting chevron,at.
the attorney general decision in matter of is particularly of that deference.first,the attorney general analyzed the text of the statute in a manner consistent with the rules of statutory construction that we applied above.he explained 
section a is properly read to refer to the person physically forced to abort the pregnancy the mother because the clause refers to a person forced to abort a pregnancy,and not to a couple or a married couple forced to do so.section a subsequent description of an abortion as a procedure that a person is forced to undergo further supports this reading.because this latter description of a forced abortion can naturally be read only to refer to one person upon whom the procedure is physically would be inconsistent with the text and structure of section a to read the opening clause on abortion to encompass two people the mother and the father.
matter of,at emphasis in the original.as discussed previously,we find this reading of the statute text to be inherently reasonable.
second,the attorney general also discussed several other compelling reasons supporting his construction.for example,he noted that permitting a husband to be automatically eligible for asylum based on his wife persecution would circumvent the ina specific requirements for derivative asylum.the ina provides that spouses of persecuted individuals are eligible for derivative asylum if such spouses do not themselves qualify as refugees,but only if they accompany,or follow to join,the alien who is eligible for,and is actually granted,asylum.id.at internal quotations omitted.by granting applicants automatic refugee status based on their spouses persecution,the bia approach circumvents with an implied rule the requirements for derivative asylum that the act expressly sets forth id.
the attorney general further noted that the bia construction of section also departs from,and creates tension with,the act general requirement that every applicant for personal asylum as distinct from statutorily prescribed derivative asylum must establish his or her own eligibility for relief under specific provisions of the statute,and effectively absolve s large numbers of asylum applicants of the statutory burden to prove that they themselves have either been persecuted,or have a fear of being persecuted,on account of their political opinion.id.quoting lin,at.
the attorney general finding that these conflicts between the bia construction of section and other provisions of the ina counsel against adopting the bia construction is consistent with the principle that we must give meaning to all statutory provisions and seek an interpretation that permits us to read them with consistency.united states fisher,cir.
for these reasons,we conclude that the attorney general construction of section in matter of is reasonable and certainly not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.fernandez,at quoting chevron,at.
having found that the statute is unambiguous,we turn now to the question of whether the bia correctly applied it to ni withholding of removal claim.ni asserts that,because seeking protection from threat to one life or freedom through withholding of removal is a much broader concept than avoiding persecution for the purpose of seeking the relief of asylum,the bia mere reference to matter of as basis for finding him not eligible for withholding of removal is clearly erroneous because matter of persecution in the context of asylum.petitioner br.at emphasis added.that assertion is unavailing.
first,the attorney general in matter of specifically stated that the holding in that decision applied to withholding of removal claims.he explained 
i conclude that,at least as to political asylum or withholding of removal claims predicated on the enforcement of coercive population control programs,the ordinary meaning of the statutory term resistance,coupled with the text of section of the act and settled principles of asylum law,does not support the per se rule of spousal eligibility the board adopted in and reaffirmed in.
matter of,at emphasis added.therefore,matter of clearly applies to ni withholding claim.
furthermore,contrary to ni assertion,it is well settled that withholding of removal covers a narrower,rather than a broader,set of circumstances than asylum.see,describing those eligible for withholding of removal as a narrower class of aliens than those eligible for asylum.as the third circuit has explained,an asylum applicant need only establish a fear of persecution,whereas t he eligibility threshold for withholding of removal is even higher because t he applicant must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution.guo ashcroft,cir internal citations omitted.because of the higher standard required for withholding of removal,we follow the general rule that an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal camara ashcroft,cir.see also yu,at holding that,because the petitioner does not qualify for asylum under matter of,he necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard of proof for withholding of removal.
accordingly,we hold that ni can not establish a claim for withholding of removal based solely on his wife forced abortion.
notwithstanding matter of,ni argues that he is entitled to withholding of removal because he has shown past persecution or a clear probability of future persecution based on grounds other than his wife forced abortion.he asserts that he has established persecution because he faced depression as a result of the abortion and felt too afraid to conceive out of plan he plans to have more children and will face persecution in china if he is successful in doing so and he has established persecution based on his wife forced insertion of an iud.the bia rejected each of these alternative grounds for relief.we review the bia findings for substantial evidence and we must affirm unless evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find that the applicant should have prevailed.dankam.gonzales,cir internal quotations omitted.in fact,to reverse the bia finding we must find that the evidence not only supports that conclusion,but compels it.id.internal quotations omitted.
it is clear under our precedent that ni depression does not suffice to support a finding of persecution.we have previously held that persecution can not be based on a fear of psychological harm alone and t hus to establish a claim for withholding an applicant can not rely solely on psychological harm but must also establish injury or a threat of injury to the applicant person or freedom.niang gonzales,cir finding no persecution where petitioner claim for withholding of removal focuse d on the psychological harm she claim ed she w ould suffer if her daughter accompanie d her to senegal and was there subjected to fgm.
furthermore,ni depression claim suffers from the fatal defect that he can not show a nexus between the alleged harm and his political opinion.see saldarriaga gonzales,cir to satisfy the statutory test,an applicant must make a showing.he must demonstrate the presence of a protected ground,and he must link the feared persecution,at least in part,to it.in other words,ni can not show that he suffered the emotional persecution on account of his political opinion because there is no evidence that the government ever perceived ni as holding any particular political opinion or that he ever exhibited resistance to the population control policies ngarurih,at see lin,at,recognizing that an individual whose spouse undergoes,or is threatened with,a forced abortion or involuntary sterilization may suffer a profound emotional loss as a partner and a potential parent,but explaining that where the applicant himself has not resisted coercive family control policies,he would need to demonstrate,though sic persuasive direct or circumstantial evidence,that his wife,fiancee,or girlfriend resistance has been or will be imputed to him.therefore,we hold that ni depression is not sufficient to support his withholding claim.
ni argument that he plans to have more children and will therefore face persecution is both speculative and unsupported by the record the fear is speculative because it depends on many factors outside of ni control,including his wife willingness to have more children and the couple physical ability to conceive,which ni himself has questioned see ni affidavit stating that as of the year,he and his wife were both getting quite old for child birth and would never have the chance to have more children if he stayed in china see also huang,cir holding that an applicant fails to establish eligibility for relief based on future persecution under china one child policy where his fear lacks solid support in the record and is merely speculative at best.
in addition,the record directly contradicts ni contention that he is likely to face persecution.in order to establish a clear probability of persecution based on china family planning policies,ni would have to show that he would face persecution for violating or resisting the policies.see a b.he has failed to do so.although ni alleges that he hated the family planning polic ies,there is nothing in the record to indicate that he ever took any affirmative steps to violate or resist them,or that the chinese government ever perceived him as opposing the policies.nor is there any indication in the record that,if deported,ni plans to engage in behavior that will subject him to persecution in the future.in fact,the opposite is true.ni testified in his deposition that he would not have more children if returned to china because of his unwillingness to break the law.see if you deport me back to china,it impossible for me to have any more children b ecause the chinese government will not allow me.although his return would potentially put him in the unfortunate circumstance of being legally prohibited from having more children,he can not establish that it would subject him to persecution on account of his violation of or resistance to the family planning policies because the record does not support the conclusion that he will ever violate or resist the policies.
were the fact that a person is subject to family planning policies sufficient to establish persecution,every chinese citizen of childbearing age would be eligible for relief.withholding of removal does not protect against the existence of the family planning policies.it only protects those who face a clear probability of persecution as a result of violating or resisting the policies.see b.because the record here does not compel the conclusion that ni has established a clear probability that he will face such persecution,we must uphold the bia finding that ni is not eligible for withholding of removal on this basis.see dankam gonzales,cir quoting,n t o reverse the bia finding we must find that the evidence not only supports that conclusion,but compels it emphasis in the original.
finally,matter of squarely forecloses ni argument that he can establish persecution based on the fact that mei was forced to have an iud inserted.matter of actually dealt with a case in which the petitioner made an identical argument,namely that he could establish past persecution because his wife had been forced by the chinese government to have an iud inserted.in rejecting that argument,the opinion holds that,under section,a petitioner can not establish persecution based on his wife forced iud insertion.see matter of,at.
furthermore,although we have previously left open the question of whether the required insertion and continuous usage of an iud might constitute sterilization for purposes of persecution,lin muk
