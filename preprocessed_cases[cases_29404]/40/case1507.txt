in this case we consider the effect of the commerce power on a federal court discretion to abstain under younger harris,d.southern ohio disposal llc sod,an solid waste disposal service,contracted with customers in west virginia to collect their garbage and dispose of it in ohio.the public service commission of west virginia psc barred sod from competing with waste removers whom the psc effectively had licensed with an exclusive franchise.after the agency ruling,sod brought suit in federal district court to enjoin the psc from enforcing its order.sod argued that the psc order violated the commerce clause.the district court abstained under younger.
we reverse.the values of comity and federalism protected by younger are undeniably important.but the state interests at stake here do not fall among those the federal courts have repeatedly recognized as deserving of special respect and solicitude.moreover,the federal interest asserted under the commerce power lies at the core of the commercial values protected by that clause,namely the promotion of robust trade and enterprise among the several states.this interest has been reaffirmed in this specific context by a panel of this court.see medigen of,pub.serv.comm n,cir.we hold that the district court erred in abstaining from ruling on the significant commerce clause challenge raised in sod complaint,and we remand the case for a determination on the merits.
southern ohio disposal,an ohio company owned by james harper,removes solid waste from its customers in west virginia.sod base is in pomeroy,ohio trucks start there and,after collecting the refuse,return to ohio to dispose of it.
west virginia requires common carriers engaged in businesses like sod to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the psc.ann.a michie.without the certificate,it is unlawful for any contract carrier by motor vehicle to operate in west virginia.id.a.but obtaining the certificate requires demonstrating that those who already are certified to provide service for a given geographic area are not adequately serving the same territory.id.in the absence of such a showing,the psc shall not grant such certificate to any applicant.id.a.
it is undisputed by sod competitors that this arrangement gives those waste haulers a monopoly over a given geographic area.and indeed west virginia law states that one purpose of the regulation of common carriers is prevent ing unnecessary multiplication of service among them.id.this regulatory system applies to competitors,but more importantly here,that it erects barriers to interstate trade in solid waste hauling.it is this interstate effect that makes relevant the commerce clause.
sod had no certificate and was therefore not in compliance with state law and psc regulations one of sod competitors filed a complaint with the psc against the town of mason,west virginia,because the town had contracted with sod.the competitor had been awarded the franchise for that area by the psc.sod was subsequently added to the complaint as a necessary party.sod attempted to remove to federal court,but the district court found that under a,the psc was not a state court and removal was therefore unavailable.
initial proceedings before the chief administrative law judge for the psc favored sod.the alj found that the psc requirements violated the commerce clause.she recognized that the psc had unsuccessfully defended very similar regulations in medigen of kentucky,public service commission,cir.those regulations governed interstate transportation of medical waste this court found them to violate the dormant commerce clause,even under the most deferential test of pike bruce church,d.medigen concluded that the psc had restrict ed market entry and in so doing had wrongfully limited the available service from which customers could choose,including interstate carriers.the court held that west virginia goal of providing universal service at reasonable rates may well be a legitimate state purpose,but restricting market entry does not serve that purpose.medigen,at.finding that medigen foreclosed the similar regulations that impeded interstate transportation of solid waste,and concluding that none of the distinctions of medigen urged by sod competitor were meaningful,the alj recommended that the complaint be dismissed.
the psc,however,rejected this recommendation.it instead ordered sod to cease and desist from collecting solid waste in west virginia until it first obtains a certificate from the psc.although west virginia law permitted filing a petition with the supreme court of appeals within days of the adverse decision,ann.michie,sod declined to do so.as the parties acknowledge,review by that court is discretionary.
instead,sod brought suit against the psc in the district court for the southern district of west virginia.a large group of other waste had also intervened in the psc as defendants.the magistrate judge found federal jurisdiction,but concluded that both younger and burford sun oil,justified abstention.harper pub.serv.comm n,d.
sod appealed the abstention order to this court.we review decisions to abstain under an abuse of discretion standard.nivens gilchrist,cir.in the interim,sod asked us to enjoin psc enforcement of the order.we granted the injunction on july,and now reverse the district court decision to abstain.
younger abstention originated as a doctrine requiring federal courts not to interfere with ongoing state criminal proceedings.see younger,at.the supreme court has since made clear,however,that it applies as well to noncriminal judicial proceedings when important state interests are involved.middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d.criminal proceedings are,perhaps,the most obvious example of the states sovereign authority to perform their separate functions in their separate ways.younger,at.but other state functions also lie at the heart of the states identity under the constitution.in middlesex county,the court listed three questions which must be answered in the affirmative for a case to merit abstention under younger 
first,do the state proceedings constitute an ongoing state judicial proceeding second,do the proceedings implicate important state interests and third,is there an adequate opportunity in the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges.
middlesex county,at.emphasis in original.
the parties do not dispute the third prong,and we accordingly assume that the psc has shown that it provided an adequate opportunity to raise constitutional challenges.sod and the psc do disagree as to whether the psc order,and the availability of discretionary review by the supreme court of appeals,constitute ongoing judicial proceedings.we need not resolve this question,however,because we think that this case turns fundamentally on the second the psc decision implicates important state interests.we therefore turn to that question.
assuming the other requirements are met,if the state interests in the proceeding are so important that exercise of the federal judicial power would disregard the comity between the states and the national government,pennzoil texaco,d,abstention is proper.the list of areas in which federal judicial interference would disregard the comity that our federalism requires is lengthy.it encompasses those interests that the constitution and our traditions assign primarily to the states.functions which make our states sovereigns,rather than mere political subdivisions or regional offices of the federal government,new york united states,d,are inherently important state interests that may warrant younger abstention.
many interests beyond criminal law,see younger,at,are core sources of state authority.for instance,enforcing state court judgments cuts to the state ability to operate its own judicial system,a vital interest for younger purposes.see,pennzoil,at.
states have always held primary sway over education likewise,its close cousin f amily relations is a traditional area of state concern.moore sims,d requiring younger abstention in case involving custody of allegedly abused children.see also foster children bush,cir state foster care system joseph ex rel.wolfe ingram,cir access to adoption morrow winslow,cir adoption proceedings liedel juvenile court,cir child abuse proceedings.
similarly,property law concerns,such as land use and zoning questions,are frequently important state interests justifying younger abstention.see,carroll city of clemens,cir state and local housing code enforcement duty free shop,administracion de terrenos de puerto rico,cir eminent domain world famous drinking emporium,city of tempe,cir nuisance ordinance in aid of and closely related to tempe zoning ordinance.further,the law of probate,trusts,and the personal property of an important interest of the states for younger purposes.see,williams adkinson,distribution of decedent property.
matters relating to public health are not infrequently under the purview of the states,and may justify abstaining under younger.see,brach meat,abrams.state regulation of kosher meat sales.similarly,the regulation and licensing of health care professionals may be an important interest under the states residual police powers and bear on the abstention decision.see,green benden,cir suspension of psychologist state license majors engelbrecht,cir suspension of nurse license watts burkhart,cir suspension of medical license.
corporate law,too,often reveals state interests important in younger analysis.charitable trusts and corporations,like other corporations,have traditionally been creatures of the states.see,worldwide church of god,california,cir investigating fraud in charitable trusts.in addition,certain businesses have historically been subject to the oversight of state government,a factor which bears on abstention decisions.see,alleghany mccartney,cir domestic insurance companies implicate state substantial,legitimate regulatory interest johnson collins entm,cir gambling is an area where state authority has long been preeminent.
federal courts thus do not hesitate to recognize as important under younger those state interests which reflect the inalienable attributes of sovereignty retained by american states.we intend no detraction from this critical principle of federalism when we note that the supreme court requirement that the state interest be important precludes some candidates from admission.
over and again,the court has repeated this requirement of importance.we have applied the younger principle to civil proceedings in which important state interests are involved.we have also applied it to state administrative proceedings in which important state interests are vindicated ohio civil rights comm dayton christian,d internal citations omitted emphasis added.the court clear insistence that the interests be important requires us to recognize some limits.
one limit comes naturally,upon proper characterization of the state interest.were we to permit a lofty level of generality as to how we identify the interests at stake,we would find that nearly anything could at least touch on something like the general welfare,the public good,or public safety.this would render a nullity the requirement that we ensure that the state interest be important.the more difficult it is to specify the nature of the state proceedings with clarity,persuasiveness,and without attenuation,the less likely the proffered interest belongs in the zone of important state interests.
neither may we grind the state interest too finely,however,
because when we inquire into the substantiality of the state interest in its proceedings,we do not look narrowly to its interest in the outcome of the particular case rather,what we look to is the importance of the generic proceedings to the state i n dayton christian schools,we looked not to ohio specific concern with dayton christian schools firing of linda hoskinson,but to its more general interest in preventing employers from engaging in sex discrimination t he appropriate question here is not whether louisiana has a substantial,legitimate interest in reducing nopsi retail rate below that necessary to recover its wholesale costs,but whether it has a substantial,legitimate interest in regulating intrastate retail rates.
nopsi,at.internal citations omitted emphasis in original.in short,the characterization of state interests should not be general to the point of rendering the middlesex county test meaningless,or specific to the point of rendering the state interest trivial.
a second aid in testing the significance of state interests comes from recognizing that the central idea in abstention analysis has always been one of simple comity.johnson,at.this is true of abstention generally,but it has particularly been the touchstone of younger abstention.since younger itself,it has been understood that the interests of both the national and state governments are advanced when federal courts abstain from interfering with the kind of ongoing state proceedings which,simply stated,make a state a state.in a word,this itself is comity.see younger,at.this principle represents the structural nature of our constitution,reserved many functions to the states even as it has allocated others,for the benefit of all states,to the national government.
for this reason of comity,we hold fast to the notion that when an interest central to a case implicates the sovereignty and dignity of a state,and when the other requirements set forth in middlesex county are met,federal courts should abstain.interests like education,land use law,family law,and criminal law lie at the heart of state sovereignty,and a failure to abstain in the face of ongoing state proceedings would disrespect the allocation of authority laid in place by the framers.in other words,that which must be respected through comity is identical to the traditional areas of paramount state concern,johnson,at,and also the same as the important state interests test of middlesex county,at.when a state interest does not fit one of these characterizations,it will likely fail to satisfy any other,for they all are shorthand for the structural values of our federalism that justice black described.younger,at.
using this framework,we next evaluate the interests advanced by the psc in this case.
the district court,agreeing with the psc,concluded that the psc proceedings implicated the important state interest in protecting the health and welfare of its citizens.d at.this interest was advanced by preventing pollution and illness caused by the improper disposal of solid waste id.
at first glance,this may seem to fit within the range of state interests that meet the standards for younger abstention.but,as explained above,any interest can at least tangentially relate to health and welfare.the problem with this characterization is that the psc requirement challenged here does not concern improper disposal of solid waste.it concerns who has the right to contract with towns,businesses,and individuals in west virginia to remove that waste,not the manner in which that waste is removed.thus,the state interest at stake here is its interest in limiting interstate access to the waste removal market.while neutral health,safety,and environmental regulations are one thing,limitation on market access to maintain exclusive franchises for existing enterprises is another.the possibility that erecting barriers to entry may have certain positive derivative the district court called conceivable,an appropriate argument for a merits consideration,but is too remote to be the important state interest that is vindicated.
because the interest advanced here is one that by its very nature serves to impede interstate commerce,we must evaluate the effect of the dormant commerce clause upon the decision to abstain.although we do not reach the merits of the underlying claim,we conclude that the interest west virginia advances through the state action sod challenges is insufficient to warrant abstention.
it is true,as the psc asserts,that the mere assertion of a substantial constitutional challenge to state action will not alone compel the exercise of federal jurisdiction.nopsi,at.constitutional involved in younger abstention can be resolved by state courts.younger itself involved such a question much of its progeny did as well we have previously af
