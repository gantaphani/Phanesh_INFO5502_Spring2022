in connection with a proposed surface coal mine adjacent to reylas fork a stream in logan county,west virginia,the west virginia department of environmental protection wvdep issued highland mining company a permit under the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra to do the mining,finding that the proposed mine would not cause material damage to the hydrologic regime.the wvdep also issued a water quality certification under of the clean water act cwa,concluding that the proposed mine would not cause or contribute to violations of the state water quality standards,as well as a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit under cwa,finding that the proposed sediment pond for the mine would not have significant adverse effects.finally,the army corps of engineers the corps issued a fill permit under cwa,authorizing highland mining to place rock overburden into the adjacent valley of reylas fork as part of the mining process.the corps issued the permit without an environmental impact statement,finding that the fill would not have a substantial cumulative impact on the water quality in the relevant watershed.
four environmental groups collectively,the environmental coalition commenced this action to challenge the fill permit issued under cwa.the environmental coalition contends that the corps,in conducting its analysis for the permit,materially misapprehended the baseline conditions in the relevant watershed,thus corrupting its analysis of the cumulative impact that the mine would have on the streams in the watershed.it also contends that the corps acted arbitrarily and capriciously in determining that the valley fill would not have a significant cumulative impact on the water quality in the relevant watershed.
the district court evaluated the data considered by the corps,the corps analysis,and the corps conclusions and found that the corps did not misapprehend the baseline conditions in the relevant watershed.ohio valley envtl.coalition,army corps of eng rs ovec,d.it also found that the corps analyzed a wide array of evidence about water quality to reach a reasoned decision that the individual and cumulative environmental impacts of the corps cwa permit would not rise to the level of significance required to trigger the need for an environmental impact statement.id.at.as the district court concluded,t he corps has analyzed the cumulative impacts,articulated a satisfactory explanation for its conclusion,and thus has not acted arbitrarily or capriciously.id.quoting ohio valley envtl.coalition aracoma coal,cir.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the mining operation proposed at the reylas mine would involve removing mountaintop rock that covers the coal seams to be mined,placing the rock in the adjacent valley,extracting the coal,and replacing the rock on the mountaintop.see bragg.coal ass n,cir describing the process.because the rock is broken up as it is removed from the mountaintop,its volume swells such that all of the rock would not be needed to restore the mountaintop.the excess rock,or overburden,would accordingly be left in the valley as permanent fill.see kentuckians for the commonwealth,rivenburgh,cir.a sediment pond,as was typical,would be constructed below the valley fill to collect water until the valley fill is stabilized.see aracoma coal,at.in connection with the reylas mine,the overburden rock would be deposited in a valley that includes a stream called reylas fork.reylas fork flows into bandmill hollow,which in turn flows into dingess run.the dingess run watershed was the relevant area for assessing the mine cumulative impact.
to operate the reylas mine,highland mining obtained a smcra permit from the wvdep,a state agency that has assumed exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on nonfederal lands.a.highland mining also obtained from the wvdep a permit under cwa,certifying that the discharge from the mine will be consistent with the state standards,and a permit under cwa,authorizing the discharge of pollutants other than dredged or fill material into navigable waters.finally,highland mining obtained a permit under cwa from the corps to allow the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites.a.
under guidelines issued by the epa,the corps could issue a permit only after concluding that the mining activity would not cause or contribute to violations of the state standards or to the significant degradation of waters of the united states.b,c.in making that assessment,it had to comply with the national environmental policy act nepa and take a hard look at the potential environmental consequences of the activity.see robertson methow valley citizens council,d.nepa required federal agencies such as the corps to prepare an environmental impact statement eis for major federal actions that significantly affect the quality of the human environment.c.to decide if an eis was required,the corps had to prepare an environmental assessment.if,after conducting the assessment,the corps found that the proposed project would not,either individually or cumulatively,have a significant impact on human health or the environment,it could make a finding of no significant impact fonsi,obviating the need for preparing an eis.see also describing the contents of a fonsi.
before evaluating highland mining application for a permit,the corps gave public notice of the application and invited comment.the environmental coalition consisting of ohio valley environmental coalition,west virginia highlands conservancy,sierra club and coal river mountain watch,submitted comments opposing highland mining application.the coalition maintained that the disturbance from the reylas mine would be ecologically significant,as the sheer volume of disturbance in the region had already indicated significant degradation and would only be made worse by additional mining.the epa also submitted comments stating that this proposal is likely to cause or contribute to an excursion from the state water quality standards downstream resulting in an impairment of the aquatic life use.the epa warned that the direct and cumulative impacts from this and future mines will be persistent and permanent and can not be sufficiently or effectively compensated through the proposed mitigation.
after receiving the epa comments,highland mining requested that the corps stay its consideration of the permit application until highland mining had an opportunity to allay the epa concerns.thereafter,the corps,the epa,and highland mining consulted each other and agreed to modifications to the conditions of the permit.under the agreement reached,highland mining would eliminate approximately feet of impact to reylas fork and apply a mitigation plan involving best management practices and monitoring.after the corps made these changes,the epa advised the corps,we believe that with appropriate permit conditions that the applicant could move forward with the issuance of the permit.
the corps released its combined decision document and permit on march,in which it included a fonsi with respect to the reylas mine.
the environmental coalition shortly thereafter commenced this action against the corps,its commander,and its district engineer,alleging that the corps failure to require an eis violated nepa and was arbitrary and capricious because the corps failed to take a hard look at the environmental impacts of those projects.the coalition also alleged that the corps arbitrarily and capriciously concluded that the permit would not result in violations of west virginia standards.the district court granted highland mining motion to intervene as a defendant.
on for summary judgment,the district court denied the environmental coalition motion for summary judgment granted the corps and highland mining for summary judgment and entered final judgment.ovec,d at.the court rejected the coalition argument that the corps,in conducting its analysis,misapprehended the baseline conditions of dingess run.id.at.it also rejected the coalition nepa challenge,finding that the corps took the requisite hard look.id.at.it noted that the corps reasonably relied on the expertise of the wvdep,the agency with primary responsibility for water quality,in determining that impacts on water quality will be insignificant.id.at.
the environmental coalition filed this appeal and at the same time requested that the district court issue an injunction to prevent highland mining from filling reylas fork valley pending appeal.when the district court denied the motion,the coalition filed a similar motion in this court,which we too denied,by order dated september.
the environmental coalition contends first that the corps,in determining the baseline conditions of the relevant watershed,which was part of its analysis of the cumulative impact of the proposed mining activity,made a material factual error and misapprehended the baseline conditions.it explains 
the corps combined decision document repeatedly stated that dingess run had good water quality,healthy aquatic life,and no significant mining impacts in fact wvdep has measured dingess run as being in poor biological condition and listed its entire mile length as an impaired water under d of the cwa.
this argument requires us to evaluate both the combined decision document,in which the corps makes its baseline assessment of current conditions in the relevant watershed,and the d document,in which the wvdep listed dingess run as among the state impaired streams.but our review is limited to deciding whether the corps considered the relevant factors when assessing the baseline conditions of the watershed.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass of,state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
in a report,the wvdep included dingess run on its list of impaired streams for purposes of complying with cwa d.the wvdep report explained that dingess run was included on the list based on measurements of a portion of a stream,using six benthic community metrics,metrics evaluating the stream bed for biological life which were combined into a single index.a stream scoring above using that index was categorized as biologically unimpaired a stream scoring between and fell within a gray zone and a stream scoring less than was considered biologically impaired.although the report found that dingess run was impaired,it cautioned that the scope of its finding was limited 
most streams with low biological scores are listed as having an unknown of impairment on the d list and most are listed,by default,for their entire length.it is doubtful that the entire length of every stream is impaired,but without further data,the exact length of impairment is unknown.
thus,the wvdep d list represented,based on limited data,the assessment that dingess run was impaired when measured against the single index and that the causes for the impairment were unknown.
this impairment finding undoubtedly raises the question of whether dingess run would be able to assimilate the effects of the reylas mine,particularly the effects of the valley fill that was the subject of the corps permit.two distinct analyses conducted in the combined decision document,however,convince us that the corps addressed the question only after considering the relevant data about baseline conditions and properly assessing them.first,the corps analyzed the conditions at the fill site itself.and second,the corps recognized and analyzed the impaired conditions of the streams in the relevant watershed.
in its analysis of the conditions at the site of reylas mine fill,the corps exhaustively reviewed the relevant data,reporting 
the streams proposed for impact at the site have perennial,intermittent and ephemeral flow regimes.the perennial and intermittent streams exhibit relatively good water quality based on analytical methods developed and approved by the usepa and wvdep based on usepa rapid bioassessment protocol,the streams fall in the middle range of range for habitat features,and have good west virginia stream condition index wvsci scores.the ephemeral streams lack sufficient water flow to conduct these analyses.within the perennial and intermittent streams,the macroinvertebrate analysis indicates a good benthic community representing the vitality of the stream bed with good diversity with a dominance of shredders.approximately of the species were comprised of the sensitive mayfly species.the presence of these types of benthic species indicates the stream has the ability to provide functions such as transport of nutrients,decomposition of organic,and food web support.overall,the perennial and intermittent stream channels located are of good quality and do provide several important functions.the ephemeral streams,due to their lack of flow throughout the majority of the year,do not provide these same functions.
the corps followed up this summary by detailing the supporting data collected with respect to physical habitat,water quality,benthics,and stream functioning.
with respect to physical habitat,the corps found that,overall,five of the eight streams proposed for impact exhibited good physical habitat,despite previous logging and deep mine activities at the site.
with respect to water quality,the corps referred to data collected in april and july.the samplings were conducted during the rainy season and presented 
overall good water quality for the majority of parameters tested.two sites,located within the perennial segments,had slightly elevated conductivities dissolved salts,while the site located higher in the watershed had a relatively low conductivity reading.
the samplings revealed that magnesium was higher than recommended but concluded 
although these parameters are slightly high,they do not appear to have resulted in adverse effects on the benthic communities at the sample sites as the data indicates thriving benthic communities.
id.the sampling found that the conductivities were higher,although magnesium levels remained similar to the levels.as to the water quality aspect,the corps concluded 
overall,water quality is good with the exception of elevated conductivity and magnesium readings in the lower perennial and intermittent sections of reylas fork.based on data obtained in downstream segments of bandmill hollow,the receiving stream and dingess run magnesium levels fall within acceptable parameters established by wvdep.
with respect to benthics,the corps noted that,based on testing conducted in april and july,the benthic community within the perennial and intermittent stream channels contained good benthic communities although there were slight differences in species diversity.the corps stated 
t he unnamed first right tributary of reylas fork presented the most diverse benthic community however the wvsci scores indicated very good biological integrity at each sampling location.the remaining streams proposed for impact are ephemeral and did not contain benthic communities.overall,the intermittent and perennial stream channels at the site contain good aquatic habitat despite the slightly elevated levels of conductivity and magnesium present in several of the streams at the site.
finally,with respect to stream functioning,the corps found that the majority of streams proposed for impacts are fully functional and of high quality based primarily on their position within the landscape,and how the stream interacts with geology,hydrology and soils,which influence biotic and physical processes.
with the specific water data evaluated and the impairments noted,the corps combined decision document concluded with a summary that the streams at the impact site 
are of good quality with good physical aquatic habitat,good riparian cover,good water quality with the exception of elevated conductivity and magnesium levels and viable benthic communities.
after looking at factors,the corps turned its attention to the dingess run watershed as a whole.it recognized,at the outset,that deep and surface coal mining and timber removal activities have been within the dingess fork watershed for the past years.because most of this activity was unregulated,many areas within the appalachian coal fields have been adversely impacted by these activities.id.the corps stressed the importance of these earlier mining activities
