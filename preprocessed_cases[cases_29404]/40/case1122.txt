opinion of the court 
at issue is whether certain parents who their children must comply with the reporting and review requirements of pennsylvania compulsory education law.compliance,the parents contend,would violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.the commonwealth of pennsylvania demurs,contending its compulsory education law neither substantially burdens the free exercise of religion nor transgresses neutral application to all citizens,and serves an important state interest in ensuring a minimal level of education for all children.
plaintiffs appeal from the grant of summary judgment for defendants in an action seeking declaratory relief and an injunction prohibiting enforcement of.stat.ann.act and prosecution under pennsylvania compulsory education laws.defendants are school districts in pennsylvania and superintendents named in their official capacity plaintiffs are six families who their children 
the commonwealth of pennsylvania education system,as enacted by the general assembly,allows parents to satisfy the compulsory attendance requirement through home education programs.parents supervising the home education programs must provide instruction for a minimum number of days and hours in certain subjects and submit a portfolio of teaching logs and the children work product for review.the local school district reviews the home education programs for compliance with the minimum hours of instruction and course requirements and determines whether each student demonstrates progress in the overall program.the school district does not review the educational content,textbooks,curriculum,instructional materials,or methodology of the program.
parents,who their children based on their sincerely held religious beliefs,have sued their respective school districts and school superintendents.parents contend the act requirements and the subsequent portfolio review place a substantial burden on their free exercise of religion.they seek an exemption from the act requirements and request declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the provisions of act violate the first and fourteenth amendments of the constitution of the united states and the pennsylvania religious freedom protection act rfpa.stat.ann.
parents have their children for many years.all six families are christians,but of different denominations.they hold in common a religious belief that education of their children,not merely the religious education,is religion and that god has assigned religious matters to the exclusive jurisdiction of the family.accordingly,because god has given parents the sole responsibility for educating their children,the school districts reporting requirements and discretionary review over their home education programs violate their free exercise of religion.
in,the commonwealth of pennsylvania passed the religious freedom protection act.the statute requires the commonwealth to justify substantial burdens on religious free exercise with a compelling interest and a showing that the least restrictive means has been employed to satisfy that interest.prior to the passage of the religious freedom protection act,many of the parents complied with the act home education program requirements,there is no evidence that the school districts ever questioned or interfered with parents home education programs educational content,methodology,curriculum,or materials.on some occasions,the school districts required parents to supplement their logs and portfolios with additional information.but parents are unable to identify an instance in which the school districts rejected any part of their home education program.
nevertheless,parents notified the school districts that act substantially burdens their free exercise of religion and sought an exemption from compliance the school districts refused to grant parents an exemption from act and threatened or,in some cases,initiated criminal prosecutions for truancy.
in response,parents sued the school districts in various state and federal courts seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,and rfpa.ultimately,the cases ended up before the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania,which consolidated the six cases for and summary judgment purposes.upon consent of the parties,discovery was limited to threshold legal issues such as whether act substantially burdened parents free exercise of religion under the rfpa and the proper standard of review for parents federal constitutional claims.the district court engaged in two rounds of summary judgment motions.
the first round addressed facial challenges to act.parents filed a consolidated motion for summary judgment and the school districts filed a consolidated opposition,but did not file a for summary judgment.the district court denied parents motion.combs homer ctr.sch,wl.in the second round,the school districts filed a motion for summary judgment addressing both parents facial and as applied challenges to act.the district court granted the school districts motion,concluding that parents failed to prove a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion,as defined by rfpa,combs homer ctr.sch,d,and act is a neutral law of general applicability,satisfying rational basis review id.at.as a result,the district court did not decide issues of compelling governmental interest or least restrictive means 
the pennsylvania constitution mandates that the general assembly provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education to serve the needs of the commonwealth,art.iii.the general assembly has carried out its constitutional charge by enacting the public school code.see.stat.ann.to 
the public school code requires every child of compulsory school age having a legal residence in this commonwealth to attend a day school in which the subjects and activities prescribed by the standards of the state board of education are taught in the english language.stat.ann.a.compulsory school age is defined as the period of a child life from the time the child parents elect to have the child enter school,which shall be not later than at the age of eight years,until the age of seventeen years.id.see also.a student who holds a certificate of graduation from a regularly accredited senior high school satisfies the compulsory attendance requirement and is no longer of compulsory school age.stat.ann.
the pennsylvania general assembly currently permits parents to choose among four alternative categories of education to satisfy the compulsory attendance requirement a public school with certain trade school options,id.a a private academic day school or private tutoring,a day school operated by a bona fide church or other religious body,id.b or a home education program,id.
significant to this appeal,the pennsylvania general assembly permitted the fourth alternative in.see act of,december.stat.ann.under act,a child instructed under a home education program satisfies the compulsory attendance requirement.id.a home education program must satisfy the same minimum hours of instruction requirements and almost all of the same subject matter requirements as a school operated by a bona fide church or religious body id.b,c.
prior to the commencement of a home education program,and thereafter on august of each year,the parent or guardian of the child must file an affidavit with the district superintendent setting forth 
the name of the supervisor of the home education program who shall be responsible for the provision of instruction the name and age of each child who shall participate the address and telephone number of the site that such subjects as required by law are offered in the english language,including an outline of proposed education objectives by subject area and that the home education program shall comply with the provisions of this section 
the superintendent of the public school district of the child residence is charged with ensuring that each child is receiving appropriate education,which is defined by act as a program consisting of instruction in the required subjects for the time required in this act and in which the student demonstrates sustained progress in the overall program.id.a.in order to demonstrate to the superintendent that appropriate education is taking place,at the end of each public school year the supervisor of the home education program must submit a file with two types of documentation first,the file must contain a portfolio of records and materials 
the portfolio shall consist of a log,made contemporaneously with the instruction,which designates by title the reading materials used,samples of any writings,worksheets,workbooks or creative materials used or developed by the student and in grades three,five and eight results of nationally normed standardized achievement tests in arts and mathematics or the results of statewide tests administered in these grade levels.the department shall establish a list,with a minimum of five tests,of nationally normed standardized tests from which the supervisor of the home education program shall select a test to be administered if the supervisor does not choose the statewide tests.at the discretion of the supervisor,the portfolio may include the results of nationally normed standardized achievement tests for other subject areas or grade levels.the supervisor shall ensure that the nationally normed standardized tests or the statewide tests shall not be administered by the child parent or guardian.
second,the supervisor of the home education program must obtain an annual written evaluation of the child work.id.e.the supervisor may choose any person qualified under act to make the evaluation the evaluation measures 
the student educational progress the evaluation shall also be based on an interview of the child and a review of the portfolio required in clause and shall certify whether or not an appropriate education is occurring.
based upon the entire portfolio of records and materials and the superintendent determines whether the home education program provides the child with an appropriate education.
if the superintendent determines,based on the documentation provided that appropriate education is not taking place for the child in the home education program,the superintendent shall send a letter to the supervisor of the home education program stating that in his opinion appropriate education is not taking place for the child in the home education program and shall return all documentation,specifying what aspect or aspects of the documentation are inadequate.
id.i.upon receipt of the letter,the supervisor has twenty days to submit additional documentation demonstrating that appropriate education is taking place for the child in the home education program.id.j.if the additional documentation is not timely submitted,the home education program shall be out of compliance with the compulsory attendance requirements and the student must promptly enroll in either a public school,a nonpublic religious school,or a licensed private school.id.
if the superintendent concludes that a timely amended file still fails to demonstrate appropriate education,he or she will notify the supervisor of his or her determination.further,the supervisor will be given a proper hearing by a duly qualified and impartial hearing examiner within thirty days.id.k if the hearing examiner finds that the documentation does not indicate that appropriate education is taking place in the home education program,the student must be promptly enrolled in either a public school,a nonpublic religious school,or a licensed private academic school id.l.the decision of the hearing examiner may be appealed by either the supervisor of the home education program or the superintendent to the secretary of education or commonwealth court of pennsylvania.id.k.
in practice,the school districts engage in a limited level of oversight.the school districts require a minimum of two contacts with the state during the calendar submission of an affidavit at the beginning of the year and the submission of the portfolio and evaluation at the end of the year.deposition testimony reveals that school officials do not check in on the progress of home education programs during the school year.furthermore,all school officials deposed acknowledged that they never disagreed with or rejected an independent evaluator assessment of the home education program.school officials reviewed the disclosures for compliance with the statute and,if all the required disclosures were presented,the home education program would be approved.
as noted,in the pennsylvania general assembly enacted the religious freedom protection act.stat.ann.titled a n act protecting the free exercise of religion and prescribing the conditions under which government may substantially burden a person free exercise of religion,id,the rfpa was based on two legislative findings 
laws and governmental actions which are facially neutral toward religion,as well as laws and governmental actions intended to interfere with religious exercise,may have the effect of substantially burdening the free exercise of religion.however,neither state nor local government should substantially burden the free exercise of religion without compelling justification.
the general assembly intends that all laws which it has heretofore enacted or will hereafter enact and all ordinances and regulations which have been or will be adopted by political subdivisions or executive agencies shall be construed so as to avoid the imposition of substantial burdens upon the free exercise of religion without compelling justification.
under rfpa,an agency shall not substantially burden a person free exercise of religion,including any burden which results from a rule of general applicability,id.a,unless the agency proves,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the burden is i n furtherance of a compelling interest of the agency and is t he least restrictive means of furthering the compelling interest,id.b.
the general assembly provides definitions for several key terms in section.first,free exercise of religion means t he practice or observance of religion under section of article i of the constitution of pennsylvania.id.second,person is defined as a n individual or a church,association of churches or other religious order,body or institution which qualifies for exemption from taxation under section c or d of the internal revenue code of public law.stat.ann.third,rfpa defines substantially burden as a n agency action which does any of the following 
significantly constrains or inhibits conduct or expression mandated by a person sincerely held religious beliefs.
significantly curtails a person ability to express adherence to the person religious faith.
denies a person a reasonable opportunity to engage in activities which are fundamental to the person religion.
compels conduct or expression which violates a specific tenet of a person religious faith.
rfpa allows a person whose free exercise of religion has been burdened or likely will be burdened in violation of to bring a claim in a judicial proceeding.id.a.prior to bringing a claim,the person must notify the agency,describing the agency action and the manner in which it burdens religion.id.b.a person who proves,by clear and convincing evidence,that the person free exercise of religion has been burdened in violation of may receive declaratory or injunctive relief.id.f.monetary damages are not available.id.
with limited exceptions.stat.ann.a b,rfpa applies to any state or local law or ordinance and the implementation of that law or ordinance,whether statutory or otherwise and whether adopted or effective prior to or after the effective date of this act,id.a.thus,rfpa applies to the public school code.stat.ann.to.
we address parents federal constitutional claim.parents contend act imposes a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion as protected by the first and fourteenth amendments the commonwealth asserts act is a neutral law of general applicability that is rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest in ensuring a minimal level of education for all children.applying rational basis review,the district court concluded that act passes constitutional muster as a neutral law of general applicability and effect.combs,d at.accordingly,the district court denied parents motion for summary judgment as to the facial challenge to act as a violation of the first amendment of the united states constitution and granted the school districts motion for summary judgment as to parents challenges.
in employment division,department of human resources of oregon smith,d,the supreme court held a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.church of the lukumi babalu aye,hialeah,d see also smith,at.t he right to free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religion prescribes or proscribes.the district court concluded that act is a neutral law of general applicability to all pennsylvania home schoolers and their home education programs,with no reference or special impact on religious practices combs,d at.as a result,the district court applied the rational basis test to parents challenge of act and upheld the provision.id.at.
in blackhawk pennsylvania,cir,we applied the standards for a neutral law of general applicability articulated by the court in hialeah.first,a law must be both facially and actually neutral.a law is neutral if it does not target religiously motivated conduct either on its face or as applied in practice.blackhawk,at see also hialeah,at.official action that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment can not be shielded by mere compliance with the requirement of facial neutrality.the free exercise clause protects against governmental hostility which is masked,as well as overt.second,the government can not advance its interests solely by targeting religiously motivated conduct.instead,the regulation must be generally applicable.
a law fails the general applicability requirement if it burdens a category of religiously motivated conduct but exempts or does not reach a substantial category of conduct that is not religiously motivated and that undermines the purposes of the law to at least the same degree as the covered conduct that is religiously motivated.
blackhawk,at see also hialeah,at.the principle that government,in pursuit of legitimate interests,can not in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief is essential to the protection of the rights guaranteed by the free exercise clause.
act is a neutral law of general applicability.it neither targets religious practice nor selectively imposes burdens on religiously motivated conduct.instead,it imposes the same requirements on parents who for secular reasons as on parents who do so for religious reasons.furthermore,nothing in the record suggests commonwealth school officials discriminate against religiously motivated home education programs,denying approval of home education programs because they include curriculum materials.
parents contend act is not a law of general applicability and is tantamount to a licensing scheme for.they cite blackhawk,at,for the proposition that a statute with a waiver mechanism creates a regime of individualized,discretionary exemptions that triggers strict scrutiny.parents reply br.at.parents depiction of act is mistaken and their reliance on blackhawk is misplaced.
as noted,there are four ways to fulfill the compulsory education requirement.none of the options is an exemption from the compulsory education law.all four require that a child be educated in the required subjects for the required period.furthermore,all parents who choose the home education program alternative,whether for religious or secular reasons,are required to fulfill the act requirements.parents cite no statutory waiver mechanism that gives the school districts the authority to waive or exempt some parents from the disclosure and review requirements.
in blackhawk,the pennsylvania wildlife code contained specific statutory exemptions authorizing the director of the game commission to waive a permit fee where hardship or extraordinary circumstance warrants.id.at.further,the court stated w e are not presented here with a neutral and generally applicable provision that is uniformly imposed without allowing individualized exemptions.under smith,such a scheme would not trigger strict scrutiny,and a person seeking to be excused from the provision requirements on religious grounds would be unlikely to prevail.id.at.act is a neutral law of general applicability and does not allow individualized exemptions.blackhawk is distinguishable.
since act is a neutral law of general applicability,we will apply rational basis review unless an exception to the smith rule applies.r ational basis review requires merely that the action be rationally related to a legitimate government objective.tenafly eruv ass n,tenafly,cir.under rational basis review,a statute is presumed constitutional,and the burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it,whether or not that basis has a foundation in the record.lighthouse,at quoting heller doe,d.
the commonwealth has a legitimate interest in ensuring children taught under home education programs are achieving minimum educational standards and are demonstrating sustained progress in their educational program.see,bd.of educ.allen,d a substantial body of case law has confirmed the power of the states to insist that attendance at private schools,if it is to satisfy state laws,be at institutions which provide minimum hours of instruction,employ teachers of specified training,and cover prescribed subjects of instruction i f the state must satisfy its interest in secular education through the instrument of private schools,it has a proper interest in the manner in which those schools perform their secular educational function.pierce soc.y of sisters of the holy names of jesus and mary.acknowledging the power of the state reasonably to regulate all schools,to inspect,supervise and examine them,their teachers and pupils.in brown board of education,the supreme court noted the importance of education and the meaningful role the state plays in preparing a child for citizenship and adult life 
today,education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society.it is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities,even service in the armed forces.it is the very foundation of good citizenship.today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values,in preparing him for later professional training,and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment.in these days,it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education.
act disclosure requirements and corresponding school district review rationally further these legitimate state interests.accordingly,act survives rational basis review.
parents assert their claim falls within a exception the supreme court discussed in smith 
the only decisions in which we have held that the first amendment bars application of a neutral,generally applicable law to religiously motivated action have involved not the free exercise clause alone,but the free exercise clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections,such as freedom of speech and of the press,see cantwell connecticut,at.invalidating a licensing system for religious and charitable solicitations under which the administrator had discretion to deny a license to any cause he deemed nonreligious murdock pennsylvania.invalidating a flat tax on solicitation as applied to the dissemination of religious ideas follett mccormick.same,or the right of parents,acknowledged in pierce society of sisters,to direct the education of their children,see wisconsin yoder,d invalidating compulsory laws as applied to amish parents who refused on religious grounds to send their children to school.
smith,at.parents contend act substantially burdens both their free exercise of religion and their fundamental right as parents,under the fourteenth amendment,to direct the education and upbringing of their children.accordingly,they invoke the exception of smith,seeking strict scrutiny review.alternatively,parents contend that,notwithstanding our determination,wisconsin yoder remains good law and the same constitutional test applies here.
although we have discussed the smith theory in prior opinions,its meaning and application remains an open question in our circuit.see blackhawk,at noting,while discussing smith,the court did not overrule prior decisions in which hybrid claims had prevailed against neutral,generally applicable laws,but deciding case on other grounds tenafly,at noting s trict scrutiny may apply when a neutral,generally applicable law incidentally burdens hybrid rights salvation army dep t of cmty.affairs,cir finding b ecause the present controversy does not concern any state action directly addressed to religion,the salvation army can not receive protection from the associational right derived from the free exercise clause.we have never decided a case based on a claim,let alone the type of a claim invoked based on the free exercise clause and the companion right to direct a child upbringing.
smith theory has divided our sister circuits.some characterize the theory as dicta and others use different standards to decide whether a plaintiff has asserted a cognizable claim.the united states courts of appeals for the second and sixth circuits have concluded the language in smith is dicta.see leebaert harrington,cir citing knight connecticut dep t of pub.health,cir watchtower bible tract soc y of new york,stratton,cir,rev on other grounds,d kissinger bd.of trs.of ohio state,coll.of veterinary,cir.furthermore,the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit views the exception as completely illogical,kissinger,at,and the united states court of appeals for the second circuit can think of no good reason for the standard of review to vary simply with the number of constitutional rights that the plaintiff asserts have been violated,leebaert,at accordingly,when faced with a neutral law of general applicability,both appellate courts decline to allow the application of strict scrutiny to claims and instead apply smith rational basis standard.see leebaert,at a t least until the supreme court holds that legal standards under the free exercise clause vary depending on whether other constitutional rights are implicated,we will not use a stricter legal standard to evaluate hybrid claims.quoting kissinger,at.
the united states courts of appeals for the first circuit and district of columbia have acknowledged that claims may warrant heightened scrutiny,but have suggested that a plaintiff must meet a stringent standard the free exercise claim must be conjoined with an independently viable companion right.see henderson kennedy,rejecting the hybrid claim argument that the combination of two untenable claims equals a tenable one catholic of,finding that the eeoc violation of the establishment clause triggered the exception gary manchester sch,cir citing gary manchester sch,d,affirming,for the same reasons,the district court rejection of a claim because the free exercise claim was not conjoined with an independently viable companion claim brown hot,sexy safer,cir rejecting a claim because plaintiff free exercise challenge is not conjoined with an independently protected constitutional protection 
this stringent approach requiring an independently valid companion claim has received criticism,most notably that such a requirement would make the free exercise claim superfluous.see hialeah,at.souter,concurring i f a hybrid claim is one in which a litigant would actually obtain an exemption from a formally neutral,generally applicable law under another constitutional provision,then there would have been no reason for the court in what smith calls the hybrid cases to have mentioned the free exercise clause at all.johnson,cir i t makes no sense to adopt a strict standard that essentially requires a successful companion claim because such a test would make the free exercise claim unnecessary.if the plaintiff additional constitutional claim is successful,he or she would typically not need the free exercise claim and the exception would add nothing to the case.
the united states courts of appeals for the ninth and tenth circuits recognize hybrid rights and require a plaintiff to raise a colorable claim that a companion right has been violated.san jose christian coll.morgan hill,cir see also,at.they define colorable as a fair probability or a likelihood,but not a certitude,of success on the merits.san jose christian,at,at.they characterize this,inquiry as a middle ground between two the extremes of painting claims too generously and construing them too narrowly,at.a plaintiff can not simply invoke the parental rights doctrine,combine it with a claimed right,and thereby force the government to demonstrate the presence of a compelling state interest.swanson guthrie indep.sch.dist.no,cir.nor is one required to establish that the challenged law independently violates a companion constitutional right alone,without any recognition of the free exercise clause.
by requiring a colorable claim that a companion right has been violated,the united states courts of appeals for the ninth and tenth circuits examine the claimed infringements on the party claimed rights to determine whether either the claimed rights or the claimed infringements are genuine.swanson,at.thus,in order to trigger heightened scrutiny,a plaintiff must show a fair probability or likelihood,but not a certitude,of success on the merits of his companion constitutional claim.
in smith,the court asserted that the case before it did not present a hybrid situation,but a free exercise claim unconnected with any communicative activity or parental right.at.the criterion applicable to a free exercise claim combined with a companion constitutional right was left undefined.see,kissinger,at noting that the smith court did not explain how the standards under the free exercise clause would change depending on whether other constitutional rights are implicated.since smith,a majority of the court has not confirmed the viability of the theory until the supreme court provides direction,we believe the theory to be dicta.
even if we were to apply the approaches used by our sister circuits colorable claim approach and independently viable claim would find parents arguments unconvincing.under either approach,we must determine whether parents can establish a claim by asserting combined violations of the free exercise clause and the companion right of a parent under the fourteenth amendment to direct a child education.parents have not presented an independent or colorable companion claim and,accordingly,can not establish a valid claim.
the due process clause guarantees more than fair process the clause also provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.washington glucksberg,d.in glucksberg,the supreme court articulated the fundamental rights protected by the due process clause.id.at.included in the list was the right to direct the education and upbringing of one children.id.at.citing meyer nebraska,and pierce soc y of sisters of the holy names of jesus and mary.see also troxel granville,d plurality opinion t he due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care,custody,and control of their children.
parents rely on three supreme court cases to generally identify a parent constitutional right to direct a child education.see meyer nebraska.holding state law prohibiting foreign language instruction violated the power of parents to control the education of their own pierce,at.holding state compulsory education law requiring students to attend solely public schools unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control wisconsin yoder,d finding a compulsory education system,as applied to the amish,to violate the free exercise clause and the traditional interest of parents with respect to the religious upbringing of their children so long as they,in the words of pierce,prepare them for additional obligations.but the particular right asserted in this right to be free from all reporting requirements and discretionary state oversight of a child never been recognized.
although parents assert the fundamental nature of their general right,it is a limited one.we have noted t he supreme court has never been called upon to define the precise boundaries of a parent right to control a child upbringing and education.it is clear,however,that the right is neither absolute nor unqualified.ridgewood bd.of,cir.the case law in this area establishes that parents simply do not have a constitutional right to control each and every aspect of their children education and oust the state authority over that subject.swanson,at furthermore,
t he court has repeatedly stressed that while parents have a constitutional right to send their children to private schools and a constitutional right to select private schools that offer specialized instruction,they have no constitutional right to provide their children with private school education unfettered by reasonable government regulation.
runyon mccrary,d 
in addition to yoder,discussed infra,parents rely on meyer and pierce for foundational support.read together,the cases 
evince the principle that the state can not prevent parents from choosing a specific educational it be religious instruction at a private school or instruction in a foreign language.that is,the state does not have the power to standardize its children or foster a homogenous people by completely foreclosing the opportunity of individuals and groups to choose a different path of education.
brown,at see also runyon,at.stressing the limited scope of meyer and pierce.in the present case,parents are given the freedom to choose a different path of education only to the act requirements.the school districts do not have any role in selecting the program parents wish to follow.parents are unable to point to a single instance in which the school districts have limited or interfered with their religious teachings materials.
in her deposition,shari nelson acknowledged that her local school district never questioned or rejected her affidavits and did not interfere with her religious content choices.nelson noted she was never concerned that the local school district would reject her children portfolio if it contained work product with a religious subject matter.similarly,maryalice newborn acknowledged that her local school district never questioned the appropriateness of her home education program or its content.
parents nevertheless contend that the commonwealth subjective and discretionary review over the act disclosures violates their right to control their children education.they insist any review of the home education programs must be purely objective.in other words,they contend the commonwealth usurps the religious and parental rights of parents when an official makes a limited determination of whether a child has sustained progress in the overall program.parents have not articulated their definition of objective in their brief.when questioned during oral argument,parents counsel was unable or unwilling to provide a concrete explanation or example of an objective review.furthermore,it is difficult to accept parents assertion that review of a child educational progress can truly be objective.the grading of an essay,even on a scale,will always be imbued with some element of subjectivity.
as noted,there is no recognized right for parents to educate their children unfettered by reasonable government regulation.runyon,at.the court in pierce expressly acknowledged the power of the state reasonably to regulate all schools,to inspect,supervise and examine them,their teachers and pupils.id.quoting pierce,at.see also meyer,at.noting t he power of the state to compel attendance at some school and to make reasonable regulations for all schools was not questioned by the parties furthermore,there is a distinction between actions that strike at the heart of parental authority on matters of the greatest importance and other actions that are not of constitutional dimension,at.parents identify the general right to control the education of one child.but parents do not have a constitutional right to avoid reasonable state regulation of their children education.act reporting and superintendent review requirements ensure children taught in home education programs demonstrate progress in the educational program.the statute does not interfere,or authorize any interference,with parents religious teachings use of religious materials.parents claim under the fourteenth amendment is of insufficient constitutional dimension to state either an independently viable or colorable claim.accordingly,under both the stringent and colorable approaches of our sister circuits,parents have not asserted a claim.
parents also contend that,notwithstanding the different standards articulated by the circuits regarding claims,they raise the same type of claim as the parents in yoder.they contend that since yoder is still good law,parents claiming a exemption to a neutral law of general applicability get the benefit of the traditional free exercise test.parents assert that it is beyond legitimate question that the same constitutional tests employed in yoder must be used here to evaluate these parents claims.parents br.at.
in yoder,the court granted a exception to a regulation of general applicability.john nowak ronald rotunda,constitutional law ed.yoder stands out as the one instance in which the court required the government to grant to persons who could not comply with the law due to their religious beliefs an exemption from a law regulating the conduct of all persons.but the unique burden suffered by the amish,combined with the supreme court limiting language,distinguish yoder from this case.
in response to objections by amish citizens,the yoder court held that the first amendment required a partial exemption from a wisconsin compulsory education law requiring children to attend public or private school until age.the amish refused to send their children,ages and,to school after completion of the eighth grade of schooling.the court noted the amish convincing showing 
the amish in this case have convincingly demonstrated the sincerity of their religious beliefs,the interrelationship of belief with their mode of life,the vital role that belief and daily conduct play in the continued survival of old order amish communities and their religious organization,and the hazards presented by the state enforcement of a statute generally valid as to others.
yoder,at.the court applied a heightened level of scrutiny and found the state interest lacking.id.at.
parents favor a broad reading of yoder and insist that it applies to all citizens.but yoder reach is restricted by the court limiting language and the facts suggesting an exceptional burden imposed on the plaintiffs.in yoder,the religious beliefs of the amish were completely integrated with their community and mode of life.yoder,at.as a result,compulsory attendance would substantially interfer e with the religious development of the amish child and his integration into the way of life of the amish faith community.id.at.accordingly,the wisconsin law carried a very real threat of undermining the amish community and religious practice,and placed the continued survival of amish communities in danger,id.at.compulsory attendance prevented these amish parents from making fundamental decisions regarding their children religious upbringing and effectively overrode their ability to pass their religion on to their children,as their faith required.parker,at citing yoder,at.
before applying a heightened level of scrutiny,the court wanted to ensure that the amish religious faith and their mode of life are,as they claim,inseparable and interdependent.yoder,at.recognizing the exceptional nature of the amish showing,the court held when the interests of parenthood are combined with a free exercise claim of the nature revealed by this record,more than merely a reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the state is required to sustain the validity of the state requirement under the first amendment.id.at.see also mozert hawkins county bd.of,cir yoder rested on such a singular set of facts that we do not believe it can be held to announce a general rule.
the united states court of appeals for the second circuit has interpreted the central underpinning of yoder to be the threat to the amish community way of life,posed by a compulsory school attendance statute.leebaert,at.in leebaert,a parent alleged a violation of the first and fourteenth amendments because a school refused to excuse his son from a mandatory health and education course.while not questioning the sincerity of the parent beliefs,the second circuit found the claims were not governed by yoder.see id.plaintiff did not allege that his community entire way of life is threatened plaintiff does not assert that there is an irreconcilable clash between the essence of plaintiff religious culture and the mandatory health curriculum that he challenges see also brown,at distinguishing yoder because a compulsory attendance at a health program did not threaten their entire way of life.
in the case new life baptist church academy east longmeadow,cir,a religious school asserted a remarkably similar claim to parents claim.the new life baptist church academy refused to comply with state rules and procedures for determining the adequacy of the secular education provided by the school because it believed it is a sin to submit its educational enterprise to a secular authority for approval.id.at.finding that the weight of legal precedent is strongly against the academy position,id.at,the united states court of appeals for the first circuit concluded that this case differs significantly from yoder,id.at it noted that the state procedures 
do not threaten interference with religious practices,prayer,or religious teaching and the record,while indicating a sincere religious scruple,does not suggest that enforcement of the state procedures would destroy a religious community way of life.nor does the record support the view that the academy,left on its own,would provide ideal or even adequate secular education.all these factors make this case quite unlike yoder.

similarly,the claim raised by the amish parents in yoder can be distinguished from the claim raised by parents here.act does not threaten parents or their community entire mode of life.even though parents are required to keep records and submit them for review,they are in complete control of the religious upbringing of their children.in fact,parents are unable to point to even one occasion in which the school districts have questioned their religious beliefs,texts,or teachings.
the dispute in yoder involved an additional one or two years of education at public schools versus vocational education at home.the amish allowed their children to attend public schools until eighth grade and sought only a partial exemption from the state compulsory school attendance law.furthermore,the court in yoder assumed the state would regulate the amish home education to ensure the satisfaction of educational standards.see yoder,at.the states have had a long history of amicable and effective relationships with schools,and there is no basis for assuming that,in this related context,reasonable standards can not be established concerning the content of the continuing vocational education of amish children under parental guidance.in contrast,parents request a full exemption from act,seeking to administer their children entire primary and secondary education without any review by the commonwealth.they cite yoder to challenge the government authority to engage in the regulation and discretionary review of their home education programs parents claim is distinguishable from the amish parents claim in yoder.
since act survives rational basis review and since parents have failed to establish that an exception to smith neutral law of general applicability rule applies,parents federal constitutional claims fail.

parents have made conflicting claims as to what conduct or review by the school districts constitutes a substantial burden.in their complaint,parents challenge all state review of their home education programs but deposition testimony reveals some variance by parents on the permissible level of state oversight nevertheless,in their district court briefs,parents again contended that placing of authority in any state agency violates their sincerely held religious beliefs and that it is a specific tenet of their religious faith that the state lacks the jurisdiction over education and the family that act asserts.parents br.opp to def.mot.summ.at,at oral argument,however,parents counsel again shifted the focus of their claims and appeared to concede that the objectionable portion of act was not the record keeping,testing,or third party evaluation,but the school districts independent,discretionary review of their children educational progress.but assuming a proper concession,this possible alteration of the claim was not made before the district court.
as noted,the construction and application of rfpa fourth definition of substantially burden is an issue of first impression.because this is a matter of pennsylvania law,we must predict how the pennsylvania supreme court,if faced with the identical issue,would construe the statute.prudential prop.cas.ins.pendleton,cir 
in construing the meaning of substantially burden,the district court relied on the plain language of the statute,the analysis of substantially burden in the context of free exercise clause and similar freedom of religion restoration acts,and the intent of the general assembly to restore the traditional free exercise of religion standards.combs,d at.as noted,parents contend the district court either ignored or misapplied the plain language of the statute and improperly included legislative history and decisions in its analysis.
parents rely exclusively upon the rfpa fourth definition of substantially burden an agency action which c ompels conduct or expression which violates a specific tenet of a person religious faith.stat.ann.parents contend they are compelled,under threat of truancy charges,to submit the portfolio of their children work product to the school districts for discretionary review.parents describe the act of turning over the portfolio for discretionary review as conduct or expression.they point to the exercise of editorial judgment and creativity on the part of the home education supervisor as evidence of this expression moreover,parents assert a specific tenet based upon certain religious beliefs.
first,parents maintain their faith teaches that education of their children,not merely the religious education,is religion.parents br.at.parents cite,inter alia,deuteronomy niv love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.these commandments that i give you today are to be upon your hearts.impress them on your children.talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road,when you lie down and when you get up,psalms niv one generation will commend your works to another they will tell of your mighty acts,ephesians niv fathers,do not exasperate your children instead,bring them up in the training and instruction of the lord,and proverbs train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old,he will not depart from it,for the proposition that god has directly called upon them to home educate their children.
second,parents contend god has assigned religious matters to the exclusive jurisdiction of the family,citing,inter alia,luke then render to caesar the things that are caesar,and to god the things that are god,psalms niv sons are a heritage from the lord,children a reward from him,matthew do give what is holy to unholy people,corinthians whatever you do,do it all for the glory of god,timothy be diligent to present yourself approved to god,thessalonians we are not trying to please men but god,who tests our hearts,and acts we must obey god rather than men.parents contend act replaces the headship of christ over the family,and their headship over their children,with the headship of the state over the family,citing,inter alia,corinthians niv now i want you to realize that the head of every man is christ,and the head of the woman is man,and the head of christ is god,ephesians niv for the husband is the head of the wife as christ is the head of the church,his body,of which he is the savior,and ephesians niv children,obey your parents in the lord,for this is right.as a result of this specific tenet,parents assert a sincerely held religious belief that the school districts have no authority to compel reporting or to engage in discretionary review of their home education program.
the term specific tenet is not defined in the religious freedom protection act or.the oxford english dictionary defines specific as precise or exact in respect of fulfilment,conditions,or terms definite,explicit and exactly named or indicated,or capable of being so precise,particular.oxford english dictionary compact ed see also dictionary ed defining specific as sharing or being those properties of something that allow it to be referred to a particular category or as free from ambiguity.tenet is defined as a doctrine,dogma,principle,or opinion,in religion,philosophy,politics or the like,held by a school,sect,party,or person.oxford english dictionary compact ed see also dictionary ed defining tenet as a principle,belief,or doctrine generally held to be true especially one held in common by members of an organization,group,movement,or profession.
in the religious context,the term specific tenet is difficult to define even though a religious concept may be stated generally,it may,in the believer mind,be a specific religious tenet.at one end of the spectrum,specificity may be relatively straightforward and easy to identify because the specific tenet is observed as an outward manifestation of a particular religious belief.for example,in fraternal order of police newark lodge newark,cir,two sunni muslim officers successfully challenged an internal order requiring all police officers to shave their beards.plaintiffs articulated a religious commandment to grow and wear a beard.id.at see also deveaux philadelphia.term,wl,at.july,granting a preliminary injunction preventing the city from suspending a practicing muslim firefighter without pay for refusing to shave his beard.in sherbert verner,d,a member of the adventist church challenged state unemployment compensation rules that conditioned the availability of benefits upon her willingness to work under conditions forbidden by her religion.the court acknowledged that the prohibition against saturday labor is a basic tenet of the adventist creed,based upon that religion interpretation of the holy bible.id.at.
furthermore,religious dietary laws would appear to qualify as specific tenets.in williams bitner,cir,a muslim inmate assigned to kitchen duty was disciplined for refusing to aid others in the consumption of pork.citing the koran he has forbidden you the flesh of swine and chapter eleven of leviticus in the old testament,williams averred that handling and serving pork would violate his religious faith.id.at.our court held that prison officials must respect and accommodate,when practicable,a muslim inmate religious beliefs regarding prohibitions on the handling of pork and affirmed the denial of qualified immunity.id.at.see also dehart horn,cir discussing a buddhist prisoner religious land use and institutionalized persons act claim based upon his request for a special diet.
at the other end of the spectrum are claims similar to parents.these claims cite more general and less obviously manifested concepts.this is not to undervalue these tenets which,as revelations,may be fundamental to one religious beliefs.in these situations,however,it may be difficult to determine whether a litigant citations to scripture or to general religious concepts articulate a specific tenet.also problematic in this analysis are religious tenets that may be viewed as both general and specific.see,exodus thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain,for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.exodus honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee.
furthermore,the rfpa definition of substantially burden appears to create some tension between state and federal law.the united states supreme court has cautioned against making religious interpretations in the first amendment context.see,smith,at.repeatedly and in many different contexts,we have warned that courts must not presume to determine the place of a particular belief in a religion or the plausibility of a religious claim.id.at.it is no more appropriate for judges to determine the centrality of religious beliefs before applying a compelling interest test in the free exercise field,than it would be for them to determine the importance of ideas before applying the compelling interest test in the free speech field.thomas review bd.of the indiana employment sec,d courts should not undertake to dissect religious beliefs because the believer beliefs are not articulated with the clarity and precision that a more sophisticated person might employ.id.at.courts are not arbiters of scriptural interpretation.additionally,the religious land use and institutionalized persons act rluipa,to,does not permit a court to determine whether the belief or practice in question is compelled by,or central to,a system of religious belief.washington klem,cir quoting a.
nevertheless,the pennsylvania general assembly statutory definition of substantially burden appears to require courts to inquire into,inter alia,whether an activity is fundamental to a person religion or whether a person is compelled to violate a specific tenet of their religious faith.see.stat.ann.defining substantially burden as an agency action which d enies a person a reasonable opportunity to engage in activities which are fundamental to the person religion or c ompels conduct or expression which violates a specific tenet of a person religious faith.arguably,a violation of a general tenet might substantially burden one religious faith.but that was not what the pennsylvania general assembly proscribed.the statutory language shifts the burden of establishing a compelling interest and least restrictive means to the state actor only after the violation of a specific tenet,which must mean something different from a general tenet.as noted,the dilemma is especially striking because,in the view of the believer,the violation of a general tenet may very well substantially burden one religious faith.
nevertheless,given the normal usage of the term,it is difficult to see that parents have cited a specific tenet that would prohibit reporting requirements and discretionary school district review of their children educational progress.instead,they reference general,but nonetheless important,religious tenets,see,luke then render to caesar the things that are caesar,and to god the things that are god.timothy be diligent to present yourself approved to god,to assert that local school districts have no authority to conduct a limited review of their children educational progress.in addition,under rfpa fourth definition of substantially burden,a party must establish a nexus between the specific tenet and the compelled violation,a nexus that parents have not established here.
furthermore,the inconsistencies in parents complaints,depositions,briefs and appellate oral argument suggest the difficulty in identifying a specific tenet as opposed to a general tenet and its attendant consequences.in their complaints,briefs to the district court,and some deposition testimony,parents asserted a specific tenet that the state lacks the jurisdiction over their children education,that no level of state review would be permissible see parents br.opp to def.mot.summ.at.but at oral argument,parents implied that their asserted tenet might allow review of their home education programs.see also parents reply br.at parents do not contend that the government may not establish any standards to govern home education.rather,the parents core objection is that their religious beliefs forbid them from submitting their religious education of their children to the discretionary review of a governmental official.yet it is problematic whether this interpretation of review would amount to any review at all.
based upon the plain language of the rfpa,parents have failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that they have been compelled or will likely be compelled to violate a specific tenet of their religious faith.accordingly,parents can not sustain their cause of action under the pennsylvania rfpa.
even finding the term specific tenet in the rfpa to be ambiguous,the decision would be the same.as noted,the purpose of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the general assembly.a.under section c,when a statute words are ambiguous,the intention of the general assembly may be ascertained by considering an array of factors 
the historical background and legislative history of pennsylvania rfpa places it in context and assists in interpreting the statute.much of this depends on the development of federal first amendment jurisprudence and its influence on pennsylvania law.prior to,legislation and government regulation burdening the free exercise of religion was subject to the sherbert test.see sherbert verner,d.under this rule,if the government substantially burdened a person constitutional free exercise rights,then it was required to justify the burden with a compelling state interest and with proof that the least restrictive means was employed.id.at.see also jimmy swaggart ministries bd.of equalization of,d our cases have established that the free exercise inquiry asks whether government has placed a substantial burden on the observation of a central religious belief or practice and,if so,whether a compelling governmental interest justifies the burden.quoting hernandez comm r,d.
in,the supreme court held that the free exercise clause did not prohibit enforcement of a neutral law of general applicability supported by a rational basis.employment,of human res.of oregon smith,d.the court concluded that the state could deny unemployment benefits due to misconduct based upon an employee religiously motivated ingestion and use of a drug specifically,in that case,the ceremonial use of peyote.id.declining to apply the sherbert balancing test,the court noted that the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religion prescribes or proscribes.id.at.quoting united states lee,d.thus,smith and its progeny establish the general proposition that a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice.church of the lukumi babalu aye,hialeah,d citing smith.
the smith court noted that religious exemptions,while not constitutionally required,could be created through the political process.smith,at.citing several state statutes making an exception to their drug laws for sacramental peyote use.in,congress accepted the court invitation by enacting the religious freedom restoration act rfra,stat,to amended.congress sought to restore the compelling interest test articulated in sherbert and wisconsin yoder,d,and to guarantee its application in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened.applicable to all federal and state law,stat,rfra prohibited both the federal and state governments from substantially burden ing a person exercise of religion except through the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling interest.in,the supreme court struck down rfra as applied to the states because rfra exceeded the scope of congress enforcement power under section of the fourteenth amendment.boerne flores,d.rfra lacked a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.id.at.
in part a reaction to city of boerne,congress enacted the religious land use and institutionalized persons act,to,which addresses only land use regulations and the religious rights of institutionalized persons.id.rluipa prohibits both state and federal governments from imposing a substantial burden on the religious exercise of an institutionalized person unless it is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.also,several states in addition to pennsylvania passed their own religious freedom restoration or protection legislation 
although there are differences among the various federal and state religious protection statutes,most contain,at their core,the same fundamental structure and purpose.they recognize that neutral laws of general applicability may burden religious exercise as significantly as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise.the federal statutes,pennsylvania rfpa,and a majority of the state statutes also acknowledge the government need not justify every action having some effect on religious exercise.under those statutes,only substantial burdens trigger heightened scrutiny rfpa four definitions of substantially burden emphasize the importance of this threshold.see.stat.ann.significantly constrains or inhibits significantly curtails denies a reasonable opportunity to engage in activities fundamental to the person religion violates a specific tenet of a person religious faith.emphasis added.
in our modern regulatory state,virtually all legislation including neutral laws of general applicability imposes an incidental burden at some level by placing indirect costs on an individual activity.recognizing this,legislatures have sought a balance between protecting free exercise of religion and preserving an effective police power.the federal government,pennsylvania,and several other states have identified a substantiality threshold as the tipping point for requiring heightened justifications for governmental action furthermore,by requiring proof of a substantial burden by clear and convincing evidence,pennsylvania appears to have set a higher threshold than other religious restoration statutes.compare.stat.ann,requiring clear and convincing evidence of substantial burden,with b plaintiff shall bear the burden of persuasion on whether the law including a regulation or government practice substantially burdens the plaintiff exercise of religion,warner,so d at t he plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing that a regulation constitutes a substantial burden,diggs snyder,d,requiring,under the illinois religious freedom restoration act,plaintiff to make a threshold showing of substantial burden.
as noted,parents have not cited a specific tenet that would prevent adherence to the reporting requirements or prohibit discretionary school district review of their children educational progress.instead,they reference general,but important,religious tenets to support their claim that local school districts have no authority to conduct limited review of their home education programs.such a broad interpretation of the term specific tenet would appear to read specific out of the statute.
the occasion,necessity,and purpose of the rfpa do not support a finding,by clear and convincing evidence,that parents are compelled or will likely be compelled to violate a specific tenet of their religious faith.accordingly,parents can not prevail on their cause of action under the pennsylvania rfpa.

justice souter,concurring in hialeah,also criticized the theory t he distinction smith draws strikes me as ultimately untenable.if a hybrid claim is simply one in which another constitutional right is implicated,then the hybrid exception would probably be so vast as to swallow the smith rule,and,indeed,the hybrid exception would cover the situation exemplified by smith,since free speech and associational rights are certainly implicated in the peyote ritual.but if a hybrid claim is one in which a litigant would actually obtain an exemption from a formally neutral,generally applicable law under another constitutional provision,then there would have been no reason for the court in what smith calls the hybrid cases to have mentioned the free exercise clause at,at.souter,concurring.
in parker hurley,cir,the united states court of appeals for the first circuit rejected plaintiff parents claims that they must be given prior notice by a public school and an opportunity to exempt their young children from reading books the parents find religiously repugnant.in discussing claims,the court stated that the strength of the companion constitutional claim required to establish a hybrid situation remains unsettled in the first circuit because the brown opinion did not explicitly decide the issue.id.at.it also noted that the parental rights claim asserted in that case was found to be so weak that it was not a colorable claim,much less an independently viable one.id.the parker court chose not to enter the fray over the meaning and application of smith hybrid situations language,and instead approach ed the parents claims as the court did in yoder.in that case,the court did not analyze separately the due process and free exercise interests of the,but rather considered the two claims interdependently,given that those two sets of interests inform one other.id.at.the court ultimately found that plaintiffs did not describe a constitutional burden on their rights and affirmed the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim.id.at.
