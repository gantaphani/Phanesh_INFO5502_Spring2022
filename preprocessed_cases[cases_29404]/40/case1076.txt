this appeal arises out of the district court dismissal of a putative class action brought by stacie byers and deborah seltzer against intuit,h r block digital tax solutions llc,free file alliance,llc,and the internal revenue service.we will affirm.
in,congress passed the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act,title ii,stat.rra.the rra states,in pertinent part,that i t is the policy of congress that paperless filing should be the preferred and most convenient means of filing federal tax and information returns,and consequently that it should be the goal of the internal revenue service to have at least percent of all such returns filed electronically by the year.id.at a.
rather than ordering the irs to develop its own internal electronic filing system in order to achieve this goal,congress mandated that the irs should cooperate with and encourage the private sector by encouraging competition to increase electronic filing of such returns,and to establish a plan to eliminate barriers,provide incentives,and use competitive market forces to increase electronic filing gradually over the next years id.at b.
in response,the irs initiated the free file program,pursuant to which it entered into an agreement in october agreement with free file alliance,llc ffa,a consortium of companies in the electronic tax preparation and filing industry.the agreement provided that the individual companies comprising ffa would offer free electronic filing services to at least of taxpayers,but it did not set an upper limit as to the percentage of taxpayers who could be offered free services.
the agreement expired after three years,and in the irs and ffa entered into a new agreement agreement wherein they agreed to extend the provisions of the initial agreement,subject to certain amendments.for example,in contrast to the agreement,the agreement limited the percentage of taxpayers eligible to receive free services from ffa to the of taxpaying population with the lowest adjusted gross income.in addition,the agreement imposed a cap on the amount of free services available from any individual ffa member at of all taxpayers.these provisions referred to hereinafter as the ceiling provisions were inserted by the irs in order to ensure the continuing vitality of the free file program,which the irs feared might otherwise cause many vendors to go out of business,thereby frustrating the program ultimate goals.see transcript of oral argument at,byers intuit,cir.
in november,stacie byers initiated a putative class action on behalf of taxpayers against ffa and its members collectively referred to hereinafter as the ffa members,alleging that in charging fees in exchange for providing services,the ffa members violated the independent offices appropriations act,ioaa byers subsequently filed a first amended complaint that added named plaintiff deborah seltzer,added the irs as a defendant with respect to the ioaa claim,and added a claim under section of the sherman antitrust act,against the ffa members,alleging that the agreement constituted an illegal horizontal agreement amongst the ffa members to restrict output,which had the effect of causing plaintiffs and the members of the proposed class to pay supracompetitive prices for and related services.
on may,the district court issued a memorandum and order dismissing the ioaa claim with prejudice pursuant to.b and dismissing the sherman act claim with leave to amend.with respect to the ioaa claim,the district court held that the ioaa does not apply to the ffa members,since it only applies to a government agency or a private entity tasked with performing an agency statutory duty and the ioaa does not provide a private right of action 
with respect to the sherman act claim,the district court held that although the ceiling provisions of the agreement do have the effect of restricting competition between the ffa members in violation of the sherman act,the ffa members are entitled to implied antitrust immunity and are therefore shielded from antitrust liability,since their anticompetitive behavior was required by the irs pursuant to the agreement.
in so holding,however,the district court noted that it may be possible for to allege facts triggering the exception to implied antitrust immunity articulated by the supreme court in otter tail power united states,and thereby reinstate the viability of byers sherman act claim against the ffa members.as such,the district court dismissed byers sherman act claim with leave to amend.
byers filed a second amended complaint,which contained all of the allegations present in her first amended complaint as well as several paragraphs intended to invoke the otter tail exception mentioned by the district court.nevertheless,on march,the district court issued an order dismissing byers sherman act claim with prejudice pursuant to rule b,holding that byers had failed to assert sufficient allegations to invoke the otter tail exception,and therefore that her sherman act claim fails due to the implied antitrust immunity shielding the ffa members.on the following day,march,the district court issued an order dismissing byers ioaa claim against the irs for the same reasons that it dismissed her ioaa claim against the ffa members.
byers timely appealed the district court dismissal of her ioaa claims against the ffa members and the irs,as well as the district court dismissal of her sherman act claim against the ffa members 
our standard of review of the district court dismissal under rule b is plenary,cir.we accept all factual allegations as true,construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,and determine whether,under any reasonable reading of the complaint,the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.grammar john kane reg l hazel,cir.in addition,
while a complaint attacked by a rule b motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations,a plaintiff obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.

ioaa claim 
ioaa claim against ffa members 
the district court dismissed byers ioaa claim against the ffa members on two independent grounds,holding that the ioaa does not apply to the ffa members and there is no express or implied private right of action under the ioaa because the district court was correct in holding that the ioaa does not apply to the ffa members,we will affirm its dismissal of the ioaa claim on that ground,and need not reach the issue of whether a private right of action exists under the ioaa.
the ioaa provides,in pertinent part,that t he head of each agency may prescribe regulations establishing the charge for a service or thing of value provided by the agency.b emphasis added.from the plain language of the statute,it is evident that the ioaa applies only to entities that are considered to be an agency under the statute.in title of the united states code,the term agency is defined as a department,agency,or instrumentality of the united states government.the ffa members,who are wholly private entities,clearly do not fit within this definition,and thus the ioaa is facially inapposite.
however,byers argues that the ioaa reach extends not only to services provided directly by a government agency,but also to private entities who provide services on behalf of a government agency pursuant to an agreement with that agency.accordingly,byers asserts that since the ffa members provided services pursuant to agreements with the is clearly an agency for ioaa ioaa therefore applies to the fees that the ffa members charged for services provided to taxpayers.
in support of her position,byers relies primarily on thomas network solutions.in thomas,the circuit held that while the ioaa traditionally applies only to services provided directly by government agencies,g overnment agencies can not escape responsibility for failing to perform their statutory duties by hiring private parties to perform those duties,and thus,under certain circumstances,the ioaa reach may be extended to encompass private entities as well.id.at.under thomas,the ioaa applies to a private entity providing services pursuant to an agreement with a government agency,but only if the services provided by the private entity are services that the agency is statutorily required to provide the agency effectively controlled the private entity provision of the services at issue or the services provided by the private entity are quintessential government service s.id.at.
exception services provided by the private entity are services that the agency is statutorily required to provide 
byers argues that since the ffa members were tasked with performing the irs statutory duty,this case falls under thomas exception,and the ioaa therefore applies.we can not accept byers argument since she erroneously conflates the statutory duty delegated to the,collecting and processing tax the services provided by the ffa,preparing and filing the returns.
and make clear that the filing of tax returns is the sole responsibility of the private individual or entity who is making the filing.moreover,while f provides that t he secretary is authorized to promote the benefits of and encourage the use of electronic tax administration programs,nowhere does it state that the irs is obligated to assist taxpayers with the or their tax returns.rather,the text merely provides that a return shall be made to the secretary id.at b a emphasis added.the by extension,the no statutory duty with respect to the preparation or filing of tax returns.rather,the irs obligations begin only after the tax return is actually return ed to the secretary,which triggers the irs statutory mandate to review the return and assess the proper taxes as dictated by the internal revenue code.id.at.
the ffa members,in offering services to the public,do not perform any of the tasks statutorily assigned to the irs,but rather serve the very same functions as accountants who aid with preparation of returns and delivery services such as federal express which aid with the filing of returns.as such,byers has failed to state a viable ioaa claim under thomas exception.
exception the agency effectively controlled the private entity provision of the services at issue 
with respect to thomas exception,byers can not sustain an argument that the irs effectively controlled the conduct of the ffa members,since byers herself acknowledges that despite the ffa members agreement with the irs,they were free to charge whatever they saw fit for their services.see brief for appellants at.moreover,the plain language of the record indicates that the relationship between the irs and the ffa members was cooperative and bilateral in nature,with neither party exercising effective control over the other 
exception the services provided by the private entity are quintessential government services 
nor does thomas exception support byers argument.the services offered by the ffa,the preparation and filing of tax activities that have always been the province of the private sector.indeed,rather than providing a quintessential government service,the ffa members in fact provide a quintessentially service.accord h,t he irs stated that it did not intend to enter into the tax preparation software business instead it intended to work in partnership with private industry to expand the electronic filing of tax returns the committee strongly believes in the private partnership concept.
since the ioaa is facially inapplicable to the ffa members,and none of the thomas exceptions apply,the district court was correct in dismissing byers ioaa claim against the ffa members pursuant to rule b on the ground that the ioaa does not apply to those entities 
ioaa claim against irs 
byers ioaa claim against the irs is identical to byers claim asserted against the ffa members.since,as we note above,the services at issue in this case are quintessentially services,and the irs is a quintessential government agency,the ioaa does not apply to this claim.see supra ii a.moreover,neither are the thomas exceptions,discussed in that section,applicable.the irs did not exercise or the provision of those services,and accordingly,the ioaa claim against the irs fails as a matter of law.the district court did not err in dismissing the ioaa claim against the irs pursuant to.b.
sherman act claim 
the district court dismissed byers sherman act claim against the ffa members pursuant to rule b on the ground that byers failed to assert sufficient allegations to establish that the ffa members are not shielded from her sherman act claims under the doctrine of implied antitrust immunity.byers argues that the district court erred in holding that the ffa members are entitled to implied antitrust immunity,and holding that byers had failed to assert sufficient allegations in her second amended complaint to invoke the otter tail exception.
implied antitrust immunity 
byers submits that implied antitrust immunity is accorded to private parties only when the private parties are acting at the direction of a government agency and providing a government service.br.for appellants at.thus,argues byers,if the district court were indeed correct in holding that the ioaa does not apply to the ffa members pursuant to thomas because they were not providing a quintessential government service,it must necessarily follow that the ffa members are not entitled to implied antitrust immunity.in essence,byers complains that the ffa members can not have their cake and eat it too if they lose on the ioaa issue,they must win on the antitrust immunity therefore can not emerge victorious on both counts.
byers logic,however,is fatally flawed in that she fails to cite any authority for the proposition that implied antitrust immunity is available to private entities only when the service being provided is governmental in nature.indeed,as the ffa members note,t he cases in this area demonstrate that in order to trigger implied antitrust immunity,the specific nature of a private entity conduct need not be the provision of a governmental function,provided the conduct is directed by a federal agency,pursuant to a defined government program or policy.joint opening brief of appellees intuit,h r block tax digital solutions,and free file alliance llc at,br.of ffa members second and third emphases added such immunity is provided to a private party acting pursuant to an agreement with a government agency when the government agency is acting pursuant to a clearly defined policy or program and the private party is acting at the direction or consent of the government agency.whether the particular activity in question is of a private or governmental nature is immaterial to the analysis.
it is clear that the irs was statutorily authorized to enter into the and agreements pursuant to the rra.see rra a mandating that the irs should cooperate with and encourage the private sector to increase.in addition,the ceiling provisions in the agreement expressly directed the ffa members to restrict the availability of free services under the free file program 
since both prongs and of the standard set forth above are satisfied,we conclude that the ffa members are entitled to implied antitrust immunity with respect to the action taken pursuant to the ceiling provisions of the agreement.
otter tail exception 
the supreme court in otter tail power united states,established an exception to the doctrine of implied antitrust immunity.otter tail held that even when the circumstances otherwise dictated that a private entity was entitled to implied antitrust immunity,such protection would not be accorded if the private entity had insisted on restrictions in its contract with a government agency and those restrictions hindered the government.see at.
since,as we hold,see supra ii b,the ffa members are otherwise entitled to antitrust immunity,for byers sherman act claim against the ffa members to survive,she must show that the ffa members insisted upon the ceiling provisions present in the agreement and that these restrictions hindered the goals of the irs free file program.
