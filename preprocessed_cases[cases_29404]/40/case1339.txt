the government appeals the district court grant of william danielczyk,and eugene biagi the appellees motion to dismiss count four and paragraph b of the indictment,alleging that they conspired to and did facilitate direct contributions to hillary clinton presidential campaign in violation of a of the federal election campaign act of feca,and the district court reasoned that in light of citizens united federal election commission,a is unconstitutional as applied to the appellees.we disagree for the following reasons and thus reverse the district court grant of the motion to dismiss count four and paragraph b of the indictment.
danielczyk and biagi were officers of galen capital group,llc,and galen capital corporation together,galen.at the time of the charged conduct,danielczyk was galen chairman,while biagi was galen secretary.in march of,danielczyk a fundraiser for clinton campaign and had individuals,including biagi,give donations to the campaign with the promise that they would be reimbursed by galen.danielczyk and biagi concealed galen reimbursements by writing consulting fees on the reimbursement checks memorandum lines,by issuing the checks for amounts larger than the actual contributions,and by creating false letters to the individual donors that characterized the reimbursement payments as consulting fees.in total,danielczyk and biagi reimbursed the donors for in contributions made to clinton campaign,and the campaign in turn reported the contributions to the federal election commission.
danielczyk and biagi were indicted on seven counts for this contribution scheme.count four and paragraph b respectively charged the appellees with knowingly and willfully causing contributions of corporate money to a candidate for federal office,aggregating or more,in violation of a and d a i,and conspiring to do so.on april,danielczyk and biagi moved to dismiss count four,contending that a is unconstitutional as applied to them in light of citizens united.
prior to the supreme court decision in citizens united,a made it unlawful for corporations to make both direct contributions to political candidates and independent expenditures on speech that expressly advocates for or against the election or defeat of a candidate.however,the feca permitted individuals to make independent expenditures and direct contributions within limits.see,a a.the act also allowed corporations wanting to make either type of expenditure to form political action committees pacs,which were entities separate from the corporations subject to regulatory requirements.see b c a iii,b,and d.citizens united struck down a prohibition against corporate independent expenditures,reasoning in part that the ban was not supported by the interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption.at,and further that the first amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker corporate identity,id.at.citizens united left untouched a ban on direct corporate contributions.
relying on citizens united,the district court held that a ban on direct corporate contributions as applied to galen is unconstitutional because it impermissibly treats corporations and individuals unequally for purposes of political speech.the district court rejected the government contention that the differential treatment of corporations in the context of direct contributions fulfills legitimate governmental interests,such as the prevention of quid pro quo corruption.it concluded that the interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption could be fulfilled by requiring corporations to comply with the act contribution limits for individual donors.
five days after it granted the motion to dismiss,the district court sua sponte ordered the parties to file briefs on whether,in light of agostini felton,and federal election commission beaumont,the court should reconsider its decision.in beaumont,the supreme court rejected an challenge to a ban on direct corporate contributions.at.the government argued that beaumont directly controlled the case and must be applied even if citizens united may have eroded beaumont reasoning.this is because the agostini principle requires lower courts to apply supreme court precedent that directly controls the case before it despite subsequent supreme court case law that may have affected the precedent by implication.at.
after considering the briefs,the district court denied reconsideration of its dismissal.it reasoned that beaumont did not directly control the case because it addressed an challenge of a ban on direct corporate contributions against a nonprofit corporation and not,as in this case,a corporation like galen.the district court further affirmed the rationale in its earlier ruling that a violated citizens united by treating corporations and individuals unequally.accordingly,it concluded that count four and paragraph b remained dismissed.the government timely appealed.
for the following reasons,we hold that a is not unconstitutional as applied to the appellees.beaumont clearly supports the constitutionality of a and citizens united,a case that addresses corporate independent expenditures,does not undermine beaumont reasoning on this point.the district court erred when it granted the appellees motion to dismiss.
the agostini principle provides that in circumstances when supreme court precedent has direct application in a case,yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions,courts should follow the line of cases which directly controls,leaving to the supreme court the prerogative of overturning its own decisions.agostini felton,quoting rodriguez de quijas.express.thus,lower courts should not conclude that the supreme court more recent cases have,by implication,overruled its earlier precedent.id.
in beaumont,the supreme court addressed a first amendment challenge to a as it applied to nonprofit advocacy corporations.federal election commission beaumont.in that case,north carolina right to life,ncrl,a nonprofit corporation organized to provide counseling to pregnant women and to promote alternatives to abortion,brought an challenge to a ban on direct corporate contributions and independent expenditures.id.at.a panel of this circuit found the ban on both independent expenditures and direct contributions unconstitutional as applied to ncrl.beaumont fec,cir,rev by beaumont.
with respect to direct contributions,the panel reasoned that the ban was unjustified in light of federal election commission massachusetts citizens for life,mcfl,a decision in which the supreme court held that a ban on independent expenditures was unconstitutional as applied to a nonprofit corporation that,in many respects,was similar to ncrl.id.at.as a result,the panel extended mcfl holding that solely addressed a ban on independent expenditures to the context of the provision ban on direct contributions,concluding that i n neither case is there the threat of quid pro quo,monetary influence,or distortion corruption that the prohibitions seek to prevent.id.after this circuit denied a rehearing en banc,the federal election commission petitioned the supreme court for certiorari only on the issue of whether the ban on direct contributions was constitutional.beaumont,at.
in a decision,the supreme court reversed this circuit opinion.at.in doing so,the supreme court thoroughly explained its longstanding jurisprudence upholding congress original,core prohibition on direct corporate contributions and warned that this jurisprudence would discourage any broadside attack on corporate campaign finance regulation of corporate contributions.id.at.it remarked that it had previously held that a had broad applicability to both corporations and labor unions regardless of their financial disposition and rejected ncrl various arguments to limit this applicability,including that the ban did not adequately consider the variations between corporations with respect to affluence and diversity of corporate form.id.at.it then recognized four government interests that supported the ban on direct corporate contributions anticorruption,and preventing the evasion of valid individual contribution limits.id.at.the supreme court
