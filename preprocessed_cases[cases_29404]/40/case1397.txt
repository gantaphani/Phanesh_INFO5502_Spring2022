the underlying claims at issue in these appeals,asserted pursuant to and state law,arise out of the fatal shooting of an arrestee by a fairfax county,virginia,police officer.defendant deval bullock,the officer who fired the fatal shot,noted an interlocutory appeal in from the district court denial of summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity.see mitchell forsyth,d.thereafter,pursuant to an order entered under.b,plaintiffs salvatore and anita culosi,individually and as personal representatives of the estate of the decedent,filed a in from the district court earlier order granting a.b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted filed by defendants fairfax county,police chief david rohrer,and james kellam.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the order of the district court denying qualified immunity to officer bullock is not immediately appealable because the district court merely determined that genuine disputes of material fact determination not subject to interlocutory appeal.see johnson jones,d.moreover,under the circumstances,we decline to exercise jurisdiction over the plaintiffs pursuant to the rule b certification order entered by the district court.accordingly,we shall dismiss both appeals in their entirety.
in october,the fairfax county police department fcpd began an investigation of salvatore culosi,culosi,a local optometrist,for felony gambling offenses.detective david baucom baucom of the fcpd money laundering unit the mlu,acting in an undercover capacity,had begun to place sports bets with culosi at a sports bar,betting approximately over the course of several months.in january,baucom and other members of the mlu decided to arrest culosi and to execute a search warrant at culosi residence for evidence of his illegal gambling activities.
the fcpd tactical section the swat team customarily executed search warrants for the mlu but it was not ordinarily involved in effecting routine warrantless felony arrests,as was planned of culosi.in any event,baucom contacted the swat team supervisor,defendant lieutenant james kellam kellam,and requested assistance in the execution of the search warrant for culosi home.in the month before the scheduled raid,kellam swat team conducted surveillance of culosi residence and neighborhood.kellam determined from the surveillance that there were no indications of red flags signifying any special dangers in the proposed operation.in due course,the officers decided to execute the search warrant at culosi home on the evening of january.under the plan the officers put in place,baucom would lure culosi from his residence to collect that culosi owed baucom from bets on football games,and the swat team would assist in effecting culosi arrest and conduct the search of the residence.
on the morning of january,members of the swat team,including officer bullock,were involved in supervising an early morning deer hunt,beginning at and ending later that afternoon.most of the members then went home and gathered later in the evening to review the procedures for the arrest of culosi and the search of his residence.kellam assigned sergeant sean scott scott to supervise the arrest aspect.
scott decided to use a dynamic tactical method known as a vehicle takedown for culosi arrest.critical to this method is the sudden appearance of officers,at least one of whom would point his firearm directly at the arrestee in order to control him.other officers would then go hands on,take physical custody of the arrestee and place him in handcuffs.specifically,the plan here called for baucom,while wired for audio monitoring by members of the swat team,to drive to culosi residence,wait in his vehicle for culosi to leave his house and approach the vehicle,and then give a verbal arrest signal once culosi handed over the gambling payoff.when the arrest signal was given,scott,accompanied by officer bullock,would drive a van from around the corner.officer bullock would then exit from the van front passenger side,announce police,do move from a gun ready position,and take culosi into custody.
scott later modified the plan whereby officer bullock would merely control culosi by use of his firearm while officers from a second vehicle would approach to go hands on with culosi.before the plan was executed,during or after the briefing,scott received a phone call requiring him to withdraw.kellam assumed scott role in executing culosi arrest.officer lee northrop was substituted as the driver of officer bullock vehicle.
at approximately,baucom called culosi and arranged to meet outside of culosi residence,a townhouse condominium.half an hour later,culosi left his house in stockinged feet and met baucom,who was sitting in his car outside the garage.culosi approached the car on the passenger side through his garage and began a conversation about the upcoming superbowl,while handing baucom.the parties dispute whether culosi was holding a cell phone in his hand during the encounter,although his cell phone was recovered close to his body after the shooting.baucom soon gave the verbal arrest signal.
at the signal,officer northrop rapidly approached baucom vehicle and pulled up immediately behind it.at that time,culosi was still standing next to the door of baucom vehicle.when officer northrop vehicle came to rest,officer bullock exited from the front passenger door using his left hand to open the door while simultaneously unholstering his weapon with his right hand and announcing police.officer bullock intended to assume a,a gun ready position.as he executed this maneuver,his weapon discharged a single round,striking culosi in the heart.culosi received emergency treatment at the scene but died of his wound at the hospital shortly after the incident.
officer bullock has insisted consistently that the discharge of his weapon was accidental,although he has varied somewhat his explanations as to the precise character and happening of the accident.in any event,it is undisputed that the firearm discharged as a direct result of officer bullock squeezing the trigger of his caliber pistol the weapon did not fire as a result of a malfunction.
plaintiffs filed this action on march.by their amended complaint,they sought damages in eight counts as follows count,claim against fairfax county and chief rohrer,based on an alleged custom or policy regarding the use of excessive force count,fourth amendment excessive force claim against officer bullock count,fourth amendment excessive force claim against kellam count,due process claim,denial of access to courts,against fairfax county and chief rohrer count,state law claim against bullock assault count,state law claim against bullock battery count,state law claim against bullock gross negligence and count,state law claim against kellam gross negligence.
by order entered on october,as modified by an order entered on august,the district court dismissed with prejudice counts,and,of the amended complaint,and without prejudice count,and thereby dismissed all claims against all defendants except officer bullock,who fired the fatal shot.after the completion of discovery,officer bullock moved for summary judgment,invoking qualified immunity as to the excessive force claim,and con tending that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the remaining state law claims.after holding a hearing,the district court entered an order on december,reciting that for the reasons stated in open court,officer bullock motion for summary judgment was denied.
thereafter,the plaintiffs moved the district court to certify the earlier dismissal of the claims against defendants other than officer bullock as a final appealable judgment pursuant to.b.defendants did not oppose that motion and the court entered a certification order on january.officer bullock and the plaintiffs filed timely notices of appeal on january,and january,respectively.
we examine first the interlocutory appeal brought by officer bullock.on appeal,the parties agree and the district court clearly recognized that the viability of the plaintiffs fourth amendment excessive force claim generally,and application of the qualifie
