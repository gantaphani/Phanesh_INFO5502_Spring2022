the real truth about abortion,formerly known as the real truth about obama,a virginia corporation organized under of the internal revenue code to provide accurate and truthful information about the public policy positions of senator barack obama,commenced this action against the federal election commission and the department of justice,contending that it was chilled from posting information about obama because of the vagueness of a commission regulation and a commission policy relating to whether real truth has to make disclosures or is a political committee commonly referred to as a political action committee or pac.real truth asserts that it is not subject to regulation but fears the commission could take steps to regulate it because of the vagueness of b and the policy of the commission to determine whether an organization is a pac by applying the major purpose test on a basis,as published at.it alleges that the regulation and policy are unconstitutionally broad and vague,both facially and as applied to it,in violation of the first and fifth amendments.
on for summary judgment,the district court found both the regulation and the policy constitutional.and,applying the exacting scrutiny standard applicable to disclosure provisions,we affirm.
real truth was organized on july,as an organization under of the internal revenue code.in its irs filing,real truth stated that its purpose was to provide truthful information about the public positions taken by senator barack obama but that it would not expressly advocate the election or defeat of any political candidate or make any contribution to a candidate.
within a few days of its incorporation,real truth commenced this action challenging three of the commission regulations implementing the federal election campaign act feca b defining when a communication expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate a defining contributions for certain purposes under feca and regulating the use of corporate or union funds for electioneering communications.in addition,real truth challenged the commission policy of determining pac status by using a major purpose test on a basis.it asserted that these regulations and the policy were unconstitutional,facially and as applied,in that they were overbroad and vague,in violation of the first and fifth amendments to the constitution.
real truth challenge was mounted in the context of two radio advertisements it intended to air concerning obama positions on abortion.the first ad,entitled change,states 
woman voice just what is the real truth about democrat barack obama position on abortion 
actor voice mimicking obama voice change.here is how i would change america about abortion 
make taxpayers pay for all million abortions performed in america each year 
make sure that minor girls abortions are kept secret from their parents 
make abortion legal 
give planned parenthood lots more money to support abortion 
change current federal and state laws so that babies who survive abortions will die soon after they are born 
appoint more liberal justices on the supreme court 
one thing i would not change about america is abortion on demand,for any reason,at any time during pregnancy,as many times as a woman wants one.
woman voice.now you know the real truth about obama position on abortion.is this the change you can believe in 
the second ad,entitled survivor,reads 
nurse the abortion was supposed to kill him,but he was born alive.i could bear to follow hospital policy and leave him on a cold counter to die,so i held and rocked him for minutes until he took his last breath.
male voice as an illinois democrat state senator,barack obama voted three times to deny lifesaving medical treatment to living,breathing babies who survive abortions.for four years,obama has tried to his horrendous votes by saying the bills did have clarifying language he favored.obama has been lying.illinois documents from the very committee obama chaired show he voted against the bill that did contain the clarifying language he says he favors.
obama callousness in denying lifesaving treatment to tiny babies who survive abortions reveals a lack of character and compassion that should give everyone pause.
real truth alleged that it planned to spend over to air these advertisements during the day period immediately before the general election and that some of this money would be raised through the circulation of a fundraising letter soliciting contributions to get the word out regarding obama views on abortion.in its complaint,it expressed the fear that these expenditures might be construed as independent expenditures under and b,subjecting it to disclosure requirements and potentially making it a pac subject to further regulation.
real truth sought a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the challenged regulations and policy against its intended activities and against others similarly situated,and the district court denied real truth motion.on appeal,we affirmed the district court denial of the injunction,applying the preliminary injunction standard announced in winter natural resources defense council,d,and holding that real truth had not carried its burden of showing a likelihood of success,as well as showing the other requirements for a preliminary injunction.real truth about obama fed.election comm n,cir.real truth filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the supreme court.
while real truth petition for a writ of certiorari was pending,the supreme court decided citizens united federal election commission,d,striking down,on first amendment grounds,a provision of the bipartisan campaign reform act bcra banning corporations and labor unions from using their general treasury funds for electioneering communications.based on its decision,the court granted real truth petition for certiorari,vacated this court judgment,and remanded the case for further consideration.real truth about obama,fed.election comm n,d.
also in the interim,the circuit decided emily list federal election commission,which struck down certain aspects of,also the subject of real truth challenge in this court,leading the commission to announce that it would cease enforcement of that regulation.
on remand from the supreme court,we reissued the portions of our original decision stating the facts and articulating the standard for the issuance of preliminary injunctions and remanded the remaining issues to the district court for reconsideration in light of the supreme court decision in citizens united.real truth about obama,fed.election comm n,cir per curiam.
on remand,the parties agreed that real truth challenges to and had become moot.and on real truth remaining challenges,the district court granted summary judgment to the commission and the department of justice,holding that b and the commission policy for determining whether an organization was a pac were constitutional,both facially and as applied to real truth.more particularly,the court found that b was consistent with the test articulated in federal election commission wisconsin right to life,d,and that the commission was entitled to use a multifactor approach on a basis for determining pac status because ascertaining an organization single major purpose is an inherently comparative task and requires consideration of the full range of an organization activities.real truth about obama,fed.election comm n,d.
from the district court judgment,dated june,real truth filed this appeal.
at the outset,we address real truth contention that,in reviewing the commission regulation and policy,we should apply the strict scrutiny standard.real truth argues that the regulation and policy place onerous burdens on speech similar to the burdens to which the supreme court applied strict scrutiny in citizens united.at finding that,restricting the amount of money a corporation could independently spend on political communication,silenced entities whose voices the government deems to be suspect and therefore should be reviewed under the strict scrutiny standard.
the commission contends instead that because the challenged regulation and policy only implicate disclosure requirements and do not restrict either campaign activities or speech,we should apply the less stringent exacting scrutiny standard.under this standard,the government must demonstrate only a substantial relation between the disclosure requirement and sufficiently important government interest.citizens united.at internal quotation marks omitted.
regulation b,which real truth challenges as too broad and vague,implements the statutory definition of independent expenditure,which in turn determines whether a person must make disclosures as required by c.the definition could also contribute to the determination of whether real truth is a pac because it is an organization with expenditures of more than,which would impose not only disclosure requirements,but also organizational requirements.see fed.election comm n,en banc.similarly,the commission policy for applying the major purposes test to organizations,which real truth also challenges,would also determine whether real truth is a pac,again implicating disclosure and organizational requirements.
such disclosure and organizational requirements,however,are not as burdensome on speech as are limits imposed on campaign activities or limits imposed on contributions to and expenditures by campaigns.indeed,the supreme court has noted that disclosure requirements certainly in most applications appear to be the least restrictive means of curbing the evils of campaign ignorance and corruption that congress found to exist.buckley valeo,d see also fed.election comm massachusetts citizens for life,d.accordingly,an intermediate level of scrutiny known as exacting scrutiny is the appropriate standard to apply in reviewing provisions that impose disclosure requirements,such as the regulation and policy.see buckley,at.see also citizens united.at applying the exacting scrutiny standard in reviewing certain disclosure provisions of the bcra.
real truth reliance on the court application of strict scrutiny in citizens united is misplaced.in its brief,real truth repeatedly notes the citizens united majority reference to onerous burdens on pac speech,which would ordinarily be subject to strict scrutiny.while it is true that the court used the word onerous in describing certain obligations and restrictions,it did so in a context significantly different from the one facing real truth.the regulation invalidated in citizens united,required corporations to set up a separate pac with segregated funds before making any direct political speech.these corporate pacs were subject to several limitations on allowable contributions,including a prohibition on the acceptance of funds from the corporation itself.see a,b.the court accordingly held that the option to create a separate corporate pac did not alleviate the burden imposed by on the corporation own speech.in contrast,the pac disclosure requirements at issue here neither prevent real truth from speaking nor impose a ceiling on activities.buckley,at.indeed,the court distinguished its application of the strict scrutiny standard to expenditure restrictions from the exacting scrutiny standard applicable to disclosure requirement provisions,stating 
disclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the ability to speak,but they impose no ceiling on activities and do not prevent anyone from speaking.the court has subjected these requirements to exacting scrutiny,which requires a substantial relation between the disclosure requirement and a sufficiently important governmental interest.
citizens united.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in sum,we conclude that even after citizens united,it remains the law that provisions imposing disclosure obligations are reviewed under the intermediate scrutiny level of exacting scrutiny.see doe reed,d applying exacting scrutiny to disclosure law relating to ballot referenda,at applying exacting scrutiny to pac disclosure obligations under feca org.for marriage mckee,cir applying exacting scrutiny to pac disclosure obligations under state law.we will accordingly review the commission regulation b and its policy for determining the major purpose of an organization under the exacting scrutiny standard.
turning to the challenge of,real truth contends that the regulation second definition of expressly advocating,as contained in subsection b,is fatally broader and more vague than the restrictions imposed on the definition of expressly advocating by buckley,at,which are codified in subsection a.
regulation defines expressly advocating as the term is used in,which in turn defines independent expenditure as an expenditure by a person expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate and not made by or in coordination with a candidate or political party.emphasis added.subsection a defines expressly advocating in the manner stated by the supreme court in buckley and thus includes communications that use phrases which in context can have no other reasonable meaning than to urge the election or defeat of a candidate,a words such as vote for,elect,defeat,or reject,which are often referred to as the express advocacy magic words.see mcconnell fed.election comm n,d citing buckley,at.subsection b,on the other hand,defines expressly advocating more contextually,without using the magic words.this subsection,which is the subject of real truth challenge,provides in relevant part 
expressly advocating means any communication that 
b when taken as a whole and with limited reference to external events,such as the proximity to the election,could only be interpreted by a reasonable person as containing advocacy of the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate s because 
the electoral portion of the communication is unmistakable,unambiguous,and suggestive of only one meaning and 
reasonable minds could not differ as to whether it encourages actions to elect or defeat one or more clearly identified candidate s or encourages some other kind of action.
real truth first challenges b as facially overbroad.the commission approach of defining expressly advocating with the magic words of buckley in subsection a and with their functional equivalent in subsection b was upheld by the supreme court in considering a facial challenge to the bcra,which included a provision defining express advocacy for purposes of electioneering communications.see mcconnell,at,overruled in part by citizens united.in rejecting the challenge,the mcconnell court noted that buckley narrow construction of the feca to require express advocacy was a function of the vagueness of the original statutory definition of expenditure,not an absolute first amendment imperative.id.at.the court accordingly held that congress could permissibly regulate not only communications containing the magic words of buckley,but also communications that were the functional equivalent of express advocacy.id.at.
later,in federal election commission wisconsin right to life,d,the chief justice controlling opinion further elaborated on the meaning of mcconnell functional equivalent test.the chief justice held that where an ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,it could be regulated in the same manner as express advocacy.wisconsin right to life,at.the chief justice explicitly rejected the argument,raised by justice scalia concurring opinion,that the only permissible test for express advocacy is a magic words test 
justice scalia concludes that i f a permissible test short of the test existed,buckley would surely have adopted it.we are not so sure.the question in buckley was how a particular statutory provision could be construed to avoid vagueness concerns,not what the constitutional standard for clarity was in the abstract,divorced from specific statutory language.buckley intermediate step of statutory construction on the way to its constitutional holding does not dictate a constitutional test.the buckley court express advocacy restriction was an endpoint of statutory interpretation,not a first principle of constitutional law.
id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
contrary to real truth assertions,citizens united also supports the commission use of a functional equivalent test in defining express advocacy.in the course of striking down feca spending prohibitions on certain corporate election expenditures,the citizens united majority first considered whether those regulations applied to the communications at issue in the case.at.using wisconsin right to life functional equivalent test,the court concluded that one advertisement hillary the movie qualified as the functional equivalent of express advocacy because it was in essence a negative advertisement that urges viewers to vote against senator hillary clinton for president.citizens united.at.but more importantly for our decision,the court also upheld bcra disclosure requirements for all electioneering communications including those that are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy.id.at we reject citizens united contention that the disclosure requirements must be limited to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy in this portion of the opinion,joined by eight justices,the court explained that because disclosure is a less restrictive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of speech,mandatory disclosure requirements are constitutionally permissible even if ads contain no direct candidate advocacy and only pertain to a commercial transaction.id.at.if mandatory disclosure requirements are permissible when applied to ads that merely mention a federal candidate,then applying the same burden to ads that go further and are the functional equivalent of express advocacy can not automatically be impermissible.
in addition to its overbreadth argument,real truth argues that even if express advocacy is not limited to communications using buckley magic words,b is nonetheless unconstitutionally vague.here again,however,real truth arguments run counter to an established supreme court precedent.the language of b is consistent with the test for the functional equivalent of express advocacy that was adopted in wisconsin right to life,a test that the controlling opinion specifically stated was not impermissibly vague.wisconsin right to life,at.moreover,just as the functional equivalent test is objective,so too is the similar test contained in b.see id.at.to the extent this evidence goes to wrtl subjective intent,it is again irrelevant express advocacy independent expenditures corporate and labor organization expenditures,july,t he subjective intent of the speaker is not a relevant consideration.
both standards are also restrictive,in that they limit the application of the disclosure requirements solely to those communications that,in the estimation of any reasonable person,would constitute advocacy.although it is true that the language of b does not exactly mirror the functional equivalent definition in wisconsin right to life,b uses the word suggestive while wisconsin right to life used the word susceptible the differences between the two tests are not meaningful.indeed,the test in b is likely narrower than the one articulated in wisconsin right to life,since it requires a communication to have an electoral portion that is unmistakable and unambiguous.b.
real truth relies heavily on our decision in north carolina right to life,leake,cir,where we held north carolina campaign finance statute unconstitutional,to argue that b is likewise unconstitutional.but our holding in leake is materially distinguishable.first,we held there that the north carolina statute was unconstitutional because the terms of the statute that defined express advocacy were clearly susceptible to multiple interpretations.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.in contrast,b applies solely to communications that could only be interpreted by a reasonable person as containing advocacy of the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate s and where r easonable minds could not differ as to whether it encourages actions to elect or defeat one or more clearly identified candidate s or encourages some other kind of action.emphasis added.
second,the north carolina provision in leake regulated all electoral speech,including,potentially,issue advocacy.to resolve whether such communications could constitutionally be regulated,we articulated two requirements.first,because the regulation covered electoral speech broadly defined,we applied the requirement in wisconsin right to life,at,that it fulfill the statutory definition of electioneering communication in f a i,which,we noted,refers to a clearly identified candidate within sixty days of a general election or thirty days of a primary election.at.second,to narrow the alternative definition of express advocacy in the north carolina statute,we relied on the test developed in wisconsin right to life,at.id.while the functional equivalent test that we applied to narrow the north carolina definition of express advocacy was drawn from the test in wisconsin right to life which itself was evaluating an electioneering communication provision,the supreme court has recognized use of the test to define express advocacy wherever the term is used in the election laws.see,citizens united.at.in contrast,in the case before us,express advocacy is a component of an independent expenditure,regulated under c and and thus may be defined by applying the test,precisely as regulation b has done.because the electioneering communications requirements of f a i are not statutorily relevant to independent expenditures,we therefore need not apply those requirements applied in leake when considering express advocacy in the context of independent expenditures.
finally,our opinion in leake emphasized the importance of bcra electioneering communication definition in minimizing the potential vagueness of campaign finance regulations.leake,at.importantly,however,the north carolina statute at issue in leake imposed a variety of restrictions on campaign speech,including limits on acceptable contributions and expenditures.again in contrast,following citizens united b only implements disclosure requirements.the supreme court has routinely recognized that because disclosure requirements occasion a lesser burden on speech,it is constitutionally permissible to require disclosure for a wider variety of speech than mere electioneering.see,united states harriss.upholding disclosure and registration requirements on lobbyists despite congress inability to ban lobbying itself first natn l bank of boston bellotti,d observing that i dentification of the source of ballot referendum advertising may be required as a means of disclosure,so that the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected.citizens united only confirmed the breadth of congress power in this regard.see citizens united.at even if the ads only pertain to a commercial transaction,the public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate shortly before an election see also doe reed,d upholding disclosure requirement for petition signatories natn l org.for marriage mckee,cir holding that state express advocacy definition without an electioneering communication limitation was not vague.
real truth advances several other reasons why it believes b is impermissibly vague,but each merits only brief discussion.
first,real truth argues that the regulation applies a balancing test similar to one in regulating corporate and labor organization funds expended for certain electioneering communications,which was invalidated in citizens united.the two provisions are,however,substantially distinguishable.the citizens united court described as a,factor balancing test,making it significantly more complicated on its face than b.citizens united.at.the court also emphasized the censorious nature of,which,given its complexity,required that regulated entities either refrain from speaking or ask the commission to issue an advisory opinion approving of the political speech in question.id.in contrast,b does not restrain speech it only implicates the requirement for disclosing specified information.the supreme court criticism of can hardly cast doubt on b.
