this appeal primarily involves the scope of the rule of the federal false claims act fca,b,and the application of the essential facts test to determine whether a complaint is barred by complaints under this provision.see united states ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,cir.
relator michael wilson,a former bristol myers squibb,bms sales representative,alleged that bms and sanofiaventis u,llc sanofi unlawfully promoted plavix for offlabel uses,that bms also unlawfully promoted pravachol and monopril,and that both companies knowingly caused the submission of false claims to the government in violation of the fca.see united states ex rel.hutcheson blackstone,cir.after the government and wilson benefitted from the settlement of certain claims wilson brought in his original complaint against bms,the government declined to intervene in the litigation of the remaining claims.the district court dismissed the remaining fca claims as expressed in a second amended complaint because they ran afoul of the rule.
wilson now appeals from the dismissal,as well as from the denial of his motion to file a third amended complaint and from denial of his motion to reconsider.we affirm.
background and first amended complaint 
wilson employment at bms was terminated in september.in september,he filed his original fca complaint in the central district of california under seal,to allow the united states time to review the complaint and to decide whether to intervene in the action,b.he filed an amended complaint first amended complaint or fac in october,which alleged,inter alia that bms violated the federal criminal anti kickback statute,b b,and engaged in promotion of monopril,plavix,and pravachol,and that these actions caused false claims to be submitted to the government in violation of the fca.physicians may prescribe plavix,pravachol,and monopril for indications,but the food,drug and cosmetic act,et,prohibits companies from marketing medications for such uses and medicaid generally does not reimburse patients for offlabel prescriptions.see k,k united states ex rel.rost pfizer,cir,overruled in part by allison engine united states ex rel.sanders.
in december,while the government investigation was ongoing and the fac was still under seal,the case was transferred to the district of massachusetts.
on september,wilson entered into a partial settlement agreement with bms that concluded part of the case.under the agreement,wilson voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all federal fca claims against bms except for claims relating to promotion,retaliation,and wrongful termination to the extent they are alleged in paragraphs,and of the fac.in the settlement,bms denied any liability or wrongdoing related to wilson allegations,but agreed to execute an agreement with the united states,under which bms would pay the government,plus per year interest from january,until the settlement amount was paid in full.wilson received a portion of that sum.
on october,the government declined to intervene in what remained of the case.
second amended complaint 
on april,wilson filed his second amended complaint sac,also under seal.the sac expanded upon wilson earlier not settled allegations against bms,and added sanofi as a defendant for the first time.the sac alleged that bms engaged in schemes to promote plavix,pravachol,and monopril for certain uses,and that sanofi participated in those schemes that related to the promotion of plavix only.it is the dismissal of this complaint which is primarily at issue.
more specifically,the sac alleged that bms promoted pravachol,a drug the fda had approved for lowering cholesterol,for uses related to diabetes or insulin resistance syndrome bms and sanofi promoted plavix,a drug the fda had approved for lowering the risk of stroke and heart attack for patients with atherosclerosis or acute coronary syndrome,for offlabel use by diabetic patients to prevent peripheral arterial disease pad and bms engaged in the promotion of monopril,which the fda approved to treat hypertension.
as to the mechanisms of the promotions,wilson alleged that bms used the following schemes to promote plavix and pravachol sponsoring and promoting research for these drugs training its sales force to promote prescriptions,including using altered fax back requests and promoting uses in continuing medical education programs.he alleged that sanofi used the same methods to promote use of plavix.finally,wilson alleged that bms trained its representatives to promote prescriptions of monopril.
in august,the court granted a motion to unseal the case.at this point,the parties agreed,with court approval,that because wilson intended to amend his complaint again,bms and sanofi did not need to answer it until the court determined which complaint would govern.
denial of leave to file third amended complaint 
on june,wilson filed a motion for leave to amend and file a third amended complaint,and attached his proposed third amended complaint tac to the motion.the tac sought to add a second relator,lucius allen,also a former bms employee,and to substantially expand the allegations in the sac.the court gertner,denied wilson motion on june,reasoning in a thoughtful opinion that the tac did not meet the requirements for amendment of,and further,that the substance of the tac did not,in any event,meet the requirements of the fca.as to rule,the district court noted that the sac came almost three years after the original complaint,with the tac following almost a year after the sac,and found that wilson ha d not adequately explained either set of delays.
the district court relied more heavily on its fca inadequacy holding.it found that to the extent allen allegations replicated claims that wilson made in the sac,the tac violated the rule,b,or the public disclosure bar,id.e b,of the fca.by contrast,to the extent that the tac added substantively new allegations not previously disclosed to the government regardless of which relator provided the information,the district court held that those allegations violated the qui tam filing and service requirements,id.b 
denial of motion to reconsider 
in anticipation of judge gertner retirement,the case was reassigned to judge wolf on june.wilson filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of his motion to file the tac.this motion disputed the rule ruling,but did not dispute the earlier ruling that new allegations based on allen knowledge could not be added to the tac.instead,wilson requested that the court allow the sac to be amended by adding certain paragraphs from the proposed tac that were,wilson represented,based on his own knowledge and investigation 
the court denied the motion on march,finding that this was not one of the limited number of circumstances,united states allen,cir,in which reconsideration was warranted.the district court ordered both bms and sanofi to respond to the sac.
motion to dismiss the fca claims in the sac 
bms and sanofi moved to dismiss the fca counts in the sac.at a hearing on february,the district court granted the motions as to wilson federal fca claims.the court dismissed the fca claims relating to plavix and pravachol for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.b,because they violated the fca rule,see b.it dismissed the monopril allegations for failure to plead fraud with particularity.b.wilson does not appeal the district court dismissal of the fca claims related to monopril.
the court dismissal on grounds was based on two complaints that were filed before wilson filed his original complaint in september.on may,daniel richardson,a senior district business manager for bms,had filed a complaint under seal in the district court for the district of columbia.the richardson complaint alleged that bms and sanofi engaged in broad,nationwide schemes to promote and prescribe plavix and pravachol for uses.his allegations extended from through at least,and probably thereafter.
more specifically,the richardson complaint alleged that bms and sanofi promoted plavix for treatment of acute coronary syndrome and promoted pravachol,which was approved for reducing cholesterol and cardiac events,for uses such as decreasing cd ligand,decreasing matrix metallop
