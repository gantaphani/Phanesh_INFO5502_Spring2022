opinion of the court 
ed sulima appeals from the district court orders granting summary judgment with respect to his claims under the americans with disabilities act ada,in favor of defense support services,llc known as,and dismissing his claims under the rehabilitation act ra,which were brought against several federal government defendants,including tobyhanna army depot,the secretary of the army,and the united states department of the army collectively,tobyhanna.throughout most of,sulima was employed by and working at the tobyhanna army depot pursuant to a contract between tobyhanna and.after sulima took part in a voluntary layoff in december of,he brought suit against and tobyhanna under the ada and ra.specifically,sulima claims that he was forced into the layoff because he was disabled,was regarded as disabled by his employer,or was retaliated against for requesting an accommodation for a disability that he believed in good faith existed.
the basis for sulima claims lies in the side effects of medications he was taking to treat his obesity and sleep apnea.thus,we must consider whether the meaning of disability under the ada can encompass an impairment resulting solely from the side effects of medication,whether or not the underlying health problems are disabling.the court of appeals for the seventh circuit has considered this issue in detail,and held that these side effects may,under certain conditions,constitute a disabling impairment under the ada.see christian anthony med,cir.the district court adopted the reasoning of the seventh circuit,but found that the side effects experienced by sulima did not constitute a disabling impairment.for substantially the same reasons as the district court,we will adopt the christian standard.we agree with the district court that sulima has not satisfied his burden under this standard,and we will therefore affirm the orders of the district court.
background 
according to the opinion of his treating physician,guy michael fasciana,sulima is morbidly obese.sulima also suffers from sleep apnea,likely related to his obesity.the sleep apnea causes him to occasionally stop breathing for short periods while sleeping,at times requiring him to use a machine to help him breathe while he sleeps.after fasciana noticed signs of sleep apnea in august,he referred sulima to john della rosa,who confirmed the sleep apnea diagnosis and spoke with sulima about possible surgical options to reduce its effects.della rosa recommended that sulima lose weight in order to reduce the severity of the sleep apnea.
sulima had been taking medications for several years.it is unclear exactly which medications sulima was taking in late,the time period at issue in this appeal.however,sulima had been taking medications for several years,including xenical,a medication that is now sold over the counter as alli.xenical assists in weight loss by binding some of the fat in a person diet,preventing it from being absorbed into the body.because the fat is not absorbed,it leaves the body as an oily discharge in the stool.after sulima consulted with della rosa,he began taking lactulose,a laxative sometimes sold under the brand name kristalose.sulima received this medication either as samples from fasciana or as a prescription.in addition,fasciana also prescribed diethylpropion,known by its brand name,tenuate,as an appetite suppressant.
in january,while employed by,sulima began working at tobyhanna army depot in the position of electronics technician ii,a position created through a united states air force contract with to provide workers to tobyhanna.the medication that sulima began taking in the latter months of caused him to need to use the restroom frequently.
on october,the team leader,joe johnson,observed sulima leaving his work station several times,remaining in the restroom for a total of approximately two hours during his shift.when johnson spoke with sulima about the frequent breaks,sulima told him that they were due to a medication he was taking.johnson told sulima to get a note from a doctor,and the next day sulima brought in a note from fasciana,dated october,which said due to gastrointestinal disorder ed sulima may need to use the restrooms more than the usual.app.after sulima brought in the note,his supervisors prepared a sheet of two written questions regarding his medical condition.in response to the questions,sulima wrote that he was not sure how long he would need the medication,but that he was going back to my doctor to see if he can give me different medication.app.
after sulima continued to take frequent long breaks,a tobyhanna supervisor asked to transfer sulima to a different work area.when made aware of the transfer request,sulima spoke with fasciana and brought a note,dated december,which indicated that sulima medication had been changed and he was now able to work without needing frequent long breaks.nonetheless decided to transfer sulima,but there was no other work area within tobyhanna available at that time.sulima accepted a layoff on december,in advance of a general round of layoffs scheduled to take effect in january.although when he was laid off sulima was told that he was eligible to be rehired,he was not contacted again by,and he did not inquire about similar advertised positions that later became available.he is currently employed elsewhere.
sulima filed a complaint in the district court,alleging several violations of the ada and ra.the complaint named both and tobyhanna as defendants as sulima primary employer and tobyhanna as a joint employer.the complaint alleged that sulima had been transferred and subsequently laid off because he was disabled,or,in the alternative,because his employers regarded him as disabled.sulima also claimed that he was transferred by in retaliation for having requested extra time to use the restroom during work hours,an accommodation he claims he was entitled to request because he believed,in good faith,that he had a disability within the meaning of the ada.
tobyhanna moved to dismiss or for summary judgment on the grounds that it was not sulima joint employer,and therefore not a responsible party under the ada.the district court agreed,granting the motion in its order of april.subsequently moved for summary judgment on the merits.the district court granted this motion in its order of october,finding that sulima had not produced sufficient evidence to succeed in the litigation.app.that order also denied sulima motion to reinstate tobyhanna as a defendant,ruling that even if the district court were to find that tobyhanna jointly employed sulima,sulima claims would fail on their merits for the same reasons that sulima claims against failed.sulima appeals.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over these ada and ra claims pursuant to.we have jurisdiction of sulima appeal from the district court final order of october,granting summary judgment to,under.we also conclude that we have jurisdiction over sulima appeal with regard to his claims against tobyhanna,although tobyhanna argues that sulima failure to specifically refer to the order of april,finding for tobyhanna on the joint employer issue in sulima notice of appeal is fatal to his appeal of that order.
we have jurisdiction over final decisions of the district court.when an officer or agency of the united states is a party to a lawsuit,a notice of appeal must be filed within days after the order or judgment appealed from is entered.fed.a b.for an action involving claims against multiple parties,a judgment that resolves less than all of the claims against all of the parties is not a final judgment unless the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.b.this includes a situation in which a court grants summary judgment as to one of several defendants.see,buzzard roadrunner trucking,cir.the district court here did not make such a certification,and therefore the district court judgment did not become final until its order of october,sulima filed his notice of appeal on november,within the limitation.
sulima failure to fully specify his intent to appeal the district court order of april in the notice of appeal does not preclude our exercise of jurisdiction.a notice of appeal must specify the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.c b.here,sulima original notice of appeal stated that he was appealing from the october,order and decision issued by judge conaboy denying sulima right to a jury trial on claims under the americans with disabilities act.app.this notice listed both and tobyhanna as parties to the appeal.later,on august,sulima filed an amended notice of appeal,which stated that he was appealing from the orders and decisions of april,and october,issued by judge conaboy denying sulima right to a jury trial on claims under the americans with disabilities act along with the judgment entered on october.app.
if an appeal is taken only from a specified judgment,the court does not acquire jurisdiction to review other judgments not specified or fairly inferred by the notice.elfman motors,chrysler,cir.however,o ur jurisprudence liberally construes notices of appeal.drinkwater union carbide,cir.in this vein,we have held that we can exercise jurisdiction over orders not specified in the notice of appeal if there is a connection between the specified and unspecified orders the intention to appeal the unspecified order is apparent and the opposing party is not prejudiced and has a full opportunity to brief the issues.polonski trump taj mahal,cir citing williams guzzardi,cir.these conditions are satisfied here.
while sulima original notice of appeal only directly referenced the october order,it also named tobyhanna as a party to the appeal.as noted above,the april order did not resolve all of the claims against all of the parties,and therefore did not become final until the issuance of the october order.as we have previously held,because only a final judgment or order is appealable,the appeal from a final judgment draws in question all prior orders and rulings.elfman motors,at.therefore,because the april order did not become final until the issuance of the october order,and because the october order denied sulima motion to reinstate tobyhanna as a defendant,the orders are sufficiently connected.see drinkwater,at finding a connection when,even though a previous order had dismissed one claim,the order specified in the notice of appeal discussed in detail the merits of the dismissed claim.
sulima notice of appeal also demonstrated his intent to appeal the april order.we have previously held that an appeal from the denial of a motion for reconsideration demonstrates an intent to appeal the underlying dismissal.leboon lancaster jewish cmty.ctr.ass n,cir citing matute procoast nav,cir.in the same way,sulima specification of the october order in his notice of appeal,in which the district court denied sulima motion to reinstate tobyhanna as a defendant,demonstrates an intent to appeal the underlying dismissal of sulima claims against tobyhanna.
finally,tobyhanna has not alleged any form of prejudice,and has fully briefed the disputed issues,so the third prong of the test is satisfied.mci telecomm.teleconcepts,cir.we therefore have jurisdiction to review the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of and its dismissal of the claims against tobyhanna.
when reviewing a district court summary judgment decision in an ada case,we exercise plenary review,applying the same standard as the district court.turner hershey chocolate,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the party,there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we review de novo a district court decision granting a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b.ballentine united states,cir.
iii.disability discrimination under the ada 
sulima first contends that his transfer and subsequent layoff constituted unlawful employment discrimination.the ada prohibits covered employers from discriminating against disabled individuals.a to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,a plaintiff must show that he is disabled within the meaning of the ada,that he is otherwise qualified for the job,with or without reasonable accommodations,and that he was subjected to an adverse employment decision as a result of discrimination.taylor phoenixville sch,cir.an individual is disabled if he has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.
equal employment opportunity commission eeoc regulations define an impairment as a ny physiological disorder,or condition affecting one or more of the following body systems neurological,musculoskeletal,special sense organs,respiratory including speech organs,cardiovascular,reproductive,digestive,hemic and lymphatic,skin,and endocrine.h.major life activities include functions such as caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working.id.i.a major life activity is substantially limited if an individual is unable to perform it or is s ignificantly restricted as to the condition,manner or duration under which it is performed,as compared to an average person in the general population.id.j.in determining whether a substantial limitation exists,the regulations require the consideration of three factors 
the nature and severity of the impairment 
the duration or expected duration of the impairment 
the actual or expected permanent or long term impact resulting from the impairment.
id.j.a nonpermanent or temporary condition can not be a substantial impairment under the ada.williams phila.hous,cir.
for purposes of summary judgment,the district court focused on sulima gastrointestinal difficulties as the nature of his alleged disability,finding that sulima had not presented any evidence to show that either his obesity or sleep apnea directly substantially limited a major life activity.next,the district court noted that sulima did not argue that the gastrointestinal problems were caused by anything other than the medications he was taking.therefore,the district court found that sulima was claiming to be substantially impaired solely due to side effects from his prescribed medications.we agree with the district court conclusion.
because sulima is claiming an impairment based on the side effects from medication,the factual situation presented here is somewhat different from a typical ada claim.sulima has health problems that prompt the use of medication,but claims that his impairment under the ada is based solely on a disorder or condition resulting from the medication,not from the underlying health problem that the medication is meant to treat 
a few of our sister courts of appeals have considered this issue.in christian,the principal case relied upon by the district court,the plaintiff claimed that she was fired because of her anticipated medical treatment for hypercholesterolemia high blood cholesterol.at.the seventh circuit court of appeals,although ultimately not ruling in favor of the plaintiff,concluded that the treatment of a condition that is not itself disabling may be a disability within the meaning of the ada.id.at.in a similar case from the eighth circuit court of appeals,a plaintiff claimed a disability under the ada based both on her hypertension and on side effects resulting from the interaction between prescribed hypertension and pain medications.hill.city area transp,cir.although also not ruling in favor of the plaintiff,the eighth circuit treated these two conditions separately,acknowledging that each could constitute an impairment under the ada.see id.referring to the side effects from the medications as an alleged physical impairment.likewise,although finding that the plaintiff was not disabled within the meaning of the ada,the eleventh circuit court of appeals did not reject the notion that the plaintiff could claim an impairment resulting from the side effects of chemotherapy treatments in response to cancer which was not itself disabling.gordon hamm,cir.
to evaluate sulima impairment for purposes of assessing whether he was disabled within the meaning of the ada,the district court adopted the
