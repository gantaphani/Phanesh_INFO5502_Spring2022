the maryland state conference of naacp branches naacp and individuals commenced this class action on april,against the maryland state police and of its officers for racially profiling minority motorists on interstate in maryland.the plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief,damages,and attorneys fees.
after the district court entered an administrative order denying the plaintiffs motion for class certification without prejudice to its later renewal,the representative parties abandoned their efforts to represent a class.instead,they filed a motion to amend their complaint to add individuals as new plaintiffs.by order dated july,the district court denied their motion to amend,concluding that the new parties could not be added to the case because their claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.the plaintiffs then filed a motion on their own behalf,through counsel,for reconsideration,and by an order dated december,the district court also denied that motion.the plaintiffs and plaintiffs appealed from the district court orders denying the plaintiffs motion to amend and denying the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration,challenging the district court application of the statute of limitations.
five months after the district court denied the motion for reconsideration and after the plaintiffs and plaintiffs filed appeals,the plaintiffs and plaintiffs filed a motion to have the district court two orders certified as final judgments under federal rule of civil procedure b,asserting that there is no just reason for delay of the entry of judgment as to the putative plaintiffs.the district court signed the proposed order electronically on may,but never entered a corresponding judgment under rule a.the plaintiffs and plaintiffs again appealed.
sorting out the procedural morass created by these proceedings,we conclude that we have jurisdiction to consider some of the appeals and that we must dismiss the others for lack of jurisdiction.on the appeals for which we have jurisdiction,we affirm for the reasons given herein.
the complaint of the naacp and the named individuals,which was brought under,alleged that the defendants engaged in a continuing pattern and practice of stops,detentions,and searches of minority motorists traveling interstate through maryland,in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution for unreasonable searches and seizures for denying them equal protection and for impinging on their right to travel,title vi of the civil rights act,and the maryland declaration of rights.the plaintiffs purported to represent a class of all innocent minority motorists who have been since january,or who will be in the future,illegally stopped,detained,searched by maryland state troopers along interstate,without just cause and based upon their race national origin.the plaintiffs requested declaratory,equitable,and monetary relief class certification under federal rule of civil procedure b for declaratory and injunctive relief and under rule b for damages and attorneys fees under.
on the defendants motion,the district court dismissed each claim that arose before april,applying maryland statute of limitations.see maryland state conf.of naacp branches maryland dep t of state police,d.
the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on march.following the exchange of some discovery,the defendants filed their opposition to the motion in january.when the plaintiffs requested more discovery in lieu of filing a reply brief,the district court granted their request and entered an order dated february,denying the motion for class certification without prejudice and providing that the motion would automatically be considered renewed if the plaintiffs filed a reply to the defendants opposition to class certification.
promptly thereafter,the parties engaged in settlement negotiations and by march,reached agreement in principle on a partial settlement involving only the representative parties.the prospective class members were so advised,as counsel for the plaintiffs testified by affidavit 
by late winter of,there was agreement at least in principle on the points that eventually were embodied in the consent decree,and the named plaintiffs along with prospective class members were encouraged to attend a briefing on the terms.on march,the meeting was held in the federal courthouse.plaintiffs and prospective class members attended and heard from the court and counsel.
emphasis added.indeed,counsel asserts that at this march meeting,the attending prospective class members,including plaintiffs who filed this appeal,voted to approve the settlement.
by february,the individual plaintiffs and the defendants completed the details of their settlement agreement and consent decree,and on may,the district court approved the consent decree.while the settlement agreement and consent decree resolved the individual plaintiffs claims for declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as their claims to date for attorneys fees,the agreement did not dispose of the individual plaintiffs damages claims,nor did it bar them from resurrecting a class action for damages under rule b.
one month later,however,on june,the plaintiffs formally announced that they were abandoning their class action in its entirety.they wrote the court that their request for class certification under rule b ha d been mooted by entry of the consent decree.and as to their request for class certification under rule b,they wrote 
we have concluded that it is desirable at this juncture for the case to proceed on individual motorists and passengers claims only,and not as a class action.
recognizing that there might be statute of limitations problems for absent class members,the plaintiffs advised the court 
w e therefore feel obligated to protect absent class members,to the fullest extent possible,from statute of limitations defenses,even if we are confident that such defenses are without merit.one way to seek such protection would be to request leave to amend the complaint by adding known but absent class members as additional named plaintiffs,so that their claims could relate back to the initial filing of this case in april,as provided by rule.but this course could complicate management of the case.it could be simpler if absent class members who still want to press their individual claims were encouraged to file them as separate actions,whether in this court or in state court.
emphasis added.
in response to the plaintiff advice to the court,the state defendants responded 
as to the future course of litigation,given that the equitable claims have been resolved in the consent decree and that no class has been certified,it is our understanding that what remains to be litigated is a set of individual damages claims arising from separate,unrelated traffic stops.
w hile we understand that plaintiffs counsel is concerned about statutes of limitation issues and we are willing to discuss those issues,we can not agree to stipulate away any statute of limitations defenses to which our clients are entitled.this is particularly so because in most cases the specific trooper connected to a complainant particular incident has not been identified.
emphasis added.
the plaintiffs replied with a proposal to send absent members of the abandoned class a notice advising each member to seek prompt legal advice.the notice suggested,any such person who wants to claim monetary damages should consider promptly filing his or her own lawsuit,or filing a formal motion to intervene in this lawsuit emphasis added.because the class action had been abandoned,however,the court had no rule obligation or mechanism to notify class members originally identified in the complaint and did not do so.so the plaintiffs,as they have alleged,informally advised some persons who they believed might have had individual claims for being stopped on interstate.
on april,more than three years after the district court administrative order denying class certification and more than two years after the class members were briefed on and voted to approve the settlement and consent decree,the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend their complaint to add individuals from the class as new plaintiffs.all purported to have damages claims against the maryland state police for being stopped and searched on interstate during the period before the commencement of this action from april,to april,and none of their claims arose from police stops involving any of the named plaintiffs.
by order dated july,the district court denied the motion to amend to add the plaintiffs because the plaintiffs claims were barred by maryland statute of limitations,citing montgomery county,motz.in,the maryland court held that when a party seeks to amend his complaint to add a new party,with his own cause of action,to the proceedings,the cause of action of that party has its own statute of limitations governed by its filing date and not that of the original plaintiff,at.because the plaintiffs proposed to state separate and distinct causes of action,the court held that their filing date did not relate back to the original commencement date of the action and therefore were barred by the statute of limitations.
thereafter,the plaintiffs,now represented by their own counsel,filed their own motion requesting the court to reconsider its order excluding them from this case.they argued that their claims were not barred by the statute of limitations because the running of the limitations period had been suspended by the filing of this class action and the district court order denying class certification for only administrative reasons did not end the class action and therefore the tolling,citing american pipe construction utah,d,and crown,cork seal parker,d.the district court rejected the argument,noting that the plaintiffs had abandoned their plan to seek class certification 
t o ask the court and the defendants to remain in legal limbo so that plaintiffs can expand the number of individuals seeking to bring individual claims that would otherwise be time barred,when they have abandoned their plan to seek class certification,is not in keeping with the principles articulated in american pipe and crown,cork seal.
responding to the plaintiffs claim that denying their claims on limitations grounds would be unfair,the district court stated 
plaintiffs waited more than three years to seek amendment to their original complaint to add additional parties after judge blake denied class action status.further,plaintiffs gave notice to the court on june,that they had no intention of pursuing status.despite this announcement,they waited an additional nine months before seeking leave to amend their complaint to add the new parties.rather than to their period of time,plaintiffs could have sought formal clarification of the effect of judge blake order,renewed their class action motion immediately,or endeavored to timely amend their complaint to add individual claims on the basis that the american pipe tolling principles applied in maryland.they chose not to do so.
the plaintiffs noticed this appeal on january,from both the district court july,order denying plaintiffs motion to amend and the district court december,order denying plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.the plaintiffs in this action also appealed both orders,but they did not file their appeal until april.apparently unsure of the appealability of any of the proposed orders,the parties filed a motion five months after the latest of the district court orders requesting that the court direct entry of final judgment as to the orders,under federal rule of civil procedure b,because there was no just reason for delay of the entry of judgment as to the putative plaintiffs emphasis added.while the district court electronically signed the order proposed by the parties,no rule b judgment was ever entered with respect to the plaintiffs under rule a.during the pendency of this appeal,the named plaintiffs and the defendants have continued litigating the damages claims in the district court.
we address first our jurisdiction,noting that the issue is entangled by procedural maneuvering and mistakes.
the motion to amend was made by the naacp and individual plaintiffs.the court denied that motion on july,but the plaintiffs did not appeal it until april.the plaintiffs,who were never parties to the action,appealed this order on january.
the motion for reconsideration was made by the plaintiffs,who were represented by their own counsel.the court denied that motion on december,and the plaintiffs timely appealed on january.the plaintiffs,even though they did not join that motion,nonetheless appealed it,and their appeal was not filed until april.
for neither order were the plaintiffs actual parties in this action.yet they,together with the plaintiffs,requested a rule b certification that both the district court july,order and its december,order were judgments.they filed this motion after they had filed their appeals.the district court granted their motion by a paperless docket entry,but it never entered a rule b judgment in accordance with rule a.see united states indrelunas,d holding that separate document requirement of rule is mandatory.nevertheless,within days after the district court granted the certification order,the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs appealed again.
troubling,in this scenario,is the fact that the plaintiffs were represented by experienced counsel who recognized that the course open for the plaintiffs to follow would be to file separate actions or motions to intervene in this action.this is precisely what the plaintiffs proposed to the district court for its notice to the abandoned class members.yet,it is apparent from the record that counsel for the plaintiffs and plaintiffs adopted a considered strategy that the plaintiffs would file a motion to amend the complaint in this that plaintiffs would file a separate action or a motion to an effort to get around difficult statute of limitations questions that attended the claims of the plaintiffs.they hoped,despite maryland law to the contrary,that an amended complaint would provide the plaintiffs with the original filing date of this action in april,in lieu of the august,filing date of their motion for reconsideration.
thus,the plaintiffs purposefully did not file a motion to intervene pursuant to rule.yet,faced with questions of appealability and standing raised by this court,the plaintiffs now argue that they should be deemed to have proceeded under rule.they maintain that proceeding under rule rather than rule should be treated as functional equivalents in terms of applicable standards of review.they argue that a party should not lose a significant right merely due to the label placed on a procedural act.
our first order of business,therefore,must be to decide which parties and issues are properly before us on appeal.
congress conferred jurisdiction on courts of appeals in and,providing jurisdiction over only final orders and certain interlocutory and collateral orders.a denial of a motion to amend a complaint is not a final order,nor is it an appealable interlocutory or collateral order.accordingly,we have no jurisdiction over the original plaintiffs appeal of the district court july,order denying their motion to amend the complaint to add new party plaintiffs to the action.even if the order were somehow appealable,the original plaintiffs,who were and could be the only parties to the motion to amend,did not timely appeal the district court order.see fed.a see also browder director,dep t of corrections,d this time limit for appealing is mandatory and jurisdictional internal quotation marks omitted shah hutto,cir same.
by force of the same reasoning,we also lack jurisdiction to hear the original plaintiffs appeal of the district court order denying the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of the district court july,order denying the amendment.the denial of reconsideration of a nonappealable order is not a final order.because the plaintiffs did not join the motion for reconsideration,they also have no standing to appeal its denial.and again,even if that order were final and the plaintiffs had standing,their appeal was untimely,having been filed on april.
because the plaintiffs never became parties to the action,they have no standing to appeal either the district court july,order denying the plaintiffs motion to amend or the district court order denying reconsideration of the motion to amend.moreover,the plaintiffs appeal from the denial of the motion to amend was untimely.their appeal from the denial of the motion for reconsideration,however,was timely.
finally,rule b does not provide the parties or the district court with the authority to convert an order denying a motion to amend or denying reconsideration of that motion into an order that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties,as required by rule b.see general elect,d district courts are authorized to use rule b to certify final judgments final in the sense that it is an ultimate disposition of an individual claim entered in the course of a multiple claims action internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.the motion to amend and the motion for reconsideration of the motion to amend adjudicated no party claims the plaintiffs were never parties whose rights and liabilities were adjudicated and the actual plaintiffs own claims were not in any way adjudicated by the district court ruling.in addition,the plaintiffs and plaintiffs second appeal filed after the court granted the rule b motion was not taken from a final judgment because a judgment was not entered as required by rule a.indeed,such a judgment reflecting the adjudication of some claims or parties could not have been crafted because no claims of parties were adjudicated.
of course,had the plaintiffs filed a motion to intervene under rule b,as was originally counseled,the denial of their motion would be treated as a final judgment that is appealable.see stringfellow concerned neighbors in action,d wright,miller kane,federal practice procedure supp.any denial of intervention should be regarded as an appealable final order.the plaintiffs now request that for purposes of assuring our jurisdiction,we take them as denied intervenors on the basis that their august,motion for reconsideration amounted in substance to a motion to intervene.
the requirements of rule serve several offices.principally,the rule protects intervenors interests by allowing them to join actions that potentially affect those interests.it also protects intervenors from the preference of existing parties that others not be brought in,by assuring that intervenors have a full and fair chance to present the reasons they believe they should be permitted to intervene.see wright,miller kane,federal practice procedure supp.the rule also protects existing parties.it requires that the intervenor serve on the existing parties and the court not only its motion to intervene,giving the reasons therefor,but also a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.c.finally,in requiring intervenors to seek leave of court,the rule recognizes the role of the district court as the primary manager of a civil action once instituted.
we have recognized that in very limited circumstances an intervenor can be excused for failing to abide by the letter of rule.in spring construction harris,cir,the intervenor failed to file its own pleading at the same time that it filed its motion to intervene.instead,the intervenor filed the pleading several days later.the district court excused the oversight and granted the motion to intervene,and we affirmed,concluding that the proper approach is to disregard technical defects in rule procedure.id.at emphasis added.
in this case,the departures from rule are more significant than those presented in spring construction,as might be expected,because the plaintiffs deliberately chose not to file a motion to intervene.yet as we read their motion for reconsideration,their departures may amount more to form than to substance.the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration,when understood as being filed by nonparties,essentially requests that they be made parties to the action.the motion was entitled unnamed plaintiffs motion to reconsider order of july,excluding them from this case emphasis added.and in the body of their motion,even though they awkwardly blur their status,calling themselves plaintiffs and making no distinction between the plaintiffs as parties and themselves as nonparties,they do request that they be allowed to join the action as plaintiffs.they carried the denominational confusion even as they made their arguments.complaining about the fairness of the district court february,order,denying class certification,these plaintiffs state,t he order is seriously unfair to the plaintiffs here actually,plaintiffs who sought actually,the plaintiffs sought to add their names in the third amended complaint.but in substance,they argue that they should be allowed to participate in the action as plaintiffs.the plaintiffs note correctly that the plaintiffs were supportive of their request to become parties and therefore would not claim prejudice,and they argue that the defendants would not be prejudiced because the defendants knew the names of these plaintiffs and some of the information about them through discovery.moreover,the proposed third amended complaint,which accompanied the plaintiffs earlier motion to amend to add the plaintiffs,contained the actual allegations that the plaintiffs would be making against the defendants in this case.the plaintiffs thus have the benefit of the plaintiffs earlier motion to satisfy in substance the rule c requirement that intervenors provide defendants with a copy of their proposed complaint.
in sum,while deliberately avoiding the mention of intervention in their motion for reconsideration,the plaintiffs nonetheless did request intervention,and they appealed to this court as if they were denied intervenors.by seeking a rule b order with respect to their request to be plaintiffs,the plaintiffs argued that the denial of their proposed claims should be treated as judgments,much as would be their status as denied intervenors.of course,if the plaintiffs had actually filed a motion to intervene under rule,they would have been quite comfortable in relying on the principle that denial of a motion to intervene is an appealable final order,without the necessity of seeking a rule b certification.likewise,in granting the rule b motion,the district court unwittingly treated the plaintiffs as nonparties seeking to them as the putative plaintiffs.
setting aside consideration of the unacceptable distorting and manipulating of judicial procedures that we have witnessed here so that we might reach the substance of the plaintiffs appeal,we will take their filings on their substance and accept them as denied intervenors.apparently the district court supported this understanding when it signed,albeit erroneously,the proposed order granting rule b certification.moreover,in considering the plaintiffs appeal,we do not see any prejudice to the defendants.
accordingly,we will treat,for purposes of this appeal,the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration to be a motion to intervene under rule b,and we review the district court december,order denying that motion as a final appealable order.at the same time,we dismiss the appeals of the original plaintiffs from both orders as interlocutory and untimely,and as to the december,order,we dismiss their appeal for the additional reason that they lack standing to appeal the denial of a motion to which they were not a party.finally,we dismiss the plaintiffs appeal of the district court july,order for lack of standing and for untimeliness.
in denying the plaintiffs permission to prosecute claims in this action,the district court concluded that the statute of limitations barred their claims.the court rejected the plaintiffs two arguments that their causes of contained in plaintiffs motion to amend and as adopted by them in their motion for relate back to the filing of the original complaint in and that the running of the statute of limitations was suspended during the period from when this action was commenced as a class action in and that suspension continued even beyond the district court administrative order denying class c
