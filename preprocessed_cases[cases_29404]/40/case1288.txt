at the heart of this case are the past and future of the outer banks,barrier islands along north carolina atlantic coast.for decades,the herbert bonner bridge bonner bridge has provided highway access between mainland north carolina and the outer banks hatteras island.but the effects of time threaten the structural integrity of the bonner bridge,while large storms and changing coastal conditions threaten the viability of the portions of north carolina highway nc south of the bonner bridge.
the north carolina department of transportation ncdot and the federal highway administration fhwa collectively,defendants sought a transportation solution to these problems and settled on a plan that essentially mirrors what currently exists replacing the bonner bridge and maintaining nc on hatteras island.
defenders of wildlife and the national wildlife refuge association plaintiffs responded with this lawsuit.plaintiffs claim that defendants violated the national environmental policy act nepa and section f of the department of transportation act of by,among other things,committing to the construction of only one segment of the transportation project namely the replacement bridge and denying the public the full review of the entire project and its environmental impact,as nepa requires.plaintiffs also contend that defendants violated section f by,among other things,improperly rejecting alternatives that would not have used protected wildlife refuge land.
the district court brought plaintiffs suit to a halt by granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.the district court held,in part,that defendants complied with nepa and section f in researching,designing,and selecting their project.
on appeal,we do not decide whether we agree with defendants policy choices or project preferences.rather,we must determine whether defendants have complied with the law in reaching their decisions.this has been no easy task,given the tortured decisionmaking history of this project,the difficulty of determining exactly what defendants intend to construct,and the extensive administrative record underlying the district court decision.nevertheless,for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court determination that defendants complied with nepa,reverse the district court determination that a special exception frees defendants from complying with section f,and remand for further proceedings.
since the early,defendants have been developing plans to replace portions of nc,a highway that traverses the outer banks.we refer to defendants chosen plan the one currently under review by this as the project.the project involves the portion of nc running from the southern tip of bodie island,across the oregon inlet,to the village of rodanthe,the northernmost population center on hatteras island.the oregon inlet is a relatively narrow and shallow channel of water formed in the mid by severe storms.
before,when the bonner bridge was constructed over the oregon inlet,motorists relied on ferries to travel between hatteras island and the mainland.the bonner bridge is approximately miles long and carries over ten thousand vehicles per day during the area busy summer tourist season.
after crossing the oregon inlet but before reaching rodanthe,nc passes through thirteen miles of the pea island national wildlife refuge refuge and the cape hatteras national seashore seashore.these two natural areas are owned and managed by the federal government,and they are major destinations for many of the tourists who visit hatteras island.although the boundaries of the seashore and the refuge generally overlap in the project area,they are two distinct entities.
in,president roosevelt established the refuge pursuant to executive order,issued under the migratory bird conservation act.the order stated that the land was to be reserved as a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife and that any private lands within the area described shall become a part of the refuge hereby established upon the acquisition of title thereto or lease thereof by the united states.exec.order.during and,the united states government used condemnation proceedings to acquire the property for the refuge directly from the previous land owners.the refuge is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service,a bureau of the department of the interior doi.
in,congress created the seashore as a protected environment separate and distinct from the refuge.act of,stat.the seashore contains approximately square miles of primitive wilderness on the coast,set apart for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.id.at.the united states government acquired the land for the seashore through several deeds from the state of north carolina.today,the seashore is a publicly owned park and recreation area that is owned by the federal government and administered by the national park service.
when the seashore was created,congress emphasized the need to protect it from development,stating that no development of the project seashore or plan for the convenience of visitors shall be undertaken which would be incompatible with the preservation of the unique flora and fauna in the area.act of,stat.the seashore remains miles of open,virtually unspoiled beach and scenic drive.
during the,paved roads were built between the villages on hatteras island,and in,a paved road was constructed through hatteras island to the village of hatteras.exactly when and how the public south of the bridge was established is a matter of dispute discussed in detail below.but the record reflects that it was not until that congress authorized doi to grant a permanent easement for the construction of a public road through the pea island national wildlife refuge to the state of north carolina.act of,stat.and it was not until that doi formally deeded the easement to north carolina.
unfortunately,both the bonner bridge and the road have suffered from the effects of time,ocean overwash,and erosion.ncdot has deemed the condition of the bonner bridge poor and given it a sufficiency rating of two out of.the condition of the surface road is no better.in its narrowest places in the refuge,hatteras island is just onequarter mile wide,and even under normal weather conditions,portions of nc are threatened by shoreline erosion and overwash.
despite moving nc as far west as possible and notwithstanding valiant efforts by its civil engineers and road crews,ncdot has not been able to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the highway in recent years.in november,for example,tropical storm ida rendered nc impassable just north of rodanthe.less than two years later,hurricane irene created two breaches that closed nc from august until october.and in,hurricane sandy tore up the roadbed,leveled the dunes,and damaged the sandbags north of rodanthe.dot struggling with highway repairs at the more ferries added for holiday,island free press.saved as ecf opinion attachment.
in light of the impact of storm events such as these,merely replacing the bonner bridge would not achieve the central purpose of the project,which is to p rovide a new means of access from bodie island to hatteras island for its residents,businesses,services,and tourists prior to the end of the bonner bridge service life.indeed,as defendants own nepa documents have put it building phase i the bridge replacement alone would not meet the purpose and need of the project.therefore,the project now also includes nc between the community of rodanthe and oregon inlet,a section of roadway that is at risk because of shoreline erosion.
in,ncdot designated several hot spots along nc areas with a high rate of erosion and a high likelihood of overwash creating a new inlet.that same year,transportation officials began to plan for the replacement of the bonner bridge.they completed a feasibility study and selected as their nepa preferred the parallel bridge corridor.this alternative consisted only of a replacement bridge.in,defendants completed a draft environmental impact study and a section f analysis for this preferred alternative.
however,nine years later,in,officials decided that the parallel bridge corridor was no longer a viable bonner bridge replacement alternative,due in large part to the ongoing beach erosion and increased problems with ocean overwash along nc south of bonner bridge that often rendered the highway impassable.defendants perceived the need to lengthen the project limits t he prevailing logic being that if those hot spots are impassible,sic what good is the bridge.
accordingly,defendants began assessing different alternatives that addressed both the bridge and certain segments of nc,preparing a supplemental draft environmental impact statement,and performing a new section f evaluation.these assessments were consolidated into one document that was signed and released to the public on september,the supplemental draft environmental impact f evaluation.
the supplemental draft environmental impact f evaluation analyzed five alternatives that were located within two different geographic corridors.the first corridor was described as the pamlico sound bridge corridor,and the two alternatives within this corridor involved an mile long bridge that extended from bodie island in the north to rodanthe in the south.both of these alternatives,titled pamlico sound bridge corridor with curved rodanthe terminus and pamlico sound bridge corridor with intersection rodanthe terminus,avoided almost all of the refuge and the seashore by making a large sweeping curve approximately five miles west of hatteras island into pamlico sound before rejoining existing nc in rodanthe.
the remaining three alternatives were located within the parallel bridge corridor.these alternatives all consisted of a replacement bridge that would span the oregon inlet parallel to the existing bonner bridge,coupled with a strategy for keeping nc open from the community of rodanthe to the oregon inlet bridge southern terminus.these alternatives differed in their respective strategies for keeping nc open on hatteras island.
the first alternative titled the nourishment alternative involved beach nourishment plus dune enhancement to maintain a minimally adequate beach and dune system.j.the protection afforded by the beach and dunes which would need to be replenished with dredged sand every few years would ostensibly allow nc to remain in place.
the second alternative titled road south involved placing nc on a bridge west of hatteras island beginning at a new intersection in rodanthe and continuing to a point approximately miles north of the refuge southern boundary where the project would meet existing nc.after that point,nc would 
then remain unchanged for miles and would be relocated to a point feet west of the forecast shoreline.this relocation would continue miles north until the relocated nc would meet the oregon inlet bridge.three foot high dunes,totaling feet would be built when needed as the shoreline erodes towards the relocated road.
the final alternative within the parallel bridge corridor was called the all bridge alternative,in which nc would be constructed on a bridge to the west of the existing road.notwithstanding its name,the all bridge alternative would also include two surface road near the oregon inlet and another just north of the refuge ponds where access from nc to the refuge would be provided.the supplemental draft environmental impact f evaluation explained that although all of the parallel bridge corridor alternatives were described and addressed as three separate alternatives,their components could be mixed and matched geographically along the length of nc to create other variations.
the supplemental draft environmental impact f evaluation did not select a preferred alternative,and defendants never issued a final environmental impact statement.instead,defendants issued another supplement in.they titled this document the supplement to the supplemental draft environmental impact statement and draft section f evaluation the supplement.the supplement explains that it was issued to address the characteristics and potential direct,indirect,and cumulative impacts of two additional detailed study alternatives.these two new alternatives were titled parallel bridge corridor with phased bridge and parallel bridge corridor with phased nourishment.the supplement also explicitly stated that u nless otherwise noted,information presented in the supplemental draft environmental impact statement has not changed and is not reproduced in this supplement.
the supplement two new alternatives were variations on a phased approach to the project.both alternatives included an oregon inlet bridge and elevating portions of nc through the refuge and northern rodanthe on new bridges within the existing nc easement.both alternatives were proposed to be built in four phases,with the construction of the new oregon inlet bridge as the first phase.the remaining phases would be constructed as necessitated by shoreline erosion.
the only difference between the two new phased approach alternatives was the manner in which nc would be protected from erosion.under the phased bridge alternative,the new bridge in the existing nc easement would begin in rodanthe and extend north to oregon inlet except for the mile length of nc in the southern half of the refuge that would not be threatened by erosion prior to.the phased nourishment alternative would be similar except the southern end of the nc bridge would begin mile south of the border.beach nourishment would be used to protect nc in rodanthe.and like the supplemental draft environmental impact statement,the supplement explained that all of the parallel bridge alternatives could be mixed and matched geographically along the length of nc to create other variations.
to review,then,the supplemental draft environmental impact statement and its supplement analyzed in detail seven alternatives pamlico sound bridge corridor with curved rodanthe terminus pamlico sound bridge corridor with intersection rodanthe terminus parallel bridge corridor with nourishment parallel bridge corridor with road south parallel bridge corridor with all bridge parallel bridge corridor with phased bridge and parallel bridge corridor with phased nourishment.
in,defendants issued a final environmental impact statement final environmental impact statement that analyzed the seven alternatives covered by the and documents.the final environmental impact statement stated that the preferred alternative was the parallel bridge corridor with phased bridge.the final environmental impact statement clearly explained that the preferred alternative and the other phased approach alternative that was added in the supplement the parallel bridge corridor with phased nourishment would remain within the existing nc easement.the final environmental impact statement noted that defendants chose the preferred alternative based on several factors,including the ability of the alternatives considered to meet the project purpose and need environmental consequences opportunities available to mitigate impacts cost public and agency comment on the supplemental draft environmental impact f evaluation and the supplement and other findings presented in this final environmental impact statement.
but at the end of the comment period,defendants did not issue a record of decision instead,sometime between late and early,defendants decided to revisit their preferred alternative because of consideration and evaluation given to comments received on the final environmental impact statement and the section f evaluation included in the final environmental impact statement.defendants also claimed to have obtained additional information,which also contributed to the of the preferred alternative.this additional information consisted of what defendants characterized as substantial evidence that a public vehicular thoroughfare existed across the length of the project area before the refuge and seashore were established.defendants explained that t his new information changes the fhwa analysis required by section f.
to support their assertions regarding the history of the nc,defendants created a document titled nc right of way timeline.in the spring of,defendants distributed this document at a meeting with representatives of state and federal agencies involved in the project.the meeting agenda for that day indicates that defendants planned to designate the road south alternative as the new preferred alternative.
during that meeting,a representative from the environmental protection agency epa put forth the idea of first building the replacement for the bonner bridge and then examining the rest of the project in more detail when future conditions are more known.j.the epa representative characterized this idea as adaptive management.
not everyone at the meeting was completely on board with this idea,however.specifically,pete benjamin,a representative with the fish and wildlife service stated that he was trying to decide if adaptive management was appropriate for this project but had reservations regarding whether or not the agencies could identify in the future a solution through the refuge that is legal from the perspective of all of the agencies involved.he went on to say that the agencies need ed more than just the hope of finding an appropriate future solution.after the meeting,benjamin sent ncdot a letter explaining that the information that defendants presented to the meeting participants contained many incorrect statements and findings that have the potential to improperly influence as the process moves forward.he took issue with defendants assessments regarding the environmental impact on the refuge,and he expressed the belief that ncdot can not demonstrate that it has a right to move its easement for nc to any other location within the refuge.
notwithstanding such reservations,defendants began to pursue yet another new that differed from the previously studied alternatives.in october,fhwa released a revised final section f evaluation section f evaluation.this document provided the public with its first notice of the new preferred parallel bridge corridor with nc transportation management plan.defendants explained it as follows 
this alternative would replace the current bonner bridge with a new bridge located to the west of the existing bridge phase i.the replacement bridge location in the refuge is limited to the area necessary to safely construct and the new bridge to nc.under the parallel bridge corridor with nc transportation management plan alternative,later phases of actions to manage nc through would be decided based on actual conditions existing on hatteras island at the point in time that additional action becomes necessary.these later phases could consist of,but would not be limited to,one or more components of any of the alternatives already studied as part of the environmental review process.
emphasis added.
fhwa also explained that b ased on newly obtained information,its determinations regarding the applicability of section f had changed.specifically,fhwa stated that section f applied only to the pea island national wildlife refuge as a historic property,rather than as a refuge.fhwa based this assertion on evidence that it claimed demonstrate d that the federal and state governments preserved the hatteras island area with an understanding that vehicular passage would be accommodated,and that the vehicular passage has not been fixed to one location.
fhwa went on to state that the history indicates that the refuge,transportation facility and existing bonner bridge were concurrently and jointly planned and developed by the federal and state governments working together to preserve the land for wildlife while maintaining a means for safe and efficient vehicular transportation.the section f evaluation explained that it is fhwa revised determination that section f is not applicable to the refuge as a refuge,as the impacts resulting from relocating nc from its current alignment through the refuge would not be considered a use as defined in.fhwa concluded that it is not required to make a specific section f approval for use prior to approving the project.
on may,defendants issued an environmental that identifie d and assesse d changes that have occurred since the approval of the final environmental impact section f evaluation on september.the environmental assessment broadly described the project as the construction of a bridge to replace the herbert bonner bridge in dare county,the demolition and removal of bonner bridge,and improvements to nc between the community of rodanthe and oregon inlet.the environmental assessment was intended to provide the public with notice under nepa of the new preferred alternative,eventually titled the parallel bridge corridor with nc transportation management plan.
in approximately seven short pages of text and three maps,defendants explained that the new preferred alternative would consist of multiple phases.the first phase would be the construction of a new oregon inlet bridge as soon as possible,j,and in a slightly different location from that which had previously been evaluated.defendants clarify in their appellate brief that the replacement bridge would use the existing highway easement.appellees br.at citing.the amorphously titled later phases also sometimes referred to as the nc transportation management plan would be finalized through commitments made in the record of decision.
the environmental assessment went on to explain that,with respect to the later phases,the parallel bridge corridor with nc transportation management plan alternative preferred does not specify a particular action at this time on hatteras island beyond the limits of phase i because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future conditions within the dynamic coastal barrier island environment.rather,the alternative addresses the study and selection of future actions on hatteras island through a comprehensive nc transportation management plan.
the environmental assessment does not contain a transportation management plan as that term is typically understood rather,it contains approximately four pages that describe how the plan consists of a comprehensive coastal monitoring program,e nvironmental r eview for f uture p hases,and the s election of f uture p hases for i mplementation.defendants plan is simply to decide what to do with the remainder of nc on hatteras island at some point in the future 
defendants claimed that b y actively monitoring the conditions and delaying decisionmaking,the environmental impacts can be better quantified,minimized,and mitigated.defendants also stated that t his process is somewhat analogous to a tiered nepa study,in that the entire impacts have been studied but the detailed selection of a portion of the action is being delayed.
on december,fhwa issued a record of decision that authorized ncdot to construct,and fhwa to substantially fund,the project described in the revised section f evaluation and the environmental assessment.the record of decision explains that the project is a mix and match of the parallel bridge corridor alternatives assessed in the final environmental impact statement.it calls for phase i oregon inlet bridge to be built as soon as possible,followed by construction of later phases whose details would be determined,reevaluated,and documented through interagency collaboration as project area conditions warrant.
the record of decision also contains a section that responds to comments made by government agencies regarding the new preferred alternative.the army corps of engineers submitted a comment noting that the final environmental impact statement on which the environmental assessment was based would confine future nc maintenance in the refuge,including maintenance,to the existing nc easement,after the issuance of the record of decision for the project.defendants responded as follows 
the proposal in section of the final environmental impact statement to confine future nc maintenance activities within the existing easement applied only to the phased approach alternatives,which were developed with the requirement that all work within the refuge must be confined within the existing easement.that requirement does not exist with the nc transportation management plan.
emphasis added.
given the foregoing,this court understands the project as follows construction of a new bridge that runs parallel to the existing bonner bridge and uses the existing nc easement,followed by the study and selection of future actions on hatteras island beyond the limits of phase i through a comprehensive nc transportation management plan,with the purpose of said plan being to guide the implementation of future phases of the project through,and with future phases not necessarily confined to the existing nc easement.
plaintiffs sued on july,and the parties filed for summary judgment in july and september of.on september,the district court granted defendants motion and denied plaintiffs motion.defenders of wildlife dep t of,d.
regarding plaintiffs nepa claim,the district court explained that defendants did not violate nepa by issuing an eis that only covers the bonner bridge replacement,with future studies planned for later construction phases along the nc corridor.id.at.it also noted that the bridge project can stand alone due to concerns as to changing conditions and weather events impacting the shoreline on hatteras island.id.at.
to reach this determination,the district court analyzed whether the project violated fhwa nepa regulations pertaining to segmentation,which require that a project have logical termini and independent utility and not restrict the selection of future phases.the district court explained that the factual circumstances surrounding this case are unique,id.at,and that the northern end of hatteras island constitutes a logical terminus for the project due to the constantly changing conditions on hatteras island,id.at.the district court also stated that the project is a reasonable expenditure independent of additional transportation improvements,and that the fact that nc requires maintenance does not ruin the substantial utility of replacing a bridge that is reaching the end of its service life.id.at.finally,the district court determined that no particular action is automatically triggered in later phases by the construction of the bridge alone.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court also held that defendants did not violate section f.first,the district court determined that fhwa properly relied on the joint planning exception with respect to the refuge.id.at.the district court concluded that the f ederal and state governments preserved the hatteras island area with an understanding that vehicular passage would be accommodated,and that the vehicular passage has not been fixed to one location.id.in reaching this determination,the district court relied on the following evidence the depiction of an unimproved road through the refuge on a coast guard map a application for a ferry permit that describes ferry service beginning in photos of ferries carrying cars north carolina highway maps from and reports from the manager of the refuge that refer to a public road a senate debate in which north carolina senator willis smith asserted the state ownership of the road public law,which,in,authorized doi to grant an easement to north carolina for a road a quitclaim deed granted by north carolina to the federal government covering any interest in the land,with the exception of a previously granted foot easement and a foot easement granted by doi to north carolina in for construction and maintenance of nc.id.
the district court also briefly addressed the substantive requirements of section f and concluded that fhwa had complied with them.specifically,the district court determined that no prudent alternative existed,that the selected alternative will cause the least overall harm,and that fhwa conducted all possible planning to minimize harm.id.at.
this appeal followed.plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in its determinations regarding whether defendants engaged in improper segmentation in violation of nepa the applicability of the joint planning exception to section f and whether defendants complied with the substantive requirements of section f.we turn now to a description of the law governing these issues.
at the outset,we must correct a major error on which the district court analysis was based the district erroneously defined the scope of the project when it noted that the current environmental impact statement only covers the bonner bridge replacement,id.at.this statement contradicts the entire record,and in making it,the district court invented a project that defendants nepa documents under review expressly disown 
since at least,defendants have made plain that the purpose of the project is to p rovide a new means of access from bodie island to hatteras island for its residents,businesses,services,and tourists prior to the end of the bonner bridge service life.this purpose can not be fulfilled by the bridge alone because the entire northern part of hatteras island is occupied by the seashore and the refuge.the bridge is essentially worthless without a means of conveying motorists from its southern terminus to the village of rodanthe,which is the northernmost point where the residents,businesses,and services on hatteras island are located.see,stating in the record of decision that b uilding phase i alone would not meet the purpose and need of the project.
as defendants stated in their record of decision,the project is a mix and match of the parallel bridge corridor alternatives assessed in the final environmental impact statement.according to the record of decision,the project calls for phase i oregon inlet bridge to be built as soon as possible,followed by construction of later phases whose details would be determined,reevaluated,and documented through interagency collaboration as project area conditions warrant.
it is true that the project only definite component at this time is the construction of a parallel bridge across oregon inlet within the existing easement.beyond that,the plan is to delay,ostensibly because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future conditions within the dynamic coastal barrier island environment.nonetheless,defendants have clearly committed themselves to doing something between the southern terminus of the bridge and rodanthe they simply have not at least publicly chosen what.
one way to resolve this case would be to remand all of it to the district court with instructions to fully evaluate the actual project that defendants proposed.however,a n appellee may defend,and this court may affirm,the district court judgment on any basis supported by the record.sloas csx,cir.because both parties have adequately briefed and argued the issues using the properly defined project,we proceed to our analyses of the nepa and section f arguments in this case.

nepa does not require agencies to adopt any particular internal decisionmaking structure.balt.gas natural res.def.council.but nepa does require agencies to follow a particular decisionmaking process.for example,environmental assessments and environmental impact statements must be completed before decisions are made and before actions are taken.b see also id.c stating that the nepa process is intended to help public officials make decisions that are based on understanding of environmental consequences.
also,nepa imposes a continuing obligation on agencies to consider the environmental impacts of a proposed action,even after a final environmental impact statement has been issued.an agency must issue a supplemental environmental impact statement if the agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns or if t here are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.c i,ii.
this case implicates the regulations pertaining to illegal segmentation of the analysis of environmental impacts as well as those pertaining to the permissible tiering of the analysis of impacts.we discuss each in turn below.
agencies may not engage in segmentation,which involves an attempt to circumvent nepa by breaking up one project into smaller projects and not studying the overall impacts of the single overall project.webster dep t of,cir quoting coal.on valley nuclear wastes chu,cir.
specifically,p roposals or parts of proposals which are related to each other closely enough to be,in effect,a single course of action shall be evaluated in a single impact statement.a.proposed projects are considered connected if they i automatically trigger other actions which may require environmental impact statements ii can not or will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously or iii are interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their justification.id.a.agencies must also assess c umulative actions,and s imilar actions with common timing or geography in the same impact statement.id.a.
fhwa regulations are designed to ensure meaningful evaluation of alternatives and to avoid commitments to transportation improvements before they are fully evaluated.f.each action evaluated must 
connect logical termini and be of sufficient length to address environmental matters on a broad scope 
have independent utility or independent significance,be usable and be a reasonable expenditure even if no additional transportation improvements in the area are made and 
not restrict consideration of alternatives for other reasonably foreseeable transportation improvements.
to evaluate whether a project connects logical termini,courts look to the purpose and need of the project as stated in the environmental impact statement.see indian lookout alliance volpe,cir if the major objective of a proposal is to connect two cities by expressway,then these two termini should determine the proper scope of the environmental impact statement.additionally,logical termini are often obvious because of their connection to crossroads,population centers,major traffic generators,or similar highway control elements.conservation law found.fed.highway,f d,cir.
the independent utility test also determines whether related actions or projects must be evaluated in a single environmental impact statement.webster,at.courts inquire into whether each project would have taken place in the other absence if so,the projects have independent utility and are not considered connected actions.id.when determining whether an action has independent utility,courts consider the benefits and uses that will occur as a result of that action,even if no other construction is done in the area.for example,in james river richmond metropolitan authority,this court upheld a determination that richmond downtown expressway and i had independent utility because each segment independently allowed traffic to access parts of the downtown area and other major highways more easily,aff per curiam,cir.see also save barton creek ass fed.highway,cir holding that one portion of a highway loop had independent utility because,standing alone,the project alleviated traffic,improved access to residential,commercial,and recreational areas,and connected to major roadways.
by contrast,a tiered or multiphase nepa analysis may be appropriate for agencies that are contemplating large or complex projects.shenandoah valley network capka,cir.in fact,a gencies are encouraged to tier their environmental impact statements to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and to focus on the actual issues ripe for decision at each level of environmental review.
a properly tiered analysis consists of a broad environmental impact statement followed by a subsequent statement or environmental assessment on an action included within the program or policy contemplated in the broad statement.emphasis added.the subsequent statement shall concentrate on the issues specific to the subsequent action,and it need only summarize the issues discussed in the broader statement.id.

plaintiffs argue that defendants violated the basic principles of nepa and engaged in illegal segmentation by issuing a record of decision that disclosed only one initial segment of the selected alternative a segment that will commit them to significant future construction of a road and bridges through a national wildlife refuge while failing to disclose any specific plans for that construction.appellants br.at.
defendants counter that n othing in nepa requires an agency to authorize all phases of a proposed action evaluated in an environmental impact statement at the time it issues a record of decision.appellees br.at.they maintain that the agencies have fully analyzed the entire project in an environmental impact statement and environmental assessment,by conducting a full study of alternatives and associated impacts for the entire length of the project,from the northern limit on bodie island to the southern limit in the v illage of rodanthe and have thus not engaged in segmentation.appellees br.at.
illegal segmentation is distinct from approving only a portion of a project that has been fully and adequately studied.we agree with the eleventh circuit that nepa does not require an agency to authorize all stages of a project in one record of decision.defenders of wildlife dep t of the navy,cir.nothing in nepa prohibits defendants from authorizing only one part of the project so long as doing so does not commit them to a course of action that has not been fully analyzed.to be sure,defendants record of decision does commit resources to the project,and we perceive no reason why defendants can not analyze the entire project in a single impact statement.a.but they are not required to approve the entire project in a single record of decision so long as their nepa documents adequately analyze and disclose the impacts of the entire project including those portions that have yet to be approved.
the parties agree that the studied alternatives are feasible,that,as a matter of sound engineering judgment,they can be built.and the record shows that defendants have adequately analyzed the impacts associated with the five parallel bridge corridor alternatives that could be implemented to complete the project parallel bridge corridor with nourishment parallel bridge corridor with road south parallel bridge corridor with all bridge parallel bridge corridor with phased bridge preferred and parallel bridge corridor with phased nourishment.indeed,at oral arguments,even plaintiffs acknowledged that if defendants had issued a record of decision that committed to any any those alternatives,that action likely would have complied with nepa procedural requirements.
accordingly,at least with respect to the previously studied alternatives,defendants have neither attempted to circumvent nepa nor refused to study the overall impacts of the single overall project.webster,at internal quotation marks omitted.rather,they have conducted a full,analysis.thus,their decision to implement the project one phase at a time does not violate nepa.
plaintiffs press that the record of decision seems to authorize the construction of future phases that have not yet been analyzed and disclosed to the public.and certain aspects of the record lend support to that position.
for example,the record of decision seems to anticipate the possibility of a separate nepa process that will take place when defendants finally decide what to do with the rest of nc.and the revised section f evaluation seems to indicate that defendants are contemplating the construction of something that has not previously been studied or disclosed 
under the parallel bridge corridor with nc transportation management plan alternative,later phases of actions to manage nc through would be decided based on actual conditions existing on hatteras island at the point in time that additional action becomes necessary.these later phases could consist of,but would not be limited to,one or more components of any of the alternatives already studied as part of the environmental review process 
emphasis added.
although it is possible to read such statements as defendants attempts to commit to or authorize something outside the scope of what their nepa documents have analyzed and disclosed,that is not how we view these isolated statements made in the context of hundreds of pages of analysis.and notwithstanding that the nc transportation management plan is really nothing more than a plan to make a plan for the remainder of nc,the public is clearly on notice that defendants intend to pursue the five studied alternatives that pass through hatteras island and the the two alternatives that avoid hatteras island altogether via construction of a bridge in pamlico sound.and because defendants have fully analyzed and disclosed the environmental impacts associated with these five legitimate alternatives,defendants have complied with nepa with regard to all five.
moreover,nepa obligates agencies to continue to review the environmental consequences of their actions,and we think it is best to read defendants statements that allude to a separate nepa process simply as an acknowledgement of this requirement.if,for example,defendants wait too long to implement the future phases of the project,conditions on hatteras island could change so much that the current environmental impact statement no longer covers the alternatives that they studied.if conditions change to such an extent,defendants must issue a supplemental environmental impact statement prior to taking any other action.c i,ii.defendants statements in their environmental assessment and record of decision that seem to anticipate changing conditions can not and do not shield them from nepa procedural requirements.
in sum,defendants have not violated nepa by engaging in unlawful segmentation with respect to the five studied parallel bridge alternatives.we thus affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on the nepa issue.our opinion may not,however,be construed as an authorization to proceed outside the scope of the previously studied alternatives,and defendants doing so would almost surely violate nepa.
unlike nepa,which prohibits than action,robertson,at,section f of the department of transportation act of,imposes substantive restraints on an agency action under section f,the secretary of transportation secretary is permitted to approve a transportation project that requires the 
use of publicly owned land of a public park,recreation area,or wildlife and waterfowl refuge or land of an historic site only if there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using that land and the program or project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the publicly owned land resulting from the use.
in other words,section f property may not be put to uses unless there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of the land.coal.for responsible reg l dev.brinegar,cir further,the secretary may approve a transportation project that uses section f property only if the program or project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the wildlife and waterfowl refuge.c.
the secretary must perform a section f evaluation and comply with that provision other substantive requirements before approving any use of section f property.the same is not required,however,if the joint planning exception applies.under the joint planning exception,
w hen a property is formally reserved for a future transportation facility before or at the same time a section f property is established and concurrent or joint planning or development of the transportation facility and the section f resource occurs,then any resulting impacts of the transportation facility will not be considered a use as defined in.
i.in other words,for a transportation facility that uses section f property to escape the substantive requirements of section f,two conditions must be met.first,the property for the transportation facility must be formally reserved before or at the same time as the establishment of the section f property.id.second,the transportation facility and the section f property must be concurrently or jointly planned or developed.id.
if section f property will be used and no exception applies,the secretary must show that the project includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the section f property and that no prudent and feasible alternatives are available.c.
the all possible planning prong of the analysis can not be met until a project design is complete.see fed of civic ass ns volpe.if all possible planning to minimize harm to the section f property has not been completed before the secretary approval of the project,the section f evaluation is invalid because,a bsent a finalized plan,it is hard to see how the department could make a meaningful evaluation of harm.id.
the secretary must also find that there is no prudent and feasible alternative to using the section f property.c.an alternative is infeasible only when it can not be built as a matter of sound engineering judgment.see also overton park,at.
to find an alternative to using section f property imprudent,the secretary must determine that the impacts or adverse effects associated with that alternative are extraordinary or unique.see id.at.the secretary regulations explain that an alternative is imprudent if 
i it compromises the project to a degree that it is unreasonable to proceed with the project in light of its stated purpose and need 
ii it results in unacceptable safety or operational problems 
iii after reasonable mitigation,it still causes 
a severe social,economic,or environmental impacts 
b severe disruption to established communities 
c severe disproportionate impacts to minority or low income populations or 
d severe impacts to environmental resources protected under other federal statutes 
iv it results in additional construction,maintenance,or operational costs of an extraordinary magnitude 
v it causes other unique problems or unusual factors or 
vi it involves multiple factors that while individually minor,cumulatively cause unique problems or impacts of extraordinary magnitude.
imprudence may not provide cover for using section f land unless there are truly unusual factors present in a particular case or the cost or community disruption resulting from alternative routes reach extraordinary magnitudes.hickory neighborhood def.league,at quoting overton park,at.see also,monroe cnty.conservation council,at a road must not take parkland,unless a prudent person,concerned with the quality of the human environment,is convinced that there is no way to avoid doing so.footnote omitted.and a state may not use restrictions on financing mechanisms to render an alternative imprudent.coal.for responsible reg l,at.
the secretary section f evaluation of the entire project must be completed before the record of decision is issued and before work on the project begins.corridor h alternatives,slater,see also a the potential use of land from a section f property shall be evaluated as early as practicable when alternatives to the proposed action are under study.
further,the secretary may not reduce the number of prudent and feasible alternatives that are available by fragmenting the evaluation and approval of a single project into separate parts.instead,the secretary must evaluate each project as a whole,not.idaho cmty.action network dep t of,cir.the secretary determination that there are no feasible and prudent alternatives must include sufficient supporting documentation to demonstrate why there is no feasible and prudent avoidance alternative and shall summarize the results of all possible planning.a.
if there are no feasible and prudent alternatives to using section f property,the secretary may select only the alternative that c auses the least overall harm in light of section f preservation purpose.c.this determination involves balancing several factors,including the ability to mitigate adverse impacts the relative severity of the harm after mitigation the relative significance of the section f property the views of the official s with jurisdiction over each section f property the degree to which each alternative meets the purpose and need for the project a fter reasonable mitigation,the magnitude of any adverse impacts to resources not protected by section f and s ubstantial differences in costs among the alternatives.c.c i vii.
in reviewing an agency section f determination,we must conduct a thorough,probing,indepth review to ensure that the secretary determination complies with section f requirements.monroe cnty.conservation council,at internal quotation marks omitted.first,we consider whether the secretary acted within the scope of his or her authority when conducting the section f evaluation.overton park,at.this requires examining whether the secretary could have reasonably believed that no feasible and prudent alternatives to using section f property existed.id.at.second,the reviewing court must consider whether the secretary choice to use section f property was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.quoting administrative procedure act,a.this determination requires us to review whether the secretary decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether the factors actually support the secretary determination.hickory neighborhood def.league,at internal quotation marks omitted.finally,we must also determine whether the secretary followed all procedural requirements.overton park,at.
plaintiffs contend that the district court erroneously applied the joint planning exception to the project.they argue that when the refuge was created,nc had not yet been formally reserved and that it was not jointly or concurrently planned.
because the joint planning exception applies only when a transportation facility is formally reserved before or at the same time,as a section f property,i,the only relevant evidence is that which sheds light on the status of nc on or before april,the date of the executive order establishing the refuge.yet some of the evidence on which the district court relied in deeming the joint planning exception applicable the coast guard map,the north carolina highway maps from and,the senate debate,the public law from authorizing doi to grant an easement to north carolina,the quitclaim deed,and the easement prove nothing about the status of nc when the refuge was established.in other words,this evidence is wholly insufficient to support the application of the joint planning exception here.
all we are left with,then,is a application for a ferry permit that describes ferry service beginning in,photos of ferries carrying cars,and some reports from the refuge man
