the issue is whether a decision by the commissioner of elementary and secondary education of massachusetts to revise an advisory curriculum guide by deleting his own earlier revision in response to political pressure violated the first amendment.we hold that it did not and affirm the judgment of the district court.
the facts in the plaintiffs complaint,taken as true,see barrington cove.hous.mortgage fin,cir,together with documents attached and cited,see stein royal bank of canada,cir,tell the following story.a massachusetts statute required the state board of elementary and secondary education to formulate recommendations on curricular material on genocide and human rights issues,and guidelines for the teaching of such material.acts.the law instructed the board to consult with practicing educators,as well as experts knowledgeable in such issues and provided a list of topics for possible consideration,including the armenian genocide.the final product was to be filed with legislative officials not later than march,and made available to all school districts in the commonwealth on an advisory basis.
on january,the commissioner,appellee david driscoll,circulated a draft of the massachusetts guide to choosing and using curricular materials on genocide and human rights issues to members of the board for review and comment.the commissioner is the secretary to the board,its chief executive officer and the chief state school officer for elementary and secondary education,but he is subject to the board authority,being removable by a majority vote.laws ch.driscoll draft guide explicitly referred to the armenian genocide,provided references to a number of relevant teaching resources,and stated by way of background information that the muslim turkish ottoman empire destroyed large portions of its christian armenian minority population in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
four days after the draft guide circulated,a local turkish cultural group asked driscoll and the board to revise the guide to present what they considered to be a more objective study of history by including references to the perspective,according to which the fate of ottoman armenians did not reflect a policy of genocide.this group along with others representing different constituencies also addressed the board at a public meeting held on january.
as a consequence,a number of changes were made to the guide,including the addition of citations to several resources arguing the thesis and the deletion of the background information the revised version of the guide was submitted to legislative officials on march,as the statute directed.driscoll cover letter indicated that the board had reviewed the guide and voted to accept it at the january meeting 
attempts to change the guide did not stop.in june,representatives of armenian descendants in massachusetts asked the governor in a letter to remove references to sources,and before the month was out,driscoll issued a second revised version of the guide this new revision was shorn of all references to turkish websites,except for that of the turkish embassy,in what the plaintiffs describe as an obviou s,if incomplete,attempt to appease the political opposition to anything appearing to be turkish.in response to the predictable complaint from turkish groups,driscoll and the chairman of the board,appellee james peyser,replied that the legislative language required the board to address the armenian genocide and not to debate whether or not it occurred.they took the position,accordingly,that the guide could not refer to any source calling the genocide into question,including the previously listed website of the turkish embassy.
the most recent version of the guide instructs that c urriculum,instruction,and classroom assessment about genocide and human rights issues should be based on factual content aligned with the material in the massachusetts curriculum framework.it lists relevant main topics from the history and social science framework,and subtopics including the armenian genocide.the guide advises that a lthough some relevant information is contained in textbooks,teachers wishing to explore these topics must find further information from other sources,and it concludes with a list of organizations,presumably intended as possible sources.the list includes the children museum in boston,amnesty international,and the united nations.several armenian groups are listed no turkish organization is.
the appellants,a collection of students,parents,teachers,and the assembly of turkish american associations ataa,one of the turkish groups that had complained to driscoll,filed this suit in.their complaint alleged that revisions to the guide made after its submission to legislative officials that is,the removal of the references violated their first amendment rights to inquire,teach and learn free from viewpoint discrimination in the case of the students and parents and to speak in the case of the ataa,whose website was removed from the revised guide.the district court dismissed the complaint.the court first held that ataa claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations,see poy boutselis,cir,because the alleged violation of its rights occurred in when its website was removed from the guide.the district court then held that the guide was a form of government speech and,as such,exempt from first amendment scrutiny.the court understood this conclusion to resolve overlapping questions of both the individual plaintiffs standing and the merits of their constitutional challenge.we affirm the district court,although our reasoning differs slightly at times.
first,we agree with the district court that ataa suit is.ataa does not claim a right to have its website included in the guide it says,rather,that the website,once included,could not be excised to further a political agenda.the allegedly unconstitutional action therefore occurred in when the website was removed.the appellants subsequent refusal to take further action to reverse that decision establishes neither an ongoing policy and practice nor an independent act of excis ion.tobin liberty mut.ins,cir.
second,as for the issue of individual plaintiffs standing,we see this as a case in which the dispositive questions of standing and statement of cognizable claim are difficult to disentangle.see mcconnell fec,overruled on other grounds,citizens united fec.warth seldin.if one sees the complaint as pleading a first amendment library claim that may or may not ultimately be supported by evidence about the curriculum guide,the opportunity for a distinct analysis of standing is clear.but we think the equally straightforward reading is that of a curriculum guide claim that should be treated like one about a library,in which case pleading cognizable injury and stating a cognizable claim resist distinction.we therefore think it prudent to dispose of both standing and merits issues together.
the briefing and argument have urged two competing metaphors upon us,with contrasting constitutional implications that the guide is a virtual school library established for the benefit of students as well as teachers and its contrary,that the guide is an element of the curriculum itself.while neither figure of speech fits exactly,we think classification of the guide as part of the state curriculum is the better choice.
the library metaphor,if accepted,would subject the decision to remove the references to material to first amendment review under board of education,island trees union free school district pico.there,a local board of education instructed the school superintendent to cull certain books from high school and junior high school libraries under circumstances suggesting that the order was based more on patriotism and religion than educational suitability.students brought an action claiming that the mandated removal interfered with a first amendment right of access to ideas free of interference from political pressure exerted through administrative authority above the school level.id.at opinion of brennan.a fragmented majority affirmed an appellate order that the case proceed to trial,contrary to the dist
