appellants are four employees of the puerto rico department of education who claim that they were unconstitutionally demoted in based on their political affiliation.they brought this suit against the department of education and its secretary,césar rey hernández rey,a member of the popular democratic party pdp appellants,all members of the new progressive party npp,were removed from trust positions and reassigned to their preexisting career employee status within days after rey assumed his position following the pdp electoral victory the district court granted summary judgment for defendants,concluding that appellants failed to offer sufficient admissible evidence to establish a prima facie case of political discrimination.although the record is meager and the case is therefore close,we conclude that appellants met their burden to generate a genuine issue of material fact on the elements of their claim.accordingly,we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
defendant rey took over as secretary of education at the beginning of january shortly thereafter,he sent letters notifying the plaintiffs that,effective january,their current trust appointments would cease and they would be reinstated to their previous career positions the letters gave no reason for the changes.before the transfers,plaintiff ivonne montfort was director of the center of investigations and ethnographic innovations,plaintiff juanita flores was facilitator of the education reform institute for the san juan region,plaintiff carmen rivera was director of the puerto rico statewide systemic initiative for science and mathematics,and plaintiff maría coss was director of the physical education program.the reassignments resulted in lower salaries for all four plaintiffs.
rey testified in his deposition that when he took over as secretary he asked lizzette pillich otero,the newly appointed assistant secretary for human resources,to prepare a list of the department trust employees so that he would have an idea of how many trust positions there were.neither rey nor pillich examined personnel files in compiling the list and rey testified that he had no knowledge of the particular job responsibilities for any plaintiff.in his deposition,rey gave the following explanation for generating the list and eliminating positions 
positions in the organigram sic were evaluated based on the need and based in the necessity.in fact,we evaluated all the organigram of the whole organization,not just the trust positions,we the whole administration 
rey also stated in his deposition that he was unaware of plaintiffs political affiliations.plaintiffs maintain that he must have known their npp status because their involvement in the party was common knowledge throughout the department and their trust positions during the prior npp administration circumstantially revealed their affiliation with that party.plaintiffs further assert that they were replaced by members of the pdp,although that allegation is based partially on hearsay 
the defendants motion for summary judgment was referred to a magistrate judge,whose report and recommendation concluded that the plaintiffs evidence was inadequate to survive defendants motion for summary judgment because some of the facts essential to a finding of political rey knew plaintiffs political affiliations and replaced them with members of his own supported only by speculation or hearsay.the district court agreed that plaintiffs had not met their burden to establish a prima facie case of political discrimination,having failed to provide admissible evidence,either direct or circumstantial,of political discrimination on the part of defendants.accordingly,the court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case with prejudice the court subsequently denied plaintiffs motion to alter or amend judgment 
standard of review and burden of proof 
we review the district court summary judgment ruling de novo,taking the record facts and all inferences to be drawn from them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the record reveals no genuine issue as to any material fact,and the undisputed facts establish the moving party entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.c.a genuine issue is one that may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party at trial,conlon,cir quoting garside osco drug,cir,and s ummary judgment should be granted only where further inquiry into the facts is not desirable to clarify the application of the law,mandel boston phoenix,cir quoting stevens howard johnson,cir.
it is well established that g overnmental employees who are not in positions of confidence are shielded from adverse employment decisions based on their political affiliations.borges colón,cir see also rutan republican party of,d.given that defendants do not argue on appeal that plaintiffs were policymakers whose job responsibilities require political compatibility with the pdp administration,we focus on whether a jury could infer from the evidence that rey knew of the plaintiffs political affiliation and replaced them because of it see molina,cir to establish a prima facie case,a plaintiff must show that party affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind a challenged employment action,cir noting requirement of sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably may infer that plaintiff constitutionally protected this case,political affiliation with the a substantial or motivating factor behind her dismissal quoting aponte,cir,vacated and remanded on other grounds,d family dep t,cir.plaintiffs have the burden of proving the link between their adverse treatment and their politics.santiago,cir.
with these parameters in mind,we consider the evidence thus far developed by the parties.
assessing the prima facie showing of political discrimination 
defendants urge us to accept the magistrate judge conclusion that the evidence presented by plaintiffs is inadequate to show either rey knowledge of their politics or a deliberate decision to remove them based on their npp status.defendants further assert that even the plaintiffs evidence reveals that the jobs they previously held were modified after their that the motivation behind the transfers was not impermissible political discrimination,but a permissible streamlining of the department operations.they specifically invoke the changeover defense,which relies on the prerogative of newly elected officials to make politically neutral changes to improve departmental operations after a careful study of existing personnel and business practices.members of the outgoing administration political party inevitably will be affected by such changes.see,borges colón,at noting that the effect of a new administration policy choices may fall most heavily on the party that has lost power,cir en banc.
although the changeover defense ultimately may prevail,our close review of the record reveals an adequate circumstantial basis for concluding both that rey was aware of plaintiffs political allegiance to the npp and that plaintiffs were replaced with pdp loyalists.most significantly,the record lacks evidence of a considered appraisal of jobs and responsibilities that could substantiate a changeover defense.on this both its contents and its believe a jury reasonably could find political discrimination.
the evidence of political affiliation 
although plaintiffs have produced no direct evidence that rey was aware of their affiliation with the npp,the record contains circumstantial evidence that could support such a finding.pillich testified that she believed all of the trust positions on the list that she compiled for rey,including those held by plaintiffs,were occupied by individuals appointed by the prior administration because the last administration was there for eight years.this statement supports the inference that pillich assumed the individuals in those positions probably were affiliated with the former npp administration.this is particularly so given that pillich further indicated that political affiliation with the newly elected pdp administration may be one of the factors necessary for those trust positions to ensure that the individuals in the jobs could collaborate in th e educational project of the new administration although pillich emphasized that political affiliation was not a determining factor,her testimony at least suggests that plaintiffs were identified as npp members and were subject to removal for that reason it is a small inferential step from pillich testimony to rey own knowledge.that is,we think it fair to infer that rey,a pdp political appointee who asked pillich to generate the list of trust employees as soon as he took over the department,shared pillich assumptions regarding the affiliations of all incumbents 
taken in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,pillich deposition testimony also inferentially supports plaintiffs allegation that all of the npp trust employees identified on the list that she compiled were replaced by pdp members who could be counted on to collaborate in the new administration educational project.pillich insisted that loyal party members were needed to support plaintiffs positions.interestingly,defendants offered no evidence to rebut such an implication,despite the fact that such evidence would probably be obtainable from the replacements identified by the plaintiffs.unlike cases in which we have noted the plaintiffs failure to provide the names of their replacements,see,at,cir,the plaintiffs here have done so.
circumstantial evidence of motivation 
in seeking to justify plaintiffs removals as part of a natural transition from one administration to the changeover attempt to downplay the significance of the plaintiffs political affiliation and that of their successors.this effort falters on the record before us.plaintiffs were reassigned to their lower level career positions,without explanation,about a week after rey assumed the secretary role.although rey stated in his deposition that the positions in the organization were evaluated based on need,the record contains no than rey bald assertion that we the whole administration of a considered plan to restructure the department of education.both rey and pillich acknowledged that,at the time the changes were made,they knew neither what plaintiffs duties were nor how well they had performed their jobs see,at in evaluating the changeover defense,the factfinder should take into account,inter alia,whether the actions occurred precipitately or after some opportunity for appraisal,whether they seem connected with previously announced goals,and whether they flowed from an organizational or procedural study.footnote omitted.
the quick terminations,with no attention to either job functions or performances,are strongly suggestive of pure political motivation.see id.at c hanges made within days of a new administration ascent to power ordinarily would be more likely to reflect an improper political housecleaning than would changes made months later,after the new officials have had a chance to evaluate how to reorganize their departments to best meet their policy goals.indeed,the record permits an inference that the defendants mistakenly believed they could demote all npp trust employees without regard to their policymaking functions.moreover,the evidence was equivocal as to whether the nature of plaintiffs positions changed after they were removed,permitting a jury to conclude on this record that the personnel actions were made for political reasons rather than to improve efficiency.there was some evidence of task realignment montfort former secretary testified in her deposition that the office functioned differently b ecause now it the director who makes the decisions not like it was done before.in addition,flores stated that the institute that she led does operate as before.however,flores also observed that her old work team is carrying out the same functions that she performed.her secretary agreed,testifying that flores successor does not do things the same way as flores,but that s he has the same functions.
the absence of evidence of a comprehensive or carefully studied effort at reform distinguishes this case from a number of others in which we have rejected claims of political discrimination following a change in administration.for example,in,the defendant had directed an investigator to conduct an audit of all recent employment actions to evaluate their compliance with department regulations.we concluded there that it did not matter that npp members were heavily affected 
i f uniformly applied personnel practices,predicated on legitimate reasons,result in terminations,those terminations are not unconstitutional because those affiliated with one political party are disproportionately impacted.it is in the nature of a change in administration that job actions by the new party will have a disparate impact on members of the outgoing party.

summary of evidence 
in sum,the admissible evidence and the plausible inferences that a jury could draw from it suffice to meet appellants burden to show a genuine factual dispute as to whether rey knew of their npp affiliation and replaced them with his political allies based solely on that association.the deposition testimony of rey and pillich,when viewed in context,renders this case more circumstantial than speculative.see,at w here the plaintiffs were all members of the adverse party their superiors knew this,and their duties were given to active supporters of the party in power,we found there was ample evidence for the plaintiffs case to avoid summary judgment.quoting,cir,at recognizing that a prima facie case for political discrimination may be built on circumstantial evidence so long as plaintiffs have generated the specific facts necessary to take the asserted claim out of the realm of speculative,general allegations quoting kauffman,cir.the evidence here,though thin,point s in different directions that is,it tend s to support conflicting inferences.summary judgment can not be predicated on so vacillatory a record.mandel,at see also in re varrasso,cir holding that a court faced with competing plausible inferences may not make its choice under the banner of summary judgment.
