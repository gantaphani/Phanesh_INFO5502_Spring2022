in,arizona voters adopted proposition,an initiative aimed at the problem of gerrymandering.proposition amended arizona constitution,removing redistricting authority from the arizona legislature and vesting it in an independent commission,the arizona independent redistricting commission airc.after the census,as after the census,the airc adopted redistricting maps for congressional as well as state legislative districts.the arizona legislature challenged the map the commission adopted in for congressional districts,arguing that the airc and its map violated the elections clause of the constitution,which provides the times,places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations.because legislature means the state representative assembly,the arizona legislature contended,the clause precludes resort to an independent commission,created by initiative,to accomplish redistricting.a district court held that the arizona legislature had standing to sue,but rejected its complaint on the merits.
the arizona legislature has standing to bring this suit.in claiming that proposition stripped it of its alleged constitutional prerogative to engage in redistricting and that its injury would be remedied by a court order enjoining the proposition enforcement,the legislature has shown injury that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,arizonans for official english arizona,fairly traceable to the challenged action,and redressable by a favorable ruling,clapper amnesty int l usa.specifically,proposition,together with the arizona constitution ban on efforts by the arizona legislature to undermine the purposes of an initiative,would completely nullif y any vote by the legislature,now or in the future,purporting to adopt a redistricting plan.raines byrd.
the elections clause and c permit arizona use of a commission to adopt congressional districts.
a redistricting is a legislative function to be performed in accordance with the state prescriptions for lawmaking,which may include the referendum,ohio ex rel.davis hildebrant,and the governor veto,smiley holm.while exercise of the initiative was not at issue in this court prior decisions,there is no constitutional barrier to a state empowerment of its people by embracing that form of lawmaking.
b title c which provides that,u ntil a state is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof after any apportionment,it must follow federally prescribed redistricting procedures permits redistricting in accord with arizona initiative.from through,apportionment acts required a state to follow federal procedures unless the state legislature drew district lines.in,congress,recognizing that states had supplemented the representative legislature mode of lawmaking with a direct lawmaking role for the people,replaced the reference to redistricting by the state legislature with a reference to redistricting of a state in the manner provided by the laws thereof.stat.the act legislative history leaves no doubt,hildebrant,at,that the change was made to safeguard to each state full authority to employ in the creation of congressional districts its own laws and regulations.cong.rec.if they include the initiative,it is included.at.congress used virtually identical language in enacting c in.this provision also accords full respect to the redistricting procedures adopted by the states.thus,so long as a state has redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof as arizona did by utilizing the independent commission procedure in its constitution the resulting redistricting plan becomes the presumptively governing map.
though four of c five default redistricting procedures operative only when a state is not redistricted in the manner provided by state law have become obsolete as a result of this court decisions embracing the,principle,this infirmity does not bear on the question whether a state has been redistricted in the manner provided by state law.
c the elections clause permits the people of arizona to provide for redistricting by independent commission.the history and purpose of the clause weigh heavily against precluding the people of arizona from creating a commission operating independently of the state legislature to establish congressional districts.such preclusion would also run up against the constitution animating principle that the people themselves are the originating source of all the powers of government.
the dominant purpose of the elections clause,the historical record bears out,was to empower congress to override state election rules,not to restrict the way states enact legislation.see inter tribal council of,at.ratification arguments in support of congressional oversight focused on potential abuses by state politicians,but the legislative processes by which the states could exercise their initiating role in regulating congressional elections occasioned no debate.
there is no suggestion that the election clause,by specifying the legislature thereof,required assignment of congressional redistricting authority to the state representative body.it is characteristic of the federal system that states retain autonomy to establish their own governmental processes free from incursion by the federal government.see,alden maine.through the structure of its government,and the character of those who exercise government authority,a state defines itself as a sovereign.gregory ashcroft.arizona engaged in definition of that kind when its people placed both the initiative power and the airc redistricting authority in the portion of the arizona constitution delineating the state legislative authority,art.iv.the elections clause should not be read to single out federal elections as the one area in which states may not use citizen initiatives as an alternative legislative process.and reading the clause to permit the use of the initiative to control state and local elections but not federal elections would deprive several states of the convenience of having the elections for their own governments and for the national government held at the same times and places,and in the same manner.the federalist,hamilton.
the framers may not have imagined the modern initiative process in which the people legislative power is coextensive with the state legislature authority,but the invention of the initiative was in full harmony with the constitution conception of the people as the font of governmental power.it would thus be perverse to interpret legislature in the elections clause to exclude lawmaking by the people,particularly when such lawmaking is intended to advance the prospect that members of congress will in fact be chosen by the people of the several states,art.i.
banning lawmaking by initiative to direct a state method of apportioning congressional districts would not just stymie attempts to curb gerrymandering.it would also cast doubt on numerous other time,place,and manner regulations governing federal elections that states have adopted by the initiative method.as well,it could endanger election provisions in state constitutions adopted by conventions and ratified by voters at the ballot box,without involvement or approval by the legislature.

a district court held,unanimously,that the arizona legislature had standing to sue dividing two to one,the court rejected the legislature complaint on the merits.we postponed jurisdiction and instructed the parties to address two questions does the arizona legislature have standing to bring this suit do the elections clause of the united states constitution and c permit arizona use of a commission to adopt congressional districts.
we now affirm the district court judgment.we hold,first,that the arizona legislature,having lost authority to draw congressional districts,has standing to contest the constitutionality of proposition.next,we hold that lawmaking power in arizona includes the initiative process,and that both c and the elections clause permit use of the airc in congressional districting in the same way the commission is used in districting for arizona own legislature.

several other states,as a means to curtail partisan gerrymandering,have also provided for the participation of commissions in redistricting.some states,in common with arizona,have given nonpartisan or bipartisan commissions binding authority over redistricting the california redistricting commission,established by popular initiative,develops redistricting plans which become effective if approved by public referendum still other states have given commissions an auxiliary role,advising the legislatures on redistricting or serving as a backup in the event the state representative body fails to complete redistricting studies report that nonpartisan and bipartisan commissions generally draw their maps in a timely fashion and create districts both more competitive and more likely to survive legal challenge.see miller grofman,redistricting commissions in the western united states,irvine.
on january,the airc approved final congressional and state legislative maps based on the census.see arizona independent redistricting,final maps,all internet materials as visited june,and included in clerk of court case file.less than four months later,on june,the arizona legislature filed suit in the united states district court for the district of arizona,naming as defendants the airc,its five members,and the arizona secretary of state.the legislature sought both a declaration that proposition and congressional maps adopted by the airc are unconstitutional,and,as affirmative relief,an injunction against use of airc maps for any congressional election after the general election.

we turn first to the threshold question does the arizona legislature have standing to bring this suit trained on whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a particular lawsuit,standing is o ne element of the constitution limitation on federal judicial authority,expressed in article iii of the constitution.raines byrd.to qualify as a party with standing to litigate,the arizona legislature must show,first and foremost,injury in the form of invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent.arizonans for official english arizona,quoting lujan defenders of wildlife.the legislature injury also must be fairly traceable to the challenged action and redressable by a favorable ruling.clapper amnesty int l usa,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the arizona legislature maintains that the elections clause vests in it primary responsibility for redistricting.brief for appellant.to exercise that responsibility,the legislature urges,it must have at least the opportunity to engage or decline to engage in redistricting before the state may involve other actors in the redistricting process.see,at.proposition,which gives the airc binding authority over redistricting,regardless of the legislature action or inaction,strips the legislature of its alleged prerogative to initiate redistricting.that asserted deprivation would be remedied by a court order enjoining the enforcement of proposition.although we conclude that the arizona legislature does not have the exclusive,constitutionally guarded role it asserts,see infra,at,one must not confus e weakness on the merits with absence of article iii standing.davis united states,slip,at,see warth seldin,standing often turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted,but it in no way depends on the merits of the claim.
the airc argues that the legislature alleged injury is insufficiently concrete to meet the standing requirement absent some specific legislative act that would have taken effect but for proposition.brief for appellees.the united states,as amicus curiae,urges that even more is needed the legislature injury will remain speculative,the united states contends,unless and until the arizona secretary of state refuses to implement a competing redistricting plan passed by the legislature.brief for united states.in our view,the arizona legislature suit is not premature,nor is its alleged injury too conjectural or hypothetical to establish standing.defenders of wildlife,at internal quotation marks omitted.
two prescriptions of arizona constitution would render the legislature passage of a competing plan and submission of that plan to the secretary of state unavailing.indeed,those actions would directly and immediately conflict with the regime arizona constitution establishes.sporhase nebraska ex rel.douglas,failure to apply for permit which would not have been granted under existing law did not deprive plaintiffs of standing to challenge permitting regime.first,the arizona constitution instructs that the legislature shall not have the power to adopt any measure that supersedes an initiative,in whole or in part,unless the superseding measure furthers the purposes of the initiative.art.iv,pt.any redistricting map passed by the legislature in an effort to supersede the airc map surely would not furthe r the purposes of proposition.second,once the airc certifies its redistricting plan to the secretary of state,arizona constitution requires the secretary to implement that plan and no other.see art.iv,pt,arizona minority coalition for fair redistricting arizona independent redistricting comm n,app.per curiam once the commission certifies its maps,the secretary of state must use them in conducting the next election.to establish standing,the legislature need not violate the arizona constitution and show that the secretary of state would similarly disregard the state fundamental instrument of government.
raines byrd,does not aid airc argument that there is no standing here.in raines,this court held that six individual members of congress lacked standing to challenge the line item veto act,at,holding specifically and only that individual members of congress lack article iii standing the act,which gave the president authority to cancel certain spending and tax benefit measures after signing them into law,allegedly diluted the efficacy of the congressmembers votes,at.the institutional injury at issue,we reasoned,scarcely zeroed in on any individual member,at.w idely dispersed,the alleged injury necessarily impacted all members of congress and both houses equally.at.none of the plaintiffs,therefore,could tenably claim a personal stake in the suit,at.
in concluding that the individual members lacked standing,the court attach ed some importance to the fact that the raines plaintiffs had not been authorized to represent their respective houses of congress.at.i ndeed,the court observed,both houses actively oppose d their suit.ibid.having failed to prevail in their own houses,the suitors could not repair to the judiciary to complain.the arizona legislature,in contrast,is an institutional plaintiff asserting an institutional injury,and it commenced this action after authorizing votes in both of its chambers,app.that different circumstanc e,at,was not sub judice in raines 
closer to the mark is this court decision in coleman miller.there,plaintiffs were of kansas state senators,whose votes would have been sufficient to defeat a resolution ratifying a proposed federal constitutional amendment.at we held they had standing to challenge,as impermissible under article v of the federal constitution,the state lieutenant governor vote for the amendment.ibid.coleman,as we later explained in raines,stood for the proposition that legislators whose votes would have been sufficient to defeat or enact a specific legislative act have standing to sue if that legislative action goes into effect or does not go into effect,on the ground that their votes have been completely nullified.at our conclusion that the arizona legislature has standing fits that bill.proposition,together with the arizona constitution ban on efforts to undermine the purposes of an initiative,see supra,at,would completely nullif y any vote by the legislature,now or in the future,purporting to adopt a redistricting plan.raines,at 
this dispute,in short,will be resolved in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.valley forge christian college americans united for separation of church and state,accordingly,we proceed to the merits 
on the merits,we instructed the parties to address this question do the elections clause of the united states constitution and c permit arizona use of a commission to adopt congressional districts the elections clause is set out at the start of this opinion,supra,at.section c provides 
until a state is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof after any apportionment,the representatives to which such state is entitled under such apportionment shall be elected in the following manner setting out five federally prescribed redistricting procedures.
before focusing directly on the statute and constitutional prescriptions in point,we summarize this court precedent relating to appropriate state decisionmakers for redistricting purposes.three decisions compose the relevant case law ohio ex rel.davis hildebrant,hawke smith,and smiley holm.
davis hildebrant involved an amendment to the constitution of ohio vesting in the people the right,exercisable by referendum,to approve or disapprove by popular vote any law enacted by the state legislature.a act redistricting the state for the purpose of congressional elections had been submitted to a popular vote,resulting in disapproval of the legislature measure.state election officials asked the state supreme court to declare the referendum void.that court rejected the request,holding that the referendum authorized by ohio constitution,was a part of the legislative power of the state,and nothing in federal statutory law or in the elections clause operated to the contrary.at.this court affirmed the ohio supreme court judgment.in upholding the state court decision,we recognized that the referendum was part of the legislative power in ohio,legitimately exercised by the people to disapprove the legislation creating congressional districts.for redistricting purposes,hildebrant thus established,the legislature did not mean the representative body alone.rather,the word encompassed a veto power lodged in the people.see,at elections clause does not bar treating the referendum as part of the legislative power for the purpose of apportionment,where so ordained by the state constitutions and laws 
hawke smith involved the eighteenth amendment to the federal constitution.ohio legislature had ratified the amendment,and a referendum on that ratification was at issue.reversing the ohio supreme court decision upholding the referendum,we held that ratification by a state of a constitutional amendment is not an act of legislation within the proper sense of the word.at.instead,article v governing ratification had lodged in the legislatures of of the several states sole authority to assent to a proposed amendment,at.the court contrasted the ratifying function,exercisable exclusively by a state legislature,with the ordinary business of legislation.at.davis hildebrant,the court explained,involved the enactment of legislation,a redistricting plan,and properly held that the referendum was part of the legislative authority of the state for that purpose.at.
smiley holm raised the question whether legislation purporting to redistrict minnesota for congressional elections was subject to the governor veto.the minnesota supreme court had held that the elections clause placed redistricting authority exclusively in the hands of the state legislature,leaving no role for the governor.we reversed that determination and held,for the purpose at hand,minnesota legislative authority includes not just the two houses of the legislature it includes,in addition,a role for the governor.in holding that the governor veto counted,we distinguished instances in which the constitution calls upon state legislatures to exercise a function other than lawmaking.state legislatures,we pointed out,performed an electoral function in the choice of united states senators under article i,section,prior to the adoption of the seventeenth amendment,a ratifying function for proposed amendments to the constitution under article v,as explained in hawke smith,and a consenting function in relation to the acquisition of lands by the united states under article i,section,paragraph.at.
in contrast to those other functions,we observed,redistricting involves lawmaking in its essential features and most important aspect.at.lawmaking,we further noted,ordinarily must be in accordance with the method which the state has prescribed for legislative enactments.at.in minnesota,the state constitution had made the governor part of the legislative process.at.and the elections clause,we explained,respected the state choice to include the governor in that process,although the governor could play no part when the constitution assigned to the legislature a ratifying,electoral,or consenting function.nothing in the elections clause,we said,attempt ed to endow the legislature of the state with power to enact laws in any manner other than that in which the constitution of the state ha d provided that laws shall be enacted.at.
the chief justice,in dissent,features,indeed trumpets repeatedly,the amendment regime in which senators were chosen in each state by the legislature thereof.art.i,see post,at.if we are right,he asks,why did popular election proponents resort to the amending process instead of simply interpreting the legislature to mean the people post,at.smiley,as just indicated,answers that question.article i,gave state legislatures a function different from that of lawgiver,at it made each of them an electoral body charged to perform that function to the exclusion of other participants,ibid.so too,of the ratifying function.as we explained in hawke,the power to legislate in the enactment of the laws of a state is derived from the people of the state.at.ratification,however,has its source in the federal constitution and is not an act of legislation within the proper sense of the word.at.
constantly resisted by the chief justice,but well understood in opinions that speak for the court t he meaning of the word legislature,used several times in the federal constitution,differs according to the connection in which it is employed,depend ent upon the character of the function which that body in each instance is called upon to exercise.atlantic cleaners dyers,united states,citing smiley.thus the legislature comprises the referendum and the governor veto in the context of regulating congressional elections.hildebrant,see supra,at smiley,see supra,at.in the context of ratifying constitutional amendments,in contrast,the legislature has a different identity,one that excludes the referendum and the governor veto.hawke,see supra,at 
in sum,our precedent teaches that redistricting is a legislative function,to be performed in accordance with the state prescriptions for lawmaking,which may include the referendum and the governor veto.the exercise of the initiative,we acknowledge,was not at issue in our prior decisions.but as developed below,we see no constitutional barrier to a state empowerment of its people by embracing that form of lawmaking.
we take up next the statute the court asked the parties to address,c,a measure modeled on the reapportionment act congress passed in,act of act,ch,stat.section c,we hold,permits use of a commission to adopt arizona congressional districts.see supra,at 
from through,the decennial congressional apportionment acts provided that a state would be required to follow federally prescribed procedures for redistricting unless the legislature of the state drew district lines,act of july,ch,stat.act of,ch,stat.in drafting the act,congress focused on the fact that several states had supplemented the representative legislature mode of lawmaking with a direct lawmaking role for the people,through the processes of initiative positive legislation by the electorate and referendum approval or disapproval of legislation by the electorate.cong.rec.statement of burton see supra,at.to accommodate that development,the act eliminated the statutory reference to redistricting by the state legislature and instead directed that,if a state apportionment of representatives increased,the state should use the act default procedures for redistricting until such state shall be redistricted in the manner provided by the laws thereof.ch,stat.emphasis added 
some members of congress questioned whether the language change was needed.in their view,existing apportionment legislation referring to redistricting by a state legislature suffic ed to allow,whatever the law of the state may be,the people of that state to control redistricting.cong.rec.statement of shively shiel thayer,bartlett contested election cases,misc.doc,view of house committee of elections member dawes that art.i,reference to the legislature meant simply the constituted authorities,through whom the state choose s to speak,prime among them,the state constitution,which rises above all legislative action others anticipated that retaining the reference to the legislature would condem n any redistricting legislation by referendum or by initiative.cong.rec.statement of burton.in any event,proponents of the change maintained,i n view of the very serious evils arising from gerrymanders,congress should not take any chances in the matter.at same.d ue respect to the rights,to the established methods,and to the laws of the respective states,they urged,required congress to allow them to establish congressional districts in whatever way they may have provided by their constitution and by their statutes.at see,at statement of works.
as this court observed in hildebrant,the legislative history of th e act leaves no room for doubt about why the prior words were stricken out and the new words inserted.at.the change was made to safeguard to each state full authority to employ in the creation of congressional districts its own laws and regulations.cong.rec.statement of burton.the act,in short,left the question of redistricting to the laws and methods of the states.if they include initiative,it is included.at.
while the act applied only to reapportionment following the census,see wood broom,congress used virtually identical language when it enacted c in.see act of,ch,stat.section c sets forth procedures operative only if the state,after any apportionment,had not redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof.the provision,like the act,thus accorded full respect to the redistricting procedures adopted by the states.so long as a state has redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof as arizona did by utilizing the independent commission procedure called for by its constitution the resulting redistricting plan becomes the presumptively governing map 
the arizona legislature characterizes c as an obscure provision,narrowed by subsequent developments to the brink of irrelevance.brief for appellant.true,four of the five default redistricting procedures operative only when a state is not redistricted in the manner provided by state law had become because of postenactment decisions of this court in virtually all situations plainly unconstitutional.branch smith,plurality opinion.concretely,the default procedures specified in c contemplate that a state would continue to use districts following a new census.the,principle announced in wesberry sanders,however,would bar those procedures,except in the unlikely event that the decennial census makes no districting change constitutionally necessary,branch,at plurality opinion.
constitutional infirmity in c default procedures,however,does not bear on the question whether a state has been redistricted in the manner provided by state law.as just observed,congress expressly directed that when a state has been redistricted in the manner provided by state law whether by the legislature,court decree see,at,or a commission established by the people exercise of the initiative the resulting districts are the ones that presumptively will be used to elect representatives 
there can be no dispute that congress itself may draw a state boundaries.see vieth,at plurality opinion stating that the elections clause permit s congress to make or alter the districts for federal elections the arizona legislature urges that the first part of the elections clause,vesting power to regulate congressional elections in state legislature s,precludes congress from allowing a state to redistrict without the involvement of its representative body,even if congress independently could enact the same redistricting plan under its plenary authority to make or alter the state plan.see brief for appellant reply brief.in other words,the arizona legislature regards c as a futile exercise.the congresses that passed c and its forerunner,the act,did not share that wooden interpretation of the clause,nor do we.any uncertainty about the import of c,however,is resolved by our holding that the elections clause permits regulation of congressional elections by initiative,see infra,at,leaving no arguable conflict between c and the first part of the clause.
in accord with the district court,see supra,at,we hold that the elections clause permits the people of arizona to provide for redistricting by independent commission.to restate the key question in this case,the issue centrally debated by the parties absent congressional authorization,does the elections clause preclude the people of arizona from creating a commission operating independently of the state legislature to establish congressional districts the history and purpose of the clause weigh heavily against such preclusion,as does the animating principle of our constitution that the people themselves are the originating source of all the powers of government.
we note,preliminarily,that dictionaries,even those in circulation during the founding era,capaciously define the word legislature.samuel johnson defined legislature simply as t he power that makes laws.a dictionary of the english language ed.ibid.ed.ibid.ed.ibid.ed.thomas sheridan dictionary defined legislature exactly as johnson did the power that makes laws.a complete dictionary of the english language ed.noah webster defined the term precisely that way as well.compendious dictionary of the english language.and nathan bailey similarly defined legislature as the authority of making laws,or power which makes them.an universal etymological english dictionary ed.
as to the power that makes laws in arizona,initiatives adopted by the voters legislate for the state just as measures passed by the representative body do.see,art.iv,pt,the legislative authority of the state shall be vested in the legislature,consisting of a senate and a house of representatives,but the people reserve the power to propose laws and amendments to the constitution and to enact or reject such laws and amendments at the polls,independently of the legislature.see also eastlake forest city enterprises,in establishing legislative bodies,the people can reserve to themselves power to deal directly with matters which might otherwise be assigned to the legislature.as well in arizona,the people may delegate their legislative authority over redistricting to an independent commission just as the representative body may choose to do.see tr.of oral arg.answering the court question,may the arizona legislature itself establish a commission to attend to redistricting,counsel for appellant responded yes,state legislatures may delegate their authority to a commission,subject to their prerogative to reclaim the authority for themselves.
the dominant purpose of the elections clause,the historical record bears out,was to empower congress to override state election rules,not to restrict the way states enact legislation.as this court explained in arizona inter tribal council of,the clause was the framers insurance against the possibility that a state would refuse to provide for the election of representatives to the federal congress.at slip,at citing the federalist,rossiter ed.hamilton.
the clause was also intended to act as a safeguard against manipulation of electoral rules by politicians and factions in the states to entrench themselves or place their interests over those of the electorate.as madison urged,without the elections clause,w henever the state legislatures had a favorite measure to carry,they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to succeed.records of the federal convention farrand.madison spoke in response to a motion by south carolina delegates to strike out the federal power.those delegates so moved because south carolina coastal elite had malapportioned their legislature,and wanted to retain the ability to do so.see rakove,original meanings politics and ideas in the making of the constitution.the problem madison identified has hardly lessened over time.conflict of interest is inherent when legislators dra w district lines that they ultimately have to run in.cain,yale,at.
arguments in support of congressional control under the elections clause were reiterated in the public debate over ratification.theophilus parsons,a delegate at the massachusetts ratifying convention,warned that when faction and party spirit run high,a legislature might take actions like mak ing an unequal and partial division of the states into districts for the election of representatives.debate in massachusetts ratifying convention,in the founders constitution kurland lerner eds.timothy pickering of massachusetts similarly urged that the clause was necessary because the state governments may abuse their power,and regulate elections in such manner as would be highly inconvenient to the people.letter to charles tillinghast,in,at.he described the clause as a way to ensure to the people their rights of election.ibid.
while attention focused on potential abuses by politicians,and the consequent need for congressional oversight,the legislative processes by which the states could exercise their initiating role in regulating congressional elections occasioned no debate.that is hardly surprising.recall that when the constitution was composed in philadelphia and later ratified,the people legislative prerogatives the initiative and the referendum were not yet in our democracy arsenal.see supra,at.the elections clause,however,is not reasonably read to disarm states from adopting modes of legislation that place the lead rein in the people hands 
the arizona legislature maintains that,by specifying the legislature thereof,the elections clause renders the state representative body the sole component of state government authorized to prescribe regulations for congressional redistricting.brief for appellant.the chief justice,in dissent,agrees.but it is characteristic of our federal system that states retain autonomy to establish their own governmental processes.see alden maine,a state is entitled to order the processes of its own governance.the federalist,at madison whenever the states may choose to substitute other republican forms,they have a right to do so.through the structure of its government,and the character of those who exercise government authority,a state defines itself as a sovereign.gregory ashcroft.arizona engaged in definition of that kind when its people placed both the initiative power and the airc redistricting authority in the portion of the arizona constitution delineating the state legislative authority.see,art.iv supra,at.
this court has long recognized the role of the states as laboratories for devising solutions to difficult legal problems.oregon ice,see united states lopez,kennedy,concurring t he states may perform their role as laboratories for experimentation to devise various solutions where the best solution is far from clear.new state ice liebmann,brandeis,dissenting it is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may,if its citizens choose,serve as a laboratory and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.deference to state lawmaking allows local policies more sensitive to the diverse needs of a heterogeneous society,permits innovation and experimentation,enables greater citizen involvement in democratic processes,and makes government more responsive by putting the states in competition for a mobile citizenry.bond united states,slip,at quoting gregory,at.
we resist reading the elections clause to single out federal elections as the one area in which states may not use citizen initiatives as an alternative legislative process.nothing in that clause instructs,nor has this court ever held,that a state legislature may prescribe regulations on the time,place,and manner of holding federal elections in defiance of provisions of the state constitution.see shiel,misc.doc,at concluding that oregon constitution prevailed over any conflicting legislative measure setting the date for a congressional election.
the chief justice,in dissent,maintains that,under the elections clause,the state legislature can trump any constitutional provision regulating federal elections.he extracts support for this position from baldwin trowbridge,bartlett contested election cases,misc.doc.see post,at.there,michigan voters had amended the state constitution to require votes to be cast within a resident township or ward.the michigan legislature,however,passed a law permitting soldiers to vote in other locations.one candidate would win if the state constitution requirement controlled his opponent would prevail under the michigan legislature prescription.the house elections committee,in a divided vote,ruled that,under the elections clause,the michigan legislature had the paramount power.
as the minority report in baldwin pointed out,however,the supreme court of michigan had reached the opposite conclusion,holding,as courts generally do,that state legislation in direct conflict with the state constitution is void.baldwin,misc.doc,at.the baldwin majority ruling,furthermore,appears in tension with the election committee unanimous decision in shiel just five years earlier.the committee,we repeat,ha d no doubt that the constitution of the state ha d fixed,beyond the control of the legislature,the time for holding a congressional election.shiel,misc.doc,at.finally,it was perhaps not entirely accidental that the candidate the committee declared winner in baldwin belonged to the same political party as all but one member of the house committee majority responsible for the decision.see house of representatives congress profiles congress,http history.house.gov profiles biographical directory of the united states congress trowbridge,rowland ebenezer.cain,yale,at identifying legislative conflict of interest as the problem independent redistricting commissions aimed to check.in short,baldwin is not a disposition that should attract this court reliance.
we add,furthermore,that the arizona legislature does not question,nor could it,employment of the initiative to control state and local elections.in considering whether article i,really says no to similar control of federal elections,we have looked to,and borrow from,alexander hamilton counsel i t would have been hardly advisable to establish,as a fundamental point,what would deprive several states of the convenience of having the elections for their own governments and for the national government held at the same times and places,and in the same manner.the federalist,at.the elections clause is not sensibly read to subject states to that deprivation 
the framers may not have imagined the modern initiative process in which the people of a state exercise legislative power coextensive with the authority of an institutional legislature.but the invention of the initiative was in full harmony with the constitution conception of the people as the font of governmental power.as madison put it the genius of republican liberty seems to demand not only that all power should be derived from the people,but that those intrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the people.at.
the people ultimate sovereignty had been expressed by john locke in,a near century before the constitution formation 
t he legislative being only a fiduciary power to act for certain ends,there remains still in the people a supream power to remove or alter the legislative,when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust reposed in them.for all power given with trust for the attaining an end,being limited by that end,whenever that end is manifestly neglected,or opposed,the trust must necessarily be forfeited,and the power devolve into the hands of those that gave it,who may place it anew where they shall think best for their safety and security.two treatises of government,laslett ed.
our declaration of independence,drew from locke in stating governments are instituted among men,deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.and our fundamental instrument of government derives its authority from we the people.preamble.as this court stated,quoting hamilton t he true principle of a republic is,that the people should choose whom they please to govern them.powell mccormack,quoting debates on the federal constitution elliot ed.in this light,it would be perverse to interpret the term legislature in the elections clause so as to exclude lawmaking by the people,particularly where such lawmaking is intended to check legislators ability to choose the district lines they run in,thereby advancing the prospect that members of congress will in fact be chosen by the people of the several states,art.i.see cain,yale,at.
the chief justice,in dissent,suggests that independent commissions established by initiative are a experiment that has failed.post,at.for this assessment,the chief justice cites a federal district court opinion,harris arizona independent redistricting comm n,supp.that opinion,he asserts,detail s the partisanship that has affected the commission.post,at.no careful reader could so conclude.
the report of the decision in harris comprises a per curiam opinion,an opinion concurring in the judgment by judge silver,and a dissenting opinion by judge wake.the per curiam opinion found in favor of the commission.supp,at.deviations from the,principle,the per curiam opinion explained at length,were small and,in the main,could not be attributed to partisanship.ibid.while partisanship may have played some role,the per curiam opinion stated,deviations were predominantly a result of the commission efforts to achieve preclearance under the voting rights act.at.judge silver,although she joined the per curiam opinion,made clear at the very outset of that opinion her finding that partisanship did not play a role.at.in her concurring opinion,she repeated her finding that the evidence did not show partisanship at work,at instead,she found,the evidence was overwhelming that the final map was a product of the commissioners consideration of appropriate redistricting criteria.at.to describe harris as a decision criticizing the commission for pervasive partisanship,post,at,the chief justice could rely only upon the dissenting opinion,which expressed views the majority roundly rejected.
independent redistricting commissions,it is true,have not eliminated the inevitable partisan suspicions associated with political.cain,yale,at.but they have succeeded to a great degree in limiting the conflict of interest implicit in legislative control over redistricting.ibid.they thus impede legislators from choosing their voters instead of facilitating the voters choice of their representatives.
banning lawmaking by initiative to direct a state method of apportioning congressional districts would do more than stymie attempts to curb partisan gerrymandering,by which the majority in the legislature draws district lines to their party advantage.it would also cast doubt on numerous other election laws adopted by the initiative method of legislating.
the people,in several states,functioning as the lawmaking body for the purpose at hand,have used the initiative to install a host of regulations governing the times,places and manner of holding federal elections.art.i.for example,the people of california provided for permanent voter registration,specifying that no amendment by the legislature shall provide for a general biennial or other periodic reregistration of voters.cal.code ann.west.the people of ohio banned ballots providing for voting along party lines.ohio,art.v.the people of oregon shortened the deadline for voter registration to days prior to an election,art.ii.none of those measures permit the state legislatures to override the people prescriptions.the arizona legislature theory that the lead role in regulating federal elections can not be wrested from the legislature,and vested in commissions initiated by the people would endanger all of them.
the list of endangered state elections laws,were we to sustain the position of the arizona legislature,would not stop with popular initiatives.almost all state constitutions were adopted by conventions and ratified by voters at the ballot box,without involvement or approval by the legislature.core aspects of the electoral process regulated by state constitutions include voting by ballot or secret ballot,voter registration absentee voting vote counting and victory thresholds again,the states legislatures had no hand in making these laws and may not alter or amend them.
the importance of direct democracy as a means to control election regulations extends beyond the particular statutes and constitutional provisions installed by the people rather than the states legislatures.the very prospect of lawmaking by the people may influence the legislature when it considers or fails to consider measures.see persily anderson,regulating democracy through democracy the use of direct legislation in election law reform,cal,describing cases in which indirect pressure of the initiative process was sufficient to spur state legislature s to action turning the coin,the legislature responsiveness to the people its members represent is hardly heightened when the representative body can be confident that what it does will not be overturned or modified by the voters themselves.
invoking the elections clause,the arizona legislature instituted this lawsuit to disempower the state voters from serving as the legislative power for redistricting purposes.but the clause surely was not adopted to diminish a state authority to determine its own lawmaking processes.article i,stems from a different view.both parts of the elections clause are in line with the fundamental premise that all political power flows from the people.mcculloch maryland,wheat.so comprehended,the clause doubly empowers the people.they may control the state lawmaking processes in the first instance,as arizona voters have done,and they may seek congress correction of regulations prescribed by state legislatures.
the people of arizona turned to the initiative to curb the practice of gerrymandering and,thereby,to ensure that members of congress would have an habitual recollection of their dependence on the people.the federalist,at madison.in so acting,arizona voters sought to restore the core principle of republican government,namely,that the voters should choose their representatives,not the other way around.berman,managing gerrymandering,texas.the elections clause does not hinder that endeavor.

chief justice roberts,with whom justice scalia,justice thomas,and justice alito join,dissenting.
just over a century ago,arizona became the second state in the union to ratify the seventeenth amendment.that amendment transferred power to choose united states senators from the legislature of each state,art.i,to the people thereof.the amendment resulted from an arduous,campaign in which reformers across the country worked hard to garner approval from congress and of the states.
what chumps did they realize that all they had to do was interpret the constitutional term the legislature to mean the people the court today performs just such a magic trick with the elections clause.art.i.that clause vests congressional redistricting authority in the legislature of each state.an arizona ballot initiative transferred that authority from the legislature to an independent redistricting commission.the majority approves this deliberate constitutional evasion by doing what the proponents of the seventeenth amendment dared not revising the legislature to mean the people.
the court position has no basis in the text,structure,or history of the constitution,and it contradicts precedents from both congress and this court.the constitution contains seventeen provisions referring to the legislature of a state,many of which can not possibly be read to mean the people.see appendix,infra.indeed,several provisions expressly distinguish the legislature from the people.see art.i,amdt.this court has accordingly defined the legislature in the elections clause as the representative body which ma kes the laws of the people.smiley holm,quoting hawke smith,emphasis added.
the majority largely ignores this evidence,relying instead on disconnected observations about direct democracy,a contorted interpretation of an irrelevant statute,and naked appeals to public policy.nowhere does the majority explain how a constitutional provision that vests redistricting authority in the legislature permits a state to wholly exclude the legislature from redistricting.arizona commission might be a noble endeavor although it does not seem so independent in practice but the fact that a given law or procedure is efficient,convenient,and useful will not save it if it is contrary to the constitution.ins chadha.no matter how concerned we may be about partisanship in redistricting,this court has no power to gerrymander the constitution.i respectfully dissent.
the majority begins by discussing policy.i begin with the constitution.the elections clause provides 
the times,places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives,shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof but the congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations,except as to the places of chusing senators.art.i,cl.
the elections clause both imposes a duty on states and assigns that duty to a particular state actor in the absence of a valid congressional directive to the contrary,states must draw district lines for their federal representatives.and that duty shall be carried out in each state by the legislature thereof.
in arizona,however,redistricting is not carried out by the legislature.instead,as the result of a ballot initiative,an unelected body called the independent redistricting commission draws the lines.see ante,at.the key question in the case is whether the commission can conduct congressional districting consistent with the directive that such authority be exercised by the legislature.
the majority concedes that the unelected commission is not the legislature of arizona.the court contends instead that the people of arizona as a whole constitute the legislature for purposes of the elections clause,and that they may delegate the congressional districting authority conferred by that clause to the commission.ante,at.the majority provides no support for the delegation part of its theory,and i am not sure whether the majority analysis is correct on that issue.but even giving the court the benefit of the doubt in that regard,the commission is still unconstitutional.both the constitution and our cases make clear that the legislature in the elections clause is the representative body which makes the laws of the people.
the majority devotes much of its analysis to establishing that the people of arizona may exercise lawmaking power under their state constitution.see ante,at.nobody doubts that.this case is governed,however,by the federal constitution.the states do not,in the majority words,retain autonomy to establish their own governmental processes,ante,at,if those processes violate the united states constitution.in a conflict between the arizona constitution and the elections clause,the state constitution must give way.art.vi,cl.cook gralike.the majority opinion therefore largely misses the point.
the relevant question in this case is how to define the legislature under the elections clause.the majority opinion does not seriously turn to that question until page,and even then it fails to provide a coherent answer.the court seems to conclude,based largely on its understanding of the history and purpose of the elections clause,ante,at,that the legislature encompasses any entity in a state that exercises legislative power.that circular definition lacks any basis in the text of the constitution or any other relevant legal source.
the majority textual analysis consists,in its entirety,of one paragraph citing founding era dictionaries.the majority points to various dictionaries that follow samuel johnson definition of legislature as the power that makes laws.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.the notion that this definition corresponds to the entire population of a state is strained to begin with,and largely discredited by the majority own admission that d irect lawmaking by the people was virtually unknown when the constitution of was drafted.ante,at internal quotation marks omitted see ante,at.moreover,johnson first example of the usage of legislature is this without the concurrent consent of all three parts of the legislature,no law is or can be made.a dictionary of the english language ed.emphasis deleted.johnson borrowed that sentence from matthew hale,who defined the three parts of the legislature of england as the king and the two houses of parliament.history of the common law of england.the contrary notion that the people as a whole make the laws would have cost you your head in england in.thus,even under the majority preferred definition,the legislature referred to an institutional body of representatives,not the people at large.
any ambiguity about the meaning of the legislature is removed by other founding era sources.e very state constitution from the founding era that used the term legislature defined it as a distinct multimember entity comprised of representatives.morley,the intratextual independent legislature and the elections clause,nw.online,and citing eleven state constitutions.the federalist papers are replete with references to legislatures that can only be understood as referring to representative institutions,the federalist,rossiter ed.hamilton describing the state legislatures as select bodies of men at contrasting the state legislatures with the people noah webster heralded american dictionary of the english language defines legislature as t he body of men in a state or kingdom,invested with power to make and repeal laws.an american dictionary of the english language.it continues,the legislatures of most of the states in america consist of two houses or branches.ibid.emphasis deleted.
i could go on,but the court has said this before.as we put it nearly a century ago,legislature was not a term of uncertain meaning when incorporated into the constitution.hawke,at.what it meant when adopted it still means for the purpose of interpretation.ibid.a legislature is the representative body which ma kes the laws of the people.see smiley,at relying on this definition colorado assembly salazar,rehnquist,dissenting from denial of certiorari same.
the unambiguous meaning of the legislature in the elections clause as a representative body is confirmed by other provisions of the constitution that use the same term in the same way.when seeking to discern the meaning of a word in the constitution,there is no better dictionary than the rest of the constitution itself.our precedents new and old have employed this structural method of interpretation to read the constitution in the manner it was drafted and ratified as a unified,coherent whole.see,nlrb noel canning,slip,at,at scalia,concurring in judgment slip,at mcculloch maryland,wheat,martin hunter lessee,wheat,amar,intratextualism,harv.
the constitution includes seventeen provisions referring to a state legislature.see appendix,infra.every one of those references is consistent with the understanding of a legislature as a representative body.more importantly,many of them are only consistent with an institutional legislature and flatly incompatible with the majority reading of the legislature to refer to the people as a whole.
start with the constitution first use of the term the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states,and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature.art.i,cl.this reference to a branch of the state legislature can only be referring to an institutional body,and the explicit juxtaposition of the state legislature with the people of the several states forecloses the majority proposed reading.
the next section of article i describes how to fill vacancies in the united states senate if vacancies happen by resignation,or otherwise,during the recess of the legislature of any state,the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature,which shall then fill such vacancies.cl.the references to the recess of the legislature of any state and the next meeting of the legislature are only consistent with an institutional legislature,and make no sense under the majority reading.the people as a whole schoolchildren and a few unnamed others excepted do not take a recess.
the list goes on.article iv provides that the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government,and shall protect each of them against invasion and on application of the legislature,or of the executive when the legislature can not be convened,against domestic violence.it is perhaps conceivable that all the people of a state could be convened although this would seem difficult during an invasion or outbreak of domestic violence but the only natural reading of the clause is that the executive may submit a federal application when the legislature as a representative body can not be convened.
article vi provides that the senators and representatives before mentioned,and the members of the several state legislatures,and all executive and judicial officers,both of the united states and of the several states,shall be bound by oath or affirmation,to support this constitution.cl.unless the majority is prepared to make all the people of every state swear an oath or affirmation,to support this constitution,this provision can only refer to the several state legislatures in their institutional capacity.
each of these provisions offers strong structural indications about what the legislature must mean.but the most powerful evidence of all comes from the seventeenth amendment.under the original constitution,senators were chosen by the legislature of each state,art.i,cl,while members of the house of representatives were chosen by the people,art.i,cl.that distinction was critical to the framers.as james madison explained,the senate would derive its powers from the states,while the house would derive its powers from the people of america.the federalist,at.george mason believed that the power of state legislatures to select senators would be a reasonable guard against the danger that the national,will swallow up the state legislatures.records of the federal convention of,farrand ed.not everyone agreed.james wilson proposed allowing the people to elect senators directly.his proposal was rejected ten to one.debates in the federal convention of,doc.
before long,reformers took up wilson mantle and launched a protracted campaign to amend the constitution.that effort began in,when representative henry storrs of new york proposed but then set aside a constitutional amendment transferring the power to elect senators from the state legislatures to the people.cong.deb.over the next of a century,no fewer than joint resolutions proposing similar reforms were introduced in both houses of congress.hall,the history and effect of the seventeenth amendment.
at no point in this process did anyone suggest that a constitutional amendment was unnecessary because legislature could simply be interpreted to mean people.see hawke,at it was never suggested,so far as we are aware,that the purpose of making the office of senator elective by the people could be accomplished by a referendum vote.the necessity of the amendment to accomplish the purpose of popular election is shown in the adoption of the amendment.in fact,as the decades rolled by without an amendment,of the states settled for the next best thing by holding a popular vote on candidates for senate,then pressuring state legislators into choosing the winner.see,abstract of laws relating to the election of united states senators,doc,sess.all agreed that cutting the state legislature out of senatorial selection entirely would require nothing less than to strike out the original words in the constitution and insert,elected by the people in its place.cong.globe,proposal of jeremiah clemens.
yet that is precisely what the majority does to the elections clause today amending the text not through the process provided by article v,but by judicial decision.the majority revision renders the seventeenth amendment an waste of time,and singles out the elections clause as the only one of the constitution seventeen provisions referring to the legislature that departs from the ordinary meaning of the term.
the commission had no answer to this point.see tr.of oral arg.justice alito is there any other provision where legislature means anything other than the conventional meaning appellee i do know the answer to that question.
the court response is not much better.the majority observes that the legislature of a state may perform different functions under different provisions of the constitution.under article i,for example,the legislature performed an electoral function by choosing senators.the legislature plays a consenting function under article i,and article iv,a ratifying function under article v and a lawmaking function under the elections clause.ante,at,and.all true.the majority,however,leaps from the premise that the legislature performs different functions under different provisions to the conclusion that the legislature assumes different identities under different provisions.
as a matter of ordinary language and common sense,however,a difference in function does not imply a difference in meaning.a car,for example,generally serves a transportation function.but it can also fulfill a storage function.at a tailgate party or a movie,it may play an entertainment function.in the absence of vacancies at the roadside motel,it could provide a lodging function.to a neighbor with a dead battery,it offers an electricity generation function.and yet,a person describing a car engaged in any of these varied functions would undoubtedly be referring to the same thing.
the constitution itself confirms this point.articles i and ii assign many different functions to the senate a lawmaking function,an impeachment trial function,a treaty ratification function,an appointee confirmation function,an officer selection function,a qualification judging function,and a recordkeeping function.art.i,cls,cls,cl.art.ii,cl.yet the identity of the senate remains the same as it discharges these various functions.
similarly,the house of representatives performs different functions,including lawmaking,impeachment,and resolving presidential elections in which no candidate wins a majority in the electoral college.art.i,cl,cl.amdt.the president is assigned not only executive functions,art.ii,but also legislative functions,such as approving or vetoing bills,convening both houses of congress,and recommending measures for their consideration,art.i,cl.art.ii.courts not only exercise a judicial function,art.iii,but may also perform an appointment function,art.ii,cl.and so on.neither the majority nor the commission points to a single instance in which the identity of these actors changes as they exercise different functions.
the majority attempts to draw support from precedent,but our cases only further undermine its position.in hawke,this court considered the meaning of the legislatur e in article v,which outlines the process for ratifying constitutional amendments.the court concluded that legislature meant the representative body which ma kes the laws of the people.at.the court then explained that t he term is often used in the constitution with this evident meaning.ibid.emphasis added.the court proceeded to list other constitutional provisions that assign different functions to the legislature,just as the majority does today,at see ante,at.
unlike the majority today,however,the court in hawke never hinted that the meaning of legislature varied across those different provisions because they assigned different functions.to the contrary,the court drew inferences from the seventeenth amendment and its predecessor,article i,in which the legislature played an electoral function to define the legislature in article v,which assigned it a ratification function.see,at.the court concluded that legislature refers to a representative body,whatever its function.as the court put it,there can be no question that the framers of the constitution clearly understood and carefully used the terms in which that instrument referred to the action of the legislatures of the states.when they intended that direct action by the people should be had they were no less accurate in the use of apt phraseology to carry out such purpose.ibid.citing art.i.
smiley,the leading precedent on the meaning of the legislature in the elections clause,reaffirmed the definition announced in hawke.in smiley,the petitioner argued as the commission does here that the legislature referred not just to the two houses of the legislature but to the entire legislative power of the state however exercised.brief for petitioner,internal quotation marks omitted.the court did not respond by holding,as the majority today suggests,that the legislature comprises the referendum and the governor veto in the context of regulating congressional elections,or that the legislature has a different identity in the elections clause than it does in article ante,at.instead,the court in smiley said this 
much that is urged in argument with regard to the meaning of the term legislature is beside the point.as this court said in hawke the term was not one of uncertain meaning when incorporated into the constitution.what it meant when adopted it still means for purposes of interpretation.a legislature was then the representative body which made the laws of the people.at quoting hawke,at.
remarkably,the majority refuses to even acknowledge the definition of the legislature adopted in both smiley and hawke,and instead embraces the interpretation that this court unanimously rejected more than years ago 
the history of the elections clause further supports the conclusion that the legislature is a representative body.the first known draft of the clause to appear at the constitutional convention provided that each state shall prescribe the time and manner of holding elections.debates on the federal constitution elliot ed.after revision by the committee of detail,the clause included the important limitation at issue here the times and places,and the manner,of holding the elections of the members of each house,shall be prescribed by the legislature of each state but their provisions concerning them may,at any time,be altered by the legislature of the united states.at emphasis added.the insertion of the legislature indicates that the framers thought carefully about which entity within the state was to perform congressional districting.and the parallel between the legislature of each state and the legislature of the united states further suggests that they meant the legislature as a representative body.
as the majority explains,the debate over the ratification of the elections clause centered on its second part,which empowers congress to make or alter regulations prescribed by the legislature of a state.see ante,at.importantly for our purposes,however,both sides in this debate recognized the distinction between the state legislature and the people themselves.brown secretary of state of florida.
the,for example,supported vesting election regulation power solely in state legislatures because state legislatures were more numerous bodies,usually elected annually,and thus more likely to be in sympathy with the interests of the people.natelson,the original scope of the congressional power to regulate elections.const,emphasis added citing sources from ratification debates.alexander hamilton and others responded by raising the specter of state legislatures which he described as local administrations deciding to annihilate the federal government by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons to administer its affairs.the federalist,at.as the majority acknowledges,the distinction between the legislature and the people occasioned no debate.ante,at.that is because everybody understood what the legislature meant.
the majority contends that its counterintuitive reading of the legislature is necessary to advance the animating principle of popular sovereignty.ante,at.but the ratification of the constitution was the ultimate act of popular sovereignty,and the people who ratified the elections clause did so knowing that it assigned authority to the legislature as a representative body.the elections clause was not,as the majority suggests,an safeguard against manipulation of electoral rules by politicians.ante,at.like most provisions of the constitution,the elections clause reflected a compromise a pragmatic recognition that the grand project of forging a union required everyone to accept some things they did not like.see the federalist,at describing the power allocated to state legislatures as an evil which could not have been avoided this court has no power to upset such a compromise simply because we now think that it should have been struck differently.as we explained almost a century ago,t he framers of the constitution might have adopted a different method,but it is not the function of courts to alter the method which the constitution has fixed.hawke,at.
in addition to text,structure,and history,several precedents interpreting the elections clause further reinforce that the legislature refers to a representative body.
the first precedent comes not from this court,but from congress.acting under its authority to serve as the judge of the elections,returns and qualifications of its own members,art.i,cl,the house of representatives in confronted a dispute about who should be seated as the congressman from the fifth district of michigan.at a popular convention,michigan voters had amended the state constitution to require votes to be cast within a resident township or ward.the michigan legislature,however,passed a law permitting soldiers to vote in alternative locations.if only the local votes counted,one candidate baldwin would win if the outside votes were included,the other candidate trowbridge would be entitled to the seat.see baldwin trowbridge,bartlett contested election cases,misc.doc.
the house elections committee explained that the elections clause conferred power on the legislature of michigan to prescribe election regulations.but,the committee asked,what is meant by the legislature does it mean the legislative power of the state,which would include a convention authorized to prescribe fundamental law or does it mean the legislature eo nomine,as known in the political history of the country at.the committee decided,and the full house agreed,that the legislature in the elections clause was the legislature eo nomine the legislature by that name,a representative body.ibid.that conclusion followed both from the known meaning of the legislature at the time of the framing and the many other uses of the word in the constitution that would not be compatible with a popular convention.thus,w here there is a conflict of authority between the constitution and legislature of a state in regard to fixing place of elections,the power of the legislature is paramount.at see california democratic party jones,and stevens,dissenting relying on baldwin for its conclusion that the elections clause specific reference to the legislature is not so broad as to encompass the general legislative power of this state 
the majority draws attention to the minority report in baldwin.ante,at.under the present circumstances,i take some comfort in the court willingness to consider dissenting views.still,the minority report does not diminish the force of baldwin.the report cites a michigan supreme court precedent that allegedly reached a contrary result,but that case turned entirely on state constitutional questions arising from a state election not federal constitutional questions arising from a federal election.see people ex rel.twitchell blodgett.the majority also contends that baldwin appears in tension with an earlier house elections committee precedent.ante,at.by its own terms,however,that earlier precedent did not involve a conflict between a state legislative act and a state constitutional provision.see shiel thayer,bartlett contested election cases,misc.doc,the two branches of the legislature differed upon the question and so the bill never became a law in any event,to the degree that the two precedents are inconsistent,the later decision in baldwin should govern 
the next relevant precedent is this court decision in mcpherson blacker.that case involved a constitutional provision with considerable similarity to the elections clause,the presidential electors clause of article ii each state shall appoint,in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct,a number of electors cl.emphasis added.the question was whether the state legislature,as a body of representatives,could divide authority to appoint electors across each of the state congressional districts.the court upheld the law and emphasized that the plain text of the presidential electors clause vests the power to determine the manner of appointment in the legislature of the state.that power,the court explained,can neither be taken away nor abdicated.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
against that backdrop,the court decided two cases regarding the meaning of the legislature in the elections clause.in ohio ex rel.davis hildebrant,the ohio legislature passed a congressional redistricting law.under the ohio constitution,voters held a referendum on the law and rejected it.a supporter of the law sued on behalf of the state,contending that the referendum was not and could not be a part of the legislative authority of the state and therefore could have no influence on the law creating congressional districts under the elections clause,at.
this court rejected the challenger constitutional argument as a nonjusticiable claim that the referendum causes a state to be not republican in violation of the guarantee clause of the constitution,at citing art.iv.the court also rejected an argument that ohio use of the referendum violated a federal statute,and held that congress had the power to pass that statute under the elections clause,at.hildebrant in no way suggested that the state legislature could be displaced from the redistricting process,and hildebrant certainly did not hold as the majority today contends that the word legislature in the elections clause encompassed a veto power lodged in the people.ante,at.hildebrant simply approved a state decision to employ a referendum in addition to redistricting by the legislature.see,at.the result of the decision was to send the ohio legislature back to the drawing board to do the redistricting.
in smiley,the minnesota legislature passed a law adopting new congressional districts,and the governor exercised his veto power under the state constitution.as noted above,the minnesota secretary of state defended the veto on the ground that the legislature in the elections clause referred not just to the two houses of the legislature but to the entire legislative power of the state however exercised.this court rejected that argument,reiterating that the term legislature meant the representative body which made the laws of the people.at quoting hawke,at.the court nevertheless went on to hold that the elections clause did not prevent a state from applying the usual rules of its legislative process including a gubernatorial veto to election regulations prescribed by the legislature,at.as in hildebrant,the legislature was not displaced,nor was it redefined it just had to start on a new redistricting plan.
the majority initially describes hildebrant and smiley as holding that redistricting is a legislative function,to be performed in accordance with the state prescriptions for lawmaking,which may include the referendum and the governor veto.ante,at.that description is true,so far as it goes.but it hardly supports the result the majority reaches here.there is a critical difference between allowing a state to supplement the legislature role in the legislative process and permitting the state to supplant the legislature altogether.see salazar,at rehnquist,dissenting from denial of certiorari to be consistent with article i,there must be some limit on the state ability to define lawmaking by excluding the legislature itself nothing in hildebrant,smiley,or any other precedent supports the majority conclusion that imposing some constraints on the legislature justifies deposing it entirely.
the constitutional text,structure,history,and precedent establish a straightforward rule under the elections clause,the legislature is a representative body that,when it prescribes election regulations,may be required to do so within the ordinary lawmaking process,but may not be cut out of that process.put simply,the state legislature need not be exclusive in congressional districting,but neither may it be excluded.
the majority contrary understanding requires it to accept a definition of the legislature that contradicts the term plain meaning,creates discord with the seventeenth amendment and the constitution many other uses of the term,makes nonsense of the drafting and ratification of the elections clause,and breaks with the relevant precedents.in short,the effect of the majority decision is to erase the words by the legislature thereof from the elections clause.that is a judicial error of the most basic order.it can not be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect and therefore such a construction is inadmissible.marbury madison,cranch.
the court also issues an alternative holding that a federal statute,c,permits arizona to vest redistricting authority in the commission.ante,at.the majority does not contend that this statutory holding resolves the constitutional question presented,see ante,at,so its reading of section c is largely beside the point.with respect,its statutory argument is also hard to take seriously.section c does not apply to this case.and even if it did,it would likely be unconstitutional 
section c establishes a number of default rules that govern the states manner of electing representatives u ntil a state is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof.section c is therefore inapplicable unless the state legislature,and state and federal courts,have all failed to redistrict the state.branch smith,plurality opinion see,at,concurring in part and dissenting in part.here,the commission has redistricted the state in the manner provided by the law thereof.so by its terms,section c does not come into play in this case.
the majority spends several pages discussing section c,but it conspicuously declines to say that the statute actually applies to this case the majority notes that the versions of section c applied only until the legislature redistricted the state,while the versions applied only until the state is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof.the majority also describes in detail the legislative history that accompanied the amendment.but if section c does not apply,its legislative history is doubly irrelevant.
the majority seems to suggest that section c somehow indicates federal approval for the district lines that the commission has drawn.see ante,at.but the statute does nothing of the sort.section c explains what rules apply u ntil a state is redistricted it says nothing about what rules apply after a state is redistricted.and it certainly does not say that the state redistricting plan will by some alchemy become federal law.no legislative drafter remotely familiar with the english language would say that a state had to follow default rules u ntil it is redistricted in the manner provided by the law thereof,when what he meant was any redistricting plan that the state adopts shall become federal law.and if the drafter was doing something as significant as transforming state law into federal law,he presumably would have taken care to make that dramatic step unmistakably clear.gregory ashcroft,internal quotation marks omitted.tellingly,our most recent case on the meaning of section c seems not to have even considered the majority position.see branch.
indeed,the majority does not even seem persuaded by its own argument.the majority quickly cautions,in discussing section c,that a state is required to comply with the federal constitution,the voting rights act,and other federal laws when it draws and implements its district map.ante,at.the majority therefore concludes that nothing in c affects a challenge to a state district map on the ground that it violates one or more of those federal requirements.ibid.but here the arizona legislature has challenged a state district map on the ground that it violates one of those federal requirements the elections clause.if we take the majority at its word,nothing in section c should affect that challenge.
not only is the majority reading of section c implausible as a matter of statutory interpretation,it would also likely violate the constitution in multiple ways.
first,the majority reading of section c as a statute approving the lines drawn by the commission would seemingly authorize congress to alter the elections clause.the first part of the elections clause gives state legislatures the power to prescribe regulations regarding the times,places,and manner of elections the second part of the clause gives congress the power to make or alter such regulations.there is a difference between making or altering election regulations prescribed by the state legislature and authorizing an entity other than the state legislature to prescribe election regulations.in essence,the majority proposed reading permits congress to use the second part of the elections clause to nullify the first.yet this court has expressly held that congress ha s no power to alter article i,section the elections clause.smiley,at see also clinton city of new york,congress may not circumvent article i constraints on its lawmaking power chadha,same.
second,the majority interpretation of section c would create a serious delegation problem.as a general matter,congress may pass statutes that delegate some discretion to those who administer the laws.it is a principle,however,that congress may not delegate authority to one actor when the constitution vests that authority in another actor.see whitman american trucking.the majority reading of section c contradicts that rule by allowing congress to delegate federal redistricting authority to a state entity other than the one in which the elections clause vests that authority the legislature.
third,the majority interpretation conflicts with our most recent elections clause precedent,arizona inter tribal council of.there we explained that when congress legislates under the elections clause,it necessarily displaces some element of a legal regime erected by the states.at slip,at.that is so because the power the elections clause confers on congress is none other than the power to.at,slip,at.put differently,all action under the elections clause displaces some element of a state regulatory regime,because the text of the clause confers the power to do exactly and only that.at,slip,at.under the majority interpretation of section c,however,congress has done the opposite of preempting or displacing state law it has adopted state law.
normally,when a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised,it is a cardinal principle that this court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.crowell benson.the multiple serious constitutional doubts raised by the majority interpretation of section c in addition to the sheer weakness of its reading as a textual matter provide more than enough reason to reject the majority construction.section c does not apply to this case.
justice jackson once wrote that the constitution speaks in majestic generalities.west virginia bd.of ed.barnette.in many places it does,and so we have cases expounding on freedom of speech and unreasonable searches and seizures.amdts.yet the constitution also speaks in some places with elegant specificity.a member of the house of representatives must be years old.art.i,cl.every state gets two senators.art.i,cl.and the times,places,and manner of holding elections for those federal representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.art.i,cl.
for the reasons i have explained,there is no real doubt about what the legislature means.the framers of the constitution were practical men,dealing with the facts of political life as they understood them,putting into form the government they were creating,and prescribing in language clear and intelligible the powers that government was to take.south carolina united states.we ought to give effect to the words they used.
the majority today shows greater concern about redistricting practices than about the meaning of the constitution.i recognize the difficulties that arise from trying to fashion judicial relief for partisan gerrymandering.see vieth jubelirer,ante,at.but our inability to find a manageable standard in that area is no excuse to abandon a standard of meaningful interpretation in this area.this court has stressed repeatedly that a law virtues as a policy innovation can not redeem its inconsistency with the constitution.failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional remedies.clinton,at kennedy,concurring see stern marshall,free enterprise fund public company accounting oversight,bowsher synar,chadha,myers united states.
indeed,the court has enforced the text of the constitution to invalidate state laws with policy objectives reminiscent of this one.two of our precedents held that states could not use their constitutions to impose term limits on their federal representatives in violation of the united states constitution.cook,term limits,thornton.the people of the states that enacted these reforms surely viewed them as measures that would place the lead rein in the people hands.ante,at.yet the court refused to accept that the framers spent significant time and energy in debating and crafting clauses that could be easily evaded.term limits,at.the majority approves just such an evasion of the constitution today 
the court also overstates the effects of enforcing the plain meaning of the constitution in this case.there is no dispute that arizona may continue to use its commission to draw lines for state legislative elections.the representatives chosen in those elections will then be responsible for congressional redistricting as members of the state legislature,so the work of the commission will continue to influence arizona federal representation.
moreover,reading the elections clause to require the involvement of the legislature will not affect most other redistricting commissions.as the majority notes,many states have commissions that play an auxiliary role in congressional redistricting.ante,at,and nn.but in these states,unlike in arizona,the legislature retains primary authority over congressional redistricting.see brief for national conference of state legislatures as amicus curiae.
the majority also points to a scattered array of laws and constitutional provisions enacted via popular lawmaking that it claims would be endangered by interpreting the elections clause to mean what it says.ante,at.reviewing the constitutionality of these farflung provisions is well outside the scope of this case.suffice it to say that none of them purports to do what the arizona constitution does here set up an unelected,unaccountable institution that permanently and totally displaces the legislature from the redistricting process.t his wolf comes as a wolf.morrison olson,scalia,dissenting.
absent from the majority portrayal of the high motives that inspired the arizona commission is any discussion of how it has actually functioned.the facts described in a recent opinion by a district court detail the partisanship that has affected the commission on issues ranging from staffing decisions to drawing the district lines.see harris arizona independent redistricting comm n,supp.the per curiam opinion explained that partisanship played some role in the design of the map,that some of the commissioners were motivated in part in some of the linedrawing decisions by a desire to improve democratic prospects in the affected districts,and that the commission retained a mapping consultant that had worked for democratic,independent,and nonpartisan campaigns,but no republican campaigns.at.the hiring of the mapping consultant provoked sufficient controversy that the governor of arizona,supported by of the arizona senate,attempted to remove the chairwoman of the commission for substantial neglect of duty and gross misconduct in office.at see arizona independent redistricting comm brewer,explaining the removal and concluding that the governor exceeded her authority under the arizona constitution.
judge silver separate opinion noted that the very structure of arizona reformed redistricting process reflects that partisanship still plays a prominent role.supp,at.judge wake separate opinion described the commission systematic overpopulation of republican plurality districts and underpopulation of democratic plurality districts as partisan malapportionment.at.in his words,the commission has been the currency of our democracy everyone equal vote and giving all the shavings to one party,for no valid reason.at.
the district court concluded by a margin that this partisanship did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.the case is pending on appeal before this court,and i take no position on the merits question.but a finding that the partisanship in the redistricting plan did not violate the constitution hardly proves that the commission is operating free of partisan influence and certainly not that it complies with the elections clause.
the people of arizona have concerns about the process of congressional redistricting in their state.for better or worse,the elections clause of the constitution does not allow them to address those concerns by displacing their legislature.but it does allow them to seek relief from congress,which can make or alter the regulations prescribed by the legislature.and the constitution gives them another means of change.they can follow the lead of the reformers who won passage of the seventeenth amendment.indeed,several constitutional amendments over the past century have involved modifications of the electoral process.amdts.unfortunately,today decision will only discourage this democratic method of change.why go through the hassle of writing a new provision into the constitution when it is so much easier to write an old one out

justice scalia,with whom justice thomas joins,dissenting.
i do not believe that the question the court answers is properly before us.disputes between governmental branches or departments regarding the allocation of political power do not in my view constitute cases or controversies committed to our resolution by art.iii,of the constitution.
what those who framed and ratified the constitution had in mind when they entrusted the judicial power to a separate and coequal branch of the federal government was the judicial power they were familiar with that traditionally exercised by english and american courts.the cases and controversies that those courts entertained did not include suits between units of government regarding their legitimate powers.the job of the courts was,in chief justice marshall words,solely,to decide on the rights of individuals,marbury madison,cranch.tocqueville considered this one reason the new democracy could safely confer upon courts the immense power to hold legislation unconstitutional 
b y leaving it to private interest to censure the law,and by intimately uniting the trial of the law with the trial of an individual,legislation is protected from wanton assaults and from the daily aggressions of party spirit 
i am inclined to believe this practice of the american courts to be at once most favorable to liberty and to public order.if the judge could only attack the legislator only openly and directly,he would sometimes be afraid to oppose him and at other times party spirit might encourage him to brave it at every turn.but the american judge is brought into the political arena independently of his own will.he judges the law only because he is obliged to judge a case.the political question that he is called upon to resolve is connected with the interests of the parties,and he can not refuse to decide it without a denial of justice.de tocqueville,democracy in america bradley ed.
that doctrine of standing,that jurisdictional limitation upon our powers,does not have as its purpose as the majority assumes merely to assure that we will decide disputes in concrete factual contexts that enable realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action,ante,at.to the contrary.t he law of art.iii standing is built on a single basic idea the idea of separation of powers.allen wright.it keeps us minding our own business.
we consult history and judicial tradition to determine whether a given disput e is appropriately resolved through the judicial process.lujan defenders of wildlife,internal quotation marks omitted.what history and judicial tradition show is that courts do not resolve direct disputes between two political branches of the same government regarding their respective powers.nearly every case presents questions like the ones in this case.but we have never passed on a question raised directly by a governmental subunit complaint.we have always resolved those questions in the context of a private lawsuit in which the claim or defense depends on the constitutional validity of action by one of the governmental subunits that has caused a private party concrete harm.that is why,for example,it took this court over years to rule upon the constitutionality of the tenure of office act,passed in.if the law of standing had been otherwise,presumably president wilson,or presidents grant and cleveland before him,would have had standing,and could have challenged the law preventing the removal of a presidential appointee without the consent of congress.raines byrd.
we do not have to look far back in the united states reports to find other cases which,if the arizona legislature theory of standing is correct,took an awfully circuitous route to get here.in zivotofsky kerry,ante,the president could have sued for an injunction against congress attempted direct usurpation of his authority to pronounce on foreign relations.or in wellness int l network,sharif,a federal district judge could have sought a declaratory judgment that a bankruptcy court adjudicating a stern claim improperly usurped his constitutionally conferred authority to decide cases and controversies.or in nlrb noel canning,the senate could have sued the president,claiming a direct usurpation of its prerogative to advise on and consent to presidential appointments.each of these cases involved the allocation of power to one or more branches of a government and we surely would have dismissed suits arising in the hypothesized fashions.
we have affirmatively rejected arguments for jurisdiction in cases like this one.for example,in raines,at,we refused to allow members of congress to challenge the line item veto act,which they claimed unconstitutionally expand ed the president power and alter ed the constitutional balance of powers between the legislative and executive branches.at.in massachusetts mellon,we refused to allow a state to pursue its claim that a conditional congressional appropriation constitute d an effective means of inducing the states to yield a portion of their sovereign rights.and mellon involved a contention that one government infringed upon another government power far closer to the traditional lawsuit than is an intragovernmental dispute.we put it plainly in the last analysis,the complaint of the plaintiff state is brought to the naked contention that congress has usurped the reserved powers of the several states,at and because the state could not show a discrete harm except the alleged usurpation of its powers,we refused to allow the state appeal.
the sole precedent the court relies upon is coleman miller.coleman can be distinguished from the present case as readily as it was distinguished in raines.in raines,the but distinction was that the senators in coleman had their votes nullified,whereas the members of congress claimed that their votes could merely be rendered ineffective by a presidential veto.raines,supra,at.in the present case we could make the distinction that in coleman individual legislators were found to have standing,whereas here it is the governmental body,the arizona legislature,that seeks to bring suit.but the reality is that the supposed holding of coleman stands out like a sore thumb from the rest of our jurisprudence,which denies standing for intragovernmental disputes.
coleman was a peculiar case that may well stand for nothing.the opinion discussing and finding standing,and going on to affirm the kansas supreme court,was written by chief justice hughes and announced by justice stone.justice frankfurter,joined by three other justices,held there was no standing,and would have dismissed the petition leaving the judgment of the kansas supreme court in place.justice butler,joined by justice mcreynolds,dissented neither joining hughes opinion nor separately discussing standing and would have reversed the kansas supreme court.
that adds up to two votes to affirm on the merits,two to reverse on the merits without discussing standing and four to dismiss for lack of standing.justice stanley reed,who was on the court and apparently participated in the case,is not mentioned in any of the opinions recorded in the united states reports.so,in order to find coleman a binding precedent on standing,rather than a standoff,one must assume that justice reed voted with hughes.there is some reason to make that assumption the four justices rejecting standing went on to discuss the merits,because the ruling of the court just announced removes from the case the question of petitioners standing to sue.at black,concurring.but then again,if nine justices participated,how could it be that on one of the two issues in the case the court was equally divided and therefore expresse d no opinion at.
a pretty shaky foundation for a significant precedential ruling.besides that,the two dissenters mere assumption of standing neither saying anything about the subject nor joining hughes opinion on the point produces if you assume reed joined hughes a majority for standing but no majority opinion explaining why.and even under the most generous assumptions,since the court judgment on the issue it resolved rested on the ground that that issue presented a political question which is itself a rejection of jurisdiction,zivotofsky clinton,slip,at coleman discussion of the additional jurisdictional issue of standing was quite superfluous and arguably nothing but dictum.the peculiar decision in coleman should be charitably ignored.
the court asserts,quoting raines,at,that the court standing analysis has been especially rigorous when reaching the merits of the dispute would force the court to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of the federal government was unconstitutional.ante,at.the cases cited to support this dictum fail to do so they are merely cases where a determination of unconstitutionality is avoided by applying what there is no reason to believe is anything other than normal standing requirements.it seems to me utterly implausible that the framers wanted federal courts limited to traditional judicial cases only when they were pronouncing upon the rights of congress and the president,and not when they were treading upon the powers of state legislatures and executives.quite to the contrary,i think they would be all the more averse to unprecedented judicial meddling by federal courts with the branches of their state governments.
i would dismiss this case for want of jurisdiction.
normally,having arrived at that conclusion,i would express no opinion on the merits unless my vote was necessary to enable the court to produce a judgment.in the present case,however,the majority resolution of the merits question legislature means the people is so outrageously wrong,so utterly devoid of textual or historic support,so flatly in contradiction of prior supreme court cases,so obviously the willful product of hostility to districting by state legislatures,that i can not avoid adding my vote to the devastating dissent of the chief justice.

reading today opinion,one would think the court is a great defender of direct democracy in the states.as it reads the legislature out of the times,places and manner clause,art.i,the majority offers a paean to the ballot initiative.it speaks in glowing terms of the characteristic of our federal system that states retain autonomy to establish their own governmental processes.ante,at.and it urges d eference to state lawmaking so that states may perform their vital function as laboratories of democracy.ante,at.
these sentiments are difficult to accept.the conduct of the court in so many other cases reveals a different attitude toward the states in general and ballot initiatives in particular.just last week,in the antithesis of deference to state lawmaking through direct democracy,the court cast aside state laws across the country many of which were enacted through ballot initiative that reflected the traditional definition of marriage.see obergefell hodges,ante.
this court tradition of disdain for state ballot initiatives goes back quite a while.two decades ago,it held unconstitutional an arkansas ballot initiative imposing term limits on that state members of congress,finding little significance in the fact that such term limits were adopted by popular referendum.term limits,thornton.one year later,it held unconstitutional a ballot initiative that would have prevented the enactment of laws under which homosexual,lesbian or bisexual orientation,conduct,practices or relationships would constitute or otherwise be the basis of any minority status,quota preferences,protected status or claim of discrimination.romer evans.the court neither gave deference to state lawmaking nor said anything about the virtues of direct democracy.it instead declared that the result of the ballot initiative was an aberration that i t is not within our constitutional tradition to enact laws of this sort.at.but if constitutional tradition is
