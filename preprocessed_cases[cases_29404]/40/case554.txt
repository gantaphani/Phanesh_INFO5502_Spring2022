this case requires us to apply first amendment law to the decision of a town to remove for cause appointed local officials unwilling to comply with the directive of the board of selectmen that they rescind a vote.plaintiffs claim that the board of selectmen of the town of fairhaven violated their first amendment rights when it removed them from the town conservation commission for the exercise of their votes to replace the chair and of the commission.upon the close of plaintiffs evidence at a bench trial,the district court found no first amendment violation and entered judgment in favor of the town of fairhaven and two members of the board of selectmen collectively defendants.this appeal ensued.we affirm.
a.the controversy 
the town of fairhaven conservation commission commission consists of seven members appointed by the board of selectmen board for an unpaid term of three years.the plaintiffs in this mullin,antonio lopes,david gammons,and william markey collectively plaintiffs were four of the seven members serving on the commission in.
the town bylaw establishing the commission mandates that t he commission shall elect by majority vote from among the members a chair and,each for a term of one year.the commission customarily holds its annual elections on the same day as the town meeting.accordingly,in june,the commission conducted its annual elections following the town meeting,naming marinus vander pol as chair and winfred eckenreiter as.prior to the june elections,mullin had been serving as commission chair.
at a commission meeting held on october,only four months into the term of the new chair and,mullin moved to reorganize the commission.markey seconded mullin motion.vander pol,who understood the bylaws to prescribe a term,stated that the commission would vote on mullin motion,whether a reorganization would be lawful or not.although the commission annual chairmanship elections are typically included on the meeting agenda,the october reorganization was not on the agenda.
eckenreiter was absent from the october meeting.the six other members were present.the motion to reorganize passed by a to margin,with one abstention by gammons,who abstained from voting because of eckenreiter absence.mullin and markey nominated each other for the positions of chair and respectively the commission then voted mullin as chair and markey as.
the reorganization prompted the board of selectmen to consult the town counsel,who advised in an opinion letter that the commission did not have legal authority to remove the chair and from their positions 
the town provide that t he conservation commission shall elect by majority vote from among the members a chair and,each for a term of one year.town.there is no provision in the or in any other applicable law authorizing the commission to remove either the chairman or the from that office prior to the expiration of his term.general law which provides for the appointment of conservation commissions is silent on this issue.
under similar provisions the massachusetts courts have held that an appointing authority does not have the authority to remove an appointee from office during his term unless that authority is expressly stated in the general laws.i am aware of no reason that the same law of construction should not apply to a town.
accordingly,it is my opinion that under these circumstances the conservation commission did not have legal authority to remove the chairman and from their respective positions.
on november,the board sent identical letters to each of the seven commission members,notifying them that their october,reorganization violated the town bylaw,and enclosing a copy of town counsel opinion letter and the relevant town bylaw.in the letters,the board indicated that they had voted two to one to require the commission to rescind as illegal this reorganization at its next meeting the letter also advised that failure to rescind would lead to additional action by the board of selectmen.
prior to the transmittal of these letters,a curious event transpired at the commission meeting held on november,which commenced with mullin and markey sitting as chair and.deposed eckenreiter moved to reorganize the commission again.gammons and lopes were absent from this meeting all other commission members were present.the motion to reorganize again was unanimously passed by all members present,including mullin and markey.eckenreiter nominated vander pol as chair,his nomination was seconded,and the commission members unanimously elected vander pol as chair.
after the meeting adjourned,mullin decided that this latest reorganization had no binding effect because he believed it had been initiated by eckenreiter only to prove the point that the commission could do this back and forth every week if reorganizations were valid.thus,at the subsequent commission meeting on november,mullin and markey disregarded the november reorganization and reassumed the positions of chair and.at that meeting,in response to the november letter by the selectmen,mullin moved that the commission reconsider the october reorganization subject to a second legal opinion to be obtained at town expense.eckenreiter then moved to rescind the october reorganization.the motion to rescind failed by a vote of three in favor to four opposed.plaintiffs were the four members who refused to rescind the october reorganization despite having been advised of its illegality of the reorganization 
in response to plaintiffs refusal to rescind the allegedly unlawful reorganization,the board informed them in separate letters dated december,that it would hold a hearing to determine whether to remove plaintiffs from their positions on the commission,in accordance with the town bylaws.under these bylaws,commission members may be removed for cause by the board pursuant to the provisions of.laws ch.section provides that an individual appointed to the conservation commission may,after a public hearing,be removed for cause by the appointing authority.laws ch.the letters indicated the board intention to consider any or all of the following as possible grounds for removal of plaintiffs 
their recent participation in the removal of the chairman and of the commission despite their election,pursuant to town,section,to a one year term to those positions on june.
their improper denial of an order of conditions for a project fisherman road without supporting facts,and on grounds not allowed under the wetlands protection act.
the letters to mullin and markey also referenced their recent participation,and apparent organization,of an appeal for a superseding order from an order approved by the commission for the at t project.in addition,mullin was notified that his apparent failure to comply with the wetlands protection act at his home at silvershell beach could also be considered as a possible basis for his removal.
on december,the board conducted the removal hearing at which plaintiffs were represented by counsel and voted to remove plaintiffs from the commission.as cause therefor,the board stated that it had less than complete confidence in their competency and efficiency in their positions based upon the record in this matter.
b.the trial 
on january,plaintiffs brought an action in federal district court pursuant to against defendants town of fairhaven and john haaland and bryan wood individually and in their capacity as members of the fairhaven board of selectmen alleging violations of the first and fourteenth amendments.plaintiffs sought damages and equitable relief for their alleged wrongful removal from the commission.specifically,plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from appointing replacement members to the commission and a permanent injunction requiring their reinstatement to the commission.the district court refused to grant the preliminary injunction.all parties then moved for summary judgment,and all motions were denied.
a bench trial commenced on august.at the close of plaintiffs evidence,the district court,upon defendants motion,entered judgment for defendants,stating inter alia,that 
u nder any circumstance i think the board of selectmen had the authority to give fair warning that they felt that the bylaws are being violated.they gave an opinion of counsel to that effect.and the commission persisted in its position.and i think that that justified a removal for cause which was within the authority of the board of selectmen.so i am going to allow the motion.
this appeal followed.
the trial court decision,issued at the close of plaintiffs case in a bench trial,was a judgment as a matter of law on partial findings under.c see northeast drilling,inner space services,cir characterizing defendant motion for judgment at close of plaintiff case at bench trial as motion for judgment on partial findings,rather than as a motion for judgment as a matter of law under.c,which is applicable only in jury trials palmacci umpierrez,cir same.in our review of rule c judgments,we evaluate the district court conclusions of law de novo,see rego arc water treatment,cir,and typically examine the district court underlying findings of fact for clear error,united states davis,cir.
however,where first amendment interests are implicated,our review must be more searching.i n cases raising first amendment issues an appellate court has an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.bose consumers union,d quoting new york times sullivan,d.see also steeves,cir.we conduct our review accordingly.
we have extended first amendment protection to votes on controversial public issue s cast by a member of a public agency or board.miller town of hull,cir there can be no more definite expression of opinion than by voting on a controversial public issue.see also stella kelley,cir.this protection is far from absolute,however.in their capacity as public officials voting on matters of public concern,plaintiffs retain first amendment protection so long as their speech does not unduly impede the government interest in the efficient performance of the public service it delivers through its appointed officials,at citing cases.accordingly,to determine the scope of first amendment free speech protections applicable to public officials,we have employed a test extracted largely from two supreme court opinions,healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d,and pickering bd.of,d.see tang dep t of elderly affairs,cir setting forth test,at same.
first,we must determine whether the speech at issue involves matters of public concern.connick myers,d.if it does not,then its first amendment value is low,and a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of internal decisions arising therefrom.id.at.second,if the speech does pertain to matters of public concern,the court must,under the supreme court decision in pickering,balance the strength of plaintiffs and the public first amendment interests against the strength of the countervailing governmental interest in promoting efficient performance of the public service the government agency or entity must provide through its public officials,at citing pickering,at.albeit not an exact science,pickering balancing is necessary in order to accommodate the dual role of the public employer as a provider of public services and as a government entity operating under the constraints of the first amendment.rankin mcpherson,d.because these first two prongs involve assessing whether plaintiffs votes are of a character which the principles of the first amendment protect,these determinations are always subject to de novo review,at quoting connick,at.internal citation omitted.
third,and finally,if first amendment interests outweigh a legitimate government interest in curtailing the speech under the pickering balancing test,plaintiffs must then show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision to remove them from their posts on the commission.see healthy,at.if plaintiffs can make this showing,the burden of persuasion shifts to defendants who must then prove by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiffs would have been removed even in the absence of the protected conduct.id.c learly erroneous review is appropriate on this inquiry.duffy sarault,cir see also,at.
invoking first amendment protections,plaintiffs claim that the board removed them from the commission on the basis of the reorganization,as well as other issues alluded to in the november notice of the removal hearing as possible grounds for their removal.notwithstanding the inclusion of these other issues in the november notice,however,there was no evidence introduced at trial that the selectmen actually considered these other grounds as bases for its removal decision.the district court,as,found that the unlawful reorganization was the basis for plaintiffs removal,specifically finding that plaintiffs insistence on the reorganization in violation of the town bylaws justified a removal for cause which was within the authority of the board of selectmen.this conclusion about the basis for the removal of the plaintiffs is not clearly erroneous.see duffy,at reviewing district court healthy causation determinations for clear error.we therefore apply our first amendment analysis to that ground for removal.
matters of public concern 
the supreme court has held that w hether an employee speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content,form and context of a given statement,as revealed by the whole record.connick,at.that determination may require an inquiry into the employee motive for the speech.see,alinovi worcester sch,cir concluding that speech found to be motivated by a purely personal issue did not implicate matter of public concern,notwithstanding attenuated connection of speech to incident raising fourth amendment concerns.in that endeavor,we examine the extent to which plaintiffs intended their speech to contribute to any public discourse,or if it simply reflected personal or internal commission concerns,at.
here,the district court perceived the reorganization as primarily a by plaintiffs,stating in the midst of plaintiffs case,you got people that want someone else in power that not first amendment.some elements of the record certainly support the district court view that the reorganization was simply a grab for power the reorganization took place without notice at the end of a meeting,and absent members could not and were not polled as to their views.however,the district court observation,and this evidence,speak to how plaintiffs conducted the reorganization vote and not to their motives,at least not directly.
our independent examination of the record instead reveals a mix of motives at play,at mandating de novo review of determinations,given importance of first amendment values involved.the friction between plaintiffs and vander pol sprang in part from a clash of personal styles and from disagreements over the internal policies and workings of the as the maintenance of files and the manner in which a secretary was matters of little concern to the public.see connick,at.t he first amendment does not require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs.curtis.city pub.schs.bd.of,cir speech concerning individual personnel disputes or internal policies will typically not involve public concern.at the same time,plaintiffs claimed dissatisfaction with vander pol leadership because of his views on controversial public issues before the commission.
moreover,beyond the question of motive,the speech at issue is a vote,not simply the expression of a point of view on a controversial issue.that vote had tangible consequences for the community in terms of the commission leadership.given the responsibility of the commission for the promotion and development of the town natural resources and for the protection of watershed resources.laws ch,there is a significant public dimension to the votes cast for its chair and.as with any local board,agency or commission,its leaders bear primary responsibility for the articulation of policy to the public and other government entities.accordingly,in view of th
