in this case we are asked to decide whether a city may be required to fund a federal court order mandating the retrofitting of city schools,under title ii of the americans with disabilities act,without any determination that the city discriminated against or otherwise excluded plaintiffs from its services and activities.recognizing the fundamental precept that remedies may be imposed only upon a party judged liable for some harm,we reverse the judgment of the district court.to impose a funding obligation on the city in the absence of any underlying finding of liability would disrespect the structure of local government and impair the commonwealth ability to structure its state institutions and run its schools.
this case arises out of a settlement agreement in which the richmond city school board agreed to retrofit of its sixty school buildings and to make approximately million in capital improvements over five years.plaintiffs,primarily disabled school children and their families,seek equal access to richmond school buildings and to the services,programs,and activities conducted therein.they sued the richmond city school board as well as the city of richmond,the richmond city council,and the mayor of richmond under title ii of the americans with disabilities act,section of the rehabilitation act,and the virginians with disabilities act,ann.et.plaintiffs alleged that of richmond sixty public schools violated the ada structural accessibility guidelines and requested injunctive relief.
the schools at issue here were constructed prior to,the year that the ada became effective.in,the school board commissioned an architectural study to evaluate structural compliance with the ada.this study revealed accessibility barriers and recommended a series of retrofitting projects designed to bring buildings into compliance with title ii.the school system made various improvements to richmond public school buildings but did not fully implement the study.
in,the school board commissioned trice architects to conduct a second ada compliance study.in its january report,trice architects identified a variety of barriers to access,including a lack of wheelchair ramps,elevators,handrails,and bathrooms.after receiving the study,the school board formed an ada subcommittee that developed a remediation plan and called for capital improvements beginning in the school year.
on may,the city council adopted its capital improvements budget.that budget allocated million in capital improvement funds to the richmond public schools for fiscal year and million over the next five years.plaintiffs filed suit on june.they argued that the budget provided almost no funding to correct the school disability accommodation deficiencies.for its part,the city contended that the school board failed to bring the ada noncompliance to its attention in a timely fashion and also that the school board had surplus capital funds sufficient to fund the first year of ada remediation.
after the district court denied defendants motions to dismiss plaintiffs ada and rehabilitation act claims,bacon city of richmond,d,the school board settled with plaintiffs.the school board first conceded that the richmond public schools did not comply with federal and state disability laws.it then agreed with plaintiffs that the appropriate remedy was to bring the richmond public schools into compliance with the disability laws by executing the remediation plan proposed by the ada subcommittee within five years.the school board also agreed to pay in attorneys fees and costs and to use its best efforts to obtain the funding necessary to fully implement the settlement agreement.the settlement agreement,however,provided that the school board obligations were contingent on the school board receiving funding from the city of richmond.
the city and plaintiffs then filed for summary judgment.the city contended that,because virginia law vests the school board with exclusive control over city schools,it was not responsible for the ada violations.plaintiffs maintained that since the city provided capital funding to the richmond schools it was critical to the settlement agreement and thus a necessary party.the district court agreed with plaintiffs.it granted summary judgment in their favor and ordered the city to ensure that the richmond city public schools become within five years.bacon city of richmond,d,hereinafter bacon ii.in this connection,the district court imposed upon the city a funding obligation,directing the city to make a reasonable,good faith appropriation to the school board in the normal course of the budget process,sufficient to enable ada compliance within the specified time frame.id.the district court denied plaintiffs subsequent petition for attorneys fees.both parties now appeal.

our legal system is built on the foundational principle that remedies are a means of redressing wrongs.as the supreme court has long made clear,a remedy must be tailored to a violation.see,swann bd.of,d.as with any equity case,the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.id.remedies,in other words,do not exist in the abstract rather,they flow from and are the consequence of some wrong.at its most basic,this principle limits the reach of judicial decrees to parties found liable for a legal violation.see id.
the supreme court decision in milliken bradley is instructive.in that case,the supreme court held it beyond the limits of judicial power to interfere with the operation of entities that have not violated plaintiff rights.milliken bradley,d hereinafter milliken i.accordingly,the court vacated the interdistrict desegregation order at issue there precisely because it contemplated restructuring the operation of local governmental entities that were not implicated in any constitutional violation.hills gautreaux,d interpreting milliken i,d.in sum,a legal violation is a necessary predicate for the entry of a remedial order.id.at.
recognizing the ancient maxim that an entity may not be made the subject of a remedial decree absent some finding of liability,the days of marbury viewed remedial questions as the second prong of a inquiry.a court first determines whether this defendant has wronged this plaintiff.only if this antecedent inquiry is answered in the affirmative does the court speak to the remedial issue,asking.if plaintiff has a right,and that right has been violated,do the laws of t his country afford him a remedy marbury madison,cranch.preserving the link between remedies and violations is not only a matter of avoiding unfair impositions on a party.it also expresses an important separation of powers principle,ensuring that court edicts are grounded in the requirements of law and not in notions of judicial policy.decrees therefore exceed appropriate limits when they are imposed upon governmental units that were neither involved in nor affected by the violation.milliken bradley,d hereinafter milliken ii.
we thus return to these first principles.for plaintiffs to prevail on their title ii claim,they must prove that some action attributable to the city caused them to be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity,here the richmond public schools.see.
title ii and its sister provisions implement congress clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.see b.a statutory violation is not limited to a finding of discriminatory intent.rather,title ii prohibits discriminating against disabled persons in two ways.the provision first bars the exclusion of otherwise qualified persons with a disability from participating in or receiving the benefits of the services,programs or activities of a public entity.id.it also bars a public entity from discriminating against an individual on the basis of disability.id.to repeat,to prevail under title ii of the ada plaintiffs must show either that they w ere excluded from participation in,or denied the benefits of,a program or service offered by a public entity,or subjected to discrimination by that entity.constantine rectors visitors of george mason,cir emphasis added.
the district court in this case did not find that the city excluded plaintiffs from receiving the benefits of its services or programs or that the city had in any way discriminated against plaintiffs.to the contrary,the district court began by noting that it had no intention of conducting a inquiry.bacon ii,d at.the court then found that virginia general assembly had vested the school board an independent municipal agency with direct statutory accountability for compliance with federal and state disability laws,id.at that the school board directly controls capital improvement projects,like the ada remediation at issue here,id.at and that the school board alone decides how to allocate its budget,id.these findings led the court,in denying plaintiffs motion for attorneys fees,to conclude from a purely statutory perspective,the responsibility for compliance with federal disability laws resided with the city school board,which has the duty to physically maintain the city schools.it was the school board that breached its specific duty of compliance in this case.accordingly,the district court properly found no fault with the city.
despite all this,the district court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs.the court ordered the city to ensure that the richmond city public schools become within five years,and to provide a reasonable,good faith appropriation to the school board in the normal course of the budget process,sufficient to enable ada compliance within the specified time frame.bacon ii,d at.the district court reasoned that since the city provided funding to the richmond schools it was a necessary party thus evidence neither of fault nor of discrimination was necessary to obtain equitable remedies under the ada.id.at.
we disagree.the district court remedial order undermines the basic precept of law discussed above that remedies may be imposed only on responsible parties.injunctive relief may not issue where,as here,the city played no part in depriving any plaintiff of the rights guaranteed by the ada.see rizzo goode,d.to impose responsibility in the absence of fault and causation would stretch the law of remedies beyond limit.as for title ii,it can not be read to impose strict liability on public entities that neither caused plaintiffs to be excluded nor discriminated against them.a remedy unmoored to any finding of fault is not a remedy at all and we must therefore reverse the judgment.
plaintiffs contend nonetheless that fault is irrelevant because the city provides capital funding to the richmond public schools.plaintiffs thus hitch their wagon to the district court finding that the city by virtue of its power of the purse bears some responsibility for correcting the ada violations in the richmond public schools.see bacon ii,d at.but using the city status as a funder to impose the express absence of fault and several difficulties.
first,the city exercises no operational control over city school buildings or school services and activities.virginia law vests the school board with exclusive authority over richmond public schools.article viii,section,of the virginia constitution provides,the supervision of the schools in each school division shall be vested in a school board.const.art.viii,see also underwood henry county sch,bristol.sch.bd.quarles.the virginia code implements this provision by establishing the commonwealth school boards as independent corporate bodies,ann,given the responsibility by law of establishing,maintaining and operating the school system,bd.of supervisors county sch.bd.of chesterfield county,see also ann.
the school board operational authority over school property and programs is set forth in some detail.school boards must ensure that schools are conducted according to law,ann,c are for,manage and control school property,id,and provide for the erecting,furnishing,equipping,and noninstructional operating of necessary school buildings and appurtenances,id.the school board independence is further illustrated by its statutory authority to sue and be sued,id,hire employees,id,insure school property and personnel,id,and pay claims,id.in short,t he power to operate,maintain and supervise public schools in virginia is,and has always been,within the exclusive jurisdiction of the local school boards.bradley sch.bd.of richmond,cir 
in stark contrast,the city of richmond has no power to make physical changes to school buildings or control the operation of local school buildings and their services and programs.with the exception of raising taxes and providing funding,the city is not charged by law with the establishment,maintenance and operation of the public school system.sch.bd.of chesterfield county,at.it can not dictate school services or programs.indeed,the city can not specify how the funds it appropriates to city schools may be spent t he exclusive right to determine how appropriated funds shall be spent is in the discretion of the school board so long as they stay within the limits set up in the budget.id.at.to impose funding liability thus places the city between a rock and a hard place the city must ensure that the city schools become within five years,but is powerless to control the expenditure of school funds.
the district court in this case noted,but failed to heed,the commonwealth decision to place primary responsibility for virginia schools in the hands of local school boards.instead,in an order that runs counter to the basic structure of virginia law,the court made the city liable for funding.but this assumes that the city has the discretionary authority that could lead to a statutory infraction.for it is only the exercise of discretion in school operations that can result in a title ii violation.in short,the remedial order issued here ascribes to the city a discretionary function which local law precludes.
such an ascription has profound implications.a state has near plenary authority to allocate governmental responsibilities among its political subdivisions.this power to structure its internal government is among those reserved to the commonwealth by the tenth amendment.see,bradley,at.needless to say,the federal court must in turn respect a state division of responsibility.
federal courts must tread with especial caution where,as here,a state paramount interest in educating its children is at stake.local control over the operation of public schools is one of our nation most deeply rooted for good reason.l ocal autonomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of community concern and support for public schools and to the quality of the educational process.milliken i,at.school authorities are granted substantial authority to formulate educational policy because they must balance so many competing interests.they are more in tune with educational example,the competing needs for more labs,additional classrooms,new buildings,and are federal courts.thus,even where appropriate,r emedial judicial authority does not put judges automatically in the shoes of school authorities whose powers are plenary.swann,at.before a federal court may recalibrate the state basic system of educational governance and conflate the functions of two very different entities,it must take into account the interests of state and local authorities in managing their own affairs.milliken ii,at.
to be sure,the states near plenary power over political subdivisions may not be used as a subterfuge to avoid statutory or constitution
