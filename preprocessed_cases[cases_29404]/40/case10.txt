gilbert,arizona town,has a comprehensive code sign code or code that prohibits the display of outdoor signs without a permit,but exempts categories of signs,including three relevant here.ideological signs,defined as signs communicating a message or ideas that do not fit in any other sign code category,may be up to square feet and have no placement or time restrictions.political signs,defined as signs designed to influence the outcome of an election,may be up to square feet and may only be displayed during an election season.temporary directional signs,defined as signs directing the public to a church or other qualifying event,have even greater restrictions no more than four of the signs,limited to six square feet,may be on a single property at any time,and signs may be displayed no more than hours before the qualifying event and hour after.
petitioners,good news community church church and its pastor,clyde reed,whose sunday church services are held at various temporary locations in and near the town,posted signs early each saturday bearing the church name and the time and location of the next service and did not remove the signs until around midday sunday.the church was cited for exceeding the time limits for displaying temporary directional signs and for failing to include an event date on the signs.unable to reach an accommodation with the town,petitioners filed suit,claiming that the code abridged their freedom of speech.the district court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction,and the ninth circuit affirmed,ultimately concluding that the code sign categories were content neutral,and that the code satisfied the intermediate scrutiny accorded to regulations of speech.
held the sign code provisions are regulations of speech that do not survive strict scrutiny.
a because laws target speech based on its communicative content,they are presumptively unconstitutional and may be justified only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests,paul.speech regulation is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed,sorrell ims health.and courts are required to consider whether a regulation of speech on its face draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys,at.whether laws define regulated speech by particular subject matter or by its function or purpose,they are subject to strict scrutiny.the same is true for laws that,though facially content neutral,can not be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,or were adopted by the government because of disagreement with the message conveyed.ward rock against racism.
b the sign code is content based on its face.it defines the categories of temporary,political,and ideological signs on the basis of their messages and then subjects each category to different restrictions.the restrictions applied thus depend entirely on the sign communicative content.because the code,on its face,is a regulation of speech,there is no need to consider the government justifications or purposes for enacting the code to determine whether it is subject to strict scrutiny.
c none of the ninth circuit theories for its contrary holding is persuasive.its conclusion that the town regulation was not based on a disagreement with the message conveyed skips the crucial first step in the analysis determining whether the law is content neutral on its face.a law that is content based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government benign motive,justification,or lack of animus toward the ideas contained in the regulated speech.cincinnati discovery network.thus,an innocuous justification can not transform a facially law into one that is content neutral.a court must evaluate each question whether a law is content based on its face and whether the purpose and justification for the law are content based before concluding that a law is content neutral.ward does not require otherwise,for its framework applies only to a statute.
the ninth circuit conclusion that the sign code does not single out any idea or viewpoint for discrimination conflates two distinct but related limitations that the first amendment places on government regulation of speech.government discrimination among viewpoints is a more blatant and egregious form of content discrimination,rosenberger rector and visitors of of,but t he first amendment hostility to regulation also extends to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic,consolidated edison of public serv.comm of.the sign code,a paradigmatic example of discrimination,singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment,even if it does not target viewpoints within that subject matter.
the ninth circuit also erred in concluding that the sign code was not content based because it made only and distinctions.the code categories are not the restrictions for political,ideological,and temporary event signs apply equally no matter who sponsors them.and even if the sign categories were speaker based,that would not automatically render the law content neutral.rather,laws favoring some speakers over others demand strict scrutiny when the legislature speaker preference reflects a content preference.turner broadcasting system,fcc.this same analysis applies to distinctions.
d the sign code restrictions do not survive strict scrutiny because the town has not demonstrated that the code differentiation between temporary directional signs and other types of signs furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to that end.see arizona free enterprise club freedom club pac bennett.assuming that the town has a compelling interest in preserving its aesthetic appeal and traffic safety,the code distinctions are highly underinclusive.the town can not claim that placing strict limits on temporary directional signs is necessary to beautify the town when other types of signs create the same problem.see discovery network,supra,at.nor has it shown that temporary directional signs pose a greater threat to public safety than ideological or political signs.
e this decision will not prevent governments from enacting effective sign laws.the town has ample options available to resolve problems with safety and aesthetics,including regulating size,building materials,lighting,moving parts,and portability.and the town may be able to forbid postings on public property,so long as it does so in an evenhanded,manner.see members of city council of los angeles taxpayers for vincent.an ordinance narrowly tailored to the challenges of protecting the safety of pedestrians,drivers,and passengers,warning signs marking hazards on private property or signs directing traffic might also survive strict scrutiny.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
the town of gilbert,arizona or town,has adopted a comprehensive code governing the manner in which people may display outdoor signs.gilbert,land development code sign code or code,ch,the sign code identifies various categories of signs based on the type of information they convey,then subjects each category to different restrictions.one of the categories is temporary directional signs relating to a qualifying event,loosely defined as signs directing the public to a meeting of a nonprofit group.p.the code imposes more stringent restrictions on these signs than it does on signs conveying other messages.we hold that these provisions are regulations of speech that can not survive strict scrutiny.
the sign code prohibits the display of outdoor signs anywhere within the town without a permit,but it then exempts categories of signs from that requirement.these exemptions include everything from bazaar signs to flying banners.three categories of exempt signs are particularly relevant here.
the first is ideological sign s.this category includes any sign communicating a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes that is not a construction sign,directional sign,temporary directional sign relating to a qualifying event,political sign,garage sale sign,or a sign owned or required by a governmental agency.sign code,glossary of general terms glossary,emphasis deleted.of the three categories discussed here,the code treats ideological signs most favorably,allowing them to be up to square feet in area and to be placed in all zoning districts without time limits.j.
the second category is political sign s.this includes any temporary sign designed to influence the outcome of an election called by a public body.glossary the code treats these signs less favorably than ideological signs.the code allows the placement of political signs up to square feet on residential property and up to square feet on nonresidential property,undeveloped municipal property,and i these signs may be displayed up to days before a primary election and up to days following a general election.ibid.
the third category is temporary directional signs relating to a qualifying event.this includes any temporary sign intended to direct pedestrians,motorists,and other passersby to a qualifying event.glossary emphasis deleted.a qualifying event is defined as any assembly,gathering,activity,or meeting sponsored,arranged,or promoted by a religious,charitable,community service,educational,or other similar organization.ibid.the code treats temporary directional signs even less favorably than political signs temporary directional signs may be no larger than six square feet.p.they may be placed on private property or on a public,but no more than four signs may be placed on a single property at any time.ibid.and,they may be displayed no more than hours before the qualifying event and no more than hour afterward.ibid.
petitioners good news community church church and its pastor,clyde reed,wish to advertise the time and location of their sunday church services.the church is a small,entity that owns no building,so it holds its services at elementary schools or other locations in or near the town.in order to inform the public about its services,which are held in a variety of different locations,the church began placing to temporary signs around the town,frequently in the public abutting the street.the signs typically displayed the church name,along with the time and location of the upcoming service.church members would post the signs early in the day on saturday and then remove them around midday on sunday.the display of these signs requires little money and manpower,and thus has proved to be an economical and effective way for the church to let the community know where its services are being held each week.
this practice caught the attention of the town sign code compliance manager,who twice cited the church for violating the code.the first citation noted that the church exceeded the time limits for displaying its temporary directional signs.the second citation referred to the same problem,along with the church failure to include the date of the event on the signs.town officials even confiscated one of the church signs,which reed had to retrieve from the municipal offices.
reed contacted the sign code compliance department in an attempt to reach an accommodation.his efforts proved unsuccessful.the town code compliance manager informed the church that there would be no leniency under the code and promised to punish any future violations.
shortly thereafter,petitioners filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of arizona,arguing that the sign code abridged their freedom of speech in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments.the district court denied the petitioners motion for a preliminary injunction.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed,holding that the sign code provision regulating temporary directional signs did not regulate speech on the basis of content.it reasoned that,even though an enforcement officer would have to read the sign to determine what provisions of the sign code applied to it,the kind of cursory examination that would be necessary for an officer to classify it as a temporary directional sign was not akin to an officer synthesizing the expressive content of the sign.at.it then remanded for the district court to determine in the first instance whether the sign code distinctions among temporary directional signs,political signs,and ideological signs nevertheless constituted a regulation of speech.
on remand,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the town.the court of appeals again affirmed,holding that the code sign categories were content neutral.the court concluded that the distinctions between temporary directional signs,ideological signs,and political signs are based on objective factors relevant to gilbert creation of the specific exemption from the permit requirement and do not otherwise consider the substance of the sign.relying on this court decision in hill colorado,the court of appeals concluded that the sign code is content neutral,at.as the court explained,gilbert did not adopt its regulation of speech because it disagreed with the message conveyed and its interests in regulat ing temporary signs are unrelated to the content of the sign.ibid.accordingly,the court believed that the code was as that term has been defined by the supreme court.at.in light of that determination,it applied a lower level of scrutiny to the sign code and concluded that the law did not violate the first amendment,at.
we granted certiorari,and now reverse.
the first amendment,applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,prohibits the enactment of laws abridging the freedom of speech.amdt.under that clause,a government,including a municipal government vested with state authority,has no power to restrict expression because of its message,its ideas,its subject matter,or its content.police of chicago mosley.laws those that target speech based on its communicative content are presumptively unconstitutional and may be justified only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.paul,simon schuster,members of state crime victims.
government regulation of speech is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed,sorrell ims health,slip,at carey brown,mosley,supra,at.this commonsense meaning of the phrase content based requires a court to consider whether a regulation of speech on its face draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys.sorrell,supra,at slip,at.some facial distinctions based on a message are obvious,defining regulated speech by particular subject matter,and others are more subtle,defining regulated speech by its function or purpose.both are distinctions drawn based on the message a speaker conveys,and,therefore,are subject to strict scrutiny.
our precedents have also recognized a separate and additional category of laws that,though facially content neutral,will be considered regulations of speech laws that can not be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,or that were adopted by the government because of disagreement with the message the speech conveys,ward rock against racism.those laws,like those that are content based on their face,must also satisfy strict scrutiny.
the town sign code is content based on its face.it defines temporary directional signs on the basis of whether a sign conveys the message of directing the public to church or some other qualifying event.glossary.it defines political signs on the basis of whether a sign message is designed to influence the outcome of an election.at.and it defines ideological signs on the basis of whether a sign communicat es a message or ideas that do not fit within the code other categories,at.it then subjects each of these categories to different restrictions.
the restrictions in the sign code that apply to any given sign thus depend entirely on the communicative content of the sign.if a sign informs its reader of the time and place a book club will discuss john locke two treatises of government,that sign will be treated differently from a sign expressing the view that one should vote for one of locke followers in an upcoming election,and both signs will be treated differently from a sign expressing an ideological view rooted in locke theory of government.more to the point,the church signs inviting people to attend its worship services are treated differently from signs conveying other types of ideas.on its face,the sign code is a regulation of speech.we thus have no need to consider the government justifications or purposes for enacting the code to determine whether it is subject to strict scrutiny.
in reaching the contrary conclusion,the court of appeals offered several theories to explain why the town sign code should be deemed content neutral.none is persuasive.
the court of appeals first determined that the sign code was content neutral because the town did not adopt its regulation of speech based on disagree ment with the message conveyed,and its justifications for regulating temporary directional signs were unrelated to the content of the sign.at.in its brief to this court,the united states similarly contends that a sign regulation is content neutral even if it expressly draws distinctions based on the sign communicative content if those distinctions can be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.brief for united states as amicus curiae,quoting ward,supra,at emphasis deleted.
but this analysis skips the crucial first step in the analysis determining whether the law is content neutral on its face.a law that is content based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government benign motive,justification,or lack of animus toward the ideas contained in the regulated speech.cincinnati discovery network.we have thus made clear that i llicit legislative intent is not the sine qua non of a violation of the first amendment,and a party opposing the government need adduce no evidence of an improper censorial motive.simon schuster,supra,at.although a purpose may be sufficient in certain circumstances to show that a regulation is content based,it is not necessary.turner broadcasting system,fcc.in other words,an innocuous justification can not transform a facially law into one that is content neutral.
that is why we have repeatedly considered whether a law is content neutral on its face before turning to the law justification or purpose.see,sorrell,supra,at slip,at statute was content based on its face,and there was also evidence of an impermissible legislative motive united states eichman,although the statute contains no explicit limitation on the scope of prohibited conduct,it is nevertheless clear that the government asserted interest is related to the suppression of free expression internal quotation marks omitted members of city council of los angeles taxpayers for vincent,the text of the ordinance is neutral,and there is not even a hint of bias or censorship in the city enactment or enforcement of this ordinance clark community for creative,requiring that a facially ban on camping must be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech united states,noting that the statute on its face deals with conduct having no connection with speech,but examining whether the the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression because strict scrutiny applies either when a law is content based on its face or when the purpose and justification for the law are content based,a court must evaluate each question before it concludes that the law is content neutral and thus subject to a lower level of scrutiny.
the court of appeals and the united states misunderstand our decision in ward as suggesting that a government purpose is relevant even when a law is content based on its face.that is incorrect.ward had nothing to say about facially restrictions because it involved a facially ban on the use,in a music venue,of sound amplification systems not provided by the city,at,and.in that context,we looked to governmental motive,including whether the government had regulated speech because of disagreement with its message,and whether the regulation was justified without reference to the content of the speech.at.but ward framework applies only if a statute is content neutral.hill,at kennedy,dissenting.its rules thus operate to protect speech,not to restrict it.at.
the first amendment requires no less.innocent motives do not eliminate the danger of censorship presented by a facially statute,as future government officials may one day wield such statutes to suppress disfavored speech.that is why the first amendment expressly targets the operation of the laws,the abridg ement of speech rather than merely the motives of those who enacted them,amdt.the vice of legislation is not that it is always used for invidious,purposes,but that it lends itself to use for those purposes.hill,supra,at scalia,dissenting.
for instance,in naacp button,the court encountered a state attempt to use a statute prohibiting improper solicitation by attorneys to outlaw speech of the national association for the advancement of colored people,at.although button predated our more recent formulations of strict scrutiny,the court rightly rejected the state claim that its interest in the regulation of professional conduct rendered the statute consistent with the first amendment,observing that it is no answer to say that the purpose of these regulations was merely to insure high professional standards and not to curtail free expression.at.likewise,one could easily imagine a sign code compliance manager who disliked the church substantive teachings deploying the sign code to make it more difficult for the church to inform the public of the location of its services.accordingly,we have repeatedly rejected the argument that discriminatory treatment is suspect under the first amendment only when the legislature intends to suppress certain ideas.discovery network,at.we do so again today.
the court of appeals next reasoned that the sign code was content neutral because it does not mention any idea or viewpoint,let alone single one out for differential treatment.at.it reasoned that,for the purpose of the code provisions,i t makes no difference which candidate is supported,who sponsors the event,or what ideological perspective is asserted.at.
the town seizes on this reasoning,insisting that content based is a term of art that should be applied flexibly with the goal of protecting viewpoints and ideas from government censorship or favoritism.brief for respondents.in the town view,a sign regulation that does not censor or favor particular viewpoints or ideas can not be content based.ibid.the sign code allegedly passes this test because its treatment of temporary directional signs does not raise any concerns that the government is endorsing or suppressing ideas or viewpoints,at,and the provisions for political signs and ideological signs are neutral as to particular ideas or viewpoints within those categories,at.
this analysis conflates two distinct but related limitations that the first amendment places on government regulation of speech.government discrimination among viewpoints or the regulation of speech based on the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is a more blatant and egregious form of content discrimination.rosenberger rector and visitors of of.but it is well established that t he first amendment hostility to regulation extends not only to restrictions on particular viewpoints,but also to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic.consolidated edison of public serv.comm of.
thus,a speech regulation targeted at specific subject matter is content based even if it does not discriminate among viewpoints within that subject matter.ibid.for example,a law banning the use of sound trucks for political speech and only political speech would be a regulation,even if it imposed no limits on the political viewpoints that could be expressed.see discovery network,supra,at.the town sign code likewise singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment,even if it does not target viewpoints within that subject matter.ideological messages are given more favorable treatment than messages concerning a political candidate,which are themselves given more favorable treatment than messages announcing an assembly of individuals.that is a paradigmatic example of discrimination.
finally,the court of appeals characterized the sign code distinctions as turning on the elements of who is speaking through the sign and whether and when an event is occurring.at.that analysis is mistaken on both factual and legal grounds.
to start,the sign code distinctions are not speaker based.the restrictions for political,ideological,and temporary event signs apply equally no matter who sponsors them.if a local business,for example,sought to put up signs advertising the church meetings,those signs would be subject to the same limitations as such signs placed by the church.and if reed had decided to display signs in support of a particular candidate,he could have made those signs far larger and kept them up for far longer than signs inviting people to attend his church services.if the code distinctions were truly speaker based,both types of signs would receive the same treatment.
in any case,the fact that a distinction is speaker based does not,as the court of appeals seemed to believe,automatically render the distinction content neutral.because s peech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker are all too often simply a means to control content,citizens united federal election comm n,we have insisted that laws favoring some speakers over others demand strict scrutiny when the legislature speaker preference reflects a content preference,turner,at.thus,a law limiting the content of newspapers,but only newspapers,could not evade strict scrutiny simply because it could be characterized as speaker based.likewise,a law that restricted the political speech of all corporations would not become content neutral just because it singled out corporations as a class of speakers.see citizens united,supra,at.characterizing a distinction as speaker based is only the beginning not the end of the inquiry.
nor do the sign code distinctions hinge on whether and when an event is occurring.the code does not permit citizens to post signs on any topic whatsoever within a set period leading up to an election,for example.instead,come election time,it requires town officials to determine whether a sign is designed to influence the outcome of an election and thus political or merely communicating a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes and thus ideological glossary.that obvious inquiry does not evade strict scrutiny review simply because an event,an election is involved.
and,just as with laws,the fact that a distinction is event based does not render it content neutral.the court of appeals cited no precedent from this court supporting its novel theory of an exception from the requirement for laws.as we have explained,a speech regulation is content based if the law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.supra,at.a regulation that targets a sign because it conveys an idea about a specific event is no less content based than a regulation that targets a sign because it conveys some other idea.here,the code singles out signs bearing a particular message the time and location of a specific event.this type of ordinance may seem like a perfectly rational way to regulate signs,but a clear and firm rule governing content neutrality is an essential means of protecting the freedom of speech,even if laws that might seem entirely reasonable will sometimes be struck down because of their nature.city of ladue gilleo,concurring.
because the town sign code imposes restrictions on speech,those provisions can stand only if they survive strict scrutiny,which requires the government to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest,arizona free enterprise club freedom club pac bennett,slip,at quoting citizens united,at.thus,it is the town burden to demonstrate that the code differentiation between temporary directional signs and other types of signs,such as political signs and ideological signs,furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to that end.see ibid.
the town can not do so.it has offered only two governmental interests in support of the distinctions the sign code draws preserving the town aesthetic appeal and traffic safety.assuming for the sake of argument that those are compelling governmental interests,the code distinctions fail as hopelessly underinclusive.
starting with the preservation of aesthetics,temporary directional signs are no greater an eyesore,discovery network,at,than ideological or political ones.yet the code allows unlimited proliferation of larger ideological signs while strictly limiting the number,size,and duration of smaller directional ones.the town can not claim that placing strict limits on temporary directional signs is necessary to beautify the town while at the same time allowing unlimited numbers of other types of signs that create the same problem.
the town similarly has not shown that limiting temporary directional signs is necessary to eliminate threats to traffic safety,but that limiting other types of signs is not.the town has offered no reason to believe that directional signs pose a greater threat to safety than do ideological or political signs.if anything,a sharply worded ideological sign seems more likely to distract a driver than a sign directing the public to a nearby church meeting.
in light of this underinclusiveness,the town has not met its burden to prove that its sign code is narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest.because a law can not be regarded as protecting an interest of the highest order,and thus as justifying a restriction on truthful speech,when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited,republican party of white,the sign code fails strict scrutiny.
our decision today will not prevent governments from enacting effective sign laws.the town asserts that an absolutist rule would render virtually all distinctions in sign laws subject to strict scrutiny,brief for respondents,but that is not the case.not all distinctions are subject to strict scrutiny,only ones are.laws that are content neutral are instead subject to lesser scrutiny.see clark,at.
the town has ample options available to resolve problems with safety and aesthetics.for example,its current code regulates many aspects of signs that have nothing to do with a sign message size,building materials,lighting,moving parts,and portability.see,r.and on public property,the town may go a long way toward entirely forbidding the posting of signs,so long as it does so in an evenhanded,manner.see taxpayers for vincent,at upholding ban against posting signs on public property.indeed,some lower courts have long held that similar sign laws receive strict scrutiny,but there is no evidence that towns in those jurisdictions have suffered catastrophic effects.see,solantic,llc neptune beach,sign categories similar to the town of gilbert were content based and subject to strict scrutiny matthews needham,law banning political signs but not commercial signs was content based and subject to strict scrutiny.
we acknowledge that a city might reasonably view the general regulation of signs as necessary because signs take up space and may obstruct views,distract motorists,displace alternative uses for land,and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation.city of ladue,at.at the same time,the presence of certain signs may be essential,both for vehicles and pedestrians,to guide traffic or to identify hazards and ensure safety.a sign ordinance narrowly tailored to the challenges of protecting the safety of pedestrians,drivers,and passengers such as warning signs marking hazards on private property,signs directing traffic,or street numbers associated with private houses well might survive strict scrutiny.the signs at issue in this case,including political and ideological signs and signs for events,are far removed from those purposes.as discussed above,they are facially content based and are neither justified by traditional safety concerns nor narrowly tailored.
we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

justice alito,with whom justice kennedy and justice sotomayor join,concurring.
i join the opinion of the court but add a few words of further explanation.
as the court holds,what we have termed laws must satisfy strict scrutiny.laws merit this protection because they present,albeit sometimes in a subtler form,the same dangers as laws that regulate speech based on viewpoint.limiting speech based on its topic or subject favors those who do not want to disturb the status quo.such regulations may interfere with democratic and the search for truth.see consolidated edison of public serv.comm of.
as the court shows,the regulations at issue in this case are replete with distinctions,and as a result they must satisfy strict scrutiny.this does not mean,however,that municipalities are powerless to enact and enforce reasonable sign regulations.i will not attempt to provide anything like a comprehensive list,but here are some rules that would not be content based 
rules regulating the size of signs.these rules may distinguish among signs based on any criteria,including any relevant criteria listed below.
rules regulating the locations in which signs may be placed.these rules may distinguish between signs and those attached to buildings.
rules distinguishing between lighted and unlighted signs.
rules distinguishing between signs with fixed messages and electronic signs with messages that change.
rules that distinguish between the placement of signs on private and public property.
rules distinguishing between the placement of signs on commercial and residential property.
rules distinguishing between and signs.
rules restricting the total number of signs allowed per mile of roadway.
rules imposing time restrictions on signs advertising a event.rules of this nature do not discriminate based on topic or subject and are akin to rules restricting the times within which oral speech or music is allowed.
in addition to regulating signs put up by private actors,government entities may also erect their own signs consistent with the principles that allow governmental speech.see pleasant grove city summum.they may put up all manner of signs to promote safety,as well as directional signs and signs pointing out historic sites and scenic spots.
properly understood,today decision will not prevent cities from regulating signs in a way that fully protects public safety and serves legitimate esthetic objectives.
breyer,concurring in judgment 
clyde reed,et,petitioners town of gilbert,arizona,et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice breyer,concurring in the judgment.
i join justice kagan separate opinion.like justice kagan i believe that categories alone can not satisfactorily resolve the legal problem before us.the first amendment requires greater judicial sensitivity both to the amendment expressive objectives and to the public legitimate need for regulation than a simple recitation of categories,such as content discrimination and strict scrutiny,would permit.in my view,the category content discrimination is better considered in many contexts,including here,as a rule of thumb,rather than as an automatic strict scrutiny trigger,leading to almost certain legal condemnation.
to use content discrimination to trigger strict scrutiny sometimes makes perfect sense.there are cases in which the court has found content discrimination an unconstitutional method for suppressing a viewpoint,rosenberger rector and visitors of of,see also boos barry,plurality opinion applying strict scrutiny where the line between subject matter and viewpoint was not obvious.and there are cases where the court has found content discrimination to reveal that rules governing a traditional public forum are,in fact,not a neutral way of fairly managing the forum in the interest of all speakers.police of chicago mosley,once a forum is opened up to assembly or speaking by some groups,government may not prohibit others from assembling or speaking on the basis of what they intend to say in these types of cases,strict is often appropriate,and content discrimination has thus served a useful purpose.
but content discrimination,while helping courts to identify unconstitutional suppression of expression,can not and should not always trigger strict scrutiny.to say that it is not an automatic strict scrutiny trigger is not to argue against that concept use.i readily concede,for example,that content discrimination,as a conceptual tool,can sometimes reveal weaknesses in the government rationale for a rule that limits speech.if,for example,a city looks to litter prevention as the rationale for a prohibition against placing newsracks dispensing free advertisements on public property,why does it exempt other newsracks causing similar litter cincinnati discovery network.i also concede that,whenever government disfavors one kind of speech,it places that speech at a disadvantage,potentially interfering with the free marketplace of ideas and with an individual ability to express thoughts and ideas that can help that individual determine the kind of society in which he wishes to live,help shape that society,and help define his place within it.
nonetheless,in these latter instances to use the presence of content discrimination automatically to trigger strict scrutiny and thereby call into play a strong presumption against constitutionality goes too far.that is because virtually all government activities involve speech,many of which involve the regulation of speech.programs almost always require content discrimination.and to hold that such content discrimination triggers strict scrutiny is to write a recipe for judicial management of ordinary government regulatory activity.
consider a few examples of speech regulated by government that inevitably involve content discrimination,but where a strong presumption against constitutionality has no place.consider governmental regulation of securities,requirements for content that must be included in a registration statement of energy conservation,requirements for content that must be included on labels of certain consumer electronics of prescription drugs,b a requiring a prescription drug label to bear the symbol rx only of confidentiality,requiring confidentiality of certain medical records,but allowing a physician to disclose that the patient has hiv to the patient spouse or sexual partner of income tax statements,requiring taxpayers to furnish information about foreign gifts received if the aggregate amount exceeds of commercial airplane briefings,cfr requiring pilots to ensure that each passenger has been briefed on flight procedures,such as seatbelt fastening of signs at petting zoos,bus.law ann.west cum.supp.requiring petting zoos to post a sign at every exit strongly recommend ing that persons wash their hands upon exiting the petting zoo area and so on.
nor can the majority avoid the application of strict scrutiny to all sorts of justifiable governmental regulations by relying on this court many subcategories and exceptions to the rule.the court h
