opinion of the court 
in this case,we consider the impact of the exclusivity provision of the federal employees compensation act feca,c,on contribution claims against the federal government.pursuant to this provision of feca,a federal employee recovery against the united states for injuries that he sustains on the job is limited to the fixed benefits to which he is entitled under the statutory compensation scheme.while the supreme court has twice held that the exclusivity provision does not,by its terms,bar contribution claims against the united states by third parties who are sued by such a federal employee,we must determine whether other principles apply to bring about such a bar in the case before us.the district court held that these contribution claims against the united states were barred because the substantive right to contribution in the maritime law is unavailable where the party against whom contribution is sought enjoys statutory immunity from liability to the injured plaintiff.we agree with the district court and will therefore affirm 
background 
this case originates from a failed attempt to tow a retired united states navy vessel,the uss guadalcanal,from the navy inactive ship maintenance facility in philadelphia to another navy facility in virginia.the navy contracted with owl associates,doing business as global associates,global,mcallister towing and transportation company,mcallister,and various other private parties to assist in the tow.the usns mohawk was assigned to do most of the towing.during the attempted tow,a portion of the mohawk towing gear assembly broke off and struck todd bruemmer,a civilian seaman employee of the united states stationed aboard the usns mohawk,in the side,causing injuries.
bruemmer and his wife filed a personal injury suit against mcallister and other private parties involved in the tow in the pennsylvania court of common pleas of philadelphia county.mcallister responded by filing a petition for exoneration from or limitation of liability in the district court pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure supplemental rules on admiralty and maritime claims,which stayed the state court proceedings.bruemmer and his wife then refiled their claims against mcallister and others in the district court.mcallister filed a complaint against the united states and global,the private contractor that arranged the tow,seeking contribution or indemnity for liability on the bruemmers claims.global filed a seeking contribution or indemnity against the united states,contending that the united states negligence contributed to bruemmer injuries.
the bruemmers did not name the united states as a defendant in either their state court or federal court complaint,presumably because the exclusivity provision of feca immunizes the united states from tort claims by its employees.like most workers compensation statutes,feca guarantees injured federal employees the right to receive immediate,fixed benefits,regardless of fault and without need for litigation from their employer,the federal government,in exchange for statutory immunity from personal injury claims.lockheed aircraft united states,d.the relevant portion of the statute provides 
the liability of the united states or an instrumentality thereof under this subchapter or any extension thereof with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the united states or the instrumentality to the employee,his legal representative,spouse,dependents,next of kin,and any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages from the united states or the instrumentality because of the injury or death in a direct judicial proceeding,in a civil action,or in admiralty,or by an administrative or judicial proceeding under a workmen compensation statute or under a federal tort liability statute.however,this subsection does not apply to a master or a member of a crew of a vessel.
the united states moved the district court for judgment on the pleadings on the contribution claims,arguing that feca exclusivity provision,described above,prohibited claims for contribution or indemnity against the united states that are based solely on the government status as a joint tortfeasor.the district court agreed and granted the government motion.analyzing the supreme court decisions in weyerhaeuser steamship united states,d,and lockheed aircraft united states,d,the district court found that this provision of feca does not directly bar contribution claims.its inquiry did not end there,however,because it noted that the substantive law governing the underlying contribution claims may bar such claims.in re mcallister towing transp,wl,at.the district court concluded that,although the substantive law governing mcallister and global contribution claims,the maritime law,recognizes a right of contribution between joint tortfeasors,that right is unavailable where the tortfeasor against whom contribution is sought enjoys statutory immunity from claims.id.at citing halcyon lines haenn ship ceiling refitting.and cooper stevedoring fritz kopke,d.because feca exclusivity clause immunizes the united states from bruemmer personal injury claims,the court concluded,application of the substantive law would result in protection of the united states from liability from contribution claims arising out of those claims.id.at.
ii.discussion 
the district court exercised jurisdiction over this case pursuant to the suits in admiralty act,et,and the public vessels act,et.our jurisdiction arises out of a,which provides for appellate review of interlocutory decrees in admiralty that determin e the rights and liabilities of the parties.our standard of review of a dismissal under.c is plenary.hayes cmty.osteopathic,cir.
on appeal,mcallister and global take issue with each aspect of the district court analysis.first,they dispute the district court reading of weyerhaeuser and lockheed,arguing that those cases stand for the broad proposition that feca exclusivity clause was not intended to affect rights.to allow feca to indirectly bar such claims,they contend,violates the spirit of those decisions.second,they challenge the district court analysis of the substantive contribution claim,urging that the supreme court cases on which the district court relied in order to conclude that the maritime common law right of contribution does not allow recovery in this case do not apply we will address these arguments by reviewing the case law on which they rely 
in weyerhaeuser,weyerhaeuser,a shipowner,sued the united states for damages that it suffered when its vessel collided with a united states army vessel.the district court found that the collision resulted from the mutual fault of both ships,and applied the settled admiralty rule of divided damages in collision cases,which allows each party to recover of provable damages and court costs from mutual fault collisions,d.the issue before the supreme court was whether feca exclusivity provision prevented weyerhaeuser from including a settlement paid to a federal civil service employee who was injured in the collision as part of its damage calculation for purposes of the divided damages rule.
the government contended that the language of the exclusivity provision foreclosing liability of the united states to any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages applied to preclude the shipowner recovery of these costs from the united states in a divided damages case.the court noted that this language followed specific categories of people related to the injured employee,and was not prepared to say that any other person otherwise entitled opened pandora box to anyone who might have a claim.however,it thought the language confusing enough to warrant an examination of the legislative history.in so doing,it discovered that the purpose behind the exclusivity provision was limited 
the purpose of s ection b,added in,was to establish that,as between the government on the one hand and its employees and their representatives or dependents on the other,the statutory remedy was to be exclusive.there is no evidence whatever that congress was concerned with the rights of unrelated third parties,much less of any purpose to disturb settled doctrines of admiralty law affecting the mutual rights and liabilities of private shipowners in collision cases.
id.at.accordingly,the supreme court found no bar against the shipowner inclusion of the settlement paid to the injured employee in calculating its damages for purposes of the divided damages rule.id.at.
before weyerhaeuser,we had held that the language of feca exclusivity provision barred a claim for contribution against the united states by a joint tortfeasor for damages paid to an injured government employee.see drake treadwell constr,cir contribution of a joint toward the satisfaction of a covered government employee judgment in tort seems as clearly within the language of section b as is total direct liability to the injured employee.the supreme court vacated our judgment and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of weyerhaeuser.treadwell constr.united states,d per curiam.the court remand order left us uncertain as to what to do in the next case before us.we explained our predicament in that case,travelers insurance united states,where a private party sought indemnity or contribution from the united states for damages paid to an injured government employee 
federal courts are in hopeless conflict concerning the proper interpretation of the weyerhaeuser and treadwell decisions the principal source of this conflict is the broad language in weyerhaeuser that there is no evidence that congress was concerned with the rights of unrelated third parties.

to make sense of this conflict,we surveyed the ways that other courts,faced with this confusion,had reacted.id.at.we noted that the fourth circuit court of appeals,in wallenius bremen united states,cir,had interpreted the weyerhaeuser language about the rights of third parties to mean that contribution claims are to be affirmatively permitted.travelers,at.in wallenius,the court found the government personal defense to suit by an injured worker to be irrelevant to the question of its liability for contribution or indemnity claims.at.most courts,however,had read weyerhaeuser more narrowly,as saying merely that the exclusivity provision did not create a bar.under their reading,other principles might still operate to bar contribution claims.we summarized this position as follows 
s ince the united states had no underlying tort liability to its injured employee,the exclusivity provision of the feca precludes a third party action for contribution or indemnity unless there exists a relationship between the third party and the united states independent of the tortious event,such as the contractual obligation in ryan or the admiralty rule of divided damages in weyerhaeuser,upon which recovery can be grounded.

we found the opinion of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit in united air lines wiener,cir,particularly convincing there,the court rejected united argument that the supreme court remand in treadwell indicated a repudiation of the principle that indemnity claims will fail where there is no underlying liability.id.at.applying that principle,it found that the absence of an independent basis of liability from the government to united,the third party,was fatal 
united claim for indemnity is not based upon a duty owed by the government to united by virtue of a contract,attenuated or otherwise,or by operation of a rule of law such as the divided damage rule of admiralty.there being no underlying liability on the part of the government,united claim for indemnity must fall.
id.at,quoted in travelers,at.finally,we noted that our own jurisprudence prohibited indemnity actions under the longshoremen and harbor worker compensation act lhwca.see brown,cir holding that there can be no action of indemnity under the lhwca which is not based on the violation of some contractual duty crawford pope talbot,cir concluding that lhwca exclusivity provision does not bar indemnity claims based on the contractual relationship between the employer and the third party because in such cases the indemnity has a claim which is independent of and does not derive from the injury to the employee based on our analysis,we held that the travelers plaintiffs could not recover from the united states on contribution or noncontractual tort indemnity claims for damages paid in a wrongful death and survival action brought by the widow of a deceased government employee.at.
nearly a decade after we issued our opinion in travelers,the supreme court was asked to revisit the meaning of the language of feca exclusivity provision and clarify its implications.in lockheed,it essentially held that there were no implications.recounting its reasoning in weyerhaeuser,it reinforced that ruling and stated that nothing in the exclusivity provision itself prevented or precluded recovery on any basis or theory by third parties against the government to the extent that the basis for the underlying cause of action could make any difference,the indemnity theories on which lockheed relies are as as the divided damages rule was in weyerhaeuser.at.importantly,the court affirmatively noted that the district court had determined that lockheed did,indeed,have a right to indemnity under the governing substantive law.id.at.
in essence,the court in lockheed explained that weyerhaeuser said only that the exclusivity provision was not directed at the situation of the contribution more,nothing less.so we must look,instead,to the underlying cause of action and determine whether it is viable based on the state of the law,which can include general legal principles as well as a particular statutory scheme.see,united states,cir t he viability of actions depend s on the underlying substantive law.just as the divided damages rule in collision cases had established the principle whereby the damages paid to the injured worker were included in the calculation in weyerhaeuser,so too the judicially recognized indemnity claim in the fact pattern in lockheed provided the basis for lockheed claim against the government.thus,the right to contribution or indemnity either does or does not exist as a matter of law,separate and apart from the exclusivity provision.
the courts of appeals that have examined this issue have reached a uniform conclusion,namely,that lockheed did not,as appellants contend,establish that the exclusivity provision never affects rights it merely directed courts to examine the underlying substantive basis of the third parties claims.see,walls,united states,cir,united states,bush,cir in re all maine asbestos,cir.
the substantive basis for appellants claims in this case is the right of contribution under maritime law.the supreme court explained the contours of this right more than a ago in halcyon lines haenn ship ceiling refitting.there,an employee of haenn ship ceiling refitting corporation sustained injuries while he was repairing a ship owned by halcyon lines.the employee sued halcyon,and halcyon impleaded haenn as a defendant.we held that halcyon had a right of contribution,but that haenn liability was limited to the amount that it would have had to pay its employee if the employee had elected to claim compensation under the applicable workers compensation statute,the lhwca.halcyon,at.citing baccile halcyon lines,cir.
both parties contested our holding before the supreme court.halcyon argued that it had a right to contribution based on the parties relative degrees of fault,while haenn disputed whether there was a right of contribution at all at most,it urged,the right should be based on an equal division of damages in keeping with the admiralty law rule of divided damages that applies in collision cases.id.at.the court declined to recognize any right of contribution under the circumstances,concluding,in light of the myriad issues involved,and wary of upsetting the intricate schemes for apportioning liability that congress had developed in the lhwca and related statutes,that legislative consideration and action can best bring about a fair accommodation of the diverse but related interests of the carr
