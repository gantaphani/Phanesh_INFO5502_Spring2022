noah nathan relator,a sales manager for takeda pharmaceuticals takeda,brought this qui tam action against his employer under the false claims act the act,through.relator alleges that takeda violated a a of the act by causing false claims to be presented to the government for payment under medicare and other federal health insurance programs after allowing relator to file a third amended complaint the amended complaint,the district court dismissed relator claims under federal rule of civil procedure b.in this appeal,relator argues that the district court erred in concluding that relator did not plausibly allege in the amended complaint that false claims had been presented to the government for payment,or that takeda caused the presentment of any such false claims.relator also contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying relator request for leave to file a fourth amended complaint.
upon our review,we hold that the district court did not err in dismissing the amended complaint,because relator failed to plausibly allege that any false claims had been presented to the government for payment.we further hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relator leave to file a fourth amended complaint.
among other things,the act prohibits any person from knowingly caus ing to be presented to the government false claims for payment or approval.a a.a false statement is actionable under the act only if it constitutes a false or fraudulent claim.harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir emphasis added.importantly,to trigger liability under the act,a claim actually must have been submitted to the federal government for reimbursement,resulting in a call upon the government fisc.see also hopper solvay,cir.
relator alleges in the amended complaint that prescriptions written for certain medical uses,which have not been approved by the food and drug administration the fda or included in statutorily specified compendia,are not reimbursable under federal health insurance programs.such uses commonly are referred to as uses.relator further alleges that because the cost of prescriptions for uses is not subject to reimbursement by the federal government,the presentment of these types of claims for payment constitutes a violation of the act 
in the amended complaint,relator additionally alleges that takeda marketed its prescription drug kapidex,a proton pump inhibitor used to treat various gastric conditions,for uses relator alleges that two of takeda marketing practices caused presentation of false claims to the government.the identified marketing practices were takeda promotion of kapidex to rheumatologists,who typically do not treat patients having conditions for which kapidex has been approved and takeda practice of marketing high doses of kapidex for the treatment of conditions for which only a lower dose has been approved by the fda.
in particular,relator alleges that mg doses of kapidex have been approved by the fda only for the treatment of the active condition of erosive esophagitis ee.however,kapidex has been approved by the fda at a lower mg dose to treat the more common condition of gastroesophogeal reflux disease gerd,as well as for the maintenance of already healed cases of ee.relator alleges that takeda has provided doctors with samples of kapidex exclusively in mg doses,irrespective whether such physicians treat active cases of ee.as relator further alleges,by this sampling practice,takeda improperly implies that a mg dose of kapidex is the only available dosage of that drug,thereby causing doctors to prescribe mg doses for unapproved conditions relator also alleges that takeda sales representatives regularly misled physicians by deflecting or dismissing their questions about proper dosages,and by making misrepresentations concerning the available dosages.
additionally,relator alleges that the motivation for takeda alleged fraudulent marketing stems from takeda desire to replicate the success of its previously approved drug,prevacid,the patent for which was set to expire in.prevacid has been approved to treat conditions,including gerd.prevacid also has been approved to provide gastric protection and to treat gastric ulcers,indications relevant to rheumatology patients who regularly take pain medications.in contrast,kapidex is not approved for these two conditions.relator alleges that because the patent expiration date for prevacid was approaching,takeda promoted kapidex to fill the prevacid void.
the district court dismissed the amended complaint on two independent grounds the amended complaint failed to allege the presentment of a false or fraudulent claim to the government for payment or approval under a a and the amended complaint failed to allege adequately that takeda caused the issuance of prescriptions the district court also denied relator request to amend his complaint for a fourth time.because we conclude that the district court properly dismissed the amended complaint based on relator failure to allege presentment of a false claim,we do not reach the additional question whether relator alleged sufficient facts to support the required causation element for a claim asserted under the act.we further hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relator motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint.
we review de novo the district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under.b.harrison,at.to survive a rule b motion to dismiss,a complaint must state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,citation omitted.facts that are merely consistent with liability do not establish a plausible claim to relief.id.citation omitted.in addition,although we must view the facts alleged in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,we will not accept legal conclusions couched as facts or unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions,or arguments.wag more dogs,llc cozart,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
before addressing the substantive allegations in the amended complaint,we first state the pleading requirements for claims brought under the act.in addition to meeting the plausibility standard of iqbal,fraud claims under the act must be pleaded with particularity pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.harrison,at.rule b provides 
in alleging fraud or mistake,a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.malice,intent,knowledge,and other conditions of a person mind may be alleged generally.
to satisfy rule b,a plaintiff asserting a claim under the act must,at a minimum,describe the time,place,and contents of the false representations,as well as the identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby.united states ex rel.wilson kellogg brown root,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the parties dispute the proper application of rule b in this case.in relator view,to meet the requirements for pleading a fraud claim under the act,a relator need only allege the existence of a fraudulent scheme that supports the inference that false claims were presented to the government for payment.in contrast,takeda argues that rule b requires that a relator plead facts plausibly alleging that particular,identifiable false claims actually were presented to the government for payment.
in view of the rationale underlying rule b,we decline to adopt relator argument for a more lenient application of the rule.we have adhered firmly to the strictures of rule b in applying its terms to cases brought under the act.see,wilson,at explaining the requirements of rule b and affirming dismissal for failing to comply harrison,at,same.the multiple purposes of rule b,namely,of providing notice to a defendant of its alleged misconduct,of preventing frivolous suits,of eliminat ing fraud actions in which all the facts are learned after discovery,and of protect ing defendants from harm to their goodwill and reputation,harrison,at citation omitted,are as applicable in cases brought under the act as they are in other fraud cases.indeed,such purposes may apply with particular force in the context of the act,given the potential consequences flowing from allegations of fraud by companies who transact business with the government.moreover,we have emphasized that a claim brought under the act that rest s primarily on facts learned through the costly process of discovery is precisely what rule b seeks to prevent.wilson,at see also harrison,at.for these reasons,nothing in the act or in our customary application of rule b suggests that a more relaxed pleading standard is appropriate in this case.
neither are we persuaded by relator contention that allegations of a fraudulent scheme,in the absence of an assertion that a specific false claim was presented to the government for payment,is a sufficient basis on which to plead a claim under the act in compliance with rule b.as the supreme court has cautioned,the act was not designed to punish every type of fraud committed upon the government.harrison,at citing united states mcninch.instead,the critical question is whether the defendant caused a false claim to be presented to the government,because liability under the act attaches only to a claim actually presented to the government for payment,not to the underlying fraudulent scheme.id.citing united states rivera,cir.therefore,when a relator fails to plead plausible allegations of presentment,the relator has not alleged all the elements of a claim under the act.see united states ex rel.clausen lab.of,cir w e can not be left wondering whether a plaintiff has offered mere conjecture or a specifically pleaded allegation on an essential element of the lawsuit.
we agree with the eleventh circuit observation that the particularity requirement of rule b does not permit a false claims act plaintiff merely to describe a private scheme in detail but then to allege simply and without any stated reason for his belief that claims requesting illegal payments must have been submitted,were likely submitted or should have been submitted to the government.id.at.rather,rule b requires that some indicia of reliability must be provided in the complaint to support the allegation that an actual false claim was presented to the government.id.indeed,without such plausible allegations of presentment,a relator not only fails to meet the particularity requirement of rule b,but also does not satisfy the general plausibility standard of iqbal.see clausen,at if rule b is to carry any water,it must mean that an essential allegation and circumstance of fraudulent conduct can not be alleged in such conclusory fashion.united states ex rel.joshi luke,cir requiring relator to provide some representative examples of the defendants alleged fraudulent conduct.
our conclusion is not altered by the cases cited by relator,in which courts have held that the requirements of rule b can be satisfied in the absence of particularized allegations of specific false claims.based on the nature of the schemes alleged in many of those cases,specific allegations of the defendant fraudulent conduct necessarily led to the plausible inference that false claims were presented to the government.
for example,in united states ex rel.grubbs kanneganti,cir,the relator alleged a conspiracy by doctors to seek reimbursement from governmental health programs for services that never were performed.the court concluded that,because the complaint included the dates of specific services that were recorded by the physicians but never were provided,such allegations constituted more than probable,nigh likely,circumstantial evidence that the doctors fraudulent records caused the hospital billing system in due course to present fraudulent claims to the government.id.at.accordingly,the court further concluded that it would stretch the imagination for the doctors to continually record services that were not provided,but to deviate from the regular billing track at the last moment so that the recorded,but unprovided,services never get billed.see also united states ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,cir holding that,in scheme alleging kickbacks to health care providers,allegations regarding the dates and amounts of the false claims filed by these providers with the medicare program met the standard imposed by rule b 
applying these principles,we hold that when a defendant actions,as alleged and as reasonably inferred from the allegations,could have led,but need not necessarily have led,to the submission of false claims,a relator must allege with particularity that specific false claims actually were presented to the government for payment.to the extent that other cases apply a more relaxed construction of rule b in such circumstances,we disagree with that approach.
in reaching this conclusion,we acknowledge the practical challenges that a relator may face in cases such as the present one,in which a relator may not have independent access to records such as prescription invoices,and where privacy laws may pose a barrier to obtaining such information without court involvement.nevertheless,our pleading requirements do not permit a relator to bring an action without pleading facts that support all the elements of a claim.see dickson microsoft,cir noting the basic pleading requirement that a plaintiff set forth facts sufficient to allege each element of his claim.we further emphasize,however,that the standard we articulate today does not foreclose claims under the act when a relator plausibly pleads that specific,identifiable claims actually were presented to the government for payment.of course,whether such factual allegations in a given case meet the required standard must be evaluated on a basis.
employing the above pleading standard,we turn to consider the sufficiency of the amended complaint in this case.relator relies on four categories of allegations in the amended complaint,which he contends state with particularity that takeda caused false claims to be presented to the government for payment.we address each set of allegations in turn,and conclude that,individually as well as collectively,relator allegations fail to allege an essential element of a claim under the act.
first,relator alleges in the amended complaint that takeda promoted kapidex to rheumatologists,who do not treat the conditions for which kapidex has been approved according to relator,when promoting kapidex to rheumatologists,takeda sales representatives equated kapidex with prevacid,even though kapidex was not approved for of the indications for which prevacid was approved,including the gastric conditions commonly suffered by rheumatology patients.relator further alleges that takeda sales representatives were instructed to promote kapidex to rheumatologists without disclosing that the drug is not approved for the gastric condition often experienced by rheumatology patients.
these allegations concerning the promotion of kapidex to rheumatologists fall far short of the pleading standards set forth in rule b and in iqbal.fatal to the claim,relator does not allege in the amended complaint that the targeted rheumatologists wrote any prescriptions that were submitted to the government for payment,a critical omission in a case brought under the act see united states ex rel.rost pfizer,cir holding that a complaint does not meet the requirements of rule when the complaint did not give notice to the defendant of false claims submitted by others for federal reimbursement of uses,only of illegal practices in promotion of the drug,overruled on other grounds by allison engine united ex rel.sanders.accordingly,relator has not plausibly alleged that takeda caused rheumatologists to write kapidex prescriptions for uses that actually were presented to the government for payment.
second,in the amended complaint,relator identifies primary care physicians pcps who received mg samples of kapidex from takeda and collectively wrote prescriptions for the drug that were submitted to the government for reimbursement.although relator alleges that these claims were presented to the government for payment,relator does not plausibly allege that the prescriptions were written for uses.
rather,relator alleges in the amended complaint that because pcps generally do not
