incorporated operates a website that allows consumers to comment on the quality of businesses,goods,and services.the present suit concerns various posts on this website relating to automobiles sold or serviced by nemet chevrolet,nemet.viewing certain of these postings as false and harmful to its reputation,nemet brought suit against in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia for defamation and tortious interference with a business expectancy moved to dismiss these claims,under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,as barred by of the communications decency act of cda,which precludes plaintiffs from holding interactive computer service providers liable for the publication of information created and developed by others see c,e,f zeran am.online,cir.
the district court granted the rule b motion,but gave nemet permission to file an amended complaint.upon filing of the amended complaint,again filed a rule b motion to dismiss based on of the cda.the district court granted the motion to dismiss,stating that the allegations contained in the amended complaint d o not sufficiently set forth a claim asserting that authored the content at issue.furthermore,the allegations are insufficient to take this matter outside of the protection of the communications decency act.joint appendix at.
nemet timely appealed the judgment of the district court and we have jurisdiction under.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court 
nemet claims,as pled in its amended complaint,are based on twenty specific posts on the website.as to these twenty posts,nemet argues its pleading was sufficient to withstand a rule b motion because the facts pled,viewed under the proper standard at this stage of the proceeding,show that was an information content provider under f of the cda and,therefore,not entitled to cda immunity.further,nemet contends that because its factual allegations are sufficient to negate the immunity bar claimed by,it should be entitled to discovery before any ruling on immunity would be appropriate as,for instance,under rule for summary judgment.
before we discuss the specific language nemet relies upon from its amended complaint,it is appropriate to briefly set forth the standard of review,the statutory and parameters of immunity under the cda,and the clarification of pleading standards recently addressed by the supreme court in ashcroft iqbal,d.
our review of the district court ruling on a motion to dismiss is de novo.see novell,microsoft,cir.because the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss,our review is de novo.like the district court,we must assume all facts to be true.trulock freeh,cir quotations and emphasis omitted.we also,like the district court,draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.see edwards city of goldsboro,cir.b ut we need not accept the legal conclusions drawn from the facts,and we need not accept as true unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions or arguments.giarratano johnson,cir quotations omitted.
recognizing that the internet provided a valuable and increasingly utilized source of information for citizens,congress carved out a sphere of immunity from state lawsuits for providers of interactive computer services to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market of ideas on the internet.b see also zeran,at.the cda bars the institution of a cause of action or imposition of liability under any state or local law that is inconsistent with the terms of.e.as relevant here,prohibits a provider or user of an interactive computer service from being held responsible as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.id.c.assuming a person meets the statutory definition of an interactive computer service provider,the scope of immunity turns on whether that person actions also make it an information content provider.the cda defines an information content provider as any person or entity that is responsible,in whole or in part,for the creation or development of information provided through the internet or any other interactive computer service.id.f.
taken together,these provisions bar plaintiffs from holding interactive computer service providers legally responsible for information created and developed by third parties.see fair hous.council,llc,cir en banc.congress thus established a general rule that providers of interactive computer services are liable only for speech that is properly attributable to them.see universal commc,lycos,cir.plaintiffs may hold liable the person who creates or develops unlawful content,but not the interactive computer service provider who merely enables that content to be posted online.see doe myspace,cir chicago lawyers comm.for civil rights under law,craigslist,cir zeran,at.
to further the policies underlying the cda,courts have generally accorded immunity a broad scope see lycos,at carafano,cir zeran,at.this circuit has recognized the obvious chilling effect the specter of tort liability would otherwise pose to interactive computer service providers given the prolific nature of speech on the internet.zeran,at.section immunity,like other forms of immunity,is generally accorded effect at the first logical point in the litigation process.as we have often explained in the qualified immunity context,immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability and it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.brown gilmore,cir quotations omitted emphasis in original.we thus aim to resolve the question of immunity at the earliest possible stage of the case because that immunity protects websites not only from ultimate liability,but also from having to fight costly and protracted legal battles,at.
nemet does not dispute that is an interactive computer service provider under the cda.what nemet contends is that is also an information content provider as to the twenty posts and,therefore,can not qualify for immunity.in other words,nemet argument is that its amended complaint pleads sufficient facts to show is an information content provider for purposes of denying statutory immunity to at this stage in the proceedings.
our analysis of the sufficiency of nemet pleading is informed by the supreme court recent decision in ashcroft iqbal,d iqbal,a former detainee taken into custody after the attacks of september,brought a bivens suit against several executive branch officials,alleging infringements of his first and fifth amendment rights.see iqbal.at.he pled,among other things,that the defendant executive branch officials adopted a policy of labeling arab muslim men as detainees and subjecting them to harsh conditions of confinement based solely on their religion,race,national origin.id.at.
because these allegations were conclusory restatements of the elements of a constitutional discrimination claim,the supreme court refused to accord them an assumption of truth for purposes of weighing a motion to dismiss under rule b.id.the court also rejected the sufficiency of iqbal supporting factual allegations,including his claim that the federal government detained thousands of arab muslim men.id.given the more likely explanation for these arrests,the government legitimate investigation into the september attacks,the court concluded that iqbal factual allegations did not plausibly establish the purposeful,invidious discrimination he asked it to infer.id.at.
as noted above,in evaluating a rule b motion to dismiss,a court accepts all facts as true and construes these facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff in weighing the legal sufficiency of the complaint.see id.at adcock freightliner llc,cir.but we also conclude from the analysis in iqbal that legal conclusions,elements of a cause of action,and bare assertions devoid of further factual enhancement fail to constitute facts for rule b purposes.see iqbal.at.we also decline to consider unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions,or arguments.wahi charleston area med,cir see also iqbal.at.
ultimately,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.iqbal.at quoting bell atl.twombly,d.facial plausibility is established once the factual content of a complaint allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.in other words,the complaint factual allegations must produce an inference of liability strong enough to nudge the plaintiff claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.id.at quoting twombly,at.
satisfying this test does not require detailed factual allegations.id.at quotations omitted.the complaint must,however,plead sufficient facts to allow a court,drawing on judicial experience and common sense,to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct.id.at.without such heft,id.at,the plaintiff claims can not establish a valid entitlement to relief,as facts that are merely consistent with a defendant liability,id.at,fail to nudge claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.id.at quotations omitted.
we must determine,in a context,whether the facts pled by nemet,as to the application of cda immunity,make its claim that is an information content provider merely possible or whether nemet has nudged that claim across the line from conceivable to plausible.id.at quoting twombly,at.
following the example set by the supreme court in iqbal we begin our analysis by identifying the allegations of the amended complaint that are either extraneous or not entitled to the assumption of truth.at.we then proceed to determine the plausibility of the factual allegations of nemet amended complaint pertaining to responsibility for the creation or development of the comments at issue.
facts alleged common to all posts 
in the amended complaint,nemet recited the specific language from each customer about his or her automobile complaint for each of the twenty posts it claimed were defamatory.then,nemet pled as to each of the posts as follows 
upon information and belief,defendant participated in the preparation of this complaint by soliciting the complaint,steering the complaint into a specific category designed to attract attention by consumer class action lawyers,contacting the consumer to ask questions about the complaint and to help her draft or revise her complaint,and promising the consumer that she could obtain some financial recovery by joining a class action lawsuit.defendant is therefore responsible,in whole or in part,for developing the substance and content of the false complaint about the plaintiffs.
see,at.nemet argues the foregoing the development paragraph pleads facts sufficient under f to show is responsible,in whole or in part,for the creation or development of the posts so as to be a information content provider.f.in short,nemet argues the language in the development paragraph shows culpability as an information content provider either through the structure and design of its website,or its participation in the preparation of consumer complaints,that solicit ed its customers complaints,steered them into specific categor ies designed to attract attention by consumer class action lawyers,contact ed customers to ask questions about their complaints and to help them draft or revise their complaints,and promis ed customers would obtain some financial recovery by joining a class action lawsuit.see,at.
we first examine the structure and design of the website argument,which encompasses all the facts pled in the development paragraph except for the claim asked questions and help ed draft or revise her complaint.at.nemet cites to the ninth circuit court of appeals opinion in fair housing council,llc,cir to support its structure and design of the website arguments.however,we do not find persuasive because it is fundamentally distinguishable and the facts pled here do not show developed the content of the posts by the structure and design of its website.
in,the ninth circuit considered whether the operator of a website created to match individuals with spare rooms with prospective renters was entitled to immunity.see at.the website operator,in that case,required users to disclose their sex,family status,and sexual orientation,as well as those of their desired roommate,using a list of responses.see id.at.unless a prospective user furnished this information,he or she would be unable to utilize the website.because the website operator had designed its website to develop unlawful content as a condition precedent of use,the ninth circuit held that the operator was an information content provider for the discriminatory postings created by third parties.see id.at.as a result,the website operator was not entitled to immunity.see id.
website differs materially from that at issue in.whereas the website in required users to input illegal content as a necessary condition of use,nemet has merely alleged that structured its website and its business operations to develop information related to.but there is nothing unlawful about developing this type of content it is a legal undertaking federal rule of civil procedure,for instance,specifically provides for suits.
the ninth circuit did not hold that a website operator becomes an information content provider because the information posted on its website may be developed in a way unrelated to its initial posting,such as its potential to further a lawsuit.merely adopted a definition of development,for purposes of f,that includes materially contributing to a given piece of information alleged unlawfulness.id.at see also f.
the theory of liability adopted in,therefore,does not aid the sufficiency of nemet amended complaint.as the ninth circuit noted,a website operator who does not encourage illegal content or design its website to require users to input illegal content is immune under of the cda,at.even accepting as true all of the facts nemet pled as to liability for the structure and design of its website,the amended complaint does not show,or even intimate,that contributed to the allegedly fraudulent nature of the comments at issue.iqbal.at.thus,as to these claimed facts in the development paragraph,nemet pleading not only fails to show it is plausible that is an information content provider,but not that it is even a likely possibility.
we now turn to the remaining factual allegations,common to all twenty posts from the development paragraph,that is an information content provider because it contacted the consumer to ask questions about the complaint and to help her draft or revise her complaint.see,at.nemet fails to make any cognizable argument as to how a website operator who contacts a potential user with questions thus develops or creates the website content.assuming it to be true that contacted the consumers to ask some unknown question,this bare allegation proves nothing as to nemet claim is an information content provider.
the remaining claim,of revising or redrafting the consumer complaint,fares no better.nemet has not pled what ostensibly revised or redrafted or how such affected the post.threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.iqbal.at.nemet claim of revising or redrafting is both threadbare and conclusory.
moreover,in view of our decision in zeran,nemet was required to plead facts to show any alleged drafting or revision by was something more than a website operator performs as part of its traditional editorial function.see at.it has failed to plead any such facts.congress enacted broad immunity to remove disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to restrict their children access to objectionable or inappropriate online material.b.in line with this purpose,forbids the imposition of publisher liability on a service provider for the exercise of its editorial and functions.id.at.
we thus conclude that the development paragraph failed,as a matter of law,to state facts upon which it could be concluded that it was plausible that was an information content provider.accordingly as to the development paragraph,the district court did not err in granting the rule b motion to dismiss because nemet failed to plead facts
