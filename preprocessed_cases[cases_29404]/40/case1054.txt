opinion of the court 
melrose,melrose brought this action challenging the pittsburgh zoning board rejection of its applications to change the identification signs on five pittsburgh buildings.the proposed building names included building and.the zoning board determined that the signs were advertising signs and were therefore prohibited in the zoning districts where melrose buildings were located.in reaching this decision,the zoning board applied four criteria that it had articulated in a prior decision for determining whether a sign with advertising aspects could still be classified as a genuine identification sign.melrose challenged this decision in the district court,arguing that the zoning board rejection of its sign applications violated its first amendment free speech and fourteenth amendment equal protection rights.the district court rejected melrose claims,applying central hudson gas electric public commission of new york,which provides the standard for assessing restrictions on commercial speech.
in our view,melrose first amendment claim is not controlled by central hudson,but instead should be evaluated under the test we delineated in rappa new castle county,cir.applying rappa,we hold that the zoning board application of the criteria constituted a permissible analysis.we also conclude that melrose equal protection claims must fail as melrose is simply not similarly situated to the entities that it claims were treated differently.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
between may and february,melrose,a pennsylvania corporation,executed lease agreements with the owners of five pittsburgh buildings.each lease granted melrose the right to name the building and to construct and display signs on the building with that name,as well as the right to sublease or assign these naming rights.the leases,which varied in length from six to years,did not limit the number of times that melrose could change a building name 
starting in february,melrose filed applications with the city zoning administrator to erect building identification signs on the five properties.the process went smoothly and the requested names were approved.the building at east ohio street was named ram staiger,a combination of the building owner name and a business on the premises the nearby building at east ohio street was named caskey limited,after the girlfriend of one of melrose officers.a building at west carson street was named the three rivers building,and one at bates street was named the cole building,after the son of a melrose officer.the fifth building,at beaver avenue,was named sssp.
in march,melrose submitted applications to rename each of the five buildings and change their signage.the cole building was to be renamed the building.the application included a drawing of one proposed sign,feet wide and twenty feet high,with repeated on four separate lines and the word building below that on a fifth line.the sssp and caskey limited buildings were both to be renamed.the ram staiger building name was to be changed to baruch atah hashem,a hebrew expression that means blessed be god.a signage application was also submitted for the three rivers building,but it did not specify the new name.at a hearing before the zoning board,however,the president of melrose testified that he intended to change the name of this building to.melrose did not propose any changes to the location,size,or shape of the signs already in place on the buildings,but instead sought to change only the signs content.
the pittsburgh zoning code zoning code distinguishes between three categories of signs.these definitions are important as melrose sought to have its signs,with the proposed new names,remain classified as identification signs.identification signs are permitted in certain zones that prohibit advertising signs.pittsburgh code of ordinances.section of the zoning code,in effect at the time of melrose applications,provided these definitions 
advertising sign means a sign that directs attention to a business,commodity,service or entertainment,conducted,sold or offered 
a only elsewhere than upon the premises where the sign is displayed or 
b as a minor and incidental activity upon the premises where the sign is displayed.
business sign means a sign that directs attention to a business,organization,profession or industry located upon the premises where the sign is displayed to the type of products sold,manufactured or assembled to the service or entertainment offered on such premises except a sign pertaining to the preceding if such activity is only minor and incidental to the principal use of the premises.
identification sign means a sign used to identify the name of the individual or organization occupying the premises the profession of the occupant the name of the building on which the sign is displayed or the name of the major enterprise or principal product or service on the premises.
at.in addition to only being permitted in certain zoning districts,advertising signs are subject,under,to more rigorous regulations,with respect to location,placement,size,shape,and illumination,than signs.these restrictions further the purposes of the code sign regulations,which include allowing advertising signs only in locations that neither lessen the visual attributes of the city through the placement of such signs,nor cause confusion,safety problems or lessen the ability to identify local businesses through visual clutter.pittsburgh code of ordinances.
finding that the proposed signs content represented advertising,the zoning administrator denied all of melrose applications.the five buildings were in zoning districts where the zoning code generally prohibited advertising signs,but allowed business signs and identification signs.melrose appealed these decisions to the zoning board,which conducted consolidated hearings.it denied all five appeals in separate decisions.
the zoning board found that the proposed signs for the buildings to be named and building represented a plan or strategy of evasion,which sought to avoid the zoning code restrictions on advertising signs.at.as for the building to be named baruch atah ashem,which melrose described as a religious message,the zoning board found that this name did not fit within the zoning code definition for an identification sign.id.at.the city of pittsburgh had sent the zoning board a letter advising that there was no legal basis for denying this application on the grounds that it had no advertising component and was a valid building name.without addressing the city position,the zoning board denied the application but invited melrose to brief the possible constitutional implications of this particular decision.melrose did not,however,pursue the matter further at the zoning board level.as for the fifth building,which melrose did not provide a new name for in its application,the zoning board found that the zoning administrator should not have made a decision until the application was completed.it remanded to the zoning administrator so that melrose could submit an amended application,but a new application was never submitted.
one month before its decisions on melrose appeals,the zoning board had approved signs for heinz field,a major football stadium that is home to the national football league pittsburgh steelers and the university of pittsburgh football team.the heinz company heinz had entered into a sponsorship agreement with the steelers and had spent million to obtain the naming rights to the stadium for a period of twenty years.neighborhood organizations challenged the proposed signage at heinz field,arguing that the signs were advertising signs rather than identification signs and therefore prohibited.in an interim decision in the case,issued on august,the zoning board acknowledged that certain identification signs,which mention the name of a company or product,may also have an advertising aspect.accordingly,it identified four attributes that an identification sign with an advertising component must possess to avoid being categorized as an advertising sign.the four criteria included first,one of the sign major purposes is to establish a destination point generally recognized by the public at a specific location second,the established location is important to a material segment of the public for example,a sports,cultural,commercial or artistic venue third,there must be evidence of intended longevity of the sign adequate to sustain the designation point concept and fourth,either the owner of the facility or its principal user should be in control of the destiny of the sign,rather than a third party.pl.mot.for.summ.at pittsburgh zoning board of adjustment,interim decision in zone case of.these criteria were subsequently cited in the decisions rejecting melrose applications,although in a slightly different formulation.in its decision applying these criteria and approving the heinz field signage,the board recognized the advertising component of naming rights but emphasized that the steelers lengthy lease agreement for the stadium and the lengthy sponsorship agreement reached with heinz reflected a commitment that the stadium will be known to the general public as heinz field.at.it concluded that the naming was not a subterfuge to circumvent the code limitations on advertising but instead a legitimate attempt to name the stadium,albeit with a natural consequence of advertising and marketing benefits for heinz.id.
in its subsequent decisions rejecting melrose applications,the zoning board offered a slightly different articulation of the attributes that it would consider necessary for a purported identification sign to avoid being categorized as an advertising sign.at.these included that 
one of its major purposes of,or result of,an identification sign must be to establish a specific destination point that will be generally recognized by the public as being at a set geographical location.there must be evidence of intended longevity of the sign adequate to sustain the designated point concept.it can not be as transitory as a commercial billboard.however,it need not be immune from unexpected,unforeseen or unwelcome circumstances that might result in a termination.either the owner of the facility or a principal long term space user thereof should be in control of the destiny of any such sign,rather than having control turned over to some third party,to assure continuing compliance with the necessary attributes.
in applying these criteria to melrose applications,the board expressed particular concern with the longevity requirement and with the transfer of building identification rights,which it noted may lead to frequent changes for commercial purposes.frequent changes in the content of signs and a lack of longevity were deemed inconsistent with the purposes of building identification the public towards a specific geographical location.the zoning board distinguished melrose failure to provide evidence of an intention to keep the building names for a substantial period of time from the agreement entered into by the steelers and heinz.it also noted in its decisions that melrose representative had testified that the purpose of the signs was to direct individuals to the website business in order to make a profit.
melrose filed this action in the western district of pennsylvania,alleging that city of pittsburgh,the pittsburgh zoning board,and the three individual members of the zoning its first and fourteenth amendment rights by arbitrarily denying its sign applications.melrose asserted two claims pursuant to section first,that defendants deprived it of its first amendment free speech rights when they impermissibly limited the content of its signs and second,that defendants deprived it of its fourteenth amendment equal protection rights by treating similarly situated entities more favorably.melrose also brought a third claim pursuant to the equal protection clause of the pennsylvania constitution.
the case was referred to a magistrate judge for pretrial proceedings.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation regarding defendants motion for summary judgment and melrose motion for partial summary judgment,recommending that the district court grant defendants summary judgment motion and deny melrose motion.the magistrate judge evaluated melrose first amendment claims in light of central hudson gas electric public commission of new york,which sets forth a framework for assessing restrictions on commercial speech.under this analysis,the court 
must determine whether the expression is protected by the first amendment.for commercial speech to come within that provision,it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.next,we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.if both inquiries yield positive answers,we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted,and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.
central hudson,at.the magistrate judge found the proposed speech to be misleading,but nonetheless proceeded to examine the remaining factors.the magistrate judge concluded that the city had a substantial interest in restricting the placement of advertising signs,that the denial of melrose signs substantially advanced this interest,and that the regulation was not overly restrictive.the magistrate judge also rejected melrose equal protection claims,finding that since the regulations passed muster under central hudson commercial speech test,they necessarily survived equal protection analysis.
melrose filed objections and the district court conducted a de novo review of the record.the district court adopted the report and recommendation in part and rejected it in part,ultimately granting defendants motion for summary judgment.the court,applying central hudson,rejected the magistrate judge finding that the proposed building names were misleading.nonetheless,it ultimately adopted the report and recommendation conclusion that the regulations constituted valid restrictions on commercial speech and did not violate melrose first amendment rights.the court held that the application related to the building melrose intended to name baruch atah hashem was not properly before it because melrose had failed to reapply and brief the possible constitutional claim related to that application.melrose does not raise this issue on appeal.the district court rejected melrose argument that the term building identification sign is unconstitutionally vague,either on its face or as applied.finally,the court rejected three additional objections to the report and recommendation and found that,even if summary judgment was not appropriate,the individual defendants were entitled to immunity.melrose filed a timely notice of appeal.

as melrose clarified at oral argument,its challenge focuses on the zoning board method of applying the sign ordinances and determining whether a purported identification sign,which has an advertising aspect,can still properly be classified as an identification sign.the district court decision analysed melrose claims by applying the framework articulated in central hudson.while we agree with the district court the zoning board decisions rejecting melrose sign applications did not violate melrose first and fourteenth amendment hold that the proper framework for evaluating these claims is governed by our decision in rappa new castle county,cir 
melrose first amendment claim 
in rappa,we articulated a framework for determining whether a statute is or.this determination is the first step in a first amendment analysis,as the answer dictates the standard that we apply in reviewing the ordinance at issue.rappa,at quoting police dep t of chi.mosley,see also riel city of bradford,cir.if the statute is,the government must show that the regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.rappa,at quoting boos barry,internal quotation marks omitted.if instead the statute is found to be in that it merely restricts the total quantity of speech by regulating the time,the place or the manner in which one can speak,a very different test applies.id.citations omitted.under this test,the government is permitted to impose reasonable restrictions on the time,place,or manner of protected speech,provided the restrictions are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.ward rock against racism,quoting clark cmty.for creative,further citation omitted.
melrose contends that the zoning code was applied to its applications in a manner and that no showing was made of a compelling state interest.in response,the city argues that the sign ordinance was applied in a permissible manner.in riel,a case also involving first amendment challenges to municipal sign ordinances,we observed that determining whether a statute is or has not been entirely straightforward.at.riel analyzed and applied the framework that we set forth in rappa for making this determination.
rappa likewise involved a first amendment challenge to outdoor sign ordinances.in seeking to determine the current state of first amendment law pertaining to outdoor signs,we discussed at length the supreme court splintered decision in metromedia,city of san diego,which dealt with a san diego ordinance regarding billboards.rappa,at.we found that a clear governing standard could not be derived from the plurality and concurrence in metromedia and concluded that,given significant differences between the ordinances at issue in both cases,the result in metromedia did not control our decision in rappa.id.at.instead,we articulated and then applied a analysis for determining whether a restriction on speech,including a sign ordinance,is or.we explained in rappa that s ome signs are more important than others because 
they are more related to the particular location than are other signs.allowing such signs while banning others is not discriminating in favor of the content of these signs rather,it is accommodating the special nature of such signs so that the messages they contain have an equal chance to be communicated.
id.at.as an example,we noted that a sign identifying a commercial establishment is more important on its premises than is a sign advertising an unrelated product.id.
determining whether a sign is related to the location where it is placed inevitably demands a consideration of the sign content.but this consideration does not by itself constitute a lack of neutrality as to specific content.summing up our analysis,we held in rappa that 
w hen there is a significant relationship between the content of particular speech and a specific location or its use,the state can exempt from a general ban speech having that content so long as the state did not make the distinction in an attempt to censor certain viewpoints or to control what issues are appropriate for public debate and so long as the exception also survives the test proposed by the metromedia concurrence,the state must show that the exception is substantially related to advancing an important state interest that is at least as important as the interests advanced by the underlying regulation,that the exception is no broader than necessary to advance the special goal,and that the exception is narrowly drawn so as to impinge as little as possible on the overall goal.
id.at internal footnotes omitted we outlined two ways through which the requirement that a sign be significantly related to a specific location might be satisfied.first,a sign could be particularly important to travelers on a nearby road,such as a directional sign.second,it could be shown that a sign better conveys its information in its particular location than it could anywhere example,an address sign.id.hence,as we summarized in riel,the core of rappa holding is that exceptions such as those at issue in this case do not constitute restrictions that we analyze using a strict scrutiny framework.instead,we employ a more flexible,approach.riel,at.
before applying the rappa framework to the ordinance in this case,we first frame the issue before us.the pittsburgh zoning code bans what it defines as advertising signs from certain areas of the city,including those in which the buildings at issue in this case are located.however,the zoning code permits signs classified as identification signs within those same zoning districts.ordinances that exempt identification signs from a general ban on signs represent a classic application of rappa rule.id.at.such signs clearly better convey their information at the location they are intended to identify,rendering them similar to address signs.id.they also promote public order by providing the public with information regarding specific buildings.id.at.
the more complex issue in this case,however,is presented by the fact that melrose seeks to classify its signs,which admittedly possess an advertising component,as identification signs.it claims that the signs do not merely advertise a web address,but in fact name the buildings they adorn.the zoning code,by not allowing advertising signs within the relevant zoning districts,creates a general ban on advertising speech in those areas.however,the four criteria that the zoning board has articulated and applied in the heinz field case and in melrose cases allow for an exception to this general ban when such advertising is conveyed through a sign that,although it has advertising characteristics,remains a genuine identification sign.
as the zoning board declared in its decision approving the heinz field signs,w here a sign has components of advertising and identification,we must determine whether the purported building identification is genuine or merely an effort to utilize the location as an advertising vehicle.at.the four criteria articulated by the zoning board for making this determination provide a framework for evaluating whether a significant relationship exists between the content of such signs and the specific location in which they are placed.see rappa,at.there is no indication that the city sought to censor certain viewpoints when it articulated and applied these criteria.id.at.we therefore conclude that the city four criteria satisfy the first part of the test we set forth in rappa.
accordingly,we proceed to the second portion of the rappa framework.here,we consider whether the zoning board certain identification signs that have an advertising component,but that by satisfying the four criteria indicate that they are still a genuine identification the test set forth in the metromedia concurrence.under this test we first examine whether the exception is substantially related to advancing an important state interest that is at least as important as the interests advanced by the underlying regulation.id.the city clearly has an important interest in allowing the public to identify a particular name with a geographic location,enabling the public to recognize and find these locations a sign located at the structure that it names better conveys its information in that location than it could anywhere else.riel,at.the four criteria serve this interest by creating a narrow exception that allows for a small number of identification signs,which also possess advertising aspects,when there are facts that indicate that the true intent behind the sign is to identify the premises where it is located and that the name depicted will remain constant for a significant period of time.the signs at issue in this case,
