this dispute focuses on communications between clark realty capital,llc clark and the department of the army army.the appellant,american management services,llc,pinnacle pinnacle,claims that the army unlawfully withheld many of these communications in violation of the freedom of information act foia.the district court granted summary judgment to the army,and pinnacle appeals from that judgment.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
acting under the authority granted to it by the military housing privatization initiative,see,the army has privatized family housing at several army installations,including fort benning in georgia and fort belvoir in virginia.to effect this privatization,according to the parties,the army sought bids from the private sector to develop,own,operate,manage,and maintain family housing.at both fort benning and fort belvoir,clark teamed up with pinnacle to compete for the housing projects.
at fort benning,clark and pinnacle formed clark pinnacle benning,llc cpbenning.clark owned of cpbenning and served as its managing member.pinnacle owned the remaining of cpbenning.once cpbenning was awarded the housing project,cpbenning and the army formed fort benning family communities,llc fbfc,with cpbenning owning of fbfc and the army owning the remaining.clark served as the managing member of fbfc.american management services east,llc amse,a subsidiary of pinnacle,served as the property manager for fbfc.
the arrangement at fort belvoir was slightly different and more complicated.clark and pinnacle initially formed two entities clark pinnacle belvoir,llc cpbelvoir and belvoir holdings,llc.these two entities,owned by clark and by pinnacle,then formed fort belvoir residential communities,llc fbrc.clark served as the managing member for fbrc,and amse served as its property manager the army did not own any part of fbrc however,belvoir land,llc,an entity owned by the army and by cpbelvoir,leased land to fbrc for the development of housing.
in,clark contends it discovered evidence of alleged fraud being committed by pinnacle as a result,by may,clark had decided to appoint a replacement property manager for both fbfc and fbrc and to initiate litigation against pinnacle.in order for fbfc and fbrc to appoint a replacement property manager and to initiate litigation,however,clark was obligated by the companies operating agreements to obtain the army approval.clark met with the army on may,and provided the army with a binder of documents prepared by clark outside counsel,kirkland ellis.the documents contained in the binder were meant to provide the army with evidence of the fraudulent conduct that clark alleged.after viewing these documents,the army,on may,approved of clark proposed course of action.six days later,clark,on behalf of fbfc and fbrc,filed a lawsuit against pinnacle in the superior court of muscogee county,georgia the georgia litigation,seeking,among other things,a declaratory judgment that the property management agreements at forts benning and belvoir were automatically terminated as a result of pinnacle alleged misconduct.the army is not a party to the georgia litigation.however,after the army gave its approval to clark,and during the pendency of the georgia litigation,which is ongoing,clark and the army continued to correspond about the litigation and about the management of the military housing projects generally.
through the discovery process in the georgia litigation,pinnacle sought the binder provided to the army by clark and various other communications between clark and.fbfc and fbrc objected to the discovery requests,asserting various privileges.instead of moving to compel disclosure of these documents or challenging the validity of the assertions of privilege,pinnacle submitted a foia request to the army.in that request,pinnacle sought,among other things,a ll records of any nature referring directly to pending litigation or matters known to be directly related to the georgia litigation and a ll records submitted or requested by clark.j.on february,a government official provided pinnacle with an interim release of documents.believing that this interim release was unresponsive to its foia request and that the army had violated foia by failing to timely respond to its request,pinnacle filed the instant foia action in the eastern district of virginia.in its complaint,pinnacle sought a declaration that the army had violated foia and sought an order compelling the army to produce all responsive records and provide pinnacle with an index of all responsive documents,pursuant to vaughn rosen,requiring agencies to correlate documents withheld with a specific foia exemption and the agency nondisclosure justification.
on may,the army issued its final administrative decision on pinnacle foia request.in that decision,the army acknowledged that pages of responsive documents remained after accounting for the interim release of pages.of the pages of responsive documents,the army released pages,withheld pages claiming they were either in pinnacle possession already or contained only boilerplate language and withheld the remaining pages based on exemptions and of foia.see b.subsequent to this administrative release,the army answered pinnacle complaint,filed a motion for summary judgment,and attached a vaughn index to the motion.pinnacle opposed the army motion and filed a for summary judgment.
in addressing these motions,the district court first grouped the documents at issue into three separate categories,an organizational approach that we will follow.category a contained correspondence and memoranda internal to the army category b contained correspondence between the army and clark or between the army and clark outside counsel and category c contained documents submitted by clark to the army.the district court found that the category a and b documents fell within exemption of foia,see b,and that the category c documents fell within exemption of the statute,see id.b.the district court,therefore,denied pinnacle motion and granted the army motion.pinnacle now appeals from that grant of summary judgment.
the basic purpose of foia is to ensure an informed citizenry,vital to the functioning of a democratic society,needed to check against corruption and to hold the governors accountable to the governed.nlrb robbins tire rubber.accordingly,under foia,when any person makes a sufficiently specific and reasonable request for records from a government agency,the agency shall make the records promptly available.a a.however,because public disclosure is not always in the public interest,baldrige shapiro,the statute contains nine exemptions that reflect a wide array of concerns,hunton williams doj,cir,and are designed to safeguard various public interests against the harms that would arise from overbroad disclosure,hanson agency for int l,cir.
foia exemptions are to be narrowly construed.fbi abramson.the government has t he burden of demonstrating that a requested document falls under an exemption,hunton williams,at,which it can satisfy by describing the withheld material with reasonable specificity and explaining how it falls under one of the enumerated exemptions,hanson,at.whether a document falls within a prescribed exemption,and therefore whether a district court properly granted the government summary judgment,is a question of law that we review de novo.see ethyl epa,cir.
on appeal,pinnacle challenges the district court ruling with respect to the documents in categories b and c only following the order in which the parties have raised these issues in their briefing,we begin by addressing the category c documents.
the bulk of the category c documents were prepared by clark outside counsel and were contained in the binder clark gave to the army when seeking its approval to appoint a replacement property manager and to initiate litigation the district court concluded that the category c documents fell within exemption,which provides that foia does not apply to matters that are trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.b.to establish that exemption applies,the government must therefore show that the documents at issue are trade secrets or commercial or financial information,that were obtained from a person outside the government,and are privileged or confidential.acumenics research tech.doj,cir.pinnacle concedes that the army can satisfy the first two elements of this test because the category c documents were commercial in nature and were obtained from a person outside of the government.the only question,then,is whether the category c documents are privileged or confidential.
pinnacle and the army focus their category c arguments on confidentiality and give short shrift to the issue of privilege,mentioning the issue mostly in footnotes in their briefs.and the district court,upon finding the category c documents to be confidential,did not reach the issue of privilege.because we agree that the documents are confidential,we likewise do not address the question of privilege.
adopting a test formulated by the circuit in national parks conservation association morton,the national parks test,we have held that i nformation is confidential if its disclosure is likely to impair the government ability to obtain necessary information in the future,or cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.acumenics research,at quoting parks conservation ass n,at.the army does not attempt to justify its category c withholdings under the prong of this test.therefore,in determining whether the category c documents are confidential and,thus,fall within exemption,we resolve only the narrow issue of whether the army satisfied its burden of showing that disclosure of the documents would impair the government ability to obtain necessary information in the future.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
to satisfy its burden,the army provided the district court with two affidavits.ronald buchholz,the army associate deputy general counsel,stated in his affidavit that public disclosure of documents similar to the category c documents would likely result in clark or a similar entity being less willing to share information with the army,which would adversely impact process es with regard to taking actions on behalf of a housing llc.and joseph calcara,deputy assistant secretary of the army for installations,housing,and partnerships,likewise concluded that to ensure that the army access to high quality information is not impeded,the army must keep information provided by clark and similarly situated entities confidential to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.giving substantial weight to these affidavits as we are required to do,see a b,we find,in our de novo review,that public disclosure of the category c documents would impair the government ability to obtain necessary information in the future.
the category c documents,most of which were prepared by clark outside counsel,include audit reports,other internal documents,and investigative findings.clark purpose in providing these documents to the army was to present the army with evidence of pinnacle alleged wrongdoing in order to get the army approval to terminate and sue pinnacle.therefore,as indicated in the vaughn index,the documents contained internal financial and business information about fbfc and fbrc,as well as evidence of the deliberative processes used by counsel for clark to cull down the relevant documents and present them in a manner to achieve clark objective.we have no hesitation in concluding that clark would prefer not to disclose such documents to the public.disclosure,in our view,would likely have a chilling effect on a company decision to initiate litigation in the first place,or,alternatively,to provide a government agency with the same quality and quantity of information that it might otherwise receive.accordingly,we conclude that public disclosure would impair the government ability to get this necessary information in the future and that the documents in category c are,therefore,confidential and fall within exemption 
acknowledging that the army,and not pinnacle,has the burden to establish application of a foia exemption,we nonetheless briefly address pinnacle arguments on appeal.pinnacle did not provide the district court with an affidavit attempting to controvert the conclusions of buchholz and calcara with regard to future impairment.instead,pinnacle first argues that the impairment test for confidentiality is altogether inapposite.according to pinnacle,because clark was contractually obligated to get the army approval,public disclosure of documents would never impair the government ability to obtain them.this contention misses the point.it is true that clark was contractually obligated to get the army approval to terminate pinnacle property management contracts and to sue pinnacle.however,clark was under no obligation to take the actions in the first place,nor was it obligated to provide the army with a certain quantity or quality of information pursuant to the parties operating agreements.a chilling effect on these decisions the decision to initiate litigation and the decision to provide thorough and exhaustive documentation would no doubt impair the government ability to obtain necessary information about possible fraud and mismanagement.in the context of a partnership,if the cost of reporting fraud and mismanagement involved public disclosure of confidential financial and business information,private companies would be less apt to report fraud,and less fraud would,therefore,be uncovered.in this case,the fact that clark had to get the army approval under the parties agreements if it chose to initiate litigation is not determinative in the impairment calculus in our view.
pinnacle also contends that any additional or more thorough information that might be provided under an assurance of its nondisclosure is not the necessary information foia seeks to ensure is available in the future.brief of appellant at.but whether pinnacle thinks the information is necessary is not the relevant inquiry.see to org.for women office workers fed.reserve,cir interpreting the word necessary in exemption to reflect congress purpose to protect information which would be particularly helpful to agency officials in carrying out their mandate and rejecting argument that information withheld must be necessary in the sense of being absolutely essential to the operations of the agency or to the governing process itself first emphasis added see also national parks,at unless persons having necessary information can be assured that it will remain confidential,they may decline to cooperate with officials and the ability of the government to make intelligent,well informed decisions will be impaired.emphasis added.thus,contrary to pinnacle assertions,we find that in the context of the partnerships at issue in this case,having thorough and information would be particularly helpful to the army in making intelligent,well informed decisions about whether to take action against pinnacle for its alleged wrongdoing.
we turn now to the category b documents and consider whether they fall within exemption.the category b documents consist of communications between the army and clark or between the army and clark outside counsel,all of which took place after may,when the army gave clark its approval to initiate a lawsuit.the district court found that the category b documents fell within exemption,which excludes from the foia disclosure obligation interagency or memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.b.to fall within exemption,a document must be and fall within a discovery privilege.see rein patent trademark office,cir.on appeal,pinnacle does not challenge the army ability to establish that the communications are privileged,and we find that the government can satisfy the privilege prong.thus,we are left to resolve the issue of whether the category b documents are documents.
although clark,the source of the documents,is not a government agency,in some circumstances a document prepared outside the government may nevertheless qualify as an intraagency memorandum under exe
