prince george county public schools the school board appeals from the district court partial rejection of the board assertion of immunity under the eleventh amendment.although it recognized that the board enjoys some measure of eleventh amendment immunity,the court ruled that the state of maryland has waived such immunity for damage claims of or less.see lee thomas bd.of educ.of prince george,cv,the opinion as explained below,we agree with the district court and affirm.

on february,the district court issued its opinion,granting the board summary judgment motion only insofar as lee thomas damage claim exceeded in so doing,the opinion adhered to the precedent of the court of appeals of maryland,the highest court of the state.in,that court concluded that the enactment of a state statute,see,cts.jud.proc.c the immunity provision,effectuated a waiver of a county board of education eleventh amendment immunity for all claims in the amount of or less.bd.of educ.of balt.cnty.zimmer rubert,the opinion also granted lee thomas motion to amend her complaint.on march,the board moved for reconsideration of the opinion,which the court denied on june.on june,the board filed its notice of appeal we possess jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to review a denial of eleventh amendment immunity,in that such a ruling is deemed a final decision under.see aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d.

the board contends that the district court erred in deferring to the decision of the court of appeals of maryland in board of education of baltimore county zimmer rubert,on the question of whether the immunity provision waived the state eleventh amendment immunity.the board posits that no such deference is owed because the question is one of federal law,on which the decisions of the supreme court of the united states are controlling.more specifically,the board relies on supreme court precedent recognizing a statutory waiver of eleventh amendment immunity only where the relevant state statute utilizes express language of consent to suit in federal court.the board maintains that the words any claim in the immunity provision are insufficient to constitute an express waiver under federal law,contrary to the conclusion reached by maryland highest court in zimmer rubert.
we begin our analysis with the threshold issue of whether federal law or state law controls the question of a state statutory waiver of eleventh amendment immunity.guided by the precepts of eleventh amendment jurisprudence,we conclude that,although the federal courts must apply federal law as embodied in supreme court precedent,when a state highest court has applied federal law and determined that a state statute effects a waiver of eleventh amendment immunity,the federal courts must accord deference to that state court decision.applying these principles to this case,the district court properly deferred to the decision of the court of appeals of maryland in zimmer rubert.

first,congress may abrogate the states eleventh amendment immunity when it both unequivocally intends to do so and acts pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.bd.of trustees of of garrett,d internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.the applicability of the first exception is not a point of contention in this appeal because congress did not abrogate the states immunity from money damage claims under title i of the ada.see id.at.second,the eleventh amendment permits suits for prospective injunctive relief against state officials acting in violation of federal law.frew ex rel.frew hawkins,d.the second exception is also inapplicable here,because the complaint does not name as defendants any officials of the state of maryland.third,a state remains free to waive its eleventh amendment immunity from suit in a federal court.lapides bd.of regents of.of,d.the third exception,that of waiver,is at issue in this proceeding.the board maintains that the waiver exception is inapplicable because supreme court precedent compels the conclusion that the state of maryland has not forgone its eleventh amendment immunity.
the board acknowledges that the supreme court long ago decided that the question of waiver of sovereign immunity by a state constitutional provision or statute is a matter of state law,as to which the decision of the state highest court is controlling.palmer ohio.the board contends,nevertheless,that the court effectively overruled palmer in its unanimous lapides decision,by virtue of the following statement 
as in analogous contexts,in which matters are questions of federal law,regents of of cal.doe,d,whether a particular set of state laws,rules,or activities amounts to a waiver of the state eleventh amendment immunity is a question of federal law.
in lapides initiated as a state court action alleging state law claims against georgia board of regents the plaintiff sought to avail himself of a statutory waiver of georgia immunity from suit in the courts of that state.georgia attorney general joined in the removal of the state proceeding to federal court,however,and then sought dismissal of the claims on eleventh amendment grounds.the question the supreme court agreed to decide was whether a state waives its eleventh amendment immunity by its affirmative litigation conduct when it removes a case to federal court.lapides,at.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.limiting its holding to state law claims that the state had already consented to defend in its own courts,the court ruled that georgia act of removal constituted a waiver of its eleventh amendment immunity.id.at.the court reasoned that it would seem anomalous or inconsistent for a state to invoke federal jurisdiction by removal and then assert immunity from such jurisdiction.id.at.
although georgia maintained that its attorney general was not authorized,as a matter of state law,to waive the state eleventh amendment immunity,the court deemed the lack of such authority immaterial.rather,the court stressed that the state had voluntarily invoked federal jurisdiction,and,more fundamentally,that waiver of such immunity by affirmative litigation conduct is a question of federal law.lapides,at.as the court explained,
an interpretation of the eleventh amendment that finds waiver in the litigation context rests upon the amendment presumed recognition of the judicial need to avoid inconsistency,anomaly,and unfairness,and not upon a state actual preference or desire,which might,after all,favor selective use of immunity to achieve litigation advantages.
in this appeal,the board erroneously conflates a state statutory waiver of eleventh amendment immunity with a litigation conduct waiver,whereas the lapides decision carefully distinguished between them.see at.differentiating waiver requiring clear indication of the state intent to waive its immunity from waiver effected by litigation conduct.therefore,we are unable to fairly read the single statement in lapides on which the board appellate position relies as having implicitly and effectively overruled palmer.it is,of course,solely the prerogative of the supreme court to decide when to overrule one of its decisions,see rodriguez de quijas.express,d,and we can not conclude that the court more recent cases have,by implication,overruled an earlier precedent,see agostini felton,d.
it is not lost on us,of course,that it has been nearly a century since the supreme court decided palmer.meanwhile,the court has developed a more complete body of law concerning eleventh amendment immunity waivers.that precedent must also be recognized and adhered to.most relevant here,the court has admonished the lower federal courts to identify a waiver of eleventh amendment immunity in a state statute only where stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implication from the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction.atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.and,because a state constitutional interest in immunity encompasses not merely whether it may be sued,but where it may be sued the state statute must specify the state intention to subject itself to suit in federal court.id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.as the court emphasized,t he test for determining whether a state has waived its immunity from jurisdiction is a stringent one.id.hence,a state does not waive its eleventh amendment immunity by consenting to suit in the courts of its own creation,by stating its intention to sue and be sued,or even by authorizing suits against it in any court of competent jurisdiction.coll.sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d citations omitted.
there is no question that,in assessing a purported statutory waiver of eleventh amendment immunity,a federal court must apply the stringent test enunciated by the supreme court atascadero decision,and,in the absence of a construction of the relevant state statute by the state highest court,examine and decide the state law issue independently.see virginia reinhard,cir internal quotation marks omitted concluding that state statute was not sufficiently explicit to waive virginia sovereign immunity,reversed on other grounds.office for prot.advocacy stewart,d huang bd.of governors of the of,cir determining,after applying stringent test and reviewing state court decisions,that north carolina statute did not waive eleventh amendment immunity in federal court see also ford motor dep t of treasury of.as this issue has not been determined by state courts,this court must resort to the general policy of the state as expressed in its constitution,statutes and decisions,overruled on other grounds,lapides,at.
nevertheless,where a state highest court has applied the atascadero stringent test and carefully scrutinized state law to determine whether a state statute effects a waiver of eleventh amendment immunity,a federal court is obliged,under palmer,to defer to that state court decision.indeed,we should defer to the decision of the state highest court even when the statute,on its face,does not appear to pass the stringent test,because t he whole point of that test,requiring a clear declaration by the state of its waiver,is to be certain that the state in fact consents to suit.see coll.sav.bank,at.internal quotation marks omitted.as the first circuit has explained,w here the highest court of a state has construed a state statute as intending to waive the state immunity to suit in federal court,the state intent is just as clear as if the waiver were made explicit in the state statute.della grotta rhode island,cir,abrogated on other grounds by will.dep t of state police,d put succinctly,the silence of the legislature may be rectified by the voice of the state highest court.see minotti lensink,cir declining to defer to the supreme court of connecticut because it had not decided whether the relevant statute constituted a waiver of immunity to suit in federal court.
moreover,the accumulated teachings of the supreme court earlier and more recent precedents instruct that the strictures of federal law extolled in atascadero must,in deference to state sovereignty,yield to the decision of a state highest court.this command is applicable here because the states immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect of their sovereignty that neither derives from,nor is limited by,the terms of the eleventh amendment.see alden maine,d.consequently,a state highest court is entitled to say what that state law is on the question of consent to suit in federal court.see palmer,at.see also johnson fankell,d neither the supreme court nor any other federal tribunal has any authority to place a construction on a state statute different from the one rendered by the highest court of the state.parden terminal ry.of.state docks dep t,d w hether a state has waived its immunity depends upon its intention and is a question of state law only,overruled on other grounds,coll.sav.bank,at.
with the foregoing principles in mind,we turn to the scope of the maryland immunity provision the state statute at issue in this appeal.in its zimmer rubert decision,maryland highest court considered and resolved the question of whether the immunity provision waives a county board of education eleventh amendment immunity.there,a teacher had sued the board of education of baltimore county the baltimore board in state court,alleging age discrimination under the age discrimination in employment act adea and seeking to recover,inter alia,in compensatory damages.see zimmer rubert,at.the circuit court for baltimore county,where the suit was initiated,granted the baltimore board motion to dismiss,ruling that the immunity provision did not specifically waive eleventh amendment immunity.id.the court of special appeals of maryland reversed,however,concluding that the immunity provision waived the baltimore board eleventh amendment immunity as to the plaintiff adea claim.id.at.the court of appeals of maryland then granted certiorari.id.
in affirming the court of special appeals,the court of appeals analyzed the issue presented as requiring a determination first,applying maryland law to ascertain whether the immunity provision waived general sovereign immunity,and,second,whether it particularly waived eleventh amendment immunity,which the court of appeals recognized to involve a question of federal constitutional law not limited to maryland common law principles.zimmer rubert,at.the court of appeals deemed the plain language of the immunity provision to be a broad and unambiguous waiver of a general sovereign immunity defense.id.at.the court also examined the legislative history of the immunity provision,observing that,as originally proposed,it would have required that county school boards carry liability insurance for personal injury claims.id.the court further observed,however,that such language was stricken in favor of language requiring comprehensive liability insurance.id.the legislature revision,the court of appeals concluded,confirms that the words any claim in the immunity provision mean all claims including those for personal injury and alleged employment law violations.id.
the court of appeals of maryland then acknowledged and applied the atascadero stringent test and concluded that the state had specified its intention to subject itself to suit in federal court,as the words any claim in the immunity provision encompass a claim brought in either state or federal court.zimmer rubert,at.the court of appeals contrasted the immunity provision with another maryland statute barring a sovereign immunity defense in a court of the state,which the court had previously held excluded eleventh amendment immunity.id.at,citing state sharafeldin.the court thus reasoned that,if the general assembly intended to preserve the state eleventh amendment protection,that body knew how to do so by merely limiting the state liability to any claim brought in a court in this state,or words to that effect.id.at.moreover,the court emphasized,i t would defy logic for the general assembly to have waived sovereign immunity as to any claim,thereby allowing all claims,whether in state or federal court,while simultaneously intending to preserve eleventh amendment immunity.id 
the board faults the district court for deferring to zimmer rubert rather than revisiting the atascadero stringent test and ruling in the board favor that the immunity provision waiver of immunity as to any claims is insufficient to constitute a consent to lawsuits against the board in federal court.as an initial matter,we reject the board insistence that the court of appeals failed to apply the stringent test.indeed,it is fair to read zimmer rubert as concluding that the overwhelming implications from the words any claim in the immunity provision leave no room for any other reasonable construction except that the immunity provision waives eleventh amendment immunity.see atascadero,at.moreover,we are reluctant to infer that the only way a state statute can satisfy the stringent test is to include the words federal court or united states in the statutory text.in any event,as we have already explained,we owe deference to the court of appeals on the question of whether maryland legislature intended to consent to suit in federal court 
finally,it is of some importance that there has been no legislative response to the zimmer rubert decision.in addressing that point,the court of appeals of maryland has explained that t he general assembly is presumed to be aware of the court of appeals interpretation of its enactments and,if such interpretation is not legislatively overturned,to have acquiesced in that interpretation.pye state,internal quotation marks omitted in re wallace,emphasizing legislative acquiescence to interpretation by highest court of maryland as indicative of legislative intent.although only two years have passed since zimmer rubert was decided,the legislative inaction is conspicuous given the minimal effort required.as the court of appeals observed,if the statutory intent underlying the immunity provision were only to waive immunity in the state courts,the statute could be readily amended,by simply adding in a court in this state,or words to that effect.see at.that no such amendment has been made further persuades us that the court of appeals did not misconstrue the breadth of the immunity provision or the intent of the legislature.
accordingly,the district court properly adhered to the zimmer rubert decision in ruling that the immunity provision effected a waiver of the board eleventh amendment immunity for claims of or less.as a result,we are constrained to reject the board contentions to the contrary.
pursuant to the foregoing,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the majority holds that the issue of maryland immunity from suit in federal court was a question properly decided by the state highest court.because i conclude that this eleventh amendment immunity question presents an issue of federal,rather than of state law,i respectfully dissent.
the issues of sovereign and eleventh amendment immunity present complex considerations of comity in our federalist system.the supreme court addressed some of the confusion regarding these two categories of immunity in its decision in alden maine,d.
in alden,private plaintiffs attempted to sue the state of maine in state court,seeking relief under a federal statute.id.at.the supreme judicial court of maine affirmed the decision of the trial court dismissing the claim on the ground of sovereign immunity.id.on appeal,the united states supreme court affirmed and,in its opinion,addressed the primary distinction between the broad umbrella of sovereign immunity and the more narrow focus of eleventh amendment immunity.the court stated 
we have sometimes referred to the states immunity from suit as eleventh amendment immunity.the phrase is convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer,for the sovereign immunity of the states neither derives from nor is limited by the terms of the eleventh amendment.
id.at.the court further explained that sovereign immunity derives not from the eleventh amendment but from the structure of the original constitution itself.id.at.
a state eleventh amendment immunity is merely a type of sovereign immunity as it applies to suits filed in federal court.stewart north carolina,cir differentiating between eleventh amendment immunity and state sovereign immunity more generally.the decision in alden addressed the doctrine of sovereign immunity with regard to suits filed in state court hereafter,state court immunity.
states may waive both their state court immunity and their eleventh amendment immunity from suit in federal court.a waiver may be drawn either in the form of a statute or a constitutional provision.see atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d.however,an interpretation of a state waiver with respect to state court immunity differs significantly from the question whether the state has waived its immunity from suit in federal court.
when a state is haled into one of its own courts,the relevant issue is one of state court immunity.any issue whether a statute or constitutional provision effectively waives state court immunity is a decision resolved by that state courts.a ruling from the state highest court interpreting a statutory waiver provision is conclusive with respect to the nature and extent of the state immunity in state court.as the court in alden observed,the immunity of a sovereign in its own courts has always been understood to be within the sole control of the sovereign itself.at.
a state eleventh amendment immunity,however,operates in an entirely different context.while state court immunity arises,and its contours are defined,in state court,issues regarding eleventh amendment immunity originate only in federal court.see hilton south carolina pub.rys.comm n,d the eleventh amendment does not apply in state courts quoting will michigan dep t of state police,d atascadero,at.citing employees missouri dep t of pub.health and welfare,d marshall,concurring.see also huang bd.of governors of the of north carolina,cir.therefore,while state courts have ample opportunity to address issues of state court immunity in disposing of cases,state courts have no cause to address issues of the state eleventh amendment immunity from suit in federal court.in contrast,federal courts routinely confront issues regarding a state eleventh amendment immunity from suit in federal court.nevertheless,the majority,erroneously in my view,concludes that issues of eleventh amendment immunity are matters properly resolved under state law.
undoubtedly,there is a certain visceral attraction in the majority position.we regularly defer to a state court interpretation of that state statutes and constitutional provisions.see johnson fankell,d.however,in such cases,the state court will have interpreted those statutes and constitutional provisions to resolve actions pending before the state court.in contrast,the issue of eleventh amendment immunity from suit in federal court is fundamentally different,because state courts do not have cause to opine on a matter that arises exclusively in the federal courts and has no impact on the state court system.
