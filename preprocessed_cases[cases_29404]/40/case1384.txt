yigal suisa and his wife,lelach ohayon,are citizens of israel.they petition for review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals the board pretermitting consideration of their applications for adjustment of immigration status under i of the immigration and nationality act ina,i finding no error,we deny the petition for review.
suisa and ohayon originally entered the united states on visas as nonimmigrant visitors.suisa year of entry was,and ohayon entered this country in.in july,the department of homeland security initiated a removal proceeding against them.in the removal proceeding,suisa and ohayon conceded that they had stayed in the united states beyond the temporary period authorized by their visas.
under the established procedure for adjustment of immigration status,certain nonimmigrant aliens may become lawful permanent residents without having to leave the country to apply for an immigrant visa.see ins bagamasbad,per curiam lee citizenship immigration,cir describing the legislative history of i.the failure to maintain a lawful presence in the country ordinarily would render suisa and ohayon ineligible for an adjustment of immigration status.see c.suisa and ohayon collectively,suisa argued in their removal proceeding,however,that despite their current unlawful presence in this country,the provisions of i nonetheless permitted them to apply for adjustment of status 
congress enacted i in,creating an exception to the general rule that use of the mechanism is limited to those lawfully present in the country.see lee,at.congress intended that this provision be temporary and,thus,i included a sunset provision that required an alien to apply for adjustment of status between october,and october.see appropriations act,b,c,stat,effective,lee,at.when that sunset provision expired,congress added to i a grandfather clause that permitted aliens to continue to apply for adjustment of status under i if they were the beneficiaries of a visa petition or a labor certification application filed on or before january.see appropriations act,public law,b,stat,lee,at.in,congress extended the sunset date for a final time to april,see appropriations act,a b,stat,lee,at.
when suisa sought to apply for adjustment of his immigration status in,the language of i provided,in relevant part,that 
n otwithstanding the provisions of subsections 
a and c of this section,an alien physically present in the united states 
i entered the united states without inspection or 
ii is within one of the classes enumerated in subsection c of this section 
b who is the beneficiary of 
i an immigrant visa petition under section that was filed with the attorney general on or before april,or 
ii an application for a labor certification under a a a a that was filed pursuant to the regulations of the secretary of labor on or before such date 
may apply to the attorney general for the adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
i.under this enactment of i,aliens who can establish that they are grandfathered may be entitled to apply for an adjustment of status subject to the ordinary eligibility requirements for an adjustment see lee,f d at.
as we have noted,suisa concedes that he is present in this country unlawfully.thus,in order to apply for an adjustment of status,he must demonstrate that he is grandfathered under the provisions i.to do so,he relies solely on the labor certification clause,i b ii,and the following relevant facts.
in,abc scholars day care center scholars offered yigal suisa a position as a secretary.scholars previously had obtained an approved labor certification for the position on behalf of another alien,vayal pramod.that certification was approved by the department of labor in.under the practices of the department of labor in,a sponsoring employer was permitted to substitute a different prospective worker than the one originally named on the labor certification see c.when scholars offered the job to yigal suisa in,scholars filed with the department of labor an application for alien employment certification naming yigal suisa as beneficiary of the certification.
the immigration judge issued a ruling,which the board upheld,that yigal suisa substitution date was a disqualifying fact under j,a regulation adopted by the attorney general to implement i of the ina.this regulation provides that a n alien who was substituted for the previous beneficiary of the application for the labor certification after april,will not be considered to be a grandfathered alien.j.applying this language to the circumstances of yigal suisa substitution,the immigration judge and the board concluded that suisa is not a grandfathered alien because he was substituted on the application for labor certification after april.the immigration judge pretermitted consideration of the applications for adjustment of status,and the board affirmed that decision,dismissing suisa appeal.
on appeal to this court,suisa argues that j is invalid because it conflicts with i.suisa contends that i is a grandfather provision that plainly applies to aliens like suisa,who are the substituted beneficiaries of labor certifications filed on or before april.
in support of this construction of i,suisa relies on our decision in william gonzales,cir.in william,we addressed c a of the ina,c a,which permits a n alien to file one motion to reopen a removal proceeding.william challenged an implementing regulation that imposed a bar on motions to reopen filed by aliens who have already departed the country.william argued that the regulation conflicted with c a,which he asserted plainly addressed the right of all aliens,whether living inside the country or out,to file motions to reopen.william,at.the government argued that the statute was silent regarding motions and,thus,left a gap that appropriately was filled by the regulation.id.at.
we agreed with william,and held that the statutory language clearly permitted the filing of motions to reopen by aliens living outside the country because such individuals are a subset of all aliens,as that term was used in c a.id.we observed that congress,in enacting a different section of the same statute,expressly had included a requirement of physical presence within this country for alien applicants.id.at.we presumed that congress acted purposefully and intentionally by omitting that same requirement from c a.id.
suisa argues that like the term alien,the term beneficiary includes two classes of individuals who benefit from labor certifications,namely,direct beneficiaries and substituted beneficiaries.suisa notes that when congress enacted i,congress was aware of the practice of the department of labor permitting the substitution of beneficiaries in applications for labor certification.suisa contends that if congress had intended to exclude substituted beneficiaries from eligibility under i,congress would have done so expressly.
under suisa interpretation,the determinative fact for deciding a substitute beneficiary eligibility for grandfathering is the date on which the original application for labor certification was filed.according to suisa,if that application was filed on or before april,an individual substituted as a beneficiary after april,would qualify as a grandfathered alien.thus,suisa argues that j is invalid because the regulation excludes from eligibility under i certain substituted beneficiaries such as suisa whom congress plainly intended to grandfather,based on their substitution after april,as the beneficiaries of labor certifications originally filed on or before that date.
because suisa challenges an agency regulation,we employ the analysis prescribed by the supreme court in chevron,natural resources defense council.
chevron step one 
under the chevron analysis,we first consider whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if congress intent is clear,as suisa contends,then our inquiry is at an end because an agency must give effect to the unambiguously stated intent of congress.id.at.however,if the statute at issue is silent or ambiguous with respect to the precise issue,then we must decide
