background 
factual history 
on may,joseph loftus,borough manager for the borough of dunmore in pennsylvania dunmore or the borough,asked chief vince arnone of the dunmore fire department to provide a list of required qualifications for firefighters and to verify whether each dunmore firefighter met those qualifications.upon review of the information provided by chief arnone,loftus concluded that smith,who was a fire captain at the time,had not completed a required fire academy training course.loftus reported that conclusion to dunmore borough council,which made the decision to suspend smith with pay until it could hold a hearing to address the apparent deficiency 
on june,loftus sent chief arnone a letter notifying him that smith was suspended with pay pending a july,hearing.two days later,a local newspaper published an article stating that smith had been suspended for failing to complete the fire academy training.as the source of its information,the article cited loftus letter to chief arnone,which had been provided to the paper by a confidential source whose identity remains unknown 
on july,a hearing was held before the borough council in which it was determined that,pursuant to the firefighter union collective bargaining agreement cba,smith,who had been a firefighter since,was not required to complete the fire academy training because his training and experience were treated as sufficient.smith was reinstated after having been suspended for eight days but without having suffered any loss of pay or seniority.
as a result of his suspension and the publicizing of that suspension in the local paper,smith filed suit against dunmore on july,claiming defamation,due process violations,right of privacy violations,and retaliation.after filing suit,smith had a conversation with leonard verrastro,a member of the borough council,in which verrastro stated that,because of smith suit,he would vote against permitting smith to retire early,despite a pension board recommendation that early retirement should be allowed.as a result,smith amended his complaint to include a second claim for retaliation 
procedural history 
as amended,smith complaint named dunmore,the borough council,loftus,and five individual council members as defendants.it contained six claims a due process claim based on his suspension a defamation claim based on the false statement,published in the local paper,that he had not completed required training a right of privacy claim alleging that defendants acts placed him in a false light a right of privacy claim alleging that defendants acts brought publicity to his private life a retaliation claim based on the refusal to vote for his early retirement and another retaliation claim alleging that his suspension was in response to comments he had made regarding pension distributions.the defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.
on march,the district court issued an order denying in part and granting in part the motion for summary judgment.the court denied summary judgment for defendants on smith claim that he was deprived of early retirement as retaliation for his filing suit,holding that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the denial was in retaliation for smith lawsuit.the court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all other claims,holding that smith retaliation claim based on his pension comments failed because the record was devoid of any support for the claim that the due process claim failed because smith paid suspension did not give rise to deprivation of either a property or liberty interest that the defamation claim failed because pennsylvania provides high public officials with an absolute immunity from defamation suits and that both privacy claims failed because the information which was made smith had been suspended for lacking required a public safety matter and was,therefore,a matter of public concern.the remaining retaliation claim was allowed to proceed to trial with only verrastro and dunmore as defendants.
on october,before trial commenced,defendants made smith a settlement offer of and early retirement.smith declined the offer and trial began on october.at the close of smith case,the court granted judgment as a matter of law to defendants on the claim against verrastro and on the claim for punitive damages.while the court acknowledged evidence that the dunmore borough council refusal to vote on the pension board recommendation for smith retirement could be retaliation for smith lawsuit the court explained that the council was the decision maker and that verrastro could not be individually liable for the council decision not to bring the recommendation to a vote.likewise,verrastro individual threat to vote against smith early retirement could not constitute adverse employment action when no vote was ever taken.the court also held that there was no evidence of evil,malicious,or reckless conduct that would justify punitive damages.on october,the retaliation claim against the lone remaining defendant,dunmore,was submitted to the jury,which returned a verdict in favor of smith and awarded nominal damages of.after trial,pursuant to smith motion for equitable relief,the district court ordered dunmore to grant smith early retirement.
on november,pursuant to b,smith filed a motion for attorney fees and costs.smith sought payment for attorney time of hours at per hour.the district court found both numbers to be unreasonable,and reduced the hours to and the hourly rate to,arriving at a total amount of for attorney fees.to that,the court added additional amounts for legal assistant fees and fees associated with the fee action itself and arrived at a total lodestar amount of.relying on hensley eckerhart,which instructs that district courts may need to adjust the fee upward or downward based on considerations such as the degree of success obtained,the district court further reduced smith requested fees because smith succeeded on only one of his six initial claims and ultimately obtained only and early than the and early retirement offered in settlement.consequently,the court reduced the award from the lodestar amount of to.the court also awarded in total costs.smith timely appeal followed.
on appeal smith argues that the district court erred by granting judgment in favor of defendants on his due process,defamation,privacy,and punitive damages claims,and he asks that each be remanded for trial.smith also argues that the district court erred by reducing his attorney hourly rate to and reducing the lodestar amount by more than percent,and he asks us to award attorney fees without those reductions.we will address each of smith arguments in turn.
a.the district court grant of summary judgment 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment under a plenary standard,applying the same test employed by the district court.kautz,cir.the party is entitled to every favorable inference that can be drawn from the record,and we will affirm only if there is no genuine issue for trial.id.citing carrasca pomeroy,cir.
smith due process claims 
the district court granted summary judgment on smith due process claims because the court found that an paid suspension did not qualify either as deprivation of a property interest or as the plus prong of the test for establishing deprivation of a liberty interest in reputation.see hill borough of kutztown,cir t o make out a due process claim for deprivation of a liberty interest in reputation,a plaintiff must show a stigma to his reputation plus deprivation of some additional right or interest.emphasis in original.because smith had not established the required plus prong of the test,the court declined to consider whether the stigma prong had been satisfied.
smith argues that the court conclusions were in error and that remand is mandated by our decision in dee borough of dunmore,cir.in dee,we reviewed the due process claims of robert dee,another dunmore firefighter who had been suspended along with smith as a result of the same assertion that he had not completed required fire academy training.id.at.dee due process claims had been disposed of on summary judgment for the same reasons smith had.id.on appeal,we held that,because both.stat.ann.and the cba allowed firefighters to be suspended only for cause,dee had a property interest in not being suspended without cause.id.at.dunmore had argued,however,that its interest in ensuring that the borough firefighters were qualified was a interest that justified an paid suspension prior to any hearing.id.at.we acknowledged that under matthews eldridge,a strong government interest can justify the deprivation of a property right,but found that there were issues of disputed fact regarding the borough justification for suspending dee without first affording him notice and a hearing.dee,at.particularly,we noted that dee had been a fireman for eighteen years,during which time he had been promoted numerous times by the borough council,and that councilman talutto stated that the council acted so quickly because they d id want to get blasted in the press.id.we viewed those facts as undercutting dunmore argument that the suspension was based on concerns over public safety and,consequently,we remanded for consideration of the borough motives for the suspension.id.then,based on our holding that dee had a property interest in not being suspended,we also concluded that dee had satisfied the plus prong of the test,and remanded the liberty interest claim for consideration of the stigma prong.id.at.
the facts here are indistinguishable from the facts in dee both dee and smith were suspended at the same time under precisely the same circumstances the same statute and cba apply,mandating that smith can be suspended only for cause talutto deposition testimony in both cases suggests that press coverage,rather than public safety,may have motivated the suspension and,like dee,smith had been a firefighter for almost eighteen years and had been promoted numerous times by the borough council.thus,we are compelled to follow our precedent in dee and hold that there exist issues of disputed fact regarding the borough justification for suspending smith without first affording him notice and a hearing.id.at.
we emphasize,however,that we are not suggesting that concerns over public safety can not justify a paid suspension.to the contrary,we recognize that the strong government interest in public safety would almost certainly justify the comparatively minor deprivation inherent in an paid suspension.instead,we conclude only that dee requires us to say that there are legitimate factual questions as to whether public safety concerns were,in fact,what motivated the borough council.accordingly,because genuine issues of material fact remain,we will remand smith due process claims to the district court.
smith defamation claim 
although the district court found that smith had made a prima facie case for defamation,it nonetheless granted summary judgment on the claim because pennsylvania grants absolute immunity from defamation suits to high public officials,including borough council members.smith argues that the grant of summary judgment to the dunmore borough council members was improper because the disclosure of loftus letter to the newspaper fell outside the scope of their duties and,therefore,the immunity does not apply.we disagree.
pennsylvania exempts a high public official from all civil suits for damages arising out of false defamatory statements and even from statements or actions motivated by malice,provided the statements are made or the actions are taken in the course of the official duties or powers.lindner mollan,quoting matson margiotti.smith argues that,while the letter itself might have been prepared within the scope of the council member official duties,the public disclosure of such a letter,which contains,in the district court words,an untrue communication resulting from a failure to exercise reasonable care and diligence,is not within those duties.appellant brief at.that argument takes too narrow a view of the immunity.the fact that a statement is untrue can not be a basis for exempting it from an immunity for defamation,as such an exception would swallow the immunity whole.likewise,the fact that the untruth may have resulted from a failure to exercise reasonable care and diligence,from immaterial to the invocation of an immunity that is intended to encompass even maliciously motivated comments.thus,smith argument that the high public official immunity can not apply under the circumstances of this case draws too narrow a boundary and is mistaken.
the proper bounds of the immunity are illustrated by the pennsylvania superior court decision in mckibben schmotzer.there,a borough mayor accused a borough police chief of assaulting her and,as a result,she suspended the chief and filed a private criminal complaint against him.id.at.following the suspension,the mayor issued a news release explaining the chief suspension and describing the brutal and unprovoked assault on her.id.shortly thereafter,a preliminary hearing was held on the assault charges and the criminal complaint was dismissed.id.immediately after that hearing,the mayor made a statement to reporters accusing the chief of lying.id.after the chief prevailed in a defamation suit,the superior court on appeal held that high public official immunity applied to the mayor with respect to the news release because the mayor was empowered to suspend the chief,and her comments in the news release,although harsh and,as the jury found,untrue,were closely related to her duties of supervising the borough police force.id.at.by contrast,the court held that the immunity did not apply with respect to her statement that the chief was lying because there,the mayor was no more than a private citizen seeking to enforce her private criminal complaint.id.at emphasis in original.although not binding on us,the reasoning of mckibben persuasively illustrates the boundary between those actions that are taken in the course of an official duties and those that are not.
here,the disclosure of loftus letter to the newspaper is akin to the news release in mckibben.the information disclosed to the local paper regarding the basis for smith suspension was closely related to the duties of supervising the borough fire department.id.at.consequently,the district court correctly concluded that pennsylvania high public official immunity shields the council members from any claim for defamation,and we will affirm the court grant of summary judgment.
smith right of privacy claims 
the district court granted summary judgment on smith false light claim and his claim for publicity given to private life because the court found that the information which was made smith had allegedly failed to complete required public safety and,therefore,is a matter of public concern.smith argues that this was error because his confidential employment information is not a matter of public concern.he also argues that whether the information is of public concern is relevant only to his publicity claim and is not an element of a false light claim.he is wrong on both points.
first,we have little difficulty concluding,as the district court did,that the qualifications of firefighters are a public safety matter and,therefore,a matter of public concern.see chappel montgomery cnty.fire protection,cir holding that speech regarding the need for firefighters to receive improved training is a matter of public concern beckwith city of daytona beach shores,cir few subjects are of more public concern to the average citizen than the provision of basic fire and rescue services.the information existence in a person
