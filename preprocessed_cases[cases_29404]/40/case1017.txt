the plaintiff in this antitrust case is pittsburgh hospital system.it sued pittsburgh dominant hospital system and health insurer under the sherman act and state law.the plaintiff asserts that the defendants violated sections and of the sherman act by forming a conspiracy to protect one another from competition.the plaintiff says that pursuant to the conspiracy,the dominant hospital system used its power in the provider market to insulate the health insurer from competition,and in exchange the insurer used its power in the insurance market to strengthen the hospital system and to weaken the plaintiff.the plaintiff also asserts that the dominant hospital system violated section of the sherman act by attempting to monopolize the market for specialized hospital services.finally,the plaintiff asserts claims for unfair competition and tortious interference against the dominant hospital system.the district court dismissed the sherman act claims and,having done so,declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims.because we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the sherman act claims,we will reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings.
the following facts are alleged in the plaintiff complaint.the district court decided this case on a motion to dismiss.we accept as true the factual allegations in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.revell port,cir.
cast of characters 
this lawsuit involves three parties.the plaintiff west penn allegheny health system,west penn is pittsburgh hospital system it has a share of less than of the market for hospital services in allegheny county,which includes the city of pittsburgh.the defendant university of pittsburgh medical center upmc is pittsburgh dominant hospital system.it enjoys a share of the allegheny county market for hospital services,and its share of the market for tertiary and quaternary care services exceeds west penn and upmc are the two major competitors in the allegheny county market for hospital services,and are the only competitors in the market for tertiary and quaternary care services.the defendant highmark,is the dominant insurer in the allegheny county market for health insurance highmark market share has remained between and since.
in,the western pennsylvania healthcare system merged with several financially distressed medical providers,including allegheny general hospital,to form west.highmark funded the merger with a million loan.highmark largesse did not spring from a sense of altruism but was intended to preserve competition in the market for hospital services.had the financially distressed providers comprising west penn failed,upmc would have attained nearly unchecked dominance in the market.this would not have been good for highmark the more dominant upmc becomes,the more leverage it gains to demand greater reimbursements from highmark.reimbursements are the payments insurers give to providers to cover services rendered to the insurers subscribers.
after the merger,highmark and west penn continued to enjoy a good relationship,as highmark recognized that preserving west penn was in its interests.thus,highmark encouraged investors to purchase bonds from west penn,touting its financial outlook and the quality of its medical services.and in early,highmark gave west penn a million grant to invest in its facilities.
in contrast to highmark,upmc has been hostile to west penn since its inception.upmc opposed the merger creating west penn it intervened in the merger proceedings,filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent highmark from funding the merger,and attempted with some success to dissuade investors from purchasing west penn bonds.upmc hostility towards west penn continued after the merger.since west penn formation,upmc executives have repeatedly said that they want to destroy west penn,and they have taken action to further that goal on more than a few occasions.but more on that later.see section,infra.
historically,upmc has also had a bitter relationship with highmark.for example,when upmc demanded purportedly excessive reimbursement rates from highmark,highmark responded by forming community blue,a insurance plan.to participate in community blue,a hospital had to agree to accept reduced reimbursements,but would receive a higher volume of patients.west penn participated in community blue,but upmc did not,claiming that its reimbursement rates were too low.upmc responded to community blue by forming its own health insurer,upmc health plan.upmc health plan has been highmark main competitor in the allegheny county market for health insurance since its formation.
moreover,highmark and upmc have faced off in litigation in the past.in a federal lawsuit,highmark sued upmc under the lanham act,asserting that upmc had made false statements about community blue in an advertisement.the district court agreed with highmark and preliminarily enjoined dissemination of the advertisement we affirmed on appeal.highmark,upmc health plan,cir.in another lawsuit,highmark sought to enjoin upmc proposed acquisition of a children hospital highmark claimed that the acquisition would violate the antitrust laws.the case ultimately settled,however,and upmc acquired the hospital.
c.the conspiracy begins the dynamics change 
in,upmc offered a truce to highmark.under the terms of the truce,each entity would use its market power to protect the other from competition.highmark initially rejected upmc offer,criticizing it as an illegal attempt to form a super monopoly for the provision of health care in western pennsylvania in which upmc,the leading provider of hospital services,and highmark,the leading health insurer,would combine forces.ja.
the complaint alleges,however,that in the summer of,over the course of several meetings,highmark reconsidered and decided to accept upmc offer of a truce.the complaint alleges that upmc agreed to use its power in the provider market to prevent highmark competitors from gaining a foothold in the allegheny county market for health insurance,and in exchange highmark agreed to take steps to strengthen upmc and to weaken west.the complaint offers the following factual allegations in support of the conspiracy claim.
upmc engaged in conduct that effectively insulated highmark from competition.first,it refused to enter into competitive provider agreements with highmark rivals.this prevented the rivals from entering the allegheny county health insurance market because,given upmc dominance,an insurer can not succeed in the market without being able to offer a plan that includes upmc as an provider 
second,upmc shrunk upmc health plan highmark main competitor in the insurance market.it cut the health plan advertising budget and increased its premiums,which led to a sharp drop in enrollment.it also refused to sell the health plan to insurers interested in buying it,which might have revived it as a highmark competitor.upmc acknowledged that it decided to shrink the health plan as a result of negotiations with highmark,in which highmark had agreed to take community blue off the market.
meanwhile,highmark took action that enhanced upmc dominance.most significantly,it paid upmc supracompetitive reimbursement rates.to afford upmc reimbursements,highmark had to increase its insurance premiums which,according to west penn,it was able to do without losing business because upmc had insulated it from competition.highmark,moreover,provided upmc with million to build a new facility for its children hospital,million of which was a grant and the remainder of which was a loan.in addition,highmark vowed not to offer a health plan that did not include upmc as an provider.thus,in,highmark eliminated its insurance plan,community blue,in which upmc had declined to participate.with the elimination of a leading insurance plan,health insurance premiums in allegheny county rose.furthermore,in,highmark publicly supported upmc acquisition of mercy hospital,which,other than west penn,was upmc only other competitor in the market for tertiary and quaternary care services.finally,in,highmark leaked confidential financial information regarding west penn to upmc,which in turn leaked a distorted version of the information to agencies and to the business media in an attempt to destroy investor confidence in west ja.
in addition,highmark essentially cut west penn off from its financial support,thus hampering its ability to compete with upmc.highmark,for instance,repeatedly rejected west penn requests to refinance the million loan that was used to fund the merger although highmark believed refinancing the loan made business sense,it declined to do so out of fear that upmc would retaliate against it for violating their agreement that highmark candidly admitted was probably illegal.highmark said that it was under a constant barrage from upmc and that upmc was obsessed with driving west penn out of business.highmark explained that if it helped west penn financially,upmc would allow one of highmark competitors to enter the allegheny county insurance market or would sell upmc health plan to a highmark competitor.indeed,upmc had sent highmark a letter containing such a warning.ja.
moreover,highmark maintained west penn reimbursement rates at artificially depressed levels and repeatedly refused to increase them.in and,for example,west penn asked highmark for a general increase in its rates,which were originally set in.highmark initially acknowledged that west penn rates were too low and suggested that it would raise them,but it ultimately refused to follow through,explaining that it could not help west penn because,if it did,upmc would retaliate.
finally,highmark discriminated against west penn in the award of grants to improve the quality of medical care in allegheny county.in november,for example,
highmark launched a program to provide grant dollars to improve the implementation of information technology in health care.the program provided for grants of per physician,with an aggregate limit of per health system.only two health systems in western pennsylvania employed enough physicians to be limited by the cap upmc and west penn.highmark waived the cap in upmc case,awarding a grant of million.but highmark consistently refused to raise the cap for west penn 
d.the effects of the conspiracy 
the conspiracy ended in,when the antitrust division of the department of justice began investigating highmark and upmc relationship.during the years covered by the conspiracy,upmc and highmark reaped record profits.upmc net income rose from million in to over million in,and highmark net income rose from million in to million in.upmc increased revenue came largely from the sweetheart reimbursements it received from highmark,and highmark increased its earnings by raising premiums on the other hand,west penn struggled during the years covered by the conspiracy.it was forced to scale back its services,and to abandon projects to expand and improve its services and facilities.in essence,west penn was unable to compete with upmc as vigorously as it otherwise would have.
upmc unilateral conduct 
besides the conspiracy with highmark,upmc has taken a number of actions on its own to weaken west.most significantly,upmc has systematically raided key physicians from west.even before west penn formation,upmc hired physicians,including neurosurgeons,oncologists,hand surgeons,cardiologists,gastroenterologists,pulmonologists,and primary care physicians from two of west penn predecessor hospitals,including allegheny general.upmc lured these physicians away by paying them salaries that were well above market rates.although upmc incurred financial losses because of the hirings that is,it paid the physicians more money than they generated,it admitted that it was willing to do so in order to injure the hospitals.
upmc physician raiding has continued unabated since west penn formation.ja.in,upmc attempted to hire the entire anesthesiology staff of a west penn hospital.upmc did so even though its internal analysis showed that the raid would be unprofitable.as before,though,upmc admitted that it was not trying to earn profits.it was trying to drive the hospital out of business.in the end,the anesthesiologists were lured away by upmc bloated salary offers.but they quit not long after joining upmc,because upmc lacked sufficient operating space to absorb them.
the complaint identifies many additional examples of physician raiding.in,upmc hired two primary care practitioners from a west penn hospital upmc admitted that it took the practitioners on in order to injure the hospital.in,upmc hired a surgical group from a west penn hospital.in,upmc hired a radiologist,an orthopedic surgeon,a cardiovascular surgeon,and an entire vascular lab department from west.upmc was unable to absorb the cardiovascular surgeon and vascular lab staff.in,upmc took cardiovascular surgeons,cardiologists,and nine primary care physicians from west.upmc agreed to pay one of the primary care physicians roughly figure well above the revenue generated by the physician practice and more than four times the salary he received at west.in,upmc offered allegheny general key bariatric surgeon a bloated salary in an attempt to hire him away.in an internal email to upmc ceo,a upmc executive said that if the surgeon joined upmc,allegheny general will not have a sustainable bariatrics program unless they just merge it with west penn.the executive also said that even if allegheny general raised the surgeon salary and persuaded him to stay,at least upmc will have forced allegheny general to incur higher costs.ja.the surgeon ended up leaving allegheny general to join upmc.
in other instances,upmc tried unsuccessfully to lure physicians away from west.between and,upmc attempted to hire a cardiology group,a urology group,an anesthesiology staff,a radiology staff,a premier podiatrist,and an endocrinology group from west.upmc did not need the additional physicians,and although the doctors remained with west penn,they did so only after west penn agreed to increase their salaries.
in addition to hiring physicians away from west penn,upmc has pressured community hospitals into entering joint ventures with it for the provision of oncology services.upmc told the hospitals that unless they entered the joint ventures,it would build upmc satellite facilities next to them,draining their business.nearly every community hospital in the pittsburgh metropolitan area except those owned by west penn acquiesced and entered a joint venture with upmc.these joint ventures function as arrangements,the community hospitals refer all of their oncology patients to upmc facilities.moreover,under pressure from upmc,many of the community hospitals have begun sending all of their tertiary and quaternary care referrals to upmc facilities.
finally,upmc has repeatedly made false statements about west penn financial health in order to discourage investors from purchasing west penn bonds.on one occasion,for example,upmc disseminated a book of false and defamatory information about west penn finances that was printed in a format designed to appear as if it were authored by west ja.the book,which was distributed to investment bankers and agencies,gave investors a distorted impression of west penn financial stability.on the whole,upmc efforts to forestall investment in west penn were somewhat successful.although west penn has been able to issue debt when necessary,upmc disparagement has caused it to pay artificially inflated financing costs on the debt.
ii.procedural history 
on april,west penn initiated this lawsuit in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania.upmc and highmark filed motions to dismiss,but west penn sought and was granted leave to submit an amended complaint,which it filed on august.the amended complaint hereafter,the complaint includes five counts.counts and assert that upmc and highmark violated sections and of the sherman act,respectively,by conspiring to protect one another from competition.count alleges that upmc violated section of the sherman act by attempting to monopolize the allegheny county market for acute care inpatient services,or,in the alternative,the allegheny county market for tertiary and quaternary acute care inpatient services.ja.for simplicity sake,we will refer to the two collectively as the market for specialized hospital services.counts and assert claims against upmc for unfair competition and tortious interference with business relations.the complaint requests damages,including treble and punitive damages,and injunctive relief,including an order requiring highmark to end any discrimination in reimbursement both direct and indirect between upmc and west ja.
on september,upmc and highmark filed renewed motions to dismiss.the defendants moved to dismiss the conspiracy claims on three bases.they argued that the complaint fails adequately to allege an unlawful conspiracy,that even if it does allege a conspiracy,it fails to allege that west penn sustained an antitrust injury as a result of the conspiracy,and that the conspiracy claims are.
upmc urged the court to dismiss the attempted monopolization claim on the ground that the complaint fails to allege anticompetitive conduct,an element of such a claim.finally,upmc argued that if the court dismissed the sherman act claims,it should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims.
on october,the district court issued a lengthy opinion dismissing the complaint in its entirety.first,the court discussed the pleading standard that applies in complex cases,including in antitrust cases.noting that discovery in complex cases is expensive and,the court stated that judges presiding over such cases have a duty to act as gatekeepers.although the court did not elaborate on what it meant by this,it suggested that,in order to prevent complex cases lacking merit from proceeding to discovery,courts must subject pleadings in such cases to heightened scrutiny.after discussing the pleading taking on the role of court proceeded to address the merits.
the court dismissed the conspiracy claims on the ground that the complaint fails to allege a conspiracy.according to the court,the complaint is long on innuendo and frequently repeats the buzz word that the defendants conspired,but ultimately fails to allege any facts which evidence a concerted action.ja.the court also concluded that the conspiracy claims are deficient because the complaint fails to allege that west penn sustained an antitrust injury as a consequence of the conspiracy.with respect to the attempted monopolization claim,the court agreed with upmc that the complaint fails to allege anticompetitive conduct.finally,after dismissing the federal claims,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims 
west penn filed this timely appeal.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over the sherman act claims under and a,and supplemental jurisdiction over the claims under a.this court has jurisdiction under.our review of a district court ruling on a motion to dismiss is plenary.jones abn amro mortg,cir.
iv.the pleading standard 
under federal rule of civil procedure,a complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.in bell atlantic twombly,the supreme court held that to satisfy rule,a complaint must contain factual allegations that,taken as a whole,render the plaintiff entitlement to relief plausible.id.at,howard hess dental,dentsply int l,cir phillips county of allegheny,cir.this does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage,but instead simply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary element.phillips,at quoting twombly,at.in determining whether a complaint is sufficient,courts should disregard the complaint legal conclusions and determine whether the remaining factual allegations suggest that the plaintiff has a opposed to merely for relief.ashcroft iqbal,fowler upmc shadyside,cir.
the district court opined that judges presiding over antitrust and other complex cases must act as gatekeepers,and must subject pleadings in such cases to heightened scrutiny.the district court gloss on rule,however,is squarely at odds with supreme court precedent.although twombly acknowledged that discovery in antitrust cases can be expensive,at,it expressly rejected the notion that a heightened pleading standard applies in antitrust cases,id.at,and iqbal made clear that rule pleading standard applies with the same level of rigor in all civil actions.at.see also swierkiewicz sorema,leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence coordination unit,rejecting fifth circuit adoption of a heightened pleading standard for civil rights cases alleging municipal liability charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure ed noting that rule pleading standard applies with the same degree of rigor in every case,regardless of its size,complexity,or the numbers of parties that may be involved.
it is,of course,true that judging the sufficiency of a pleading is a exercise.see iqbal.at twombly,at phillips,at.some claims require more factual explication than others to state a plausible claim for relief.see in re ins.brokerage antitrust,cir.for example,it generally takes fewer factual allegations to state a claim for simple battery than to state a claim for antitrust conspiracy.see benjamin spencer,understanding pleading doctrine.but,contrary to the able district court suggestion,this does not mean that twombly plausibility standard functions more like a probability requirement in complex cases.
we conclude that it is inappropriate to apply twombly plausibility standard with extra bite in antitrust and other complex cases.we now turn to address whether west penn complaint satisfies the plausibility standard.
v.the conspiracy claims 
west penn asserts conspiracy claims under sections and of the sherman act,and.section provides that e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states is declared to be illegal.despite its seemingly absolute language,section has been construed to prohibit only unreasonable restraints of trade.standard oil united states,united states brown,cir.some agreements are so plainly anticompetitive that they are condemned per se that is,they are conclusively presumed to unreasonably restrain trade,united states trenton potteries,horizontal agreements to fix prices palmer brg of,per curiam horizontal agreements to divide markets.other agreements are condemned only if evaluation under the rule of reason indicates that they unreasonably restrain trade,leegin creative leather,psks,vertical agreements to maintain resale prices.
section imposes liability on e very person who shall monopolize,or attempt to monopolize,or combine or conspire with any other person or persons,to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states.see also howard hess,at listing the elements of a section conspiracy claim 
upmc and highmark defend the district court dismissal of the conspiracy claims on several bases.we address each in turn.
first,we address the defendants argument that the conspiracy claims were properly dismissed because the complaint fails to allege an agreement.to prevail on a section claim or a section conspiracy claim,a plaintiff must establish the existence of an agreement,sometimes also referred to as a conspiracy or concerted action.twombly,at gordon lewistown,cir.an agreement exists when there is a unity of purpose,a common design and understanding,a meeting of the minds,or a conscious commitment to a common scheme.copperweld indep.tube,howard hess,at gordon,at.
a plaintiff may plead an agreement by alleging direct or circumstantial evidence,or a combination of the two.if a complaint includes allegations of direct evidence of an agreement,a court need go no further on the question whether an agreement has been adequately pled.ins.brokerage,at allegations of direct evidence of an agreement,if sufficiently detailed,are adequate.see also toledo mack sales,mack trucks,cir citing rossi standard roofing,cir.
west penn theory on the conspiracy claims is that in the summer of,upmc and highmark formed an agreement to protect one another from competition.west penn asserts that upmc agreed to use its power in the provider market to exclude highmark rivals from the allegheny county health insurance market,and that in exchange highmark agreed to take steps to strengthen upmc and to weaken its primary rival,west.we conclude that the complaint contains allegations of direct evidence of such an agreement.
the complaint alleges that in,west penn asked highmark to refinance the loan that was used to fund the merger,that highmark agreed that refinancing was a good idea,but that highmark would not sign off on the refinancing.highmark explained that if it helped west penn out financially,upmc,which was obsessed with driving west penn out of business,would retaliate against it for violating their agreement that highmark admitted was probably illegal.indeed,upmc had sent highmark a letter warning that if it extended financial assistance to west penn,upmc would enter a provider agreement with a highmark competitor,thus reducing highmark dominance in the insurance market.the complaint also alleges that in and,west penn asked highmark to increase its reimbursement rates,that highmark acknowledged that the rates were too low and suggested that it would raise them,but that highmark refused to follow through,explaining that if it increased west penn rates,upmc would retaliate against it for violating their agreement.finally,the complaint alleges that at an employees meeting,upmc ceo admitted that he decided to shrink upmc health plan as a result of negotiations with highmark,during which highmark had agreed to take community blue off the market.in all,these allegations of direct evidence are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss on the agreement element.see ins.brokerage,at 
unreasonable restraint 
the defendants make a argument that even if the complaint alleges that they formed a conspiracy to shield one another from competition,the section claim is still deficient because the complaint does not allege that the conspiracy unreasonably restrained trade.we disagree.at the pleading stage,a plaintiff may satisfy the element by alleging that the conspiracy produced anticompetitive effects in the relevant markets.see howard hess,at brown,at.anticompetitive effects include increased prices,reduced output,and reduced quality.toledo mack,f d at brown,at.
here,the complaint alleges that the relevant markets are,on one hand,the allegheny county market for specialized hospital services and,on the other hand,the allegheny county market for health insurance the complaint plausibly suggests that by denying west penn capital,the conspiracy caused west penn to cut back on its services including specialized hospital services and to abandon projects to expand and improve its services and facilities.the complaint also plausibly suggests that by shielding highmark from competition,the conspiracy resulted in increased premiums and reduced output in the market for health insurance.these allegations are sufficient to suggest that the conspiracy produced anticompetitive effects in the relevant markets 
antitrust injury 
we now turn to the defendants argument that the conspiracy claims were properly dismissed on the ground that the complaint fails to allege antitrust injury.in brunswick pueblo,the supreme court held that an antitrust plaintiff must do more than show that it would have been better off absent the violation the plaintiff must establish that it suffered an antitrust injury.an antitrust injury is an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes the defendants acts unlawful.id.at.the injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation.see also atl.richfield usa petroleum,an injury,although causally related to an antitrust violation,nevertheless will not qualify as an antitrust injury unless it is attributable to a aspect or effect of the defendant behavior.
the requirement helps ensure that the harm claimed by the plaintiff corresponds to the rationale for finding a violation of the antitrust laws in the first place,and it prevents losses that stem from competition from supporting suits by private plaintiffs for damages.atl.richfield,at see also cargill,monfort of,declaring that it is inimical to the antitrust laws to award damages for losses stemming from continued competition internal punctuation omitted serfecz jewel food stores,cir when the plaintiff injury is linked to the injury inflicted upon the market,such as when consumers pay higher prices because of a market monopoly or when a competitor is forced out of the market,the compensation of the injured party promotes the designated purpose of the antitrust preservation of competition.iia phillip areeda,herbert hovenkamp et,antitrust law,at ed.
so,for example,in brunswick,a group of bowling alleys sued a manufacturer of bowling equipment,claiming that the latter acquisition of several financially distressed alleys violated the antitrust laws.at.the plaintiffs said that if the struggling alleys had been allowed to fail,their profits would have increased,as displaced bowlers would have patronized their alleys.id.at.the supreme court held,however,that the plaintiffs had not sustained an antitrust injury.the acquisitions in question were unlawful,if at all,because they tended to give the defendant monopoly power in the bowling alley market.and the plaintiffs were complaining about profits lost as a result of continued competition the defendant rescuing the distressed alleys,not about injuries linked to reduced competition.the plaintiffs thus failed to establish antitrust injury.id.at.
as a general matter,the class of plaintiffs capable of satisfying the requirement is limited to consumers and competitors in the restrained market,carpet group int l oriental rug imps.ass n,cir gulfstream iii,gulfstream aerospace,cir gregory mktg.wakefern food,cir,and to those whose injuries are the means by which the defendants seek to achieve their anticompetitive ends,blue shield of mccready,broadcom qualcomm,cir areeda hovenkamp,supra,at.
west penn asserts that three aspects of the conspiracy caused it antitrust injury.first,west penn says it was injured as a result of highmark decision to take community blue off the market.it explains that community blue subscribers often received treatment at west penn hospitals and that it lost business when community blue was eliminated.west penn injury in this regard,however,is not antitrust injury.as west penn seems to acknowledge,highmark elimination of community blue violated the antitrust laws,if at all,because it tended to reduce competition in the allegheny county market for health insurance and thus tended to cause,among other things,an increase in premiums.west penn participates in the insurance market not as a consumer or a competitor but as a sells hospital services to insurers.a supplier does not suffer an antitrust injury when competition is reduced in the downstream market in which it sells goods or services.schuylkill energy.power light,cir sas of,tele,cir serfecz,at int l raw materials,stauffer chem,cir alberta gas chems.du pont de nemours co,cir.although a supplier may lose business when competition is restrained in the downstream market in which it sells goods and services,such losses are merely byproducts of the anticompetitive effects of the restraint.see areeda hovenkamp,supra,at.we conclude,then,that west penn did not sustain an antitrust injury based on the elimination of community blue.
second,west penn alleges that it sustained an antitrust injury based on highmark refusals to refinance the million loan.it explains that highmark refusals caused it to incur inflated financing costs,which in turn deprived it of capital that it would have used to improve and expand its medical facilities.but even if highmark would not refinance the loan,the loan agreement allowed west penn to obtain financing elsewhere and to repay the loan early without penalty in fact,west penn did so in.because highmark was just one of many possible sources of financing,we conclude if it acted with anticompetitive refinancing refusals could not have been aspect s of the conspiracy,atl.richfield,at,and thus did not give rise to an antitrust injury.see paycom billing,mastercard int l,cir johnson.health,cir defendant refusal to provide the plaintiff financing with which to open her own business did not give rise to antitrust injury because plaintiff could have obtained financing from many other sources christofferson dairy,mmm sales,cir defendant refusal to sell plaintiff surplus milk did not give rise to antitrust injury where there were plenty of other sources for surplus milk.
finally,west penn argues that it sustained an antitrust injury in the form of artificially depressed reimbursement rates.the complaint alleges that during the conspiracy,west penn asked highmark to renegotiate and raise its rates.the complaint suggests that highmark acknowledged that the rates were too low and initially agreed to raise them,but that highmark refused to follow through,citing its agreement with upmc,under which it was not to do anything to benefit west penn financially.west penn asserts that the amount of the,the difference between the reimbursements it would have received in a competitive market and those it actually an antitrust injury.for their part,the defendants do not take issue with west penn suggestion that its reimbursement rates would have been greater absent the conspiracy.they argue,instead,that paying west penn depressed reimbursement rates was not an element of the conspiracy that posed antitrust problems.they reason that low reimbursement rates translate into low premiums for subscribers,and that it would therefore be contrary to a key purpose of the antitrust consumer allow west penn to recover the amount of the underpayments.west penn has it right.
admittedly,had highmark been acting alone,west penn would have little basis for challenging the reimbursement rates.a firm that has substantial power on the buy side of the market,monopsony power is generally free to bargain aggressively when negotiating the prices it will pay for goods and services.kartell blue shield of,cir breyer,travelers ins.blue cross of,cir.this reflects the general hesitance of courts to condemn unilateral behavior,lest vigorous competition be chilled.am.needle,nfl,goldwasser ameritech,cir.
but when a firm exercises monopsony power pursuant to a conspiracy,its conduct is subject to more rigorous scrutiny,see am.needle.at,and will be condemned if it imposes an unreasonable restraint of trade,see standard oil,at.this is so because unlike independent action,concerted activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk insofar as it deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands.am.needle.at quoting copperweld,at internal punctuation omitted.
here,the complaint suggests that highmark has substantial monopsony power.it alleges that highmark has a share of the allegheny county market for health insurance,that there are significant entry barriers for insurers wishing to break into the market including upmc unwillingness to deal competitively with insurers,and that medical providers have very few alternative purchasers for their services the complaint also alleges that highmark paid west penn depressed reimbursement rates,not as a result of independent decisionmaking,but pursuant to a conspiracy with upmc,under which upmc insulated highmark from competition in return for highmark taking steps to hobble west.in these circumstances,it is certainly plausible that paying west penn depressed reimbursement rates unreasonably restrained trade.such shortchanging poses competitive threats similar to those posed by conspiracies among buyers to fix prices,see mandeville island farms am.crystal sugar,and other restraints that result in artificially depressed payments to,suboptimal output,reduced quality,allocative inefficiencies,and given the reductions in output higher prices for consumers in the long run.see brown pro football,wald,dissenting discussing the anticompetitive effects of monopsony citing roger blair jeffrey harrison,monopsony,areeda hovenkamp,supra,at john miles,health care antitrust law collecting sources and discussing the problems linked to insurer monopsony roger blair john lopatka,predatory buying and the antitrust laws,utah,observing that the exercise of monopsony power misallocates resources and thereby reduces social welfare see also bernard,hosp.serv.ass n,cir prima facie antitrust violation shown where insurer that was controlled by participating hospitals limited reimbursements paid to hospitals.
the defendants argue,though,that highmark paying west penn depressed reimbursements did not pose antitrust problems because it enabled highmark to set low insurance premiums and thus benefitted consumers.we disagree.first,even if it were true that paying west penn depressed rates enabled highmark to offer lower premiums,it is far from clear that this would have benefitted consumers,because the premium reductions would have been achieved only by taking action that tends to diminish the quality and availability of hospital services.see brown,at wald,dissenting warren grimes,the sherman act unintended bias against lilliputians,antitrust,the very nature of monopsony or oligopsony power is that it tends to suppress output and reduce quality or choice.second,the complaint alleges that highmark did not pass the savings on to consumers.it alleges,instead,that highmark pocketed the savings,while repeatedly ratcheting up insurance premiums.see also roger blair jeffrey harrison,antitrust policy and monopsony,cornell,explaining that lower input prices resulting from the exercise of monopsony power do not ultimately translate into lower prices to the monopsonist customers.
but most importantly,the defendants argument reflects a basic misunderstanding of the antitrust laws.the ninth circuit discussion in knevelbaard dairies kraft foods,cir,illustrates the point well.there,the plaintiff milk producers established that the defendant cheese makers had conspired to depress the price they paid for milk.the cheese makers argued that the plaintiffs injuries were not antitrust,were not the kind of injuries the antitrust laws were intended to prevent,brunswick,at the conspiracy enabled them to purchase milk at lower costs and thus to sell cheese to consumers at lower prices.knevelbaard dairies,at.the ninth circuit properly rejected this argument 
the fallacy of th e defendants argument becomes clear when we recall that the central purpose of the antitrust laws is to preserve competition.it is the collusive fixing of prices at levels either low or these statutes recognize as vital to the public interest.the supreme court references to the goals of achieving the lowest prices,the highest quality and the greatest material progress,pac.ry.united states,and of assur ing customers the benefits of price competition,associated contractors of,cal.state council of carpenters,do not mean that conspiracies among buyers to depress acquisition prices are tolerated.every precedent in the field makes clear that the interaction of competitive forces,not,is what will benefit consumers.
see also mandeville,at.similar reasoning applies here.highmark improperly motivated exercise of monopsony power,like the collusive exercise of oligopsony power by the cheese makers in knevelbaard,was anticompetitive and can not be defended on the sole ground that it enabled highmark to set lower premiums on its insurance plans.
having concluded that paying west penn artificially depressed reimbursement rates was an anticompetitive aspect of the alleged conspiracy,it follows that the underpayments constitute an antitrust injury.see atl.richfield,at holding that an antitrust injury is an injury that is attributable to an aspect of the practice under scrutiny brunswick,at areeda hovenkamp,supra,at noting that sellers receiving illegally low prices suffer antitrust injury.

highmark argues that the conspiracy claims are.under,a suit to recover damages for a violation of the sherman act must be commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued.in zenith radio hazeltine research,the supreme court declared that an antitrust cause of action generally accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run when a defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiff business.id.at.however,i n the context of a continuing conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws,each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendants a cause of action accrues to it to recover the damages caused by that act and as to those damages,the statute of limitations runs from the commission of the act.hanover shoe,united shoe mach,in re lower lake erie iron ore antitrust,cir a n injurious act within the limitations period may serve as a basis for an antitrust suit.see also klehr smith.
west penn initiated this lawsuit on april,and so the limitations period extends back to april.see.the complaint adequately alleges that the defendants performed injurious acts in furtherance of the conspiracy within the limitations period.the complaint alleges,for example,that as part of the conspiracy,highmark refused to increase west penn reimbursement rates in.on a straightforward reading of zenith,it therefore appears that west penn may,consistent with the statute of limitations,recover damages for the acts that occurred within the limitations period.see at.
highmark acknowledges all of this,but urges us to adopt a limitation on zenith.citing persuasive authority,highmark asks us to hold that no cause of action accrues based on injurious acts that occur within the limitations period,if those acts are merely reaffirmations of acts done or decisions made outside the limitations period.see highmark br.at citing,grand rapids plastics,lakian,cir.highmark says that under this standard west penn conspiracy claims are,because the acts that allegedly occurred within the limitations period were merely manifestations of decisions made or acts done outside the limitations period.we reject highmark proposed standard,as it is inconsistent with controlling precedent.
we start with hanover shoe.there,a shoe manufacturer sued a shoemaking machinery company for monopolization under section of the sherman act.the manufacturer asserted that in,the machinery company had established a policy for its most important equipment,under which it would would not equipment to manufacturers.at.the manufacturer claimed that the policy had enabled the machinery company to maintain a monopoly in the market for shoemaking equipment,and that as a result,it had incurred artificially inflated costs in carrying out its business.id.at.although the manufacturer asserted that the policy had been established in,it did not file suit against the machinery company until.citing the time gap,the machinery company asserted that the suit was.the supreme court disagreed 
the machinery company has advanced the argument that because the earliest impact on the manufacturer of the machinery company lease only policy occurred in,the manufacturer cause of action arose during that year and is now barred by the applicable statute of limitations but w e are not dealing with a violation which,if it occurs at all,must occur within some specific and limited time span rather,we are dealing with conduct which constituted a continuing violation of the sherman act and which inflicted continuing and accumulating harm on the manufacturer.although the manufacturer could have sued in for the injury then being inflicted,it was equally entitled to sue in.
id.at.the court so held even though the injurious acts that took place within the limitations,instances in which the machinery company persisted in its refusal to offer its equipment for simply manifestations of the policy,which had been established in,well before the start of the limitations period.see see also klehr,at noting that in the context of a conspiracy,any given sale gives rise to a cause of action to recover the damages caused by that sale harold friedman,thorofare,cir section suit challenging shopping center refusal to lease space to grocery store deemed timely,even though refusal was grounded upon an exclusivity clause in a lease that was entered into between the shopping center and a rival grocery store more than four years before the commencement of the suit.
our decision in lower lake erie is along the same lines.there the plaintiffs,which included docking and transportation companies,sued a railroad under section of the sherman act.the companies proved that the defendant had participated in a conspiracy among railroads to exclude the companies from the market for the handling and transportation of iron ore.at.the railroads had excluded the companies by,among other things,refusing to lease them dock property suitable for the shipment of iron ore,and by overcharging the companies to use the railroads to ship ore.id.the defendant argued that because the conspiracy had gotten under way outside the limitations period,the companies claims were.we disagreed,reasoning that the companies claims were timely because the railroads exclusionary conduct,including refusing to lease dock property and overcharging for use of the railroads,had continued into the limitations period.see id.at accord bell dow chem,cir imperial point colonnades,mangurian,cir,followed in harold friedman,at nn.poster,screen serv,cir.but see,david orgell,geary stores,cir.taken together,hanover shoe and lower lake erie leave no room for highmark proposed rule.in each case,the plaintiff suit was timely even though the acts that occurred within the limitations period were reaffirmations of decisions originally made outside the limitations period.
finally,we note that the policies underlying limitations,providing potential defendants with repose and avoiding prejudice caused by lost evidence,faded memories,and unavailable witnesses,see wilson garcia,do not counsel in favor of recognizing highmark proposed rule.as for repose,the fifth circuit said it well in poster exchange,where it rejected a rule strikingly similar to the one highmark proposes here 
adopting the defendant rule would improperly transform the limitations statute from one of repose to one of continued immunity.for according to the defendant argument,a plaintiff who suffers damage from a continuing antitrust violation is barred not only from proving violations and damages more than four years old,but is barred forever from complaining of the continuation of the unlawful conduct.the function of the limitations statute is simply to pull the blanket of peace over acts and events which have themselves already slept for the statutory period,thus barring the proof of wrongs embedded in events.employing the limitations statute additionally to immunize recent repetition or continuation of violations and damages occasioned thereby not only extends the statute beyond its purpose,but also conflicts with the policies of vigorous enforcement of private rights through private actions.
at internal citations omitted.with regard to the policy of avoiding prejudice,the defendants hardly are in a position to argue for the protection of the statute of limitations on the traditional ground that evidence has been lost,memories have faded,and witnesses have disappeared when it is the defendants own recent conduct that results in a finding of a newly accruing cause of action.imperial point,at internal citations and punctuation omitted.
we thus end up where we started zenith should be applied on its terms.under zenith,west penn conspiracy claims are not because the complaint adequately alleges that the defendants performed injurious acts in furtherance of the conspiracy within the limitations period.

in addition to the conspiracy claims,west penn alleges that upmc violated section of the sherman act by attempting to monopolize the allegheny county market for specialized hospital services.the elements of attempted monopolization are that the defendant has a specific intent to monopolize,and that the defendant has engaged in anticompetitive conduct that,taken as a whole,creates a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.spectrum sports,mcquillan,swift united states,lepage,cir en banc holding that a court should consider a defendant an
