in,south carolina spartanburg county school district seven adopted a policy allowing public school students to receive two academic credits for religious instruction offered by private educators.the parents of two students at spartanburg high school commenced this action against the school district,alleging that the policy impermissibly endorses religion and entangles church and state,in violation of the establishment clause of the first amendment.
the school district filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they were not injured by the policy,and that the policy,in any event,was constitutional in that it was neutrally stated and administered and that it had the secular purpose of accommodating students desire to receive religious instruction.the plaintiffs filed a for summary judgment,arguing that that the purpose and primary effect of the school district policy was to promote christianity.the district court rejected the school district standing argument but agreed with it on the merits and,accordingly,granted summary judgment to the school district.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
since at least,a number of school districts in south carolina have allowed students to be released for part of the school day in order to receive religious instruction.initially,the students who availed themselves of this opportunity did not receive grades or academic credit,which made enrollment difficult for some students.in,the south carolina general assembly found that the absence of an ability to award academic credit ha d essentially eliminated the school districts ability to accommodate parents and students desires to participate in released time programs,acts,and it responded by enacting the released time credit act.the released time credit act provides in part 
a school district board of trustees may award high school students no more than two elective carnegie units for the completion of released time classes in religious instruction if 
the released time classes in religious instruction are evaluated on the basis of purely secular criteria that are substantially the same criteria used to evaluate similar classes at established private high schools for the purpose of determining whether a student transferring to a public high school from a private high school will be awarded elective carnegie units for such classes and 
the decision to award elective carnegie units is neutral as to,and does not involve any test for,religious content or denominational affiliation.
ann.a.the act specifies that the secular criteria for evaluation include but are not limited to 
number of hours of classroom instruction time 
review of the course syllabus which reflects the course requirements and materials used 
methods of assessment used in the course and 
whether the course was taught by a certified teacher.
soon after the general assembly enacted the released time credit act,spartanburg county school district seven adopted a released time policy,dated march.the policy states in part 
the district will accept no more than two elective carnegie unit credits for religious instruction taken during the school day in accordance with this policy.the district will evaluate the classes on the basis of purely secular criteria prior to accepting credit.the district will accept transfer of credit for released time classes with prior approval.
the policy requires that released time courses be taken away from school property,without the assistance of public staff or funding.the policy also directs that district staff and faculty not promote or discourage participation by district students in a released time program.
early in,a private,unaccredited religious education organization,spartanburg county bible education in school time spartanburg bible school,approached a number of south carolina school districts,including spartanburg county school district seven,requesting that they allow students to participate in a released time religious course a christian worldview class for academic credit.in discussions with school district seven,the school officials conveyed their preference that administrators receive grades under the released time program as transfer credits from accredited private schools,rather than from unaccredited education providers,such as spartanburg bible school.this arrangement would be consistent with the school district practice of receiving grades awarded by a private school,including grades for religious courses,when a private school student transfers into public school.the officials explained that by receiving released time grades through a private school transfer transcript,the school district could obviate the need for school officials to become involved in assessing the quality of religious courses.
following the school district preference,spartanburg bible school entered into an arrangement with oakbrook preparatory school,an accredited private christian school,by which spartanburg bible school could submit its grades through oakbrook to spartanburg high school.under the arrangement,oakbrook agreed to review and monitor spartanburg bible school curriculum,its teacher qualifications,and educational objectives,and to award course credit and grades given by the bible school before transferring them to spartanburg high school.in carrying out the arrangement,oakbrook reviewed syllabi,spoke with instructors,suggested minor curricular adjustments,and satisfied itself that the spartanburg bible school course was academically rigorous.
after spartanburg bible school began its instruction under the arrangement with oakbrook and spartanburg high school,spartanburg high school never actively or directly engaged in promoting the spartanburg bible school course or any other released time course.the spartanburg bible school course was not listed in the spartanburg high school course catalog,and the bible school was not permitted to advertise itself in spartanburg high school classrooms.while the bible school did provide spartanburg high school guidance counselors with flyers,the counselors were authorized to discuss spartanburg bible school or the flyers with parents and students only after they expressed an interest in learning about the program.spartanburg high school did,however,allow spartanburg bible school to staff an informational table at its annual registration open house for parents and students,as it did for other outside organizations,such as military and college recruiters.
over a period of three years,spartanburg high school students,out of the roughly students in the school each year,elected to participate in the released time course at spartanburg bible school.
the plaintiffs robert moss,the parent of melissa moss,who attended spartanburg high school and has now graduated melissa moss,in her own right ellen tillett,for herself and on behalf of her minor child who attends spartanburg high school and the freedom from religion foundation,commenced this action in june against school district seven,pursuant to,alleging that school district seven released time policy violates the establishment clause of the constitution.
the record shows that neither of the two student plaintiffs participated in the spartanburg bible school course,nor did they claim to have been harassed in any way for not so participating.moreover,both students were not adversely affected by released time grades,as they had higher gpas than any of their classmates who did participate in the spartanburg bible school course.the student plaintiffs also did not claim to have seen spartanburg bible school personnel on spartanburg high school grounds or to have encountered at the high school any efforts at advertising or promoting the spartanburg bible school.the mosses,however,did receive a promotional letter in the mail from spartanburg bible school,which indicated that the school would be conducting a released time course which will be available for elective credit to students who attend spartanburg high school.the course would help students learn the basic tenets of the christian worldview,and it would teach students how they ought to live as a result of what they have learned.while the school district did provide spartanburg bible school with the addresses of students so that it could send the promotional letter,school district and high school officials did not review or approve the letter before it was sent.
on the parties for summary judgment,the district court entered judgment in favor of school district seven.in doing so,the court applied the framework established in lemon kurtzman,d,and concluded that the school district released time policy did not violate the lemon test adopted for enforcing the establishment clause.as to the first prong,focusing on purpose,the court concluded that the school district stated purpose for its release time program,the accommodation of religion,was plausible and therefore had to be accepted that this purpose was secular and that the plaintiffs have failed to show that the school district harbored an impermissible religious motive.on the second prong,focusing on effect,the court concluded that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the adoption and implementation of the school district released time policy ha d the principal effect of advancing religion and that,viewed from the perspective of an objective observer,the school district policy did no more than merely accommodate students desire to partake in religious instruction.finally,with respect to the third prong,focusing on entanglement,the court concluded,
by limiting the acceptance of academic credit to grades from accredited schools,the school district released time policy was designed to disentangle the school district from reviewing the religious content of released time instruction.the policy was cast in neutral terms and allow ed its students to petition for released time religious instruction regardless of the specific religion or denomination.plaintiffs have failed to show how the school district passive acceptance of academic credit for religious instruction constitute d excessive entanglement with religion.
from the district court judgment,dated april,the plaintiffs filed this appeal.
ii.standing 
the school district contends first that plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the constitutionality of the released time policy because they were not injured by the policy.
the constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to resolving cases and controversies.const.art.iii,cl.one aspect of the requirement is that a federal lawsuit must seek to prevent or redress an actual or imminently threatened injury to the plaintiff.summers earth island,d.plaintiffs may not establish their standing to bring suit merely because they disagree with a government policy,see.christian sch.tuition org.winn,d,or because they share the generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance,schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war,d.
relying on cursory remarks about standing in the footnotes of two supreme court decisions,the plaintiffs propose that we adopt a per se rule that students and parents always have standing to bring suit against policies at their school when they allege a violation of the establishment clause,regardless of whether they allege or can prove personal injury.see sch.dist.of abington schempp,d finding standing where students and parents were directly affected by the laws and practices against which their complaints are directed zorach clauson.finding standing because,unlike the appellants in doremus board of education,appellants here are parents of children currently attending schools subject to the released time program.
the plaintiffs argument,however,reads far too much into the unremarkable discussions of standing in schempp and zorach.neither case justifies the sweeping conclusion that parents and students currently in school may challenge the constitutionality of school policies without demonstrating that they were personally injured in some way by those policies.the zorach footnote merely states that one of the impediments that undermined standing in doremus specifically,the child of the parent plaintiff had graduated since the complaint was filed and therefore was no longer subject to the school allegedly unconstitutional policies did not present a problem in zorach because the affected students were still attending the school.and schempp,far from suggesting that all students or parents have standing to object to unconstitutional school policies,conferred standing only because the students bringing suit were directly affected by the laws and practices against which their complaints were directed.at.emphasis added.
while the plaintiffs are not exempt from the basic constitutional requirement that they be injured and thus have a concrete stake in the dispute,we have nonetheless recognized that standing principles must be tailored to reflect the kind of injuries establishment clause plaintiffs are likely to suffer.suhre haywood,cir.many of the harms that establishment clause plaintiffs suffer are spiritual and,rather than tangible and economic.aclu rabun cnty.chamber of commerce,cir.consequently,plaintiffs have been found to possess standing when they are spiritual ly affront ed as a result of direct and unwelcome contact with an alleged religious establishment within their community.suhre,at see also saladin city of milledgeville,cir concluding that establishment clause plaintiffs have more than an abstract interest in their claims when they are part of the relevant community and are directly affronted.nonetheless,we must guard against efforts to use this principle to derive standing from the bare fact of disagreement with a government policy,even passionate disagreement premised on establishment clause principles.such disagreement,taken alone,is not sufficient to prove spiritual injury.see valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d holding that plaintiffs,who resided in maryland and virginia,lacked standing to challenge a property transfer in pennsylvania,and rejecting the argument that any person asserting an establishment clause violation possesses a spiritual stake sufficient to confer standing.
with these principles in hand,we now address the standing of the plaintiffs,taking their circumstances separately,as they differ.
ellen tillett,her child,and the foundation 
the facts to support standing for ellen tillett and her child are notably thin.they had no personal exposure to the spartanburg bible school course apart from their abstract knowledge of the school district released time policy.moreover,they have alleged nothing to suggest that the policy or the bible school course injured them in any way.tillett child never participated in the course and had not been pressured or encouraged to attend the course by anyone.neither tillett nor her child suffered any adverse repercussions from the child decision not to enroll in the course.and the child gpa was higher than that of any student in the child class who took the spartanburg bible school course.
moreover,ellen tillett did not receive the promotional letter from spartanburg bible school,as her child had not entered high school at the time the letter was sent.she was told about the letter by heidi moss,robert moss wife,and only read it in preparation for this litigation.tillett claims that after reading the letter,she found it to be offensive because it reflected intolerance and in what should be an open learning environment.tillett testified that the school district policy also made her child feel like an outsider at spartanburg high school because it made him aware of the prevalence of intolerance in his community.tillett has not suggested,however,that either she or her child altered conduct as a result of the released time policy.
tillett allegations amount to little more than simple disagreement with the wisdom of the school district policy.tillett and her child do not suggest that they were the targets or victims of this alleged religious intolerance indeed,they are christians.thus they are seeking to vindicate,not their own rights,but the rights of others.in these circumstances,we conclude that tillett and her child lack standing to challenge the school distri
