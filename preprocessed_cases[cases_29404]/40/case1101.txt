opinion of the court 
this case requires us to determine whether a municipality may,consistent with the tax act ahta,require airlines to pay a tax every time one of their flights lands within the municipality borders.tinicum township tinicum enacted an ordinance establishing just such a tax.airline industry groups complained to the department of transportation dot,arguing that the tax violated the ahta.the dot agreed with the industry groups and issued a declaratory order invalidating the ordinance.tinicum filed a petition for review,and we will deny that petition.
the city of philadelphia city owns and operates the philadelphia international airport airport.some of the airport runways,however,are located within tinicum borders.about fifty years ago,a dispute arose over whether tinicum could charge the city property tax for the airport use of that land.rather than litigate the matter to completion,tinicum and the city settled.the city agreed to make periodic payments to tinicum in exchange for continued runway access.but that agreement the payments,which amounted to as much as million per year,may.unable to reach a new agreement with the city,on june,tinicum enacted ordinance,which provides 
t here shall be imposed upon all aircraft users a privilege fee for use of property located within tinicum township for landing of aircraft of per one thousand pounds of part thereof of approved maximum landed weight.fees will be determined by weight listed in the federal aviation administration faa type certificate data sheet.
appendix app.
the ordinance became effective on july.app.over the course of the next month,passenger airlines including united,southwest,and delta and parcel shippers including federal express and united parcel service landed flights at the airport on runways located within tinicum,but refused to pay the tax.the air transport association ata and the air carrier association of america acaa,industry groups whose membership includes many of those carriers,petitioned the dot to review the ordinance and invalidate it on the ground that it violated the ahta.after receiving written submissions from ata,acaa,tinicum,and other interested parties,the dot issued an order agreeing with the industry groups and declaring the ordinance invalid.tinicum then filed a petition for review of the dot administrative order.ata and the airports council america,a coalition of local governments that own and operate airports,entered the case as intervenors,urging the denial of tinicum petition for review.
the dot had subject matter jurisdiction over the ata and the acaa petition for a declaratory order pursuant to a.this court has subject matter jurisdiction to review the dot declaratory order pursuant to a and c.
the dot is charged with administering the ahta.see nw.airlines,county of kent,d the secretary of transportation is charged with administering the federal aviation laws,including the ahta.we therefore review the dot interpretation of that statute using the framework established in chevron,natural resources defense council,d 
first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear the court must give effect to th at unambiguously expressed intent i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
in,congress enacted federal head,airplane passengers in order to raise money to help states and municipalities develop local airports.see aloha airlines,dir.of taxation,d discussing federal efforts to assist local airports.in,the supreme court in airport authority district delta airlines,held that states,too,may enact head taxes on interstate air travel,d.the court explained 
at least so long as the toll is based on some fair approximation of use or privilege for use of a state facility,and is neither discriminatory against interstate commerce nor excessive in comparison with the governmental benefit conferred,it will pass constitutional muster,even though some other formula might reflect more exactly the relative use of the state facilities by individual users.
congress became concerned that the court decision opened the floodgates for a hodgepodge of local head taxes and similar taxes that could complicate interstate air travel.see county of kent,at discussing congress perception of.so,in,congress enacted the ahta,which prohibited a wide array of state head taxes and other functionally similar tolls.see id.congress has since amended the statute several times,and it is now codified at.
immediately prior to recodification at,the ahta provided 
a prohibition exemption.no state or political subdivision thereof shall levy or collect a tax,fee,head charge,or other charge,directly or indirectly,on persons traveling in air commerce or on the carriage of persons traveling in air commerce or on the sale of air transportation or on the gross receipts derived therefrom 
b permissible states taxes and fees.except as provided in subsection d of this section prohibiting certain tolls deemed to unreasonably burden interstate commerce,nothing in this section shall prohibit a state or political subdivision thereof from the levy or collection of taxes other than those enumerated in subsection a of this section,including property taxes,net income taxes,franchise taxes,and sales or use taxes on the sale of goods or services and nothing in this section shall prohibit a state or political subdivision thereof owning or operating an airport from levying or collecting reasonable rental charges,landing fees,and other service charges from aircraft operators from the use of airport facilities.
f flight takeoff or landing requirement for state taxation.no state or political subdivision thereof shall levy or collect any tax on or with respect to any flight of a commercial aircraft or any activity or service on board such aircraft unless such aircraft takes off or lands in such state or political subdivision as part of such flight.
congress recodified the ahta and relocated it to via public law.section of that law set forth the new text 
b prohibitions.except as provided in subsection c of this section and section of this title,a state or political subdivision of a state may not levy or collect a tax,fee,head charge,or other charge on an individual traveling in air commerce the transportation of an individual traveling in air commerce the sale of air transportation or the gross receipts from that air commerce or transportation.
c aircraft taking off or landing in state.a state or political subdivision of a state may levy or collect a tax on or related to a flight of a commercial aircraft or an activity or service on the aircraft only if the aircraft takes off or lands in the state or political subdivision as part of the flight.
d unreasonable burdens and discrimination against interstate commerce.
a a state,political subdivision of a state,or authority acting for a state or political subdivision may not do any of the following acts because those acts unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce 
e other allowable taxes and charges.except as provided in subsection d of this section,a state or political subdivision of a state may levy or collect taxes except those enumerated in subsection b of this section,including property taxes,net income taxes,franchise taxes,and sales or use taxes on the sale of goods or services and reasonable rental charges,landing fees,and other service charges from aircraft operators for using airport facilities of an airport owned or operated by that state or subdivision.
e,stat,codified at.later in the recodification law,congress provided sections of this act restate,without substantive change,laws enacted before july,that were replaced by those sections.those sections may not be construed as making a substantive change in the laws replaced.a,stat.at.
in,congress proposed an amendment to the ahta that would have removed subsection b reference to subsection c as an e xcept ion to the ban on the four enumerated categories of taxes
