salvador peter serrano died in the early hours of october.serrano was a student at pennsylvania state university.serrano was walking down an alleyway in the borough of state college near a bar known as the rathskeller at about am with plaintiff brooke morgan,timothy padalino,and alison bresnahan.padalino stopped in a parking lot behind the rathskeller to urinate.
at this point,accounts of the incident diverge.the plaintiffs allege that an altercation began when an unidentified rathskeller employee observed padalino and violently forced him to the ground.jason and chris rosengrant,security personnel employed at the rathskeller,testified that they were informed that a fight was under way in the parking lot.they and several other rathskeller employees confronted a group in the parking lot that included serrano,morgan,padalino,and bresnahan.the rathskeller employees sought to restrain members of the group.chris rosengrant pulled serrano to the ground.
according to the plaintiffs,both rosengrants were involved in throwing serrano to the ground.they then held serrano down and restrained him while jason rosengrant pressed his knee into serrano back.according to the rosengrants,jason approached to assist chris and placed serrano hand behind his back.
officer winkelbach of the borough of state college police department scpd arrived on the scene while jason rosengrant was on top of serrano.officer winkelbach testified that rosengrant appeared to need assistance.winkelbach began to handcuff serrano before realizing that he was unresponsive.
serrano was pronounced dead on arrival at the centre county community hospital.the parties do not dispute that serrano died of asphyxia.however,the cause has been hotly contested.the plaintiffs expert,michael baden,stated that the rosengrants weight caused serrano death by positional asphyxia.the defendants expert,gordon carl handte,performed an autopsy on serrano and testified at a related criminal trial that he died from asphyxia by aspiration of vomitus.handte concluded that the death was accidental and noted that substantial alcohol intoxication was a contributing factor.
the plaintiffs grace jiminez,administratrix of serrano estate,and morgan,serrano fiancee at the time of his death,filed complaints in united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania on august,which they amended twice.morgan complaint was based on injuries she allegedly suffered during the encounter.on september,the district court granted a motion to dismiss by bluebird entertainment enterprise,the dark horse.on may,the district court granted the plaintiffs unopposed motion for settlement and dismissed all claims against phyllis gentzel and associated property management.
on june,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the borough of state college state college and the scpd on all claims against them.on july,the district court approved the plaintiffs unopposed motion for settlement with the remaining defendants and dismissed all claims against them.the plaintiffs timely appealed.

the plaintiffs advance claims under theories of municipal liability,pursuant to monell new york city department of social,d,and of danger liability.
under monell,a municipality can not be subjected to liability solely because injuries were inflicted by its agents or employees.see id.rather,it is when execution of a government policy or custom,whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under.id.there must be a direct causal link between a municipal policy or custom and the alleged constitutional deprivation to ground municipal liability.city of canton harris,d.we have previously observed that t here are three situations where acts of a government employee may be deemed to be the result of a policy or custom of the governmental entity for whom the employee works,thereby rendering the entity liable under 
the first is where the appropriate officer or entity promulgates a generally applicable statement of policy and the subsequent act complained of is simply an implementation of that policy.the second occurs where no rule has been announced as policy but federal law has been violated by an act of the policymaker itself.finally,a policy or custom may also exist where the policymaker has failed to act affirmatively at all,though the need to take some action to control the agents of the government is so obvious,and the inadequacy of existing practice so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights,that the policymaker can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.

we have also observed that a government policy or custom can be established in two ways.see andrews city of philadelphia,cir.the plaintiffs may establish a government policy by showing that a decisionmaker possess ing final authority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action issued an official statement of policy.pembaur city of cincinnati,d.the plaintiffs may establish that a course of conduct constitutes a custom when,though not authorized by law,such practices of state officials are so permanent and well settled that they operate as law.monell,at.in either instance,the plaintiffs have the burden of showing that a government policymaker is responsible by action or acquiescence for the policy or custom.andrews,at.we have also held that,at a minimum,the government must act with deliberate indifference to the purported constitutional deprivation in order to ground liability.san filippo bongiovanni,cir.
the plaintiffs second amended complaint alleges that the scpd engaged in a custom,practice,or policy of directing employees of various liquor licensees in the borough of state college,including the rathskeller,to detain restrain persons suspected by the liquor licensee to have violated the law until such time as the scpd could respond to the scene.the plaintiffs allege a custom of essentially permitting the liquor licensee employees to act as an auxiliary by handcuffing any person restrained by a liquor licensee security employee while taking no action against any security employee involved in the altercation.the complaint argues that this conduct was taken in accordance with official scpd policy or was so well settled as to have the same practical effect.the record documents a series of incidents involving liquor licensee personnel that the plaintiffs allege demonstrate this custom.
with regard to the plaintiffs monell claim,the district court found that t here is no competent evidence that indicates the scpd directed liquor licensee employees to detain or restrain individuals until the police arrived to effect an arrest,and that no reasonable jury could find from the evidence that there was a custom of delegation to the private security personnel.
the owner of the rathskeller,duke gastiger,testified in a july,deposition that his employees restrained individuals for defensive purposes only,and specifically denied that they took actions to prevent persons from leaving the area so that the police could determine whether any laws ha d been broken.gastiger was responsible for setting this policy of defensive restraint and communicated it orally to his staff.gastiger testified that the scpd has arrested some,but not all,of the persons detained by rathskeller employees.the plaintiffs produced evidence of a series of incidents,each of which involved the person restrained by the liquor licensee employee being handcuffed and removed from the scene by the scpd.gastiger stated that he did not consult with anyone at the scpd regarding this detention policy and that no official from the scpd offered any training or direction to his employees.
jason rosengrant testified that he was only permitted to restrain individuals to prevent them from causing bodily harm,and never for the purpose of detaining someone until the police arrived.he also testified that the scpd has never offered him any instructions or training.
the police officers deposed,including chief of the scpd thomas king,denied that there was a policy or custom of encouraging or permitting security personnel to detain individuals until the police could arrive.the deposition testimony uniformly demonstrated that there was no written policy and that no member of the scpd has ever given any instructions to rathskeller employees.the sole exception was that one sergeant instructed rathskeller employees to confiscate false identification,but not to detain those carrying it.several scpd officers testified that,if private security personnel inquired about detention procedures,their policy was to refer the inquiries to the employer private counsel or to the district attorney.
the sole piece of evidence at odds with the above testimony is an affidavit submitted by duke gastiger on april.the affidavit stated that members of the rathskeller staff had been asked on several occasions by the borough police department to hold people until the police got there,and that,t he police were aware we,on occasion,restrained intoxicated patrons until the police arrived.the affidavit also stated that there was an occasion where rathskeller staff were asked by the borough police to assist in apprehending and restraining individuals who were not on the rathskeller property.
the district court found that gastiger affidavit was not competent evidence because it contradicted his prior deposition testimony.the federal rules of civil procedure do not prescribe how courts should address contradictory subsequent affidavits.however,we have held that a party may not create a material issue of fact to defeat summary judgment by filing an affidavit disputing his or her own sworn testimony without demonstrating a plausible explanation for the conflict.baer chase,cir citing hackman valley fair,cir.this principle of summary judgment practice is often referred to as the sham affidavit doctrine.although district courts do not always refer to the sham affidavit doctrine by name,its roots in the federal courts can be traced at least as far back as the second circuit decision in perma research development singer,cir.nevertheless,the plaintiffs assert that t he sham affidavit doctrine utilized by the lower court to discount the bar owner affidavit was plainly in error.
the sham affidavit doctrine has created some disagreements among federal and state courts.the principal reason for these differences is that the federal rules do not address the handling of contradictory affidavits in summary judgment proceedings.rule governs the limited circumstances under which summary judgment is appropriate the plain language of rule permits consideration of affidavits in summary judgement proceedings.fed.civ.e.indeed,the original version of rule empowered courts to direct the appearance of affiant for examination,providing the court with an opportunity to question the affiant about contradictory testimony or affidavits.see collin cox,note,reconsidering the sham affidavit doctrine,duke.however,the current rule clearly contemplates that district courts will scrutinize affidavits,as it provides that,s hould it appear to the satisfaction of the court at any time that any of the affidavits presented pursuant to this rule are presented in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay,the court shall forthwith order a variety of sanctions against the offending party.fed.civ.g.nevertheless,as the rule does not prescribe how the court should regard the evidentiary value of contradictory affidavits,the sham affidavit doctrine has grown from a long line of court decisions.
the signal case remains perma research,in which the second circuit held that a contradictory affidavit failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact.perma research president,frank perrino,had testified extensively in depositions that he could not recall any instance in which the adverse party employees had behaved fraudulently.at.however,perrino submitted an affidavit during summary judgment proceedings stating that these same employees never had any intention of performing their contract with perma research.id.at.the second circuit observed that,i f there is any dispute as to the material facts,it is only because of inconsistent statements made by perrino the deponent and perrino the affiant,and that,i f a party who has been examined at length on deposition could raise an issue of fact simply by submitting an affidavit contradicting his own prior testimony,this would greatly diminish the utility of summary judgment as a procedure for screening out sham issues of fact.id.at.
since perma research,every federal court of appeals has adopted some form of the sham affidavit doctrine.see darnell target stores,cir colantuoni alfred calcagni sons,cir sinskey pharmacia ophthalmics,martin merrell dow,cir barwick celotex,cir reid sears roebuck and,cir franks nimmo,cir albertson stevenson,cir van junkins assocs.indus,cir camfield tires,michelin tire,cir radobenko automated equip,cir.
although several state courts and a handful of commentators have criticized the sham affidavit doctrine,we do not doubt its continued vitality and importance.the supreme court in anderson liberty lobby laid down the axiom of summary judgment practice that,t he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff position will be insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff,d.some state courts have nevertheless likened the sham affidavit doctrine to a determination of credibility or a weighing of the evidence,both of which are impermissible at the summary judgment stage.see,webster sill,utah.the liberty lobby court recognized this distinction,noting that it is clear enough from our recent cases that at the summary judgment stage the judge function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.at.it is use of the term genuine issue,rather than any issue of fact,that implicitly demonstrates the necessity of the sham affidavit doctrine as a means of sorting the wheat from the chaff.in explaining its use of the term genuine issue of fact,the liberty lobby court buttressed the trial judge role in sorting the genuine from the fallacious there is no requirement that the trial judge make findings of fact.the inquiry performed is the threshold inquiry of determining whether there is the need for a,in other words,there are any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.id.at.
it is this determination that permits trial judges to disregard contradictory affidavits.a sham affidavit is a contradictory affidavit that indicates only that the affiant can not maintain a consistent story or is willing to offer a statement solely for the purpose of defeating summary judgment.a sham affidavit can not raise a genuine issue of fact because it is merely a variance from earlier deposition testimony,and therefore no reasonable jury could rely on it to find for the nonmovant.see id.at.liberty lobby specifically recognizes the trial judge power to grant summary judgment on disputed records.see id.at.therefore,if it is clear that an affidavit is offered solely for the purpose of defeating summary judgment,it is proper for the trial judge to conclude that no reasonable jury could accord that affidavit evidentiary weight and that summary judgment is appropriate.
the main practical reason supporting the sham affidavit doctrine is that prior depositions are more reliable than affidavits.the second circuit noted in perma research that t he deposition of a witness will usually be more reliable than his affidavit,since the deponent was either by opposing counsel,or at least available to opposing couns
