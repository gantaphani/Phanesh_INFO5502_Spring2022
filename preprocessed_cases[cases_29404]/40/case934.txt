this appeal involves a constitutional challenge to an electronic surveillance program operated by the national security agency nsa under the authority of section of the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa.elliott schuchardt appeals an order of the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania dismissing his civil action for lack of jurisdiction.the district court held that schuchardt lacked standing to sue because he failed to plead facts from which one might reasonably infer that his own communications had been seized by the federal government.because we hold that,at least as a facial matter,schuchardt second amended complaint plausibly stated an injury in fact personal to him,we will vacate the district court order and remand.
schuchardt appeal is the latest in a line of cases raising the question of a plaintiff standing to challenge surveillance authorized by section.congress amended fisa in to supplement fisa authority by creating a new framework under which the government may target the communications of persons located abroad.clapper amnesty international usa,see also fisa amendments act of,pub,stat.on the day section became law,its constitutionality was challenged by attorneys and human rights,labor,legal,and media organizations whose work allegedly require d them to engage in telephone and email communications with persons located outside the united states.see id.at.the clapper plaintiffs claimed that section was facially unconstitutional under the fourth amendment,which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.see id.at.
the dispositive question presented to the supreme court in clapper was whether the plaintiffs had established an imminent injury fairly traceable to the government conduct under section.see at.because the plaintiffs had brought suit on the day the law was enacted,there was no evidence that their communications had been intercepted there was only a looming threat of future surveillance.id.at.nonetheless,the plaintiffs claimed they had standing because there was an objectively reasonable likelihood that their communications would be intercepted based on the nature of their contacts with persons outside of the country.id at.
the supreme court rejected this argument as inconsistent with longstanding precedent requiring that threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact,clapper,at emphasis in original quoting whitmore arkansas.and because the plaintiffs could rely only on a speculative chain of possibilities to support their allegations of future harm from unlawful government surveillance,they failed to demonstrate an injury that was certainly impending.id.at.
in particular,the court characterized the clapper plaintiffs speculative chain as entailing five inferential leaps 
the government will decide to target the communications of persons with whom the plaintiffs communicate 
in doing so,the government will choose to invoke its authority under section rather than another method of surveillance 
the article iii judges who serve on the foreign intelligence surveillance court will conclude that the government proposed surveillance procedures satisfy section many safeguards and are consistent with the fourth amendment 
the government will succeed in intercepting the communications of the plaintiffs contacts and 
the plaintiffs will be parties to the particular communications that the government intercepts.
on summary judgment,the plaintiffs had failed to set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts supporting these inferences.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,they lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of section.id.
soon after clapper was decided,former nsa contractor edward snowden leaked a trove of classified documents to journalists writing for the washington post and guardian those documents referenced the existence of an nsa program engaged in the bulk collection of domestic telephone metadata,details about telephone calls,including for example,the length of a call,the phone number from which the call was made,and the phone number called,but not the voice content of the call itself.aclu clapper,cir.see also smith obama,cir.obama klayman,cir.the operational parameters of the program were summarized in a classified order of the foreign intelligence surveillance court fisc directed at verizon business network services.aclu,at.in short,based on section of the usa patriot act,pub,stat,codified as amended at et,verizon was producing to the government,all call detail records or telephony metadata on all telephone calls made through its systems or using its services where one or both ends of the call are located in the united states.aclu,at.
the government bulk collection of telephone metadata precipitated a number of lawsuits.in one case,the second circuit held that the government had exceeded its statutory authority under section to obtain relevant information by constructing an database of every telephone call made or received in the united states.aclu,at.under the statute sunset provision,however,authorization for the bulk telephone metadata collection program expired on june.see pub,stat.authorizing an extension smith,at.and although the program was subsequently reauthorized by the usa freedom act,pub,stat,that act prohibits any further bulk collection.smith,at.in reliance on that prohibition,the ninth circuit has determined that claims related to the ongoing collection of metadata under section are now moot.id.
separate and apart from the bulk collection of telephone metadata under section,the documents leaked to the washington post and guardian also shed light on a previously undisclosed electronic surveillance program operating under section called prism slides from a presentation purportedly authored by the nsa described prism as collect ing directly from the servers the full content of user communications exchanged using services provided by several large companies including microsoft,google,yahoo,apple,and facebook.app.another slide depicted a timeline showing the inception of prism collection from each company,beginning with microsoft in september and ending with apple in october.yet another slide suggested a slogan for the nsa new collection posture sniff it all,know it all,collect it all,process it all,exploit it all,and partner it all.app.
on june,schuchardt filed a complaint in the district court asserting constitutional,statutory,and state law claims against the president,the director of national intelligence,and the directors of the nsa and federal bureau of investigation.he alleged that the government was violating the fourth amendment by storing his confidential communications in a computer database,or through a government program,which the defendants call prism.civil complaint,schuchardt obama.june,ecf.he sought to enjoin the government from engaging in any further collection of his information.id.
schuchardt responded to the government successive motions to dismiss by amending his complaint twice.in addition to refining and expanding his allegations,schuchardt supplemented his averments with exhibits,the contents of which fall into two general categories.first,he supported his allegations regarding prism with excerpts of the classified materials that were the focus of the washington post and guardian reports,as well as several of the reports themselves.second,he included affidavits filed in support of the plaintiffs in jewel nsa jewel i,supp.cal,a case challenging the nsa interception of internet traffic flowing through a telecommunications facility in san francisco pursuant to an executive order issued shortly after september.id.at.jewel i was decided on remand from jewel nsa,cir,in which the ninth circuit held that the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded article iii standing to sue.see at.the affidavits in jewel i were filed by former nsa employees who asserted that the agency had,since september,developed an expansive view of its own surveillance authority and the technology to back it up.see,app.the approach was that nsa could circumvent federal statutes and the constitution as long as there was some visceral connection to looking for terrorists.the nsa has,or is in the process of obtaining,the capability to seize and store most electronic communications passing through its intercept centers.
based on the record he had compiled,schuchardt second amended complaint alleged that because the government was intercepting,monitoring and storing the content of all or substantially all of the sent by american citizens,his own online communications had been seized in the dragnet.app,emphasis added.in particular,schuchardt asserted that he was a consumer of various types of electronic communication,storage,and internet services,including the services provided by google and yahoo the internet search services of google the cloud storage services provided by google and dropbox and the and instant message services provided by facebook.app.then,relying on the operational details of prism made public by the washington post and guardian,he alleged that the government had obtained direct access to the servers of the companies providing him with these services the government was unlawfully intercepting,accessing,monitoring storing his private communications made or stored through such services and the government was collecting such information in order to data mine the nation database.app.
in its motion to dismiss schuchardt second amended complaint,the government principally took issue with his allegation that the nsa collects the online communications of all americans,including,therefore,his.see brief in support of defendants motion to dismiss plaintiff second amended complaint at,schuchardt obama,ecf emphasis added.specifically,the government argued that because section authorizes the targeted surveillance of only persons outside the united states,it was implausible that prism a program operating under the authority of section was a dragnet capturing all the country domestic online communications.in support of its position,the government cited a report on prism prepared by the privacy and civil liberties oversight board pclob an independent agency tasked with review ing actions the executive branch takes to protect the nation from terrorism,ensuring that the need for such actions is balanced with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties.c.based on its review,the pclob determined that i n prism collection,the government sends selectors such as an email address to a united electronic communications service provider,who is then by law compelled to give the communications sent to or from that selector to the government.pclob report at.far from being the dragnet that schuchardt had alleged,therefore,prism collection under section may be targeted only at persons located abroad who possess or are likely to receive information.brief in support of defendants motion to dismiss at,schuchardt obama,ecf.because none of schuchardt allegations suggested that he or his associates would be targeted as such persons,the government argued that he had failed to include allegations and allegations of fact necessary to establish his standing.brief in support of defendants motion to dismiss plaintiff second amended complaint at,schuchardt obama,ecf.
the district court granted the government motion to dismiss schuchardt second amended complaint,but took a slightly different tack than what the government had suggested.after considering four cases examining constitutional standing to sue in cases challenging national security surveillance clapper,aclu,jewel,and klayman the court deduced a meaningful distinction that explained their divergent outcomes.schuchardt obama,wl,at.in situations where plaintiffs are able to allege with some degree of particularity that their own communications were specifically targeted for example by citing a leaked fisc order or relying on a detailed insider account courts have concluded that the particularity requirement has been satisfied.id.on the other hand,courts have refused to find standing based on naked averments that an individual communications must have been seized because the government operates a data collection program and the individual utilized the service of a large telecommunications company.id.
applying the pleading standard it had gleaned from clapper,aclu,jewel,and klayman,the district court began by noting that the facts underpinning schuchardt allegations were drawn almost entirely from media reports and publicly available information.id.accordingly,his lawsuit fell squarely within the second category of cases,those brought by plaintiffs who lacked article iii standing.id.furthermore,schuchardt had identified no facts from which the court reasonably might infer that his own communications have been targeted,seized,or stored.id.as such,he was indistinguishable from every other american subscribing to the services of a major telephone internet service provider.id.his only discernible distinction was his heightened in the subject,which was insufficient to confer standing.id.citing schlesinger reservists comm.to stop the war.
the district court had jurisdiction over schuchardt claims under,as well as the inherent power to ascertain its own jurisdiction.see arbaugh.we have jurisdiction under.see also bender williamsport area sch.we review de novo the district court order dismissing schuchardt second amended complaint.see fleisher standard ins,cir.
at the outset,we note that there is an important distinction between facial and factual attacks on subject matter jurisdiction raised in a motion under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.see mortensen first fed.sav.loan,cir.in a facial attack,we review only the allegations of the complaint and documents referenced therein and attached thereto,in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.gould elecs.united states,cir.if,however,the defendant contests the pleaded jurisdictional facts,the court must permit the plaintiff to respond with evidence supporting jurisdiction.id.at citing int l ass of machinists aerospace workers nw.airlines,cir.the court may then determine jurisdiction by weighing the evidence presented by the parties,but if there is a dispute of a material fact,the court must conduct a plenary trial on the contested facts prior to making a jurisdictional determination.id.
it is clear from the record in this case that the district court viewed the government motion to dismiss as a facial attack on its jurisdiction.the court analysis focused solely on schuchardt second amended complaint it did not consider any extrinsic facts proffered by the government,including,for example,the nature of prism collection as determined by the pclob.see schuchardt,wl,at.accordingly,our review of the district court order will accept as true all of schuchardt plausible allegations,and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor 
we begin our analysis with first principles.as a plaintiff seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction,schuchardt bears the burden of establishing each element of his standing to sue under article iii.see lujan defenders of wildlife.t he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.id.at.
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
id.at internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.
because a motion to dismiss raising a facial attack on subject matter jurisdiction relies solely on the pleadings,we apply the same standard of review we use when assessing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.see finkelman nfl,cir.thus,to survive a motion to dismiss for lack of standing,a plaintiff must allege facts that affirmatively and plausibly suggest that he has standing to sue.id.internal quotation marks omitted.that is,the plaintiff must plausibly allege facts establishing each constitutional requirement.hassan city of new york,cir.see also spokeo,robins.
against this doctrinal backdrop,schuchardt article iii standing turns on two inquiries.first,were his allegations sufficiently particularized to demonstrate that he suffered a discrete injury see lujan,at.second,were those facts pleaded with enough detail to render them plausible,allegations entitled to a presumption of truth see ashcroft iqbal,bell atl.twombly.we address each inquiry in turn.
a particularized article iii injury is one that affect s the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.in re schering plough.consumer class action,cir.quoting lujan,at.that putative litigants must suffer in some discrete and personal fashion ensures,first,that the legal questions presented will be resolved,not in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society,but in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action,and,second,that our exercise of judicial power shows p roper regard for the other two coequal branches of the federal government.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for the separation of church state.these two concerns respect for the judicial role and separation of powers are most salient when courts are asked to review actions of the political branches in the fields of intelligence gathering and foreign affairs.clapper,at.
the supreme court has identified a subset of cases in which plaintiffs routinely fail to demonstrate particularized injury because they present only generalized grievances,injuries that are undifferentiated and common to all members of the public.lujan,at quoting united states richardson.whether styled as a constitutional or prudential limit on standing,the court has sometimes determined that where large numbers of americans suffer alike,the political process,rather than the judicial process,may provide the more appropriate remedy.fed.election comm akins.such cases often involve government action directed at the public at large,or harms that by their nature touch upon interests that are widely shared.see,schlesinger,at plaintiffs asserting violation of the incompatibility clause by members of congress also serving in the armed reserves lacked standing because their only interest was to have the judicial branch compel the executive branch to act in conformity with the law an interest shared by all citizens sierra club morton,association challenging development of national park lacked standing based on alleged special interest in conservation.
nevertheless,t he fact that an injury may be suffered by a large number of people does not of itself make that injury a nonjusticiable generalized grievance.spokeo,at.the victims injuries from a mass tort,for example,are widely shared,to be sure,but each individual suffers a particularized harm.see also massachusetts epa,s tanding is not to be denied simply because many people suffer the same injury.to deny standing to persons who are in fact injured simply because many others are also injured,would mean that the most injurious and widespread government actions could be questioned by nobody.and although particularity and concreteness are distinct elements constituting injury in fact,see spokeo,at,the supreme court has also observed that the judicial language accompanying generalized grievances invariably appears in cases where the harm is not only widely shared,but also of an abstract or indefinite nature for example,harm to the common concern for obedience to law.akins,at emphasis added.
we applied these principles in a recent case involving allegations of government surveillance.in hassan city of new york,the plaintiffs claimed that the new york city police department nypd had implemented a program to monitor the lives of muslims,their businesses,houses of worship,organizations,and schools.at.the program allegedly entailed widespread photo and video surveillance of organizations and businesses visibly or openly affiliated with islam,and the infiltration of groups with informants and undercover police officers.id.at.the information gathered was compiled into a series of reports document ing american muslim life in painstaking detail.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the hassan plaintiffs discovered the program after some of these reports became widely publicized,and they asserted that the fallout required them to alter their ordinary conduct.see id.at.
we held that the plaintiffs allegations in hassan were sufficient to demonstrate particularized injury under article iii.after determining that they had asserted an invasion of a legally protected interest t he indignity of being singled out by the government for special burdens on the basis of one religious calling we observed that the particularized nature of an injury does not turn on the number of persons that may claim it.id.at.t hat hundreds or thousands or even millions of other persons may have suffered the same injury does not change the individualized nature of the asserted rights and interests at stake.id.at citing akins,at.harm to all even in the nuanced world of standing law can not be logically equated with harm to no one.id.and with regard to allegations of widespread government surveillance,we stated that because the plaintiffs had claim ed to be the very targets of the allegedly unconstitutional surveillance,they were unquestionably affect ed in a personal and individual way.id.quoting lujan,at.
like the plaintiffs in hassan,schuchardt has alleged a program of government surveillance that,though universal in scope,is unmistakably personal in the purported harm.his second amended complaint describes prism as a dragnet that collects all or substantially all of the sent by american citizens by means of several large internet service providers.app.the collected information allegedly encompasses schuchardt personal communications,and includes not only the kind of intensely private details that one could reasonably expect to find in the email accounts of most americans bank account numbers credit card numbers passwords for financial data and health records but also data influenced by schuchardt personal circumstances,namely trade secrets and communications with clients of schuchardt law firm,which are privileged and confidential under applicable law.app.
the government strenuously disputes the plausibility of schuchardt assertion that prism collects all or substantially all of the sent by american citizens,and we address that dispute in detail below.but putting aside for the moment the question of whether schuchardt allegations concerning prism are entitled to a presumption of truth,the consequences that he identifies as flowing from the government alleged dragnet are undoubtedly personal to him insofar as he has a constitutional right to maintain the privacy of his personal communications,online or otherwise.see plumhoff rickard,fourth amendment rights are personal rights which may not be vicariously asserted.quoting alderman united states.that interest is neither indivisibly abstract nor indefinite,see warshak united states,cir,and the fact that a large percentage of the population may share a similar interest does not change its individualized nature because schuchardt allegations make clear that he is among the persons that are the very targets of the allegedly unconstitutional surveillance.hassan,at riley california,extending the warrant requirement to searches of cellular phones,which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy.
having determined that schuchardt allegations stated a particularized injury under article iii,we now consider whether those allegations should be credited as true for the purpose of resolving the government jurisdictional objection.as noted previously,the district court construed the government motion to dismiss as a facial attack on its subject matter jurisdiction.as a result,we must accept schuchardt allegations as true,with the important caveat that the presumption of truth attaches only to those allegations for which there is sufficient factual matter to render them plausible on their face.iqbal,at.conclusory assertions of fact and legal conclusions are not entitled to the same presumption.see see also twombly,at connelly lane constr,cir.under the pleading regime established by twombly and iqbal,a court reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint must identify allegations that,because they are no more than conclusions,are not entitled to the assumption of truth.quoting iqbal,at 
we have recognized that t he plausibility determination is a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.see,connelly,at quoting iqbal,at.at the same time,we have cautioned that the plausibility standard does not impose a heightened pleading requirement,and that federal rule of civil procedure a continues to require only a showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.see,phillips cty.of allegheny,cir.the supreme court emphasized that it was neither demanding a heightened pleading of specifics nor imposing a probability requirement.indeed,although twombly and iqbal emphasized the plaintiff burden of pleading sufficient factual matter,the supreme court also expressly disavow ed the requirement that a plaintiff plead specific facts.boykin keycorp,cir.quoting twombly,at,and erickson pardus.
implicit in the notion that a plaintiff need not plead specific facts to survive a motion to dismiss is that courts can not inject evidentiary issues into the plausibility determination see twombly,at a complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable.this includes the weighing of facts or the requirement that a plaintiff plead specific facts beyond those necessary to state a valid claim.see id.at w hen a complaint adequately states a claim,it may not be dismissed based on a district court assessment that the plaintiff will fail to find evidentiary support for his allegations or prove his claim to the satisfaction of the factfinder.the same logic precludes a court from rejecting pleaded facts based on some blanket exclusion of evidence.see ricciuti new york city transit,cir.a contrary rule would confuse the principles applicable to a motion to dismiss with those governing a motion for summary judgment.campanella cty.of monroe,supp,see also whitney guys,cir.
accordingly,although it is unclear whether the district court applied a heightened pleading standard in this case,to the extent that its opinion suggests that schuchardt reliance on media reports and other information was impermissible,we disagree see schuchardt,wl,at.indeed,we held that the plaintiffs in hassan had plausibly pleaded both their standing to sue and claims for relief based on nypd surveillance reports that the plaintiffs had discovered only after they had been widely publicized.see at.similarly,we take the district court enumeration of the types of evidence giving rise to the plaintiffs standing in jewel and aclu a leaked fisc order or a detailed insider account as merely a suggestion of facts that would have strongly supported the plausibility of schuchardt allegations,rather than a requirement that he plead those specific facts.see wl,at.such limitations on the scope or source of facts that a plaintiff may plead to reach the threshold of plausibility run counter to the longstanding principles animating pretrial dispositions,as set forth in twombly and iqbal,and come close to the weighing of evidence and credibility determinations that are the exclusive province of the factfinder.see iqbal,at it is the conclusory nature of respondent allegations,rather than their extravagantly fanciful nature,that disentitles them to the presumption of truth.twombly,at rule b does not countenance dismissals based on a judge disbelief of a complaint factual allegations.quoting neitzke williams,see also anderson liberty lobby.
the upshot of all this for schuchardt is that his reliance on news articles and other disclosures concerning prism weighs neither in his favor nor against him.instead,these public reports and the leaked classified materials accompanying them are simply part and parcel of the factual matter that must be considered in assessing the plausibility of his allegations.we will therefore examine those reports in conjunction with the rest of schuchardt pleadings to ascertain whether he plausibly alleged a particularized injury under article iii.
based on our review of the pleadings,the plausibility of schuchardt alleged injury that the government has been unlawfully intercepting,accessing,monitoring storing his private communications,app.depends on the plausibility of his assertion that prism functions as an indiscriminate dragnet which captures all or substantially all of the sent by american citizens.app.aside from this sweeping allegation,schuchardt has supplied no facts suggesting how or why the government would have been interested in his online activity.his burden,therefore,was to allege enough factual matter to make plausible the government virtual dragnet.iqbal,at see also arpaio obama,cir.
schuchardt pleaded facts drawn from news articles published by the guardian,as well as the leaked and purportedly classified materials from which those articles were derived.as we noted in part,supra,these documents state that the nsa,through prism,has obtained direct access to the technical facilities of several major internet service providers.app.they indicate specific dates for when those providers granted the government access,app,and that the degree of access those providers granted enables the government to query their facilities at will for interception of an individual internet activity.app.they also describe the types of activity that may be accessed,encompassing both the content and metadata of private communications sent by those providers on behalf of their subscribers.app.finally,they claim that the rate of data c ollection is outpacing the government ability to ingest,process and store the data to the norms to which it has become accustomed,app,and that the nsa overriding surveillance goal is to c ollect it a ll,app.
by including these factual averments in his second amended complaint,schuchardt outlined a coherent and plausible case supporting his allegations.first,his alleged facts specify,at least to some degree,the means through which the nsa captures all or substantially all of the sent by american citizens,app,namely,by compelling companies that provide email and other internet services to cooperate with the nsa in the collection of their customers data.although the technical details of how each company email service integrates within prism infrastructure are not specified,on a motion to dismiss,we presum e that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.lujan,at quoting lujan wildlife fed n.moreover,according to the nsa itself,prism entails data collection directly from the servers of these companies,and schuchardt describes events involving lavabit,a company that resisted the government demands to install a device on its server which would have provided the government with access to the full content of all messages for all of lavabit customers.see app.thus,the pleaded facts plausibly allege the technical means through which prism purportedly achieves a nationwide email dragnet 
second,schuchardt allegations are replete with details confirming prism operational scope and capabilities.the exhibits attached to his second amended complaint include a slide from a purported nsa presentation identifying company names and the dates they began cooperating with the agency.another slide confirms that consistent with a dragnet capturing all or substantially all of the sent by american citizens the scale of the data collected by prism is so vast that the government reported difficulty processing it according to the norms to which it has become accustomed.app.see also app.characterizing prism as the sigad used most in nsa reporting app.indicating the nsa new collection posture of collect ing it all.
finally,the pleaded facts support schuchardt allegation that the scope of prism data collection encompasses his personal email.the nsa presentation identifies specific companies participating in the prism program,and indicates that nsa analysts receive the content of emails collected as part of the program.schuchardt alleged that he uses email services provided by two of those companies google and yahoo so we need not speculate about whether schuchardt own communications were captured because he specified the scope of prism dragnet with enough factual matter to make additional inferential leaps unnecessary.see klayman,at opinion of brown,permitting the inference that the bulk telephone metadata program under section encompassed the plaintiff communications in light of facts alleging the government efforts to create a comprehensive metadata database.
the government raises three principal arguments challenging the plausibility of schuchardt prism allegations.first,it argues that clapper and its application by the circuit in klayman require us to find his allegations implausible.we disagree.
two aspects of clapper distinguish it from this case.first,because the clapper plaintiffs raised a facial constitutional challenge to section on the day the statute was enacted,they pleaded only prospective injury,potential future surveillance.see at.and because that potential relied on a speculative chain of possibilities,the supreme court concluded that they had failed to satisfy the imminence and traceability elements of under article iii.here,in contrast,schuchardt alleged injury has already occurred insofar as he claims the nsa seized his emails.it is therefore not surprising that the government has been unable to formulate an analogous speculative chain that would doom schuchardt constitutional standing.
another critical distinction between this case and clapper is that the district court entered summary judgment,a procedural posture that required the plaintiffs to identify a triable issue of material fact supported by an evidentiary record.see id.at.in contrast,schuchardt sought to avoid dismissal in a facial jurisdictional challenge raised under rule b,which requires him only to state a plausible claim,a significantly lighter burden.this distinction in the standard of review is also reflected in cases concerning national security surveillance from our sister courts.compare aclu,at plaintiffs had standing on motion to dismiss jewel,at same,with klayman,at opinion of williams,plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue preliminary injunction because there was no substantial likelihood that they could establish,observing that summary judgment imposes a lighter burden than the substantial likelihood of success necessary to obtain a preliminary injunction aclu nsa,cir.plaintiffs failed to establish on summary judgment because they had no evidence on various points of causation.here,schuchardt has gone beyond mere allegations to survive a motion to dismiss by creating a limited evidentiary record to support his allegations.
the government reliance on klayman is also misplaced.there,the circuit vacated the district court preliminary injunction,holding that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.see at.however,the panel split on the issue of the plaintiffs standing,and also disagreed on whether to remand the case for further proceedings or outright dismissal.see id.at opinion of brown,plaintiffs had satisfied the bare requirements of standing,remanding for jurisdictional discovery id.at opinion of williams,plaintiffs lacked standing to seek preliminary injunction,remanding for jurisdictional discovery id.at opinion of sentelle,plaintiffs lacked standing vel non,remanding with order to dismiss.under these circumstances,it seems clear to us that klayman persuasive force is minimized by its splintered reasoning,different procedural posture,and the fact that the circuit addressed itself to a surveillance program authorized by a separate provision of fisa.accordingly,neither clapper nor klayman supports the government in this case.
second,the government contends that schuchardt allegations say at most that the government may have the capability to seize and store most electronic communications,but t hey do not say that the government is searching or seizing most,let alone all.gov t br.we agree that schuchardt alleged facts even if proven do not conclusively establish that prism operates as a dragnet on the scale he has alleged.the language of the leaked materials schuchardt relies on is imprecise.the use of the term direct in the nsa presentation could mean,for example,that the government has complete discretion to search all electronic information held by a company participating in prism at will this would certainly be consistent with the interception capability that the nsa allegedly possesses,and could qualify as an unconstitutional seizure of all information stored on the company servers.on the other hand,direct could mean that the government merely has the legal authority to compel participating companies to turn over communications that may be of value because they are associated with the addresses that are used by suspected foreign terrorists.gov t br.in that scenario,it is implausible that schuchardt communications would be targeted by prism.
at this early stage of litigation,however,schuchardt is entitled to any inference in his favor that may be reasonably drawn from his pleaded facts.see,king drug of florence,smithkline beecham,cir.citing iqbal,at.and as we have explained,the inference that prism collects all or substantially all of the sent by american citizens,app,is one supported by his pleaded factual matter.accordingly,in this procedural posture,we can not accept the government preferred inference.
finally,the government disputes the notion that prism is a dragnet,that it is based on the indiscriminate collection of information in bulk.see gov t br.quoting pclob report at.according to the government,the program consists entirely of targeting specific persons that may be of value because they are,for example,associated with the addresses that are used by suspected foreign terrorists.id.under this view,to intercept communications using prism 
analysts first identify a person located outside the united states who is likely to communicate certain types of foreign intelligence information,such as an individual who belongs to a foreign terrorist organization or facilitates its activities.analysts also attempt to identify a means by which this foreign target communicates,such as an address,or a telephone number any such address,number,or other identifier is known as a selector.prism collection occurs when the government obtains from telecommunications providers communications sent to or from specified selectors.
gov t br.internal citations omitted.
several commentators and the few courts that have examined prism appear to agree with the government view of the program targeted nature.so too has the pclob,whose report on prism the government has asked us to consider.see pclob report at.these authorities are substantial,and if correct,would tend to undermine schuchardt ability to show that his own electronic communications were seized by the prism program.
the problem for the government at this stage is that the scope of materials that a court may consider in evaluating a facial jurisdictional challenge raised in a motion under rule b is not unconstrained.as with motions under rule b,the court is limited to the four corners of the complaint,document s integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint,and any undisputedly authentic document that a defendant attaches if the plaintiff claims are based on the document.in re asbestos prods.liability litig.no.vi,cir.quoting in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.schuchardt pleadings are in no way based on any countervailing authorities that support the government position,nor are those authorities integral to or explicitly relied upon by his complaint accordingly,we must ignore their persuasive value,whatever it may be,at this stage of the litigation.see gould,at.likewise,insofar as the
