opinion of the court 
tsg,tsg filed this petition to challenge the validity of the environmental protection agency epa applicability determination,which found that tsg was a fabric finishing operation under subpart oooo of the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap.tsg argues that its fabric treating process should not be required to abide by the finishing operation standards and should instead qualify as a coating operation under the regulations.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the epa did not clearly err when it classified tsg as a finishing operation.therefore,we will deny the petition for review and uphold the epa determination.
background 
petitioner tsg is a commission fabric coater with facilities in pennsylvania and north carolina.it receives fabrics from other entities,including jobbers,importers,and interior decorators,and treats these fabrics to enhance qualities such as water repellancy,stain resistance,and fire repellancy and to meet other such specifications or requirements.tsg claims its process and business model can be contrasted with that used by large,vertically integrated mills,which typically apply stain repellant coatings.such large mills are able to use this method because of their familiarity with their fabric,as the method can potentially harm some fabrics.because tsg deals with a variety of and unfamiliar fabrics,it uses a process.
in tsg process,chemicals are diluted in a solvent,trichloroethene tce,which is then sprayed onto the fabric as it passes through the spraying machinery.this method allows tsg to process many different fabric weights,widths,colors,and constructions,as the solvent is generally gentler on a wider variety of fabrics than is a system.as tsg characterizes it,the solvent acts as a carrier for the chemicals as they are sprayed onto the fabric and then evaporates when the fabric passes through the heating and drying machinery.a solvent recovery system then captures the evaporated solvent for reuse.
congress enacted the clean air act caa to protect and enhance the quality of the nation air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.b.under the caa,the administrator of the epa administrator shall promulgate regulations establishing emissions standards for each category of sources of hazardous air pollutants hap.id.d.
on may,the epa promulgated a neshap for the category of new and existing fabric and textile operations involved in coating,printing,slashing,dyeing,and finishing.may,codified at et.part,subpart oooo.subpart oooo further divided these operations into the subcategories of coating and printing,slashing,and dyeing and finishing,setting different emission standards for each of these subcategories.id,table.coating is defined as 
the application of a coating material to one or both sides of a textile web substrate.once the coating material is dried and cured,if necessary,it bonds with the textile to form a continuous solid film for decorative,protective,or functional purposes.coating does not include finishing where the fiber is impregnated with a chemical or resin to impart certain properties,but a solid film is not formed.
id.finishing is defined as 
the chemical treatment of a textile,with resins,softeners,stain resist or soil release agents,water repellants,flame retardants,antistatic agents,or hand builders that improves the appearance usefulness of the textile substrate.
tsg did not comment on the proposed rulemaking during the notice and comment period.instead,tsg requested,by a letter dated june,that the epa develop an alternative mact maximum achievable control technology standard for its textile operations.tsg asserted that the stringency of the finishing operation requirements,if applied to tsg,would likely require it to cease operation.tsg acknowledged that o n its face,tsg application of chemicals constitutes a finishing operation but stated that because tsg uses a chemical solvent rather than a solution,it should not be subject to finishing operation emission standards.the epa requested more information to make its determination,but tsg did not respond until june.in order to obtain the necessary information,the epa contacted the pennsylvania department of environmental protection pdep,which faxed additional information regarding tsg processes from its records of tsg state permit application.
on november,based on the information it had gathered,the epa issued an applicability determination.the epa concluded that tsg operations were finishing operations for purposes of subpart oooo.the epa determined that the tsg process impregnates textile fibers with a stain repellant without resulting in the formation of a solid film,so it is a finishing,rather than a coating operation.the epa also determined that the chemical solvent used by tsg was not merely a carrier of materials,but itself a finishing material.the epa stated that its decision was based on the current mact standard and noted that tsg was permitted to petition the epa to develop a different standard.tsg received the decision on november.this petition for review followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to review a final action of the epa under b a petition for review of any final action of the administrator under this chapter which is locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in the united states court of appeals for the appropriate circuit.to be a final action,the epa applicability determination must comply with the requirements of bennett spear,d.first,the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.and second,the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.as the parties concede,and as the facts detailed above indicate,the bennett requirements have been met here.the epa action was the consummation of the decisionmaking process.it determined that tsg was a finishing operation and was therefore obligated to abide by a particular hap control standard.thus,the epa applicability determination is a final agency action and we have jurisdiction to consider tsg petition.see star enter.envtl.prot.agency,cir.
we review an administrative agency interpretation of its own regulations for plain error,deferring to the agency construction of the regulation language,unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.beazer,envtl.prot.agency,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
while we apply the plainly erroneous standard of review where the meaning of the words in the regulation is in doubt or subject to different interpretations,we are not at liberty to allow the agency to imply language that does not exist in the regulation.we acknowledge the complex nature of environmental statutes and regulations and the specialized knowledge necessary to construe them,and therefore,subject to these limitations,defer to the epa interpretations of its own regulations.

iii.discussion 
the crux of tsg argument is that there are operational differences between its process for imbuing fabrics with qualities and those processes generally used by large,vertically integrated mills.tsg argues that despite these differences,it has been unfairly and arbitrarily lumped into the finishing operation category because,in promulgating the regulation,the epa primarily considered the processes used by the larger mills.more specifically,tsg asserts that because it uses a process for treating its fabric,whereas most large mills generally use an process,tsg should not be considered a finishing operation under the regulations.in addition,tsg asserts,it more closely fits the definition of a coating operation.tsg makes a number of arguments based on the language of the regulations and the intent of the epa,and it finally argues that,in any case,the epa did not have enough information to make the determination that it did.
tsg first argues it is not a finishing operation because tce,the solvent that
