appellants american arms international aai and gilbert indoor range,llc gir appeal the judgment of the district court upholding the decision of the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf to revoke aai firearms dealer license and to deny gir application for a new firearms license.over the past three decades,charles gilbert,the owner of both aai and gir,has been cited by the atf multiple times for numerous violations of the regulatory requirements of the gun control act of gca,codified as amended at et.the decision to revoke aai license and to deny gir license application was prompted by a atf inspection of gilbert operations in which thousands of and other violations were discovered.our de novo review of this appeal reveals no error in the district court grant of summary judgment to atf,and we therefore affirm.
the atf first inspected gilbert operations in february,and the inspection revealed that gilbert had failed to record both the transfer of firearms and the acquisition of six national firearms act nfa firearms in the store acquisition and disposition records a d records atf cited gilbert for these and other violations.
in june,atf sent gilbert a warning letter after another atf inspection revealed a number of new regulatory violations.the letter advised that failure to conduct future operations in accordance with the regulations will be considered willful and could result in administrative proceedings to revoke your license.admin.gilbert was cited again in july for,inter alia,failure to record the disposition of seven missing firearms,failure to properly maintain disposition records for repaired firearms,and improper maintenance of atf form 
in,an atf inspector found another discrepancy in an inventory of gilbert nfa firearms,as well as at least one other violation.the inspector recommended that atf issue an admonitory letter.in june,an inspection revealed nineteen instances where gilbert failed to record the date of sale in his a d records and numerous failures to ensure proper completion of atf form.
in december,when gilbert was applying to renew his dealer license,an atf inspector met with him to review the federal firearms regulations,including all,requirements.an atf inspector held a similar review of the regulations with gilbert in september,covering requirements for maintenance of a d records,proper completion of atf form,and reporting of missing firearms.
nonetheless,in an august inspection of gilbert operations,inspectors discovered thousands of regulatory violations.a review of gilbert inventory revealed that firearms were missing,meaning they were not locatable either in physical inventory or the a d records.the inspection further found a number of discrepancies in the a d records,including the following on occasions,gilbert failed to record disposition information in the a d records within seven days of disposition on occasions,gilbert failed to report a federal firearms license number in the acquisition section of the a d records on two occasions,gilbert failed to report the name and address of the person from whom a firearm was received and,on one occasion,gilbert failed to record the disposition date of a firearm in the a d record.the inspection further found that gilbert had been using an expired ammunition manufacturer license number rather than his actual dealer license number to stamp at least atf forms the inspection also turned up numerous additional violations related to improperly filling out atf form,including failing on thirty occasions to properly complete the needed information for a transfer of nfa weapons to failing in thirteen instances to obtained the required additional documentation to establish residence for purchasers prior to transferring a firearm and failing on six occasions to include national instant criminal background check nics information with atf form.gilbert was also cited for failing to timely report the theft or loss of firearms transferring a firearm to a virginia resident in violation of virginia and federal law,transferring a firearm to someone who indicated on atf form that she was not the firearm purchaser,and illegally operating as a gunsmith at an unlicensed premise.
as a result of the inspection,atf issued a notice of revocation of license to aai on january.the notice indicated that aai had willfully violated the provisions and regulations of the gca and it detailed the aforementioned history of noncompliance.on january,the atf issued a notice of denial for gir application for renewal of its federal firearms license.
at gilbert request,a hearing regarding these decisions was held before an atf hearing officer on march.at this hearing,gilbert,represented by counsel,introduced no evidence to contest the factual basis for the revocation and denial,and he refused to testify when called as a witness by the government.on may,the hearing officer issued his report,recommending revocation and denial.
on june,atf director of industry operations for the baltimore field division,arthur herbert,issued a final notice of to gilbert.the final notice stated that gilbert had willfully engaged in repeat violations of the gun control act.at gilbert request,atf stayed the effective date of the revocation pending review by the united states district court for the district of maryland pursuant to f 
gilbert petition for review asked the district court to decide that atf erred and was not authorized to revoke aai license or to deny gir license application order atf to withdraw the revocation and denial and award such other relief,including costs and attorney fees as appropriate.instead,the district court granted summary judgment to atf on february.
the administrative record was essentially the only evidence before the district court at summary judgment.the only additional evidence gilbert provided to the district court was his own affidavit in which he denied that any of the violations for which he was cited by the atf were willful.he characterized many of them instead as clerical in nature.then,while not specifically denying any of the violations except the allegation that he operated as a gunsmith at an unlicensed premises,he proceeded to explain the circumstances surrounding each violation how he remedied or attempted to remedy the violation,how he had arranged alternative procedures for accomplishing the purpose of the given violated regulation,or how he had been unaware of the unlawful nature of his actions at the time.he also noted that in a may inspection,the inspector had told him that aai was doing a good job.
in granting summary judgment to atf,the district court found there was substantial evidence to support respondent finding that petitioner willfully committed hundreds of violations after a history of previous violations.alteration in original.revocation,the court continued,was not only authorized but well justified where petitioners continued to commit hundreds of violations of the gca after repeated warnings about the unlawfulness of the licensee prior noncompliance.id.
after the district court denied gilbert motion to alter judgment,he timely appealed to this court.in his appeal,gilbert challenges the district court finding that his violations of the gca were willful and he questions the lawfulness of several of the regulations which he was found to have violated.
the attorney general may,after notice and opportunity for hearing,revoke any license issued pursuant to if the holder of such license has willfully violated any provision of the gca or any rule or regulation prescribed by the attorney general under the gca e see also a whenever the atf director of industry operations has reason to believe that a licensee has willfully violated any provision of the gca a notice of revocation of the license may be issued.a federal court reviewing such a revocation may grant summary judgment if no genuine issue of material fact exists about whether the licensee willfully violated an applicable statutory or regulatory provision.armalite,lambert,cir.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.blaustein reich,buckles,cir.
in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.at.however,a nonmovant can not defeat summary judgment with merely a scintilla of evidence.anderson liberty lobby,d.if the evidence is merely colorable or is not significantly probative summary judgment may be granted.id.at.internal citations omitted.
gilbert first argues that in granting summary judgment,the district court applied an erroneous interpretation of the word willfully to find that gilbert had willfully violated the gca.gilbert contends that the district court improperly relied on the interpretation of willfully used in rsm,herbert,cir.according to gilbert,rsm interpretation is in conflict with that found in this court earlier decision in prino simon,cir per curiam,and with the supreme court decision in safeco insurance of america burr,d.
gilbert is correct that,to the extent there is a conflict between rsm and prino,we are bound to follow prino interpretation.mcmellon united states,cir en banc.and,of course,the supreme court interpretation of the term would supersede both rsm and prino.however,we fail to find the irreconcilable conflict between these three opinions that gilbert suggests.
in prino,this court interpreted the term willfully as used in d c,which permits the denial of a firearms license application where the applicant has willfully violated any provision of the gca or its regulations.prino,at.we articulated the standard for willfulness as follows 
willful means action taken knowledgeably by one subject to the statutory provisions in disregard of the action legality.no showing of malicious intent is necessary.a conscious,intentional,deliberate,voluntary decision properly is described as willful,regardless of venal motive.
id.quoting intercounty constr.occupational safety health review comm,cir.
years later,in rsm,this court interpreted the term willfully as used in e.at.we decided that,although this statute imposed only civil liability,we should interpret its use of the term willfully in accordance with that found in its criminal counterpart id.at.taking this approach,we found that a defendant does not need to have knowledge of the law which he is accused of violating to have acted willfully for purposes of e.id.at emphasis omitted.rather,a more general knowledge that the conduct is unlawful is all that is required.id.quoting bryan united states,d.moreover,we recognized that the willfulness requirement could be satisfied by showing a disregard of or an indifference to known legal obligations.id.thus when determining the willfulness of conduct,we must determine whether the acts were committed in deliberate disregard of,or with plain indifference toward,either known legal obligations or the general unlawfulness of the actions.id.at.
gilbert now suggests that prino and rsm are in irreconcilable conflict because he believes that rsm interpretation could extend willfully to apply to more than the conscious,intentional,deliberate,and voluntary action to which prino was directed in his view,prino definition would protect a licensee conduct in situations where he was aware of the law generally but did not act intentionally or deliberately to violate the law,while rsm definition would not.whatever potential conflicts could manifest between these two standards,however,we are confident that they do not present in this case.
although prino and rsm articulate the willfulness standard for a little differently,both hold that malice or improper motive is not necessary to establish willfulness.compare prino,at no showing of malicious intent is necessary.a conscious,intentional,deliberate,voluntary decision properly is described as willful,regardless of venal motive.internal citation and quotation marks omitted with rsm,at noting that bryan specifically rejected a construction of willfully that would require a showing of bad purpose.both cases also recognize that deliberate disregard of,or plain indifference toward known legal obligations is enough to constitute willfulness.rsm,at.while rsm does this explicitly,in prino it is implicit looking at the context of the case,it is clear that the prino standard was meant to cover such conduct.
in prino,the licensee,who had been dealing in firearms since,was cited in a inspection for a number of recordkeeping violations,as well as three illegal sales of handguns to residents.at.he received a warning letter from atf regional director ordering immediate compliance and warning that if further violations were found in an inspection scheduled for sixty days later,his license would be revoked.id.at the,a number of violations were found again,some of them being of the same type as those found in the first inspection.id.on the basis of that,prino application for a license renewal was denied,and that decision was affirmed after an atf hearing.id.in his appeal to the district court,prino submitted affidavits that tended generally to explain as inadvertent,or to show mitigating circumstances,or to refute particular ones of the last violations found,but the fact that some of the violations cited on all three inspections had indeed occurred was not disputed.id.at.thus,much like this case,the prino licensee main defense was that his violations were inadvertent and therefore not willful.the prino court rejected this argument,agreeing with the district court that the evidence showing prino continued after warnings from atf sufficed to establish willfulness.id.at.
similarly,in rsm,licensee valley gun had its license revoked after being cited for numerous violations of the gca and after being given an extended opportunity to place its operations in compliance.at internal quotation marks omitted.valley gun was first cited in for improper maintenance of its atf form,improper maintenance of its a d records,and having firearms missing from its inventory.id.at.atf issued a warning letter as a result of these violations that stated,repeat violations of those listed above will be viewed as willful,and may result in the revocation of your license.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.over the next six years,atf conducted three more inspections,finding increasing numbers of violations.id.despite the fact that each of these inspections was followed by a warning letter and that atf held at least two warning conferences with the licensee,many of the violations found were repeat violations.id.ultimately a notice of revocation was issued to valley gun.id.
in contesting revocation,valley gun did not dispute the violations themselves but claimed that it was not aware of some of the applicable regulations and that the recordkeeping violations were simply the result of human error and not willful.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.while we rejected this argument in valley gun case,we nonetheless acknowledged that there was a measure of normal human error in terms of gca compliance that would fall below willfulness 
to be sure,a single,or even a few,inadvertent errors in failing to complete forms may not amount to willful failures,even when the legal requirement to complete the forms was known.yet at some point,when such errors continue or even increase in the face of repeated warnings given by enforcement officials,accompanied by explanations of the severity of the failures,one may infer as a matter of law that the licensee simply does not care about the legal requirements.at that point,the failures show the licensee plain indifference and therefore become willful.
the facts and outcomes of prino and rsm are almost identical.both cases stand for the proposition that,where a licensee receives official warning that his actions violate the gca and his record of compliance does not change or,in these cases,gets worse,it is permissible to infer willfulness.rsm,in fact,serves to explain prino result at some point,when a licensee shows a continued failure to avoid errors about which it has already been warned that conduct amounts to a willful violation,whether we describe it as deliberate disregard or,as prino terms it,a conscious,intentional,deliberate,voluntary decision,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.it ther
