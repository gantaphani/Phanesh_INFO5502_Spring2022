the city of pittsfield,massachusetts asks us to consider whether the environmental appeals board eab improperly declined pittsfield petition seeking the board review of the environmental protection agency epa grant of a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit for the pittsfield wastewater treatment plant.pittsfield sought changes to the terms of the permit,which was issued pursuant to section of the clean water act cwa the eab held that pittsfield had procedurally defaulted because its petition failed to identify its specific objections to the permit or to articulate why the board should assume jurisdiction.we conclude that the board did not abuse its discretion in so holding,and we therefore affirm its denial of pittsfield petition.
statutory and regulatory background 
congress enacted the cwa to restore and maintain the chemical,physical and biological integrity of the nation waters.a see also rhode island epa,cir discussing legislative purpose.the cwa makes it unlawful for any person to discharge pollutants into united states waters without an npdes permit.a,a.npdes permits typically place limits on the discharge of pollutants and establish monitoring and reporting requirements.see arkansas oklahoma,citing pertinent statutory and regulatory provisions.
the epa issues npdes permits,except in those cases in which the agency has specifically authorized a state to administer its own npdes program subject to epa review.massachusetts has not obtained such authorization,so our focus is on the epa permitting procedures.
when the epa receives a permit application,its regional administrator prepares a draft permit,which is then made available for public comment.the administrator may also grant a public hearing during the public comment period.id.a.at the end of this process,the regional administrator issues a final permit decision,along with a written response to all significant comments raised during the public comment period.id,a.any party that participated during the comment period then has thirty days to petition the eab for review of the epa decision.id.a.where,as here,the eab denies review,the permit becomes administratively final.id.c.
ii.factual and procedural background 
the pittsfield water treatment plant discharges treated wastewater into the housatonic river.until,pittsfield operated the plant under an npdes permit that the epa had issued in.in june,six months before its existing permit was set to expire,pittsfield timely filed an application for renewal of its permit.in december,the epa sent pittsfield a copy of its draft permit,accompanied by a fact sheet explaining the permit limits and conditions 
the city submitted several comments during the comment period.among them,it expressed concerns about the new permit stricter phosphorous,aluminum,coli and copper limits and noted that the permit appeared to place responsibility on pittsfield to ensure that other towns contributing flow to the plant properly reported and managed their collection systems.the city also questioned new testing and reporting requirements.
on august,the epa issued a final permit to pittsfield and its,along with a document addressing the comments the agency had received.the epa explained that section b c of the cwa and federal regulations require it to limit any pollutant that it has determined is or may be discharged at a level which will cause,have the reasonable potential to cause,or contribute to any excursion above any state water quality standard,including state narrative criteria for water quality.d v.based on the housatonic river designation as a class b water,a classification signifying suitability for habitation by fish and other wildlife and for swimming and boating,the epa concluded that the new strict limits on the discharge of pollutants were correct,and it provided pittsfield with a detailed explanation of its data sources and calculations 
the agency did make some changes to the draft permit based on the city comments,however.noting pittsfield history of compliance with discharge limits,the epa granted the city request for a reduction in routine testing requirements.it also added new language clarifying that pittsfield would not be responsible for the implementation of any of the permit terms and conditions to the extent that they applied to.
on september,the city sought review of the final permit by the eab,pursuant to a.the city petition consisted of a letter and a copy of the comments it had submitted during the public comment period on the draft permit.in its letter,pittsfield asserted that the epa had issued the draft permit as final without any significant modification to address the city previously stated concerns,and that the new permit limits and requirements were unachievable by the city.
the eab denied pittsfield petition for review.the eab interpreted the regulation governing board review,a,to require that a petition for review demonstrate either that the epa decision involved a clearly erroneous finding of fact or conclusion of law,or that the petitioner appeal raised an important policy consideration that the board,in its discretion,should review.the board concluded that pittsfield had not met this burden and therefore had procedurally defaulted on its claim.the board noted that the city had not specified which permit conditions it was challenging before the board nor had it explained why these limits were unachievable,let alone clearly erroneous.pittsfield had also failed to identify any important policy consideration,the board observed,that would spur the board to assume jurisdiction and review a record.
the epa permit decision became final when pittsfield received notice that the board had denied review.f i.the city then filed this appeal.
iii.discussion 
the cwa gives us jurisdiction to review the epa final federal permit decision,see b f,and the administrative procedure act apa,governs our standard of review.under the apa,we may only overturn the board procedural default ruling,as an agency action,if it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see also adams epa,cir applying standard of review to review of the epa issuance of a npdes permit.where,as here,the petitioner challenge to the agency action questions the agency construction of its own regulations,our review is particularly deferential.davis latschar,see also pan am.grain epa,cir observing that our degree of deference in reviewing a final epa action is magnified when the agency interprets its own regulations.indeed,we must give controlling weight to the agency interpretation unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.bowles seminole rock sand.
a.the eab interpretation of a 
pittsfield principal argument is that the board interpretation of a was plainly erroneous and thus its denial of pittsfield petition should be set aside as an abuse of discretion.in relevant part,the regulation states 
the petition shall include a statement of the reasons supporting that review,including a demonstration that any issues being raised were raised during the public comment period including any public hearing to the extent required by these regulations and when appropriate,a showing that the condition in question is based on 
a finding of fact or conclusion of law which is clearly erroneous,or 
an exercise of discretion or an important policy consideration which the environmental appeals board should,in its discretion,review.
emphasis added.
as in this case,the eab has consistently interpreted the regulation as requiring that the petitioner set forth an argument in its petition as to why the permit condition it is challenging is either based on a clearly erroneous finding of fact or conclusion of law or raises an important policy consideration.see,in re chukchansi gold resort and casino waste water treatment plant,npdes appeal to,slip op.at eab,in re city of irving,mun.separate storm water sewer,eab.additionally,the board has repeatedly stated that the petitioner must explain why the challenged conditions merit review.see,in re avon custom mixing,eab we have held in the past that to warrant r
