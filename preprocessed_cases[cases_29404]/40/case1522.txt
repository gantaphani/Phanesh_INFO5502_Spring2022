in this interlocutory appeal,judicial watch,incorporated,challenges the district court dismissal of its claims for injunctive relief and money damages against the internal revenue service irs and certain irs employees.judicial watch contends that the irs initiated a retaliatory tax audit,intended to punish the organization for its political speech.because the act bars the requested injunctive relief and the law provides no damages remedy for the wrongs alleged here,we affirm.
founded in,judicial watch describes itself as a legal watchdog organization that relies on the freedom of information act foia,the civil discovery process,and court litigation,among other tools,to protect the american people from,and educate them about,corruption in government and abuses of power,and to enforce the principle that no one is above the law.
since,judicial watch has operated as a,c organization.see c west.the internal revenue code bars such organizations from lobbying.see id.requiring that qualifying organizations refrain from carrying on propaganda,or otherwise attempting,to influence legislation or interven ing in including the publishing or distributing of statements,any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office see also west addressing status of organization that fails to qualify for c exemption because of substantial lobbying or political activities regan taxation with representation for washington,d affirming c ban on lobbying.
during the late,judicial watch filed a number of lawsuits against president and clinton.on september,in the midst of the impeachment proceedings against president clinton,judicial watch submitted a report entitled interim report crimes and other offenses committed by president bill clinton warranting his impeachment and removal from elected office interim report to members of the house judiciary committee.the interim report claimed,inter alia,that the clinton administration had operated a campaign of retribution and retaliation against its perceived enemies,using politically inspired retaliatory tax audits as a major weapon in that campaign.the interim report was subsequently accepted into the congressional record and made an official part of the impeachment proceedings in congress.
several days later,judicial watch received a letter from the irs,signed by agent donna dorsey,stating that it had been selected for an audit.the letter was accompanied by an irs form information document request,which requested information pertaining to the political affiliations of judicial watch directors.after receiving the audit letter,judicial watch resisted irs efforts to proceed with the audit by filing foia requests,meeting with irs officials,refusing irs document requests,and asserting throughout that the audit constituted politically motivated retaliation.
in july,the irs informed judicial watch that the service was withdrawing the audit pending an investigation by the treasury inspector general for tax administration,the independent internal monitor of irs activities.the irs contends,and judicial watch does not dispute,that the inspector general then conducted two investigations into the asserted illegitimacy of the audit and found no evidence of impropriety by the irs or any of the irs employees involved in the decision to audit judicial watch.
nevertheless,in september,judicial watch filed this action in the united states district court for the district of maryland against former irs commissioner rossotti,four individual irs agents donna dorsey,peter breslan,wayne hampel,and steven miller,and the united states.in january,judicial watch filed an amended complaint,withdrawing its claims against the united states,but adding the department of the treasury and the internal revenue service as defendants.
the amended complaint alleges that the audit is retaliatory,and unconstitutional,violating judicial watch first amendment free speech rights,fifth amendment due process rights,and fifth amendment right to be free of selective prosecution.the amended complaint seeks an injunction against all defendants from proceeding with the audit and compensatory and punitive damages against rossotti and the individual agents.it also includes claims for relief in connection with judicial watch foia requests.
in support of its constitutional claims,judicial watch alleges that the timing of the audit letter four days after the interim report was made an official part of congress impeachment proceedings,the timing of several subsequent irs document requests pursuant to the audit,and the fact that it received final notice of its exempt status at roughly the same time that it received the audit letter,create a strong inference of retaliatory motive.similarly,judicial watch cites the extraordinary demand contained in the irs form information document request that judicial watch provide information on the political affiliations of its directors and the alleged refusal of the irs to respond to judicial watch various foia requests as evidence of bad faith and improper motive.
finally,judicial watch refers to comments by various irs agents that,in its view,suggest a retaliatory motive.these comments include the statement by agent dorsey on november,to counsel for judicial watch that the audit was a hot potato the query by agent breslan to representatives from judicial watch at a meeting on january,what do you expect when you sue the president the asserted concession by agent miller that the audit and irs failure to respond to judicial watch foia requests had created at least the appearance of a problem and statements made during march and april by agent hampel that judicial watch was still on the irs radar screen.
on january,more than three years after sending the initial audit letter,the irs served judicial watch with an administrative summons pursuant to the audit demanding production of documents within eight business days.judicial watch refused to comply with the summons,but instead filed another action in the district court seeking to stay or enjoin any attempt to enforce the summons.the court subsequently consolidated the new action with the original action.
after full briefing,the district court denied judicial watch motion to stay or enjoin the administrative summons and granted the defendants motion to dismiss all claims.because the court did not resolve the foia claims,judicial watch moved for certification of the case for immediate appeal.the district court entered the requested certification order and we,in turn,granted judicial watch petition for interlocutory review.see a west 
the district court denied judicial watch request for injunctive relief on the ground that the act sometimes herein,the act,west,deprived it of jurisdiction to grant such relief.we review that decision de novo.estate of michael lullo,cir.
the act provides in relevant part that 
no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person,whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.
as the supreme court has emphasized,the language of the act could scarcely be more explicit,reflecting its overarching objective of protecting the government need to assess and collect taxes as expeditiously as possible with a minimum of judicial interference.bob jones university simon,d see also sigmon coal apfel,cir the act has two primary objectives efficient and expeditious collection of taxes with a minimum of preenforcement judicial interference,and protection of the collector from litigation pending a refund suit.quoting united states american friends serv,d per curiam,aff sub nom.barhart sigmon coal,d.the effect of the act is simple and obvious courts lack jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief in suits seeking to restrain the assessment or collection of taxes.see,estate of michael,at the act withdraws all courts jurisdiction over suits filed for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.
judicial watch maintains that the act does not apply to its motion to enjoin the audit and stay or enjoin enforcement of the administrative summons issued pursuant to the audit because an audit conducted for unlawful purposes does not constitute assessment or collection of a tax.alternatively,it argues that even if the act does apply to its request for injunctive relief,the present action falls within the judicially crafted exceptions to the act.both arguments fail.
first,it is clear that the act extends beyond the mere assessment and collection of taxes to embrace other activities,such as an audit to determine tax liability,that may culminate in the assessment or collection of taxes.
in bob jones,for example,the supreme court refused to enjoin the irs from revoking the plaintiff c status.at.other courts,including this one,have also held that the act applies broadly to include activities that are intended to or may culminate in the assessment or collection of taxes.see,lowrie united states,cir the statute applies not only to the actual assessment or collection of a tax,but is equally applicable to activities leading up to,and culminating in,such assessment and collection.dickens united states,cir stating that the act is equally applicable to activities which are intended to or may culminate in the assessment or collection of taxes internal quotations marks and citations omitted white boyle,cir affirming dismissal of request for injunctive relief regardless of whether the sought to restrain the collection of taxes or to restrain an investigation of his tax liability citations omitted.clearly,an audit to determine tax liability fits squarely within the category of activities that may culminate in the assessment or collection of taxes.
judicial watch attempts to distinguish these cases on the ground that in them the irs acted on the basis of good faith tax enforcement purposes,while the audit at issue here was,according to judicial watch,a product of bad faith related motives.judicial watch further maintains that because these bad faith motives assertedly drove the decision to initiate the audit,enjoining the audit and any judicial enforcement of the administrative summons would not constitute an interference with the assessment or collection of taxes.
the initial difficulty with this argument is that,although the amended complaint contains general allegations of retaliatory conduct by irs agents based on the factual chronology outlined above,the complaint does not allege that the individual irs agents even knew that judicial watch had filed various lawsuits,much less its interim report,explicitly targeting the clinton administration.nor does judicial watch dispute that the inspector general conducted two investigations and twice exonerated the individual irs employees involved in the audit decision.
moreover,the sworn declaration of agent dorsey,which the district court made part of the record after issuance of its decision in this case at the request of judicial watch and which judicial watch urges us to consider,severely undermines judicial watch general allegations of retaliation.in her declaration,dorsey,who signed the initial audit letter,states that the decision to audit judicial watch was made in december more than nine months before the impeachment proceedings that when first assigned the judicial watch audit in july she had never heard of the organization that,except for an initial instruction to coordinate her work on the audit with irs district counsel in baltimore,she never received any instructions,directions,indications,or suggestions from anyone to treat judicial watch,differently than any other taxpayers during the course of her work on the case that she never had any contact with rossotti or his office or with the president or the vice president,or their offices and that she did not follow and was not aware of any role that judicial watch played in the impeachment of president clinton judicial watch does not dispute any of these assertions.we also can take judicial notice that in its recent decision granting the irs summons enforcement request,the district court in the district of columbia concluded,on the basis of a voluminous record,that there was no evidence of political vindictiveness or a retaliatory motive.united states judicial watch,misc.action esh,slip op.at.thus,judicial watch argument that the irs acted with bad faith motives unrelated to enforcement of the tax law finds little support in the record.
more importantly,judicial watch misunderstands the impact of allegations that the irs acted with bad faith,related motives.such allegations do not render the act inapplicable.in bob jones itself,the taxpayer contended,when seeking to enjoin the irs,that the service threatened action was outside its lawful authority and would violate petitioner rights to the free exercise of religion,to free association,and to due process and equal protection of the laws.bob jones,at.the supreme court recognized this attribution of motives to the service,but concluded that the attribution ignore d the fact that the taxpayer ha d not shown that the service action was without an independent basis in the requirements of the code.id.at.emphasis added.the court explained that if the irs action represents a effort to enforce the technical requirements of the tax laws,other additional motives for its actions do not eliminate the prohibition in the act.id.thus,despite the petitioner efforts to circumvent the restrictions of the act by attributing a purpose to the irs actions,the bob jones court concluded that the act did apply and proceeded to determine if the request for injunctive relief qualified for an exception to the act.id.at.
accordingly,unless judicial watch qualifies for one of two exceptions to the act,the district court properly concluded that the act stripped it of jurisdiction necessary to issue the requested injunctive relief.
the supreme court established the first exception to the act in enochs williams packing navigation,d,the capstone to judicial construction of the act.bob jones,at.in williams packing,the taxpayer requested an injunction to prevent the irs from collecting past due social security and unemployment taxes.although the supreme court reversed a lower court grant of injunctive relief,the court held that such actions could proceed,despite the act,if,but only if,the plaintiff could show that under no circumstances could the government ultimately prevail,and equity jurisdiction otherwise exists.williams packing,at.moreover,the court directed that in analyzing the initial factor,a court must determine,on the basis of the information available to the government at the time of the suit,whether,under the most liberal view of the law and the facts,the united states can not establish its claim.see also estate of michael,at.
judicial watch simply can not establish that under no circumstances could the government ultimately prevail.williams packing,at.section c provides an explicit basis for the irs to investigate judicial watch status and determine if its political activities merit a change in its status.as the district court concluded,taking the most liberal view of the law and the facts,it is quite possible even plausible that the irs initiated and has continued to pursue the audit because it was legitimately suspicious that judicial watch earnest efforts to assist in the impeachment of president clinton constituted the sort of prohibited political activity not permitted any organization afforded c status.as in bob jones,therefore,regardless of any additional,improper related purpose,judicial watch has not and can not demonstrate that the irs action does not reflect,at least in part,a good faith effort to enforce the technical requirements of the tax laws.bob jones,at.thus,without deciding the merits of judicial watch claims,we must conclude that its contentions are sufficiently debatable to foreclose any notion that under no circumstances could the government ultimately prevail.id.at.
nor can judicial watch find refuge in the other exception to the act,that created in south carolina regan,d.there,south carolina sought an injunction against a tax on the ground that a provision of the code regarding bonds violated the constitution.the supreme court held that if the act applied,south carolina would have had to depend on third parties to raise the state constitutional challenge in their tax refund suits.id.at.the court reasoned that the act could not stand as a barrier to injunctive relief in situations where congress has not provided the plaintiff with an alternative legal way to challenge the validity of the tax.id.at.
of course,the basis of the regan exception is not whether a plaintiff has access to a legal remedy for the precise harm that it has allegedly suffered,but whether the plaintiff has any access at all to judicial review.as the regan court explained,the indicia of congressional act purposes and the circumstances of its that congress did not intend the act to apply where an aggrieved party would be required to depend on the mere possibility of persuading a third party to assert his claims.id.at.the act does apply,however,whenever congress has provided an alternative avenue for an aggrieved party to litigate its claims on its own behalf.id.
this case differs markedly from regan.judicial watch does not challenge the validity of any provision of the code,but only seeks to avoid an audit to determine its tax liability.judicial watch need not depend on third parties to pursue this claim,a fact reflected in its efforts to resist the audit in the summons enforcement proceedings in the district of columbia.see supra.moreover,the code also provides that organizations whose exempt status under c has been denied or revoked can seek declaratory relief.see west.although judicial watch may not like the avenues congress has provided for challenging an audit,it simply can not maintain that it has no avenue for doing so.
in sum,the claims for injunctive relief asserted by judicial watch do not fall within the narrow exceptions carved out in williams packing or regan.strong policy reasons support this result.extending the recognized exceptions to the act to include requests for injunctive relief like that of judicial watch would threaten a flood of lawsuits brought against the irs by those seeking to enjoin an audit they believed to be wrongful,creating precisely the kind of judicial interference with the assessment and collection of taxes that the act was designed to prevent.
judicial watch also contends that the district court erred in dismissing its bivens action for money damages against the individual defendants.see bivens six unknown named agents of the fed.bureau of narcotics,d 
in bivens,the supreme court found that the fourth amendment contained an implied private cause of action for damages against federal narcotics agents who allegedly conducted an illegal search and seizure.see bivens,at.the court concluded that it could recognize this new constitutional tort because,although congress had never provided for such a private right of action,no explicit congressional declaration prohibited it,and no special factors counsel ed hesitation by the court in the absence of affirmative action by congress.id.at.
in the more than thirty years since bivens,the court has been very hesitant to imply other private actions for money damages.indeed,the court has only recognized two other such under the due process clause of the fifth amendment,davis passman,d finding bivens remedy for alleged violation of due process rights because of gender discrimination by united states congressman in terminating petitioner employment,and one under the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the eighth amendment,carlson green,d finding bivens remedy for federal prisoner who was allegedly deprived of potentially treatment in violation of his eighth amendment rights.instead,the court has directed its attention to cabining the bivens doctrine.see correctional services malesko,d since carlson we have consistently refused to extend bivens liability to any new context or new category of defendants.
the court refusal to extend bivens has been especially apparent in cases involving complex statutory schemes in which congress has considered and created meaningful avenues for redress.thus,in bush lucas,d,the court refused to find an implied bivens remedy for federal employees alleging that their supervisors violated their first amendment rights.because these claims arose out of a relationship governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions giving meaningful remedies against the united states,the court concluded that it would be inappropriate to supplement that regulatory scheme with a new judicial remedy.id.at.
similarly,in schweiker chilicky,d,the court declined to find a new bivens remedy for claimants whose social security disability benefits had been improperly terminated.given the elaborate remedial scheme devised by congress to deal with the improper denial or termination of disability benefits,the court saw no reason to tread on congressional prerogatives by creating a new judicial remedy for the particular harm suffered by the claimants.id.at.in reviewing the development of bivens jurisprudence,the court concluded 
the concept of special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by congress has proved to include an appropriate judicial deference to indications that congressional inaction has not been inadvertent.when the design of a government program suggests that congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration,we have not created additional bivens remedies.
id.at.thus,in chilicky,even though congress ha d failed to provide for complete relief for the disability claimants,the court refused to create a bivens remedy because congress had provided some meaningful safeguards or remedies.id.at.emphasis added.
following these precedents,we too have refused to extend bivens.see,hall clinton,cir declining to create a fifth amendment bivens remedy for white house employee because congress had already established an exclusive statutory remedy zimbelman savage,cir finding that special factor of federal employment counseled against creating a bivens remedy for air force personnel alleging unfair termination of employment based on false accusations.in adjudicating claims requesting the creation of new bivens remedies,we have gleaned from the above supreme court precedent a test 
i n order for a bivens remedy to be available,a court must determine that congress has not already provided an exclusive statutory remedy there are no special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by congress and there is no explicit congressional declaration that money damages not be awarded.
hall,at citations omitted.moreover,we have noted that t he special factors concept include s an appropriate judicial deference to indications that congressional inaction has not been inadvertent.id.citations omitted.accordingly,we apply these factors to this case to determine whether congress has sufficiently attended to the rights and remedies available to taxpayers in the context of the internal revenue code to foreclose judicial creation of additional remedies.
it would be difficult to conceive of a more comprehensive statutory scheme,or one that has received more intense scrutiny from congress,than the internal revenue code.in constructing this vast and exceedingly complex statutory apparatus,moreover,congress has given taxpayers all sorts of rights against an overzealous.cameron internal revenue service,cir see also mcmillen united states,cir.thus,the code provides judicial watch with a number of ways to challenge actions of the irs as well as those of individual agents.
as noted above,in response to an audit or other activities involved in the investigation of its tax liability,judicial watch could simply resist the audit,force the irs to initiate a summons enforcement proceeding,and then challenge the validity of the audit in that forum.see a west.indeed,judicial watch has done precisely this in the district of columbia.in the event that an audit led to revocation of judicial watch c status,the organization could seek declaratory relief.see.furthermore,to the extent that the audit culminated
