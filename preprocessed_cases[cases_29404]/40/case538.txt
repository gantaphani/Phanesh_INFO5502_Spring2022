this appeal requires us to decide whether woburn,massachusetts,police officer paul meaney was lawfully disciplined for repeatedly blasting a borrowed truck air horn after or near the conclusion of a union picket and during a municipal inauguration ceremony.acting on for summary judgment,the district court ruled that meaney conduct was within his free speech rights,and that robert dever woburn mayor and philip mahoney woburn chief of police violated clearly established first amendment law in suspending him.dever and mahoney challenge both rulings,arguing that the court should have entered summary judgment for them or set the matter for trial.we believe that dever and mahoney were entitled to summary judgment and accordingly reverse.
background 
on january,meaney participated in an informational picket organized and sponsored by the woburn police patrolmen union local and the woburn firefighter union.he was off duty at the time.the unions held the picket outside the woburn city hall and timed it to coincide with the arrival of persons who would be attending the inauguration of mayor dever.the unions hoped to bring attention to the fact that their members had been working without a collective bargaining agreement for the previous four years.dever was angered by the picket,telling a demonstrating firefighter upon his arrival at city hall well,if this is the way you want it to be,that the way it going to be.
the picketers,who numbered between and,demonstrated from around until around,which is when the inauguration ceremony was scheduled to begin.during the demonstration,a number of persons in passing trucks and vehicles honked their horns in support of the unions.several police officers and firefighters drove their vehicles around the adjacent common and blew their horns as well.the hornblowing was steady throughout the picket.
as the picket wound down,the demonstrators gathered on the steps of city hall for a group photograph.afterwards,the group marched around the common and most of the picketers departed.meaney,however,headed to a nearby fuel oil business owned by his and borrowed an oil truck.within minutes,meaney returned to city hall.he made three passes around city hall,pausing beneath the windows of the room in which the inauguration had begun.all the while,he sounded the truck loud air horn.a handful of picketers were still in the vicinity of city hall as meaney made his rounds,and more than one cheered him on.meaney hornblowing was described as sufficiently loud to be heard by the ceremony attendees,but not loud enough to disrupt it.chief mahoney and five other officers personally observed meaney driving the fuel truck and blowing its air horn.
on january,a perturbed mayor dever asked chief mahoney for a report on the previous evening noisemaking.mahoney responded with a written memorandum detailing the events just described.the memorandum was signed by himself and the five other officers who had observed meaney conduct.that same day,dever removed meaney business from the list of businesses with which the city contracted to perform services.when meaney learned that dever had removed his business from the list,he telephoned mahoney to protest.during the conversation,mahoney told meaney that his conduct the night before was outrageous and ridiculous,and opined that meaney had intended to interrupt the inauguration ceremony.meaney agreed with this characterization of his intent,explaining that he wanted to piss off dever because dever held a grudge against him and his family and had once unreasonably denied him a leave of absence from the police force.mahoney replied that meaney conduct had occurred after almost everybody had left and that it was unprofessional.meaney responded that his hornblowing was protected because he had act ed as a union member.
in the two weeks that followed,at least two local newspaper articles about the hornblowing incident were published.the first described what had happened and noted that mayor dever had ordered that the matter be investigated the second detailed dever removal of meaney business from the list.each article contained quotes from dever in which he acknowledged that the picket was perfectly lawful but considered the blowing of the air horn to be illegal because it was an attempt to disrupt a public meeting.in one of the articles,meaney was quoted as saying,my intent was to get under the mayor skin and voice our opinions.if he did like it,that tough.
by letter dated january,chief mahoney suspended meaney without pay for two days for his actions on january,and for insubordination during the january,telephone conversation.the letter explained that,in mahoney view,meaney had failed in his professional responsibilities by contributing to a disturbance of the public peace for personal reasons.
meaney appealed his suspension to mayor dever,who appointed the city solicitor to conduct a public hearing on the matter.see.laws ch.the hearing,at which chief mahoney and meaney testified,was held on january.at the hearing,mahoney explained that the crux of the suspension was the statements made by meaney during the january,telephone conversation he gave me that he did it on purpose.he wanted to interrupt the inauguration and piss off the mayor,which i thought was not conduct becoming of a police officer on duty or off duty.mahoney also reiterated that meaney had explained his hornblowing as occasioned by animosity between dever and meaney family and dever denial of his request for a leave of absence.for his part,meaney testified that,in response to chief mahoney suggestion during the january,telephone call that meaney intent was to piss off mayor dever,he had replied,you are goddamn right.in my opinion that was the underlying intention of both unions and if that what happened to the mayor well,that too bad.
after the hearing,the city solicitor issued written findings and an opinion stating that,in his view,there was just cause warranting meaney suspension.in support of this determination,the city solicitor found,in substance,that meaney had not specified the message he sought to convey by blowing the air horn,and that the blowing of the air horn was prompted by both a desire to piss off mayor dever because of personal animosity between the two and to support the unions in their perceived desire to do the same.
acting on the basis of the city solicitor recommendation,mayor dever upheld meaney suspension.but the massachusetts civil service commission,by written decision issued november,overturned the suspension.the commission held that mayor dever had failed to prove that there was just cause to suspend meaney.in so doing,the commission stated that meaney clearly had not disturbed the public peace because nobody called the police to complain about the hornblowing,no police officer attempted to stop it,and no arrest was made.the commission also opined that meaney hornblowing was part and parcel of his lawful,constitutionally protected right as a union member to picket in a peaceful manner.
on july,meaney and his wife brought a damages action against mayor dever,chief mahoney,and the city of woburn.the complaint invoked and alleged that the defendants had violated meaney free speech rights and otherwise committed a number of state law torts.following discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the city summary judgment on all claims against it and mayor dever and chief mahoney summary judgment on the meaneys state law claims.but the court granted meaney summary judgment on his free speech claim against mayor dever and chief mahoney and,after rejecting their qualified immunity arguments,entered a judgment against them.mayor dever and chief mahoney appeal this judgment.
ii.discussion 
mayor dever and chief mahoney take issue with multiple aspects of the district court first amendment ruling,but our agreement with their threshold argument permits us to limit our focus.because of the likelihood that government agencies would be unduly hampered in performing public services if permitted to regulate their employees speech only in the same manner and to the same extent as the government
