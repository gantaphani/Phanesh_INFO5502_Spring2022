the united states seeks review of a judgment awarding million to the family and the estate of louis litif the litif estate,resulting from litif murder by james whitey bulger in.litif united states,d.the litif estate,seeking an increase in the damage award.this case,like its companion case decided by us today davis hussey and others already decided stems from fbi agents sheltering of bulger and his associate stephen flemmi over several decades.
in the,louis litif worked as a bookmaker in the boston area and was involved with bulger winter hill gang.in september,litif was charged with murder in the death of james matera.while out on bail,litif secretly offered to cooperate with the boston police,in exchange for leniency,in the investigation of an ongoing drug conspiracy involving bulger and his gang.in march or april of,litif attorney,kevin curry,met with boston police detective edward walsh to discuss this offer.the meeting was also attended by fbi agent john connolly.
unbeknownst to litif and curry,bulger was a top echelon fbi informant,connolly was his primary handler,and connolly and others within the fbi were taking measures to protect bulger from prosecution so that he could continue supplying information.roughly three weeks after the meeting,litif was murdered in south boston.his body,repeatedly stabbed and shot,was discovered the day after the murder in the trunk of his car.at this early stage there was nothing directly connecting fbi agent actions to litif death.
a news article at the time of litif death reported that litif had lost the blessing of the south boston gang allegedly headed by james whitey bulger richard connolly,slaying victim alienated mob,prober says,boston globe.but the boston globe stated that,according to investigators,there was no evidence that he was killed for losing bulger support or that he had been murdered by friends of matera.id.the boston police department appears to have stopped investigating litif murder in the summer of.
throughout the,the boston press and eventually the national news media began to report on alleged ties between bulger,flemmi and the fbi.first in news stories and then in judicial proceedings,it emerged that certain fbi agents allowed bulger and flemmi to engage in serious criminal activity while bulger and flemmi informed on other criminals and paid at least some of the agents,including connolly.united states connolly,cir.eventually,it was learned that in some instances connolly had tipped off bulger and flemmi about cooperating witnesses against them.
in,the boston globe ran a story about litif death.shelley murphy,in,fbi saw bulger as both informant and murder suspect,boston globe,at.the article said that in brian halloran a criminal associate of bulger gave the fbi an eyewitness account of litif murder implicating bulger,shortly before halloran was himself murdered,allegedly by bulger.according to the article,halloran claimed that bulger murdered litif because litif had been freelancing as a drug dealer and because litif had killed matera without bulger permission.id.
however,the globe story identified its sources only as unnamed law enforcement officials and noted that the fbi was skeptical of halloran reliability because he was facing murder charges at the time of his cooperation,was abusing drugs,and was unwilling to take a lie detector test.murphy,in,at.halloran himself was killed in.the globe story also recounted that in a boston herald reporter had investigated stories about bulger involvement in the litif murder and had been threatened by bulger.the reporter acknowledged to the globe that the encounter occurred,but refused to comment on the details.id.
in the late,district judge mark wolf held the first extensive judicial proceedings the salemme proceedings documenting the relationship between bulger,flemmi and the fbi in april testimony,fbi agent john morris implicated the fbi and,in particular,both himself and connolly in covering up crimes by bulger and flemmi.morris also testified that connolly told bulger and flemmi of halloran offer to cooperate with the fbi against them,which morris suspected to be the cause of halloran murder.salemme,d at.
litif murder was not a significant subject of testimony during the salemme proceedings,although one quincy police detective stated in his testimony that bulger was suspected in litif murder,among others.this testimony was reported in the boston herald and quincy patriot ledger.ralph ranalli,cop whitey linked to ira,boston herald,june,robert sears,former quincy detective recalls bulger connection,quincy patriot ledger,june.the police,however,never charged bulger with litif murder.
on august,the boston herald,citing a local attorney who requested anonymity,ran a story detailing the substance of litif offer to cooperate with the boston police just weeks before his murder.ralph ranalli,questions arise over agent link to murdered drug dealer,boston herald.the anonymous attorney said that he told detective walsh,in the presence of connolly,that litif would implicate bulger in exchange for leniency.the next day,the herald reported connolly denial that the meeting ever took place.ralph ranalli,ex fbi agent says slain dealer was informer,boston herald.
on september,judge wolf published his decision in united states salemme,d.this lengthy decision provided the first detailed,publicly available legal document describing in great detail the relationship between the fbi,bulger and flemmi.litif murder was not discussed but brian halloran cooperation with the fbi and subsequent murder was canvassed in considerable detail.id.at.the decision recounted and placed in context morris testimony that connolly had leaked halloran name to bulger who had then likely killed him.id.
the decision also contained summaries of evidence linking bulger and flemmi to the murders of roger wheeler,john callahan,and john mcintyre.salemme,d at.further,the discussion of the mcintyre murder noted his offer of cooperation to law enforcement officials shortly before his disappearance.id.at.together with morris testimony as to halloran,the decision warranted at least a strong suspicion of systematic fbi leaks of informant names to bulger followed by their death at bulger hands.
litif widow thereafter spoke with her family and engaged an attorney,and the litif estate filed the administrative claim under the federal tort claims act ftca on september,b,b,et when no action was taken by the government,the instant lawsuit was filed on september.a.after consolidation,discovery and motions,the district court conducted a single bench trial on the litif,davis and hussey claims in july.
thereafter,the district court found in favor of the litif plaintiffs.it concluded that connolly leaked to bulger litif willingness to incriminate bulger.litif,d at.in reaching this conclusion,the court expressly relied on the trial testimony of litif former attorney,kevin curry,as to litif offer to cooperate evidence of the relationship between connolly and detective walsh connolly leaks to bulger of information regarding other informants and testimony see note,below from bulger associates kevin weeks and stephen flemmi.id.
having concluded that connolly generated this leak,the district court ruled that there was no question that connolly had a duty of care,breached it,and by breaching it,created a foreseeable risk of injury to litif.litif,d at.in particular,the district court ruled,connolly breached the general duty of care not to cause foreseeable harm to others through the criminal acts of a third person,a breach that caused litif death.id.
the district judge then awarded the litif plaintiffs damages totaling million to litif daughter for loss of consortium,to litif son for loss of consortium,to litif wife for loss of consortium,and to litif estate for litif conscious pain and suffering incident to his murder.the government filed the appeal now before us to challenge the judgment the plaintiffs have to challenge as inadequate the award for litif conscious pain and suffering.
the government contests liability on three grounds that the administrative claim was filed after the statute of limitations had run that there is insufficient admissible proof that the leak occurred and that bulger killed litif and that the litif estate failed to meet its burden for liability based on conscious pain and suffering.the limitations and the proof issues are connected but not identical so we address them separately in turn,reserving damage appeals on both sides for later discussion.
as for the standard of review,the pure issues of law are reviewed de novo findings of fact in a bench trial are reviewed for clear error.united states padilla galarza,cir.of course,an individual claim,defense,or precondition,the statute of limitations can turn on issues of law,fact,or or any combination of them and on some deference may be afforded to the district court judgment.id.within this framework,the standard as to particular issues is discussed below as needed.
statute of limitations.the relevant statutory language of the ftca provides that a tort claim against the united states shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after such claim accrues.b.the litif plaintiffs filed their administrative claim on september.the government contends that their claim accrued prior to september,so that their lawsuit is now.
the pertinent legal doctrine governing timeliness has now been repeated so often see davis hussey at that a brief summary will suffice.litif murder occurred in,but the discovery rule applied to ftca claims,united states kubrick,delays accrual where the fact or cause of an injury is unknown to and perhaps unknowable by a plaintiff for some time after the injury occurs.rakes united states,cir.this court has applied the discovery rule in a number of ftca claims at this point its applicability here is not in dispute.
under this rule,a claim accrues under the ftca once a plaintiff knows,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should know,of her injury and sufficient facts to permit a reasonable person to believe that there is a causal connection between the government and her injury.skwira united states,cir,cert.denied.the inquiry is an objective one it includes not only what was actually known but what a reasonable person,once fairly prompted to investigate,would have discovered by diligent investigation.rakes,at,
the district court ruled that whatever the plaintiffs may have suspected,they did not have actual or constructive knowledge of their claim prior to september.litif,d at.specifically,they did not know that litif was an informant,that he was murdered by bulger and flemmi,that this occurred because he was threatening to incriminate them,and that bulger and flemmi knew these facts because connolly so warned them.the court supported this conclusion by pointing to the lack,at that time,of identifiable witnesses or other admissible evidence to corroborate any of these facts.id.
the plaintiffs could not prove based on newspaper stories quoting anonymous sources that bulger knew of litif offer to cooperate.the fbi was formally and informally denying involvement litif was not mentioned in any detail in the salemme proceedings and most of the helpful witnesses,bulger,connolly would hardly agree to incriminate themselves.the court noted that even today no one has ever been indicted for litif murder.litif,d at.
the government counters by saying that proof was unnecessary prior to the date there were newspaper accounts suggesting,though falling far short of proving,that bulger killed litif and evidence generated in the salemme proceedings,reported before the decision,indicating that the fbi was protecting bulger.this,according to the government,was enough to require the filing of an administrative claim under an emboldening theory of liability and therefore triggered the accrual period as to all related theories to support a liability claim.
even if we assume the second proposition to be a mechanical rule,but see donahue united states,cir citing rakes,at we do not accept the first one.whether the liability theory is emboldening or leak,prior to the salemme decision,and arguably for some time after it,there was only press speculation itself seemingly unknown to the plaintiffs that bulger killed litif.thus the plaintiffs lacked sufficient facts to permit a reasonable person to believe that there is a causal connection between the government and the injury.skwira,at.
first,the plaintiffs denied being familiar with the early and relatively sparse newspaper coverage two major articles and a few other isolated press mentions connecting bulger with litif death.the modest scale of coverage on this issue contrasts with our cases charging plaintiffs with knowledge regarding facts that have achieve d a local notoriety great enough that the only practicable course is to attribute knowledge of them to people in a position to become familiar with them.rakes,at.see also donahue,at rakes,at callahan united states,cir.
second,even assuming the articles were known,nothing available prior to september,would have yielded enough for a reasonable belief that bulger killed litif.see rakes,at.halloran hearsay statement was discredited in the same article in which it appeared connolly himself refuted the next day the boston herald story that connolly had been advised of litif offer to cooperate.there is little else beyond those articles,nor any indication that a diligent inquiry would have yielded anything more prior to september.
much of the evidence at trial which the government says is still insufficient to establish liability emerged after september.the september,salemme decision assembled for the first time a story of the fbi protection of bulger and flemmi.it included a description of the evidence suggesting halloran murder by bulger and the prospect that this information had been leaked by connolly along with discussion of other murders and players in the saga.the halloran episode in turn offered helpful indirect evidence,later reinforced by additional examples,of a sequence similar to the one that caused litif death.
nor,prior to september,could the plaintiffs know of bulger and flemmi incriminatory conduct described below both before and after weeks wedding kevin weeks did not begin to cooperate with law enforcement until and his book containing substantially similar information was published in.kevin curry trial testimony was also essential both to the leak theory because it showed that connolly was aware of litif offer to inform,and to substantiate the basic fact necessary to any theory supporting recovery that bulger was the killer.
the government also argues that our conclusion is at odds with prior cases in which ftca plaintiffs have been barred under the discovery rule.however,in donahue,the case most heavily relied upon,there was solid and direct proof,more than two years before the halloran plaintiffs filed their claims,that morris had told connolly of halloran cooperation,that connolly had told bulger and flemmi,and that hallaron death had followed.donahue,at 
so,too,in rakes.there,the plaintiffs were charged with knowledge,more than two years before their claim was filed,of connolly corrupt relationship with bulger,rakes,at,and thus the arguments for an emboldening theory in addition,quite unlike the present case,they knew at the same time without any doubt that bulger was the direct agent of the harm caused to them by the extortion,because it was bulger who forced them to sign title of their store over to him.id.at.
similarly,in skwira,the debarred plaintiffs filed no timely claim within two years even after the following had emerged a highly publicized investigation of suspicious deaths in the ward of a veteran administration hospital in which skwira died,the exhumation of skwira body after a government request to the family citing suspicions about the deaths,and information passed to the family after an autopsy was performed confirming that the cause of death listed on the death certificate was inaccurate.skwira,at.
to sum up,the legal reasonable belief standard is not in dispute save on one issue that we have assumed arguendo in favor of the government.nor is the pattern of relevant facts as to wh
