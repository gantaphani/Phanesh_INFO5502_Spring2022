appellants jimmy martin martin and lucky strike,llc lucky strike appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in an action to enjoin enforcement of two south carolina statutes,ann.and,which prohibit certain device s pertaining to games of chance.appellants put forward two theories first,that is void for vagueness and thus violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.second,applying a holding of ex parte young,they argue that the statutes violate their right to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment because they are required to risk imprisonment,fines and forfeiture of property to obtain a determination as to the legality of a game under the statutes.because the statutes in question have a legitimate application,we affirm the district court vagueness holding.we further conclude that the statutes do not fall within the scope of ex parte young holding.as such,we affirm the district court ruling.
appellant martin is a citizen of south carolina in the business of developing and operating gaming machines.after the south carolina legislature passed legislation in that outlawed a type of video poker game he was operating,martin removed all of his machines from the state.see act.he currently operates games only on sites in oklahoma.martin claims that he would like to develop a game that he can operate in south carolina,but is unable to do so because he is unclear on the reach of the disputed statutes and unwilling to risk criminal prosecution if he unwittingly develops a game.
lucky strike is a limited liability corporation which operates gaming machines in convenience stores and other locations.lucky strike has stated that since,the south carolina law enforcement division sled,the agency tasked with enforcing the statutes,has confiscated and destroyed hundreds of its machines.lucky strike never challenged any of the seizures.instead,it chose,along with martin,to bring this facial challenge to the statutes.
section is part of south carolina legal framework regulating machines and devices.it establishes that 
it is unlawful for any person to keep on his premises or operate or permit to be kept on his premises or operated within this state any vending or slot machine,or any video game machine with a free play feature operated by a slot in which is deposited a coin or thing of value,or other device operated by a slot in which is deposited a coin or thing of value for the play of poker,blackjack,keno,lotto,bingo,or craps,or any machine or device licensed pursuant to section and used for gambling or any punch board,pull board,or other device pertaining to games of chance of whatever name or kind,including those machines,boards,or other devices that display different pictures,words,or symbols,at different plays or different numbers,whether in words or figures or,which deposit tokens or coins at regular intervals or in varying numbers to the player or in the machine,but the provisions of this section do not extend to nonpayout pin tables,pin games,or to automatic weighing,measuring,musical,and vending machines which are constructed as to give a certain uniform and fair return in value for each coin deposited and in which there is no element of chance.
any person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and,upon conviction,must be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned for a period of not more than one year,or both.
section sets forth procedures for enforcement of 
any machine,board,or other device prohibited by section must be seized by any law enforcement officer and at once taken before any magistrate of the county in which the machine,board,or device is seized who shall immediately examine it,and if satisfied that it is in violation of section or any other law of this state,direct that it be immediately destroyed.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.nader blair,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.id.
a statute is unconstitutionally vague under the due process clause if it fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited,or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.united states williams,d see also south carolina medical ass thompson,cir.when considering a facial challenge,courts first determine whether the enactment implicates a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d.if it does not,then the challenge should only succeed if the law is impermissibly vague in all of its applications.id.at.as we have explained,a facial challenge is ineffective if the statute has a plainly legitimate sweep.united states comstock,cir quoting crawford marion cnty.election,d.however,where a statute imposes criminal penalties,the standard of certainty is higher and the statute can be invalidated on its face even where it could conceivably have some valid application.wright new jersey,d quoting kolender lawson,d.
because appellants bring a facial attack,the first question is whether the statute implicates constitutionally protected conduct.the district court answered this question by pointing to the proposition that gambling implicates no constitutionally protected right.see united states edge broad,d.the parties dispute whether can be used to confiscate games that are not used for gambling.in any case,appellants make no argument that infringes on constitutionally protected conduct.the appropriate inquiry,then,is whether is invalid in all of its applications,keeping in mind that,because this is a criminal statute,it must be more than a mere conceivable application.see hoffman,at kolender,at.
appellants concede in their reply brief that the statute,taken as a whole,is not impermissibly vague in all its applications.for instance,they do not dispute that poker,blackjack,keno,lotto,bingo and craps are clearly outlawed.however,they argue that one phrase in the statute the blanket prohibition against possessing any other device pertaining to games of chance of whatever name or kind,is impermissibly vague in all its applications.
even when bringing a facial challenge,a party may contest certain provisions of a statute without taking on the whole of the statute.see,reno american civil liberties union,d.however,a court is not confined to the plain language of the contested statute when assessing a claim.see kolender,at.a federal court must consider any limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proffered.village of hoffman estates,at.further,when considering phrases or words within a statute,those phrases or words should be considered in the context of the statute as a whole.the real truth about abortion,fed.election comm n,cir.
the supreme court of south carolina has provided significant clarity to the disputed phrase by deciding several cases based,at least in part,on whether a device is a game of chance under and its predecessor statute.see state deangelis,affirming a jury determination that a game requiring no skill was illegal under a predecessor statute see also ward west oil,holding that game machines were illegal games of chance sun light prepaid phonecard state of south carolina,holding that machine dispensing phone cards with attached was an illegal game of chance.while these cases may not draw definitive parameters around the catchall phrase that appellants contest,they do demonstrate that use of the term games of chance has a plainly legitimate sweep and more than a conceivable application,which is all that is required to survive a facial challenge to a criminal statute where constitutional rights are not implicated.see comstock,at.
appellants repeatedly assert that can be read to outlaw standard board games like monopoly.the supreme court of the united states
