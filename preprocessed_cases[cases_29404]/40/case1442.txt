this case presents the question of whether a federal lies within congress power.section purports to allow the federal government to place in indefinite civil commitment sexually dangerous persons,granting the federal government unprecedented authority over civil area long controlled by the states.the district court held that exceeds the limits of congressional power and intrudes on the powers reserved to the states.the government now appeals.
we are the first appellate court to address this question,but the issue has divided trial courts across the nation.compare united states tom,d,holding that congress lacked authority to enact,and united states comstock,d,same,with united states abregana,d,holding that congress had authority to enact,united states dowell,no,wl,at,same,united states shields,d,same,and united states carta,d,same.
two fundamental principles guide our inquiry.on one hand,respect for the legislative branch demands that we afford congressional enactments a presumption of constitutionality.united states morrison,d.but on the other,we must invalidate an act of congress on a plain showing that congress has exceeded its constitutional authority.id.
after carefully considering the government arguments,we conclude,for the reasons set forth below,that does indeed lie beyond the scope of congress authority.the constitution does not empower the federal government to confine a person solely because of asserted sexual dangerousness when the government need not allege let alone prove that this dangerousness violates any federal law.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court 
congress enacted as part of the adam walsh child protection and safety act of the act.see,stat.with the aim of protect ing children from sexual exploitation and violent crime,id.at,a senate sponsor described the act as the most comprehensive child crimes and protection bill in our nation history.cong.rec.daily ed.july,statement of hatch.among other measures,the act creates a national sex offender registry,see,stat.at codified at,increases punishments for a variety of federal crimes against children,see,stat.at codified as amended at,and strengthens existing child pornography prohibitions,see,stat.at codified as amended at.none of these provisions of the act is challenged here.
the only portion of the act at issue here,authorizes the federal government to civilly commit,in a federal facility,any sexually dangerous person in the custody of the bureau of after that person has completed his entire prison sentence.a,d.to initiate commitment under,the attorney general need only certify that a person within federal custody is sexually dangerous.such a certification,when filed with the district court in the jurisdiction in which the federal government holds a person,automatically stays that person release from prison.id.a.in the cases at issue here,this stay has extended federal confinement well past the end of any prison term.thus,pursuant to,the federal government has civilly confined former federal prisoners without proof that they have committed any new offense.moreover,empowers the attorney general to prolong federal detention in this manner without presenting evidence or making any preliminary showing the statute only requires that the certification contain an allegation of dangerousness.
the statute defines a sexually dangerous person to be one who has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation and who is sexually dangerous to others,and who suffers from a severe mental illness such that he would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released.a.however,neither sexually violent conduct nor child molestation are terms defined by the statute 
after the attorney general files the certification,directs the district court to adjudicate a person alleged sexual dangerousness.id.a.if the district court finds the person to be sexually dangerous by clear and convincing evidence,the court must commit the person to federal custody.id.d.only then does direct the attorney general to make all reasonable efforts to transfer responsibility for the person to an appropriate state authority.id.unless and until a state assumes this responsibility,authorizes federal confinement for as long as the person remains sexually dangerous.id.
graydon comstock,who filed the first of these consolidated challenges to,pled guilty to receipt of child pornography in violation of a.six days prior to the end of his prison sentence,the attorney general certified comstock as a sexually dangerous person,staying his release from prison.more than two years later,comstock remains confined in the medium security federal correctional institution at butner,north carolina.
the cases of markis revland,thomas matherly,and marvin vigil followed a similar course,with the government certifying each man for federal commitment less than one month before he completed his full prison term in fact,the government certified vigil for civil commitment on the very same day that he had completed his term of imprisonment.like comstock,each of these men remains in federal custody at more than two years after the expiration of his prison term.
as part of each certification,the government petitioned for a hearing to determine whether the named person qualified as sexually dangerous under.in each case,the named person then moved to dismiss,contending that violates the constitution.the district court agreed and held that civil commitment scheme could not withstand constitutional scrutiny.comstock,d at.
with this background in mind,we turn to the question presented in this case whether the constitution grants congress the authority to enact.
in the exercise of their general police and parens patriae powers,the states have long controlled the civil commitment of the mentally ill.see,united states sahhar,cir united states cohen,en banc mackinnon,concurring the care and commitment of the insane is,and has been,a uniquely state function.note,federal hospitalization of insane defendants under section of the criminal code,yale,power over the general field of insanity resides exclusively in the states as parens patriae.unlike the states,the federal government has no general police or parens patriae power.united states lopez,d.
nonetheless,in the statute at issue here,congress purports to grant the federal government broad civil commitment authority this raises a substantial constitutional question because the constitution requires that a specific enumerated power support every statute enacted by congress.morrison,at.the government does not argue to the contrary.
yet the government attempts to defend the validity of largely by direct reliance on the necessary and proper clause.const.art.i,cl.but that provision,by itself,creates no constitutional power rather,it merely permits congress t o make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution all powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states id.emphasis added.thus,to sustain under the necessary and proper clause,the government must show that the statute is necessary to achieve ends within congress enumerated powers.see sabri united states,d.
perhaps implicitly recognizing this deficiency in its necessary and proper clause arguments,the government also relies albeit briefly on the commerce clause unlike the necessary and proper clause,the commerce clause does vest congress with enumerated constitutional power.clearly,if we can uphold as a valid exercise of congress commerce clause powers,the statute lies within congressional authority.accordingly,consistent with the presumption of constitutionality,morrison,at,that we afford every federal statute,we begin our analysis by addressing this question.
the commerce clause empowers congress t o regulate commerce among the several states.const.art.i,cl.
recent supreme court precedent provides substantial assistance in resolving the question of whether the commerce clause authorizes.first,in united states lopez,the court held that the school zones act gfsza of,which made possession of a firearm in a school zone a federal crime,exceeded congress commerce clause power because it regulated neither commercial nor interstate activity.at.then,in morrison,the court imposed further limits on congress commerce clause power,holding unconstitutional a provision of the violence against women act vawa that created a federal civil remedy for noneconomic sexual violence,because such crimes do not substantially affect interstate commerce.at.
in these cases,the court identified three specific areas that congress could regulate pursuant to its commerce clause power the channels of interstate commerce,instrumentalities of or persons and things in interstate commerce,and activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.see,lopez,at.like the statutes at issue in lopez and morrison,the statute challenged here,contains no jurisdictional requirement limiting its application to commercial or interstate activities.nor does the government suggest that targets the channels of interstate commerce or persons and things in interstate commerce.therefore,we can uphold under the commerce clause only if it regulates activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.see morrison,at.
morrison forecloses any such argument.indeed,bears striking similarities to the vawa provision struck down in morrison.first,like vawa,provides a civil remedy aimed at the prevention of noneconomic sexual violence.the morrison court rationale for rejecting commerce clause authority for such a statute applies with equal force here 
the regulation and punishment of intrastate violence has always been the province of the states.indeed,we can think of no better example of the police power,which the founders denied the national government and reposed in the states,than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.
id.at.citations omitted.
second,the target of the statute challenged here sexual dangerousness no less than the target of the statute invalidated in morrison violence is not,in any sense of the phrase,economic activity.id.at.like the violence banned in morrison,sexual dangerousness does not substantially affect interstate commerce.indeed,unlike morrison,the record here does not even contain any legislative findings to the contrary.
supreme court precedent thus compels the conclusion that does not constitute a valid exercise by congress of its commerce clause power to construe as within such power would encroach on the police and parens patriae powers reserved to the sovereign states,conflating what is truly national and what is truly local.id.at.see also cohen,at scalia,a federal procedure for the commitment of the mentally ill would constitute an inappropriate interference with the balance of federal and state powers t he care of the mentally ill is a task that uniquely belongs within the parens patriae powers of the states.quoting,at.
federal commitment of sexually dangerous persons may well the suppression of guns in schools or the redress of sound proposal as a matter of social policy.but policy justifications do not create congressional authority.morrison,at.hence lies beyond congress commerce clause authority.the government apparent reluctance to rely on the commerce clause is thus understandable.
what is less understandable is the government heavy reliance on the necessary and proper clause,standing alone,as a source of congressional power.of course,as the government contends at length,the necessary and proper clause reaches broadly,but it does so only to effectuate powers specifically enumerated in the constitution.see mcculloch maryland,wheat.the necessary and proper clause simply does and of any congressional power.see kinsella united states ex rel.singleton,d the necessary and proper clause is not itself a grant of power,but a caveat that the congress possesses all the means necessary to carry out the specifically granted foregoing powers of of article i of the constitution.ordinarily,this would end our discussion of the necessary and proper clause.but because the government defense of relies almost exclusively on that clause,we briefly address each of its specific arguments on this point.
the government principal argument is that its ability to establish and maintain a federal criminal justice and penal system somehow renders necessary and proper and thus constitutional.see brief of appellant at,reply brief of appellant at.the government cites no precedent in support of this novel theory.instead,the government relies on a restatement provision setting forth common law principles on the responsibilities of custodians.see brief of appellant at quoting restatement second of torts reply brief of appellant at same.in essence,the government argues that because it may constitutionally imprison persons who violate federal criminal law,it can continue to confine such after they have served their it believes them to be sexually dangerous.
this argument must fail.of course,congress may establish and run a federal penal system,as necessary and proper to the article i power usually the commerce clause relied on to enact federal criminal statutes.and,consistent with its role in maintaining a penal system,the federal government possesses broad powers over persons during their prison sentences.but these powers are far removed from the indefinite civil commitment of persons after the expiration of their prison terms,based solely on possible future actions that the federal government lacks power to regulate directly 
the fact of previously lawful federal custody simply does not,in itself,provide congress with any authority to regulate future conduct that occurs outside of the prison walls.for example,although the government may regulate assaults occurring in federal prisons,the government can not criminalize all assaults committed by former federal prisoners.as the district court explained 
the fact of legitimate custody does not establish congressional authority to provide for the commitment of a person after a person has completed a sentence for a federal crime,when the power to prosecute federal offenses is exhausted,when that person has not committed any misconduct while in custody,and where there has been no showing that the person is likely to engage in conduct that congress,as opposed to the states,actually has the authority to criminalize.
comstock,d at.
the government next contends that constitutes a necessary and proper exercise of its power to prevent crimes.brief of appellant at.but the federal government simply has no power to broadly regulate all crimes,as purports to do.
consistent with congress limited powers,federal statutes regulating sex crimes are limited in number and breadth,specifically requiring a connection to interstate commerce,see,a,or limiting their scope to the territorial jurisdiction of the united states,see,id.a.in contrast,targets sexual dangerousness generally,without any requirement that this undefined danger relate to conduct that the federal government may constitutionally regulate.because most crimes of sexual violence violate state and not federal law many commitments under would prevent conduct prohibited only by state law.section thus sweeps far too broadly to be a valid effort to prevent federal criminal activity.
the principal case on which the government relies for its argument to the contrary,united states perry,cir,actually offers it no support.notably,at the outset,the perry court recognized as the government fails to here that a specific,enumerated federal power must support a federal civil commitment 
t he federal government may resort to civil commitment when such commitment is necessary and proper to the exercise of some specific federal authority.congress may not,however,authorize commitment simply to protect the general welfare of the community at large.
id.at emphasis added.applying this test,perry upheld the constitutionality of the bail reform act of,which authorizes pretrial detention only if a court finds a likelihood that the detainee will,if released,commit one of four specific federal offenses.id.at.the bail reform act therefore contained a clear connection between the pretrial detentions and the
