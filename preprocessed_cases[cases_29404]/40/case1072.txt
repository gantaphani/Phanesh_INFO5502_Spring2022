this appeal requires us to consider the scope of the employee retirement income security act erisa rule,u.g.certain current and retired members of a union the battoni plaintiffs challenged an amendment to their welfare plan the disputed amendment as an unlawful cutback of their accrued benefits under their pension plan.we must determine whether the disputed amendment,which conditions receipt of healthcare benefits under a welfare plan on of an accrued benefit under a pension plan,violates the rule.in light of erisa statutory text and our precedent,we conclude that the disputed amendment violated the rule by constructively amending the pension plan in a manner that decreased an accrued benefit under that plan.accordingly,we will affirm the district court judgment in favor of the battoni plaintiffs.
in november,the local and the local chapters of the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew merged.as a result of the merger,the local chapter was dissolved and its members were transferred to the local chapter.the chapters pension and welfare plans were also combined.
before the merger,the local pension plan permitted plan participants to choose between a lump sum pension benefit or a periodic monthly benefit.the local pension plan,on the other hand,provided only a periodic monthly benefit to its participants.after the merger,the two pension plans were combined into local pension plan.to accommodate the lump sum pension benefit option that was included in the local pension plan,the local pension plan was amended to provide former local members the right to receive a lump sum benefit for accruals.accruals,however,could be applied only towards a periodic monthly benefit.
the chapters welfare plans were combined by transferring the local members to the local welfare plan.that plan provided eligible retirees healthcare benefits for themselves and their spouses.to receive these benefits,a retiree was required to satisfy certain conditions outlined in the plan.shortly after the merger,the local welfare plan was amended to include a new condition on the receipt of healthcare benefits.this amendment,the disputed amendment,conditioned a retiree receipt of healthcare benefits on the retiree not choosing the lump sum pension benefit offered under the local pension plan.the disputed amendment stated,in relevant part,that 
retired employees who elect a lump sum pension benefit in lieu of periodic monthly benefits from the ibew local pension plan from another local union ibew pension plan shall not be eligible for continued healthcare coverage.
before the addition of the disputed amendment,a former local member could elect to receive the lump sum pension benefit provided under the local pension plan and still receive healthcare benefits under the local welfare plan.
a group of current and retired members of the local chapter who were formerly members of the local chapter,the battoni plaintiffs,challenged the disputed amendment,alleging,among other things,that it violated the rule.the battoni plaintiffs filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,naming the local pension and welfare plans and the current and former trustees of those plans collectively,the union as defendants.
after a bench trial,the district court concluded that the disputed amendment violated the rule and entered judgment in favor of the battoni plaintiffs.the union then filed this timely appeal

the rule states the accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan,other than an amendment described in section d or.g to state a claim for violation of erisa rule one must show that a plan was amended and that the amendment decreased an accrued benefit.see id.
the union concedes that the lump sum pension benefit offered under the local pension plan was an accrued benefit.it argues that the disputed amendment lawfully amended a welfare benefit benefits are exempt from coverage under the rule,without disturbing the battoni plaintiffs rights to the lump sum pension benefit offered under the local pension plan.this argument can not succeed in this case.
the first question that must be resolved is whether the disputed amendment,by conditioning the receipt of welfare benefits on a retiree not exercising her right to receive a lump sum pension benefit under the local pension plan,constituted an amendment to the local pension plan.see g.because the disputed amendment constructively amended the right to receive a lump sum pension benefit under the local pension plan,we conclude that the first requirement of an claim was satisfied.
our view of what constitutes an amendment to a pension plan has been construed broadly to protect pension recipients.see,hein fdic,cir accord hunter caliber,cir.that being said,the union argument that it did not amend the local pension plan has a certain superficial appeal because welfare and pension plans undoubtedly serve different purposes under erisa scheme.the former provide healthcare and unemployment benefits and the latter provide retirement income benefits

we must examine the disputed amendment closely to determine its true character before we declare it solely a welfare plan amendment and exempt from the rule.an evaluation of the amendment benefit characteristics,which are independent of the formal placement of the amendment,is necessary.see in re lucent death benefits erisa,at.the type of benefit provided,not other considerations,determines whether a plan amendment amends a pension plan or a welfare plan.see rombach nestle usa,cir.
