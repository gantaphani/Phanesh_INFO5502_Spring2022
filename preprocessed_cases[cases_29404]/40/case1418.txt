in its recent opinion in winter,the supreme court articulated clearly what must be shown to obtain a preliminary injunction,stating that the plaintiff must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.winter.at.and all four requirements must be satisfied.id.indeed,the court in winter rejected a standard that allowed the plaintiff to demonstrate only a possibility of irreparable harm because that standard was inconsistent with our characterization of injunctive relief as an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.id.at.
before the supreme court decision in winter,the standard articulated in blackwelder furniture of statesville seilig manufacturing,cir,governed the grant or denial of preliminary injunctions in the fourth circuit.see also,direx israel,breakthrough med,cir rum creek coal sales,caperton,cir.in blackwelder we adopted the test,which begins with balancing the hardships of the parties.at.we stated,the first step in a rule a preliminary injunction situation is for the court to balance the likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiff against the likelihood of harm to the defendant.id.at.if that balancing results in an imbalance in the plaintiff favor,we then determine whether the plaintiff raised questions going to the merits so serious,substantial,difficult and doubtful,as to make them fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.id.in blackwelder,we specifically held that the district court erred when it demanded that the plaintiff first show likelihood of success in order to be entitled to preliminary relief.id.
similarly,in rum creek coal,we reiterated that the hardship balancing test applies to determine the granting or denial of a preliminary injunction.at.we held that only after the district court concluded that the balance of the likelihood of the irreparable harm to the parties tilted in favor of the plaintiff was it to turn to the merits of the case to determine whether the plaintiff show ed grave or serious questions for litigation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
our blackwelder standard in several respects now stands in fatal tension with the supreme court decision in winter.
first,the supreme court in winter,recognizing that a preliminary injunction affords relief before trial,requires that the plaintiff make a clear showing that it will likely succeed on the merits at trial.at.yet in blackwelder,we instructed that the requirement be considered,if at all,only after a balancing of hardships is conducted and then only under the relaxed standard of showing that grave or serious questions are presented for litigation.at emphasis added see also rum creek coal,at.the winter requirement that the plaintiff clearly demonstrate that it will likely succeed on the merits is far stricter than the blackwelder requirement that the plaintiff demonstrate only a grave or serious question for litigation.
second,winter requires that the plaintiff make a clear showing that it is likely to be irreparably harmed absent preliminary relief.at.blackwelder,on the other hand,requires that the court balance the irreparable harm to the respective parties,requiring only that the harm to the plaintiff outweigh the harm to the defendant.at.moreover,blackwelder allows that upon a strong showing on the probability of success,the moving party may demonstrate only a possibility of irreparable injury,id.at standard explicitly rejected in winter.at.
third,in winter,the supreme court emphasized the public interest requirement,stating,in exercising their sound discretion,courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.at emphasis added internal quotations marks and citation omitted.yet,under the blackwelder standard,the public interest requirement does not appear always to be considered at length in preliminary injunction analyses,even though it must always be considered.rum creek coal,at see also blackwelder,at.
