in this appeal,we address the interpretation of a provision of the act of,governing the filing of whistleblower lawsuits in federal district court.the parties acknowledge that the act expressly provides a united states district court jurisdiction to entertain a whistleblower action.however,they disagree as to whether a whistleblower plaintiff,during the pendency of an administrative appeal of an administrative law judge alj ruling,has the right to a de novo proceeding in district court.in the absence of guidance from this court,or other circuit courts,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the district court action in favor of remand to the appropriate administrative body for further proceedings.in light of the language of the statutory provisions at issue,we reverse the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
david stone stone or appellant was employed by instrumentation laboratory company ilc from through.ilc is in the business of developing,manufacturing,and distributing critical care and diagnostic instruments,as well as other related products and services,for use primarily in hospital laboratories.stone began as an ilc sales representative in,was promoted to sales manager in,and was again promoted in to director of national accounts.during his employment at ilc,stone received numerous accolades for his performance 
as director of national accounts,one of stone responsibilities was working with group purchasing organizations gpos,which are strategic affiliations of hospitals that concentrate buying power in order to negotiate lower prices.ilc had contracts with various gpos requiring that,among other things,ilc maintain a gpo membership database,offer contractually negotiated prices and terms to gpo members,and pay administrative fees to gpos equal to three percent of sales revenue generated from member purchases.ilc has acknowledged in public disclosures to shareholders that gpos are a critical part of its distribution strategy.
after assuming his role as director of national accounts,stone learned that brian durkin durkin,one of stone superiors at ilc,was not accurately tracking,reporting,and paying the required administrative fees to gpos.durkin omissions resulted in a cumulative liability of at least half a million dollars and threatened ilc ability to sell products to most of its customers.stone complaint asserts that durkin failure to maintain adequate internal controls and track administrative fees resulted in ilc misrepresenting its financial condition to shareholders.compl.stone discovery regarding administrative fees prompted him to perform additional investigation into ilc internal controls,and such investigation revealed numerous weaknesses.
from september of until march of,stone repeatedly voiced his concerns about deficient internal controls and unpaid gpo fees to durkin and two other ilc managers stone efforts were repeatedly met with resistance and even unequivocal refusals to correct the problems.stone contends that appellees retaliated against him after he brought such deficiencies to light,and that such retaliation culminated in stone termination in march of.
on june,pursuant to the act,stone filed a retaliation claim with the occupational safety and health administration osha,which hears such claims on behalf of the secretary of labor the secretary.osha issued its preliminary findings on january,more than days after stone claim was filed.pursuant to the governing regulations,stone timely objected to osha findings and requested a hearing before an alj.on march,appellees filed a motion for summary decision before the alj.in response,stone moved to delay consideration of such motion to permit him to take discovery.stone motion for discovery was denied and the alj granted appellees motion for summary decision on september.stone thereafter successfully petitioned the administrative review board arb for review of the alj order.on october,the arb established a briefing schedule,which was thereafter modified by the arb on stone motion.
on november,more than a month before stone initial brief was due under the modified briefing schedule,stone filed a notice with the arb stating his intention to bring a de novo action in federal district court.the arb then issued an order to show cause why the administrative appeal should not be dismissed.after appellees failed to respond,and after receiving notice from stone that he had in fact filed suit in federal court,the arb dismissed the administrative appeal.such dismissal was not based on the merits,but appears to be an acknowledgment that,no bad faith having been alleged by ilc,the arb lost jurisdiction over the matter once stone complaint was filed in district court.
stone act whistleblower suit was filed in the united states district court for the district of maryland on november.on march,appellees timely filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.after the matter was fully briefed,on july,the district court granted such motion based on preclusion principles,finding that the alj ruling was a final judgment on the merits for purposes of collateral estoppel.in so ruling,the court rejected stone claim that he did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate his claims before the alj and indicated that permitting stone to pursue relief in federal district court would be wasteful.the district court did,however,issue a mandamus to the department of labor to proceedings and further ordered the arb to rule on the merits of stone appeal within days.
although the district court granted the motion to dismiss and ordered further administrative proceedings,it did not dismiss the civil action before it,opting instead to stay the proceedings.stone thereafter sought certification to file an appeal to this court,but that motion was ultimately denied.stone declined to further prosecute his administrative appeal before the arb because he believed that the filing of his complaint in district court divested the arb of jurisdiction.based on stone failure to prosecute,the arb entered a final order of dismissal and stone thereafter obtained a final judgment from the district court on his dismissed whistleblower claim.stone now appeals the dismissal of his district court action.
the instant appeal presents a question of statutory interpretation,which is a question of law that we review de novo.united states turner,cir.appellant argues that the plain meaning of the relevant statute could not be clearer,and that as a complainant he is entitled to a de novo review in federal district court because the secretary did not reach a final decision within days,as required by the act.in contrast,appellees contend that the language of the act and its regulations do not abrogate the district court power to apply principles of preclusion to avoid duplicative litigation.both sides agree that there is no apparent guidance from federal circuit courts on the proper interpretation of the relevant provision of this relatively new statute

with the above statutory and regulatory backdrop,we now turn to the central question before the district court had authority to dismiss stone complaint by applying preclusion principles.
the relevant portion of the whistleblower statute states that an aggrieved individual may bring an action at law or equity for de novo review in the appropriate district court of the united states if a final decision has not been issued by the secretary of labor within days after the filing of an administrative complaint.b b.starting,as we must,with the text of the statute,we find the above quoted language to be plain and unambiguous.it is undisputed that,here,the secretary did not issue a final decision within days and that stone followed the procedure set forth in the regulations to exercise his statutory right to seek relief in district court.
although the action in district court was properly filed and the court acknowledged its jurisdiction over the suit,in granting appellees motion to dismiss,the district court relied on its inherent power to apply preclusion principles,issue a mandamus,and order the dol to administrative proceedings.the district court explained that because stone had a full and fair opportunity to litigate his claims before an alj,which resulted in a final judgment on the merits,it would be wasteful to relitigate the claims in district court.in reaching such conclusion,the district court relied in part on the secretary public comments on,as well as on a similar finding by an out of circuit district court in allen stewart enterprises,unpublished.
in applying preclusion principles,the district court strayed from the plain and unambiguous meaning of b b.the district court need not have reached any dol interpretive regulations,or the secretary comments to such regulations,to define a complainant right to a de novo review in district court.the text of the statute is the dol has not reached a final decision within the time period established by congress,a complainant has the statutory right not merely to undefined relief in another forum,but to de novo review in federal district court.b b.a plaintiff right to pursue such relief is not circumscribed in any manner by the statute.
appellees argue,however,that although the statute does not preclude a plaintiff from seeking such relief,nothing in the text of the statute,its procedural regulations,or its legislative history,abrogate s the district court power to prevent needless duplicative litigation by applying collateral estoppel.appellees brief.although we agree that district courts generally have the ability to give preclusive effect to final administrative rulings,collins pond creek mining,cir,we reject appellees interpretation of the instant statute since such construction reads out of the statute the phrase de novo review.b b.as we have previously stated,b y definition,de novo review entails consideration of an issue as if it had not been decided previously.united states george,cir see betty b coal director,office of workers compensation programs,united states dep t of labor,cir the sum of a de novo review and a de novo process is a new adjudication.accordingly,although the statute does not expressly state that a district court ability to apply preclusion principles is abrogated,the statute expressly requires the district court to consider the merits anew.taking steps that,in effect,defer to the agency is in direct conflict with the statute mandate that the district court consider the issue as if it had not been decided previously.george,at 
to further clarify the import of congress establishment of a right to de novo review,we have previously discussed in detail the difference between preclusive findings of state aljs on claims,and findings of state aljs on title vii claims.rao county of fairfax,cir layne campbell county of social,cir.such distinction exists because the language and legislative history of title vii establish that administrative findings are entitled to a level of deference that is something less than preclusion.rao,at see university of elliott,d recognizing congress authority to create a statutory scheme that does not afford preclusive effect to prior administrative fact finding.
