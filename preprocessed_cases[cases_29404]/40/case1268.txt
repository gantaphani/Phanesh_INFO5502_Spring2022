the board of commissioners of rowan county,north carolina,the board opens its public meetings with an invocation delivered by a member of the board.the district court determined that practice violates the establishment clause of the first amendment.under the supreme court most recent decision explaining legislative prayer,town of greece galloway,d,we find the board legislative prayer practice constitutional and reverse the judgment of the district court.
the relevant facts are undisputed.rowan county,north carolina,exercises its municipal power through an elected board of commissioners,which typically holds public meetings twice a month.for many years prior to this proceeding,the board has permitted each commissioner,on a rotating basis,to offer an invocation before the start of the board legislative agenda 
at most board meetings,the chairperson would call the meeting to order and invite the board and audience to stand for the ceremonial opening.a designated commissioner would then deliver an invocation of his or her choosing followed by the pledge of allegiance.the content of each invocation was entirely in the discretion of the respective commissioner the board,as a board,had no role in prayer selection or content.the overwhelming majority of the prayers offered by the commissioners invoked the christian faith in some form.for example,prayers frequently included references to jesus,christ,and lord,supp.it was also typical for the invocation to begin with some variant of let us pray or please pray with me.id.although not required to do so,the audience largely joined the commissioners in standing and bowing their heads during the prayer and remained standing for the pledge of allegiance.
in february,the american civil liberties union of north carolina sent the board a letter objecting to the invocations and asserting a violation of the establishment clause.the board did not formally respond,but several commissioners expressed their intent to continue delivering prayers consistent with their christian faith.for example,a stated,i will continue to pray in jesus name.i am not perfect so i need all the help i can get,and asking for guidance for my decisions from jesus is the best i,and rowan county,can ever hope for.
subsequently,rowan county residents nancy lund,liesa montag siegel,and robert voelker collectively,plaintiffs filed a complaint in the district court for the middle district of north carolina to challenge the constitutionality of the board practice of delivering sectarian prayer at meetings.specifically,plaintiffs alleged that the prayer practice unconstitutionally affiliated the board with one particular faith and caused them to feel excluded as outsiders.
apart from their objections to the prayers contents,plaintiffs further alleged that the overall atmosphere of the meetings coerced them to participate as a condition of attendance.lund stated she felt compelled to stand during the invocation so that she would not stand out.supp.voelker offered a similar account,claiming he was coerced into participating because the commissioners and most audience members stood and bowed their heads.supp.voelker also posited that any public opposition to the prayers could negatively affect his business before the board.
based on these allegations,plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the board prayer practice violated the establishment clause,along with an injunction preventing any similar future prayers.plaintiffs also moved for a preliminary injunction based on precedent that sectarian legislative prayer was a constitutional violation.see joyner forsyth,cir.explaining that our decisions hewed to the approach of approving legislative prayer only when it is nonsectarian in both policy and practice.observing that of the board recorded meetings have opened with a commissioner delivering a sectarian prayer that invokes the christian faith,the district court entered a preliminary injunction barring the county from permitting such invocations.
the supreme court then issued its decision in town of greece,holding that the legislative prayer in that case,although clearly sectarian,was constitutionally valid and did not transgress the establishment clause.id.at an insistence on nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a single,fixed standard is not consistent with the tradition of legislative prayer outlined in our cases.see also id.at.the parties filed for summary judgment in light of town of greece.
in reviewing the summary judgment motions,the district court acknowledged that in town of greece the supreme court had repudiated and dismantled the fourth circuit legislative prayer doctrine that had developed around the core understanding that the sectarian nature of legislative prayers was largely dispositive of its constitutionality.lund rowan,d.moreover,the plaintiffs did not raise the sectarian nature of the prayers as part of their summary judgment motion.nonetheless,the district court struck down the board legislative invocation practice,concluding that s everal significant differences between town of greece and this case rendered that practice unconstitutional.lund,d at.the district court thought the fact that the commissioners delivered the prayers,instead of invited clergy,deviates from the history and tradition of a chaplain,separate from the legislative body,delivering the prayer.id.at.the district court further emphasized that the board practice created a of that inherently discriminates and disfavors religious minorities.id.at.
after finding the board practice outside the constitutionally protected historical practice of legislative prayer,the district court went on to consider whether the board prayer practice otherwise violate d the establishment clause as a coercive religious exercise.id.at.although the unrefuted record disclosed that individuals could leave the room or remain seated during the opening prayer,the district court held the board conduct was nonetheless coercive because,among other things,the commissioners often invited the public to stand before the invocation.in the court words,
the board legislative prayer practice leads to prayers adhering to the faiths of five elected commissioners.the board maintains exclusive and complete control over the content of the prayers,and only the commissioners deliver the prayers.in turn,the commissioners ask everyone including the audience to stand and join in what almost always is a christian prayer.on the whole,these details and context establish that the board prayer practice is an unconstitutionally coercive practice in violation of the establishment clause.
based on this analysis,the district court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and entered a permanent injunction barring the board legislative prayer practice.the board timely appealed,and we review the district court decision de novo.simpson chesterfield cty.bd.of supervisors,cir.see also weinbaum city of las cruces,cir.we review de novo a district court findings of constitutional fact and its ultimate conclusions regarding a first amendment challenge.
recognizing this nation history has not been one of entirely sanitized separation between church and state,the supreme court has acknowledged that government,in some instances,may properly commemorate religion in public life.comm.for pub.educ.religious liberty nyquist,d.pertinent here,the court has expressly approved the practice of opening legislative sessions with prayer.see joyner,at there is a clear line of precedent not only upholding the practice of legislative prayer,but acknowledging the ways in which it can bring together citizens of all backgrounds and encourage them to participate in the workings of their government.in contrast to other establishment clause jurisprudence,legislative prayer stands on its own distinct ground owing to its historically based practice and acceptance.
while legislative prayer is generally a type of government speech,turner city council of fredericksburg,cir,the supreme court has always stressed its unique status.that status was evident in marsh chambers,d,which involved a challenge to the constitutionality of the nebraska legislature practice of having a paid chaplain offer a prayer to open each legislative session.applying the test from lemon kurtzman,d,the eighth circuit had concluded such invocations violated the establishment clause.the supreme court disagreed.
recounting the american tradition of opening legislative sessions with prayer,the supreme court traced its history f rom colonial times through the founding of the republic and ever since.marsh,at.the court noted that the first congress,as one of its early items of business,adopted the policy of selecting a chaplain to open each session with prayer.id.at.the senate and house,in turn,appointed official chaplains in.id.ascribing great significance to these events,the court explained they shed light on how the founders viewed the establishment clause in relation to legislative prayer.it can hardly be thought that they intended the establishment clause to forbid what they had just declared acceptable.id.at.this unique history led the court to accept the interpretation of the first amendment draftsmen who saw no real threat to the establishment clause arising from the practice of legislative prayer.id.at.
having upheld legislative prayer in general,the marsh court next considered whether specific features of nebraska practice fell outside constitutional protection.in that regard,the plaintiff raised three challenges i nebraska had selected a representative of only one denomination for sixteen years ii the chaplain was a paid state employee and iii his prayers were offered in the judeo christian tradition.id.at.the supreme court rejected all three claims,noting that the first congress did not consider opening prayers as a proselytizing activity or as symbolically placing the government official seal of approval on one religious view.id.at.moreover,there was no evidence that the chaplain long tenure stemmed from an impermissible motive,and thus his continuous appointment did not in itself conflict with the establishment clause.id.at.that the chaplain was paid from public funds was similarly grounded in historic practice and thus not prohibited.id.at.as for the content of the prayers,the court explained it was not of concern because there is no indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to proselytize or advance any one,or to disparage any other,faith or belief.id.at.that being so,the supreme court concluded it would not embark on a sensitive evaluation or to parse the content of a particular prayer.id.at.
the supreme court later referenced its holding in marsh during the course of ruling on the propriety of two religious holiday displays located on public property in county of allegheny aclu greater pittsburgh chapter,d.in dicta commenting about legislative prayer practice permitted in marsh,the court noted that t he legislative prayers involved in marsh did not violate the establishment clause because the particular chaplain had removed all references to christ.id.at.the court also observed that not even the unique history of legislative prayer can justify contemporary legislative prayers that have the effect of affiliating the government with any one specific faith or belief.id.
whatever fleeting validity those observations may have had,the supreme court flatly rejected this approach in town of greece.clarifying its earlier holdings,the court disavowed a requirement that legislative prayers must be neutral and reference only a generic god to comply with the establishment clause an insistence on nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a single,fixed standard is not consistent with the tradition of legislative prayer outlined in our cases.town of greece.at.
the supreme court decision in town of greece guides review of this case,which,like other legislative prayer cases,requires a evaluation of all the facts and circumstances.see lynch donnelly,d observing that the establishment clause can not mechanistically be applied to draw unwavering,universal lines for the varying contexts of public life.to guide that review we turn to a fuller examination of the supreme court discussion in town of greece.
the town of greece opened its monthly legislative meetings with an invocation delivered by volunteer clergy.it solicited guest chaplains by placing calls to local congregations listed in a directory.town of greece.at.nearly all of the local churches were christian,as were the guest clergy,and thus most invocations referenced some aspect of the christian faith.the town made no attempt to guide the in the content of the prayer.id.although the district court found the town practice constitutional the second circuit disagreed and concluded that the steady drumbeat of christian prayer tended to affiliate the town with christianity,in violation of the establishment clause.id.at.the supreme court reversed.
beginning with a summary of marsh,the court explained that the establishment clause must be interpreted by reference to historical practices and understandings.id.at see also id.at.marsh stands for the proposition that it is not necessary to define the precise boundary of the establishment clause where history shows that the specific practice is permitted.id.at.the pertinent inquiry in legislative prayer cases,therefore,is whether the practice at issue fits within the tradition long followed in congress and the state legislatures.id.the court added,a ny test we adopt for analyzing invocations must acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the framers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change.id.
rooted thus,the court rejected the plaintiffs argument that legislative prayer must be generic or nonsectarian under the establishment clause.observing that legislative invocations containing explicitly religious themes were accepted at the time of the first congress and remain vibrant today,the court concluded,a n insistence on nonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a single,fixed standard is not consistent with our accepted tradition of legislative prayer.id.at.on this point,the court disavowed allegheny nonsectarian interpretation of marsh as dictum that was disputed when written and has been repudiated by later cases.id.at see also id.marsh nowhere suggested that the constitutionality of legislative prayer turns on the neutrality of its content.
the court further observed that a rule would force the legislatures that sponsor prayers and the courts that are asked to decide these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech.id.at.enforcing such a line would involve government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is the case under the town current practice of neither editing or approving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content after the fact.id.once it invites prayer into the public sphere,the court stated,government must permit a prayer giver to address his or her own god or gods as conscience dictates,unfettered by what an administrator or judge considers to be nonsectarian.id.at.
noting that legislative prayer has historically served a ceremonial function,t he relevant constraint derives from its place at the opening of legislative sessions,where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and reflect values long part of the nation heritage.id.at.even so,the court cautioned there could be a circumstance where a legislative prayer practice failed to serve its legitimate function if the course and practice over time shows that the invocations denigrate nonbelievers or religious minorities,threaten damnation,or preach conversion.id.at.
synthesizing these factors,the court held that the prayers offered on behalf of the town,although almost exclusively christian,did not evidence any pattern of denigration or proselytization.see id.our tradition assumes that adult citizens,firm in their own beliefs,can tolerate and perhaps appreciate a ceremonial prayer delivered by a person of a different faith.though the plaintiffs pointed to at least two prayers in the record that arguably contained disparaging content,the court concluded that the prayer practice as a whole served only to solemnize the board meetings.a few deviating prayers,the court explained,were of no constitutional consequence.id.at.
relatedly,the court also determined there was no constitutional defect arising from the fact that the invited were predominantly christian s o long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination,the constitution does not require it to search beyond its borders for prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious balancing.id.continuing,the court observed 
t he quest to promote a diversity of religious views would require the town to make wholly inappropriate judgments about the number of religions it should sponsor and the relative frequency with which it should sponsor each,a form of government entanglement with religion that is far more troublesome than the current approach.
lastly,the court addressed the plaintiffs contention that the prayers unconstitutionally coerce participation by nonadherents.id.kennedy,plurality opinion.in jettisoning this argument,the court acknowledged that coercion could render legislative prayer beyond constitutional protection in some outlier circumstances.but the justices differed in their understandings of what constituted coercion.compare id.at sec.of justice kennedy plurality opinion,with id.at sec.ii.of justice thomas concurring opinion.
justice kennedy,joined by chief justice roberts and justice alito,framed the coercion inquiry as a one that considers both the setting in which the prayer arises and the audience to whom it is directed.id.at kennedy,plurality opinion.these justices found no coercion in the town prayer practice and relied heavily on the historical approach of marsh.they presumed that reasonable observers are aware of the multiple traditions acknowledging god in this country,including legislative prayer,the pledge of allegiance,and presidential prayers.they concluded that,because of these traditions,citizens could appreciate the town prayer practice without being compelled to participate.id.furthermore,they observed that the purpose of the prayers was to put legislators in a contemplative state of mind rather than have an effect on observers.id.at.justice kennedy further stated that o ffense does not equate to coercion.id.adults often encounter speech they find disagreeable and an establishment clause violation is not made out any time a person experiences a sense of affront from the expression of contrary religious views in a legislative forum.id 
with these principles from town of greece in mind,we now apply them to the facts presented here.
legislative prayer thus has a unique status relative to the first amendment that places it in a different legal setting than other types of government conduct touching the establishment clause.see marsh,at.town of greece reflects that the constitutionality of legislative prayer hinges on its historical precedence,as it has become part of the fabric of our society.at.if a prayer exercise has long been followed in congress and the state legislatures,town of greece reflects that a court must view it as a tolerable acknowledgement of beliefs widely held among the people of this country.id.at.a court reviewing a challenge to legislative prayer must acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the framers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change.id.at.a test that would sweep away what has so long been settled would create new controversy and begin anew the very divisions along religious lines that the establishment clause seeks to prevent.id.
following town of greece,both parties correctly acknowledge that sectarian legislative prayer,as a general matter,is compatible with the establishment clause what remains in dispute is whether the board practice of the elected commissioners delivering such prayers makes a substantive constitutional difference.the district court found this feature largely dispositive.see lund,d at.in its view,the status as a member of the legislative body is a crucial and determinative difference.id.at.the district court decision has the practical effect of imposing a prohibition on prayer.
in reaching its conclusion,the district court observed that the supreme court has never before sanctioned prayers i t is telling that throughout its town of greece opinion and the opinion in marsh,the supreme court consistently discussed legislative prayer practices in terms of invited ministers,clergy,or volunteers providing the prayer,and not once described a situation in which the legislators themselves gave the invocation.id.at.in essence,the district court treated the supreme court jurisprudential silence on prayer as conclusively excluding legislators from being permissible to their own legislative bodies.that conclusion is not supportable.
while town of greece involved a rotating group of local clergy and marsh concerned a paid chaplain,the supreme court attached no significance to the speakers identities in its analysis and simply confined its discussion to the facts surrounding the prayer practices before it.see town of greece.at marsh,at.nowhere did the court say anything that could reasonably be construed as a requirement that outside or retained clergy are the only constitutionally permissible givers of legislative prayer.quite the opposite,town of greece specifically directs our focus to what has been done in congress and the state legislatures without any limitation regarding the officiant.id.at.we find the supreme court silence on the issue of prayer to be simply that silence.see united states stewart,cir.remarking it would be improper to draw any inference from the supreme court silence on an issue not placed before it.
nor has this court previously assigned weight to the identity of the.to the contrary,we have suggested this feature is irrelevant.for example,in wynne town of great falls,we remarked that p ublic officials brief invocations of the almighty before engaging in public business have always,as the marsh court so carefully explained,been part of our nation heritage,cir.similarly,joyner forsyth county observed that i t is the governmental setting for the delivery of sectarian prayers that courted constitutional difficulty,not those who actually gave the invocation.at see also id.at.and in simpson chesterfield county board of supervisors,we noted that the supreme court,neither in marsh nor in allegheny,held that the identity of the,rather than the content of the prayer,was what would affiliate the government with any one specific faith or belief.at.although these cases ultimately turned on the position that sectarian prayer was constitutionally invalid,none made the identity dispositive.
on a broader level,and more importantly,the very history and tradition anchoring the supreme court holding in town of greece underscores a practice not only of legislative prayer generally but of prayer specifically.opening invocations offered by elected legislators have long been accepted as a permissible form of religious observance.see,at commenting that the authors of the establishment clause did not intend to prohibit a just expression of religious devotion by the legislators of the nation,even in their public character as legislators emphasis added see also lynch,at.there is an unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all three branches of government of the role of religion in american life from at least.as just one example,the south carolina provincial congress south carolina first independent legislature welcomed an elected member to deliver its opening invocations.see south carolina provincial congress,thanks to the continental congress,last visited,and saved as ecf opinion attachment.the recognition of religion in these early public pronouncements is important,unless we are to presume the founders of the united states were unable to understand their own handiwork.myers loudoun cty.sch,cir.
this tradition of legislative prayer has continued to modern day.a majority of state and territorial assemblies honor requests from individual legislators to give an opening invocation.see national conference of state legislatures,inside the legislative process to,observing legislators may offer an opening prayer in at least states.prayer is especially prevalent in the states under our jurisdiction,where seven of the ten legislative chambers utilize elected members for this purpose.see br.for state of et as amici curiae supporting at addend.see also prayers offered in the north carolina house of representatives,last visited july.several of these states have enacted legislation recognizing the historical practice of legislative prayer.for example,a virginia statute protects legislators who deliver a sectarian prayer during deliberative sessions.see.code.and south carolina expressly authorizes its elected officials to open meetings with prayer.see code b see also.rule requiring the clerk of the michigan house of representatives to arrange for a member to offer an invocation at the beginning of each session.
prayer finds contemporary validation in the federal government as well.both houses of congress allow members to deliver an opening invocation.as recently as may,senator james lankford commenced legislative business in the senate with a prayer invoking the name of jesus.cong.rec.daily ed.may.the congressional record is replete with similar examples.see,cong.rec.daily ed.june,prayer by william cowan cong.rec.daily ed,prayer by john barrasso cong.rec.statement of william hudnut iii see also robert byrd,the senate addresses on the history of the united states senate wendy wolff,senators have,from time to time,delivered the prayer.
in view of this long and varied tradition of prayer,the district court judicial wall barring elected legislators from religious invocations runs headlong into the supreme court acknowledgement that a ny test we adopt must acknowledge a practice that was accepted by the framers and has withstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change.town of greece.at.as justice alito aptly explained,if there is any inconsistency between any establishment clause test and the historic practice of legislative prayer,the inconsistency calls into question the validity of the test,not the historic practice.id.at alito,concurring.heeding this advice,we decline to accept the district court view that legislative prayer forfeits its constitutionally protected status because a legislator delivers the invocation.a legal framework that would result in striking down legislative prayer practices that have long been accepted as part of the fabric of our society can not be correct.id.at.
in reaching its decision,the district court seems to have wholly ignored a foundational principle in town of greece.the principal audience for these invocations is not,indeed,the public but lawmakers themselves,who may find that a moment of prayer or quiet reflection sets the mind to a higher purpose and thereby eases the task of governing.id.at kennedy,plurality opinion.
not only are the legislators themselves the intended congregation for legislative prayer,but the practice carries special meaning to the thousands of state and local legislators who are citizen representatives.in this respect,the supreme court has specifically singled out members of town boards and commissions,who often serve and as volunteers,as lawmakers for whom ceremonial prayer may reflect the values they hold as private citizens.id.at.if legislative prayer is intended to allow lawmakers to show who and what they are in a public forum,then it stands to reason that they should be able to lead such prayers for the intended audience themselves.id.indeed,legislators are perhaps uniquely qualified to offer uplifting,heartfelt prayer on matters that concern themselves and their fellow legislators.
the district court determination that the fact that a legislator delivers a legislative prayer is a significant constitutional distinction,at least in the context of this case,was error.
we turn now to the question of whether some other facet of the board practice,beyond the bare fact that prayer is offered,takes this case outside the protective umbrella of legislative prayer.although the supreme court has not forged a comprehensive template for all acceptable legislative prayer,its decisions set out guideposts for analyzing whether a particular practice goes beyond constitutional bounds.see snyder,at marsh implicitly acknowledges some constitutional limits on the scope and selection of legislative prayers.
an initial guidepost relates to the selection of the content of legislative prayer.in rejecting the plaintiffs position that invocations must be nonsectarian,the supreme court in town of greece explained that such a rule would force the legislatures that sponsor prayers and the courts that are asked to decide these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech.at.such an outcome,the court continued,would involve government in religious matters to a far greater degree than is the case under the town current practice of neither editing or approving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content after the fact.id.
the district court determined the board practice was invalid under this standard because the individual commissioners author their own invocations,and by doing so act as supervisors of the prayers.lund,d at.it reasoned that the government is thus improperly delivering prayers that were exclusively prepared and controlled by the government.id.we disagree.the board practice here,where each commissioner gives their own prayer without oversight,input,or direction by the board simply does not present the same concerns of the government attempting to define permissible categories of religious speech.town of greece.at emphasis added.
what the supreme court has cautioned against in this context is for cing the legislatures that sponsor prayers to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech.id.emphasis added.to be sure,in offering the invocations the individual commissioners sometimes convey their personal alignment with a particular faith.but the court has always looked to the activities of the legislature as a whole in considering legislative prayer.this makes perfect sense for it is only through act of the deliberative body writing or editing religious speech that government would impermissibly seek to promote a preferred system of belief or code of moral behavior with selected content.town of greece.at.there is no evidence that the board,as a board,had any role in any of the prayers by the individual commissioners.the record is devoid of any suggestion that any prayer in this case is anything but a personal creation of each commissioner acting in accord with his or her own personal views.
in effect,each commissioner is a free agent like the ministers in town of greece and the chaplain in marsh who gave invocations of their own choosing.in other establishment clause contexts,the supreme court has stressed this element of private choice,holding that when a neutral government policy or program merely allows or enables private religious acts,those acts do not necessarily bear the state imprimatur.see zelman simmons harris,d school voucher programs mueller allen,d income tax deductions.as the supreme court stated in town of greece,o nce it invites prayer into the public sphere,government must permit a prayer giver to address his or her own god or gods as conscience dictates,unfettered by what an administrator or judge considers to be nonsectarian.at.
the board legislative prayer practice amounts to nothing more than an individual commissioner leading a prayer of his or her own choosing.
a second guidepost to acceptable legislative prayer discussed in town of greece concerns its content.after reaffirming the holding in marsh that lower courts should refrain from becoming embroiled in the review of the substance of legislative prayer,the supreme court noted that there could be certain circumstances where sectarian references cause a legislative prayer practice to fall outside constitutional protection.id.at.if the course and practice over time shows that the invocations denigrate nonbelievers or religious minorities,threaten damnation,or preach conversion,a constitutional line can be crossed.id.in that circumstance,the court observed,many present may consider the prayer to fall short of the desire to elevate the purpose of the occasion and to unite lawmakers in their common effort.id.
to this end,courts need only assure themselves that sectarian legislative prayer,viewed from a cumulative perspective,is not being exploited to proselytize or disparage.below this threshold,the supreme court has disclaimed any interest in the content of legislative invocations,announcing a strong disinclination to embark on a sensitive evaluation or to parse the content of a particular prayer.marsh,at.
the record in this case reflects that the board prayer practice did not stray across this constitutional line of proselytization or disparagement.see wynne,at to proselytize on behalf of a particular religious belief necessarily means to seek to convert others to that belief.the content of the commissioners prayers largely encompassed universal themes,such as giving thanks and requesting divine guidance in deliberations.references to exclusively christian concepts typically consisted of the closing line,such as in jesus name.amen.see supp.there is no prayer in the record asking those who may hear it to convert to the faith or belittling those who believe differently and even if there were,it is the practice as a whole not a few isolated incidents which controls.town of greece.at absent a pattern of prayers that over time denigrate,proselytize,or betray an impermissible government purpose,a challenge based solely on the content of a prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation.
the invocation delivered at the board october,meeting is illustrative of what the board members and the public in rowan county would hear 
let us pray.father we do thank you for the privilege of being here tonight.we thank you for the beautiful day you given us,for health and strength,for all the things we take for granted.lord,as we read the paper today,the economic times are not good,and many people are suffering and doing without.we pray for them we pray that you would help us to help.we pray for the decisions that we will make tonight,that god,they will honor and glorify you.we pray that you would give us wisdom and understanding.we thank you for it.in jesus name.amen.
supp.such prayer comes nowhere near the realm of prayer that is out of bounds under the standards announced in town of greece.prayers that chastise dissenters or attempt to sway nonbelievers press the limits of the supreme court instruction and may not merit constitutional protection,but no such prayers have been proffered in this case.see,snyder,at finding the plaintiff proffered prayers unconstitutional because they strongly disparage d other religious views and s ought to convert his audience.
plaintiffs call our attention to a few examples that contain more forceful references to christianity out of the hundreds of legislative prayers delivered before board meetings.as an initial matter,the sectarian content cited in plaintiffs opening brief and referenced by the dissent is austere and innocuous when measured against invocations upheld in marsh.see at.stevens,dissenting quoting an exemplar challenged prayer.regardless,plaintiffs hypersensitive focus is misguided.town of greece requires an inquiry into the prayer opportunity as a whole,rather than into the contents of a single prayer.at.absent a pattern of prayers that over time denigrate,proselytize,or betray an impermissible government purpose,a challenge based solely on the content of a prayer will not likely establish a constitutional violation.id.given the respectful tone of nearly all the invocations delivered here,which largely mirror those identified in town of greece,the board practice crossed no constitutional line.see id.at holding that a few stray remarks are insufficient to despoil a practice that on the whole reflects and embraces our tradition.
moving beyond the invocations themselves,a third guidepost to legislative prayer relates to the selection of the.in town of greece,the challenged practice resulted in a predominately christian set of ministers lead ing the prayer.id.the court found this fact unremarkable because t he town made reasonable efforts to identify all of the congregations located within its borders and represented that it would welcome a prayer by any minister or layman who wished to give one.id.so long as the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination,then the constitution does not require it to search beyond its borders for prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious balancing.id.
the district court found the board legislative prayer practice objectionable because the invocation opportunity was rotated among only the elected commissioners that is,all of the board members.according to the district court,w hen all faiths but those of the five elected commissioners are excluded,the policy inherently discriminates and disfavors religious minorities.lund,d at.marsh and town of greece reflect that the district court conclusion was mistaken.
the supreme court prohibition on discrimination in this context is aimed at barring government practices that result from a deliberate choice to favor one religious view to the exclusion of others.as explained in town of greece,concerns arise only if there is evidence of an aversion or bias on the part of town leaders against minority faiths in choosing the.at.the marsh court likewise alluded to this requirement when it cautioned that the selection of a guest chaplain can not stem from an impermissible motive.at.read in context,this condition appears directed at the conscious selection of the on account of religious affiliation.see id.at.
the district court opinion aims elsewhere,essentially mandating diversity.see lund,d at t he present case presents a of,leaving minority faiths with no means of being recognized.for example,under the district court framework,a legislature,including congress,would be prohibited from permitting individual members to deliver the opening invocation to solemnize its proceedings unless an unlimited number of faiths were actually represented by the elected representatives.but diversity among the beliefs represented in a legislature has never been the measure of legislative prayer.town of greece specifically rejected the notion that lawmaking bodies must promote a diversity of religious views.at.consequently,the town was not obliged to search beyond its borders for prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious balancing.id.and in marsh,the nebraska legislature appointed the same presbyterian minister for sixteen years to the exclusion of all other creeds.the court was unpersuaded that this made a constitutional difference.see marsh,at.
thus,while the board practice limits the represented faiths to those of the individual commissioners,that is no different from the limitations built into the constitutional prayer practices in town of greece and marsh.see simpson,at a party challenging a legislative invocation practice can not rely on the mere fact that the selecting authority chose a representative of a particular faith,because some adherent or representative of some faith will invariably give the invocation.there is simply no requirement in our case law that a legislative prayer practice reflect multiple faiths or even more than one to be constitutionally valid.
absent proof the board restricted the prayer opportunity among the commissioners as part of an effort to promote only christianity,we must view its decision to rely on prayer as constitutionally insignificant.see pelphrey cobb,cir.marsh does not require that all faiths be allowed the opportunity to pray.the standard instead prohibits purposeful discrimination.plaintiffs have not directed the court to any evidence that would suggest the board harbored such a motive.it is uncontested that the board policy was facially neutral and bereft of government discretion.a person of any creed can be elected to the board and is entitled to speak without censorship.furthermore,as far as we can tell,the board never altered its practice to limit a commissioner or attempted to silence prayers of any viewpoint.see lund,d at.
the supreme court has determined that the selection of a who represents a single religious sect,even over many years,does not advance any one faith or belief over another.see marsh,at.we can not,any more than members of the congresses of this century,perceive any suggestion that choosing a clergyman of one denomination advances the beliefs of a particular church.ctr.for inquiry,marion circuit court clerk,cir.marsh and greece show that a government may,consistent with the first amendment,open legislative sessions with christian prayers while not inviting leaders of other religions.a party challenging a legislative prayer practice can not rely on the mere fact that the selecting authority has confined the invocation speakers to a narrow group.this is particularly true here as the board has no voice in the selection of commissioners,which is entirely up to the citizens by election.
a final guidepost to legislative prayer is found in the statement from town of greece that the prayer practice over time may not be exploited to advance any one faith or belief.at.we must discern,then,whether over time the board practice conveys the view that rowan county advance d christianity over other creeds.id.
the board has not picked any of the prayers under its legislative prayer practice of ceremonial invocation by which the commissioners prayers solemnize their meeting.town of greece fully supports this approach,reaffirming the principle first set out in marsh that a governmental subdivision does not endorse any one faith or belief by opening its forum to prayers,even sectarian ones.see mccreary cty.am.civil liberties union of,d citing marsh as an example of a permissible governmental action whose manifest purpose was presumably religious.and this remains true even when sectarian religious content is communicated regularly.see galloway town of greece,cir.observing that r oughly of the prayers at issue in that case contained uniquely christian language,while t he remaining third of the prayers spoke in more generically theistic terms.
the prayers in this case,like those in town of greece,were largely generic petitions to bless the commissioners before turning to public business.references to christian concepts typically consisted of the closing statement in jesus name we pray,or a similar variation.supp.as town of greece imparts,such prayers do not unconstitutionally convey the appearance of an official preference for christianity.rather,o ur tradition assumes that adult citizens,firm in their own beliefs,can tolerate and perhaps appreciate sectarian ceremonial prayer.town of greece.at.
had a chaplain offered prayers identical to those in the instant case,town of greece and marsh would unquestionably apply to uphold the board practice.unlike the district court,we are unconvinced the feature of a legislator delivering the prayer to fellow legislators signals an unconstitutional endorsement of religion.
practically speaking,the public seems unlikely to draw a meaningful distinction between a chaplain and the legislative body that appoints him.such chaplains speak for the legislature.snyder,at lucero,concurring in judgment.they are in essence deputized to represent the governing body in this context.town of greece.at kagan,j,dissenting.consequently,when an elected representative underscores his alignment with a particular faith during the invocation,as is sometimes the case here,the risk of placing the government weight behind this view is the same as those practices upheld in marsh and town of greece.in other words,the degree of denominational preference projected onto the government with prayer is not significantly different from selecting denominational clergy to do the same.both prayers arise in the same context and serve the same purpose.
if anything,allowing the legislative body to collectively select a tenured chaplain as in marsh would seem to pose a greater problem.the presence of a single religious figure,particularly a paid state employee,seems more likely to reflect a perceived governmental endorsement of the faith that individual represents.yet,the supreme court has concluded this more obvious preference is not constitutionally significant.see rubin lancaster,cir.w hatever message nebraska might have conveyed through its practice of selecting,paying,and retaining for sixteen years a presbyterian chaplain who often delivered explicitly christian invocations,the supreme court concluded that the legislature had not advanced christianity.
legislative prayer is constitutionally acceptable when it fits within the tradition long followed in congress and the state legislatures.town of greece.at.the supreme court has observed that prayers offered within this tradition have a common theme and respectful tone they are given at the opening of legislative sessions,where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion.id.at.acceptable legislative prayer thus solemnize s the occasion and invites lawmakers to reflect upon shared ideals and common ends before they embark on the fractious business of governing.id.the record here reflects just such prayers.
we now turn to plaintiffs claims that the board legislative prayer practice is impermissibly coercive.the coercion test under the establishment clause reflects that the government violates the constitution if it compels religious participation.see allegheny,at.kennedy,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part.although spurned by the supreme court for some time,see sch.dist.of abington twp.schempp,d noting that free exercise cases were predicated on coercion while an establishment clause violation need not be,the coercion test gradually emerged as part of establishment clause doctrine in several decisions regarding prayer.see lee weisman,d striking down prayers at graduation ceremonies because the school district supervision and control places public pressure,as well as peer pressure,on attending students as real as any overt compulsion.santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe,d finding prayers at high school football games unconstitutionally coercive.
although previously unclear whether the coercion test applied beyond the schoolhouse,see sidney buchanan,prayer in governmental institutions the who,the what,and the at which level,temp,see also mellen bunting,cir.recognizing a gap in supreme court precedent with regard to secular expression not directed to children,town of greece settled that ambiguity by observing that a analysis applies to adults encountering religious observances in governmental settings.see.at kennedy,plurality opinion it is an elemental first amendment principle that government may not coerce its citizens to support or participate in any religion or its exercise.
the town of greece majority,however,was unable to settle on what constitutes coercion in the legislative prayer context.although five justices agreed that the town did not engage in an unconstitutional coercion,they reached this conclusion by separate paths.justices thomas and scalia would require coercion to consist of the coercive state establishments that existed at the founding,which essentially equates to religious observance by force of law and threat of penalty.town of greece.at thomas,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.justice kennedy,joined by chief justice roberts and justice alito,framed the inquiry as a one that considers both the setting in which the prayer arises and the audience to whom it is directed.id.at kennedy,plurality opinion.under this view,c ourts remain free to review the pattern of prayers over time to determine whether they comport with the tradition of solemn,respectful prayer approved in marsh,or whether coercion is a real and substantial likelihood.id.at.the history and tradition of legislative prayer is relevant here,too,and the reasonable observer is presumed to be aware of that history and recognize the purpose of such practices.id.at.
the district court divided its coercion analysis into two parts.first,it considered the issue under town of greece,concluding justice kennedy general rules for evaluating potential coercion in the legislative prayer context point the c ourt in the direction of finding the practice of the board unconstitutionally coercive.lund,d at.the district court then turn ed to the principles of the coercion doctrine developed prior to the town of greece decision,finding these cases likewise suggested the board violated the establishment clause.id.
as noted above,the supreme court coercion doctrine prior to town of greece developed in several cases involving public school events with children.the potential for undue influence,however,is less significant when dealing with prayer involving adults,and this distinction warrants a difference in constitutional analysis.the law recognizes a meaningful distinction between children in a school setting and a legislative session where adults are the participants.see stein plainwell cmty,cir.the potential for coercion in the prayer opportunity was one of the distinctions employed by the court in marsh to separate legislative prayer from classroom prayer.the supreme court assumes that adults are not readily susceptible to religious indoctrination or peer pressure.marsh,at.see also town of greece.at a dult citizens,firm in their own beliefs,can tolerate and perhaps appreciate a ceremonial prayer delivered by a person of a different faith.
consistent with this distinction,we do not find the supreme court prior coercion cases applicable in analyzing legislative prayer like that at issue here.see simpson,at marsh,in short,has made legislative prayer a field of establishment clause jurisprudence with its own set of boundaries and guidelines.thus,we look to the coercion analysis in town of greece,recognizing first that the board clearly did not engage in coercion under the view expressed by justices scalia and thomas.but we analyze the issue under the view more favorable to the plaintiffs as expressed in justice kennedy plurality opinion.under that approach,the court must conduct a inquiry consider ing both the setting in which the prayer arises and the audience to whom it is directed.town of greece.at kennedy,plurality opinion.
in upholding the invocation practice in town of greece,the supreme court plurality identified several red flags that could signal when a prayer exercise is coercive and thus not within the historical tradition of constitutionally protected legislative prayer.see id.at.specifically,the court explained that coercion may exist if town board members directed the public to participate in the prayers,singled out dissidents for opprobrium,or indicated that their decisions might be influenced by a person acquiescence in the prayer opportunity.id.at.the court also identified as problematic practice s that classified citizens based on their religious views or resulted in a pattern of prayers used to intimidate or chastise dissenters.id.
it is not difficult to understand why the court placed the coercion bar so high in this context.as noted,adults are not presumed susceptible to religious indoctrination or pressure simply from speech they would rather not hear.thus,there is limited risk that disenchanted listeners would be affected by mere contact with legislative prayer.adults often encounter speech they find disagreeable and an establishment clause violation is not made out any time a person experiences a sense of affront from the expression of contrary religious views.see also elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d,concurring in the judgment t he constitution does not guarantee citizens a right entirely to avoid ideas with which they disagree.
the district court erred in concluding the board prayer practice was coercive under this framework.the commissioners prayers neither chastised dissenters nor attempted lengthy disquisition on religious dogma.town of greece.at kennedy,plurality opinion.rather,as illustrated previously,the content largely followed the spirit of solemn,respectful prayer approved in marsh and town of greece.moreover,the record shows that both attendance and participation in the invocations were voluntary.the board has represented without contradiction that members of the public were free to remain seated or otherwise disregard the invocation in a manner that was not disruptive.thus,as a practical matter,citizens attending a board meeting who found the prayer unwanted had several options available they could arrive after the invocation,leave for the duration of the prayer,or remain for the prayer without participating just like the audiences in marsh and town of greece.and to the extent individuals like plaintiffs elected to stay,their quiet acquiescence would not,in light of our traditions,be interpreted as an agreement with the words or ideas expressed.town of greece.at kennedy,plurality opinion.
the record is similarly devoid of evidence that anyone who chose not to participate during the prayer suffered adverse consequences,that their absence was perceived as disrespectful,or was recognized by the board in any way.to the contrary,the board has attested that such conduct would have no impact on the constituent right to fully participate in the public meeting,including addressing the commission and participating in the agenda items in the same matter as permitted any citizen of rowan county.plaintiffs point us to no evidence to the contrary.thus,it is implausible on this record to suggest that plaintiffs were in a fair and real sense coerced to participate in the board exercise of legislative prayer.lee,at.
plaintiffs allegations that the prayer practice made them feel subjectively excluded at meetings and that the board disagreement with their public opposition to sectarian prayer could make them less effective advocate s does nothing to change the outcome.lund,d at.town of greece explicitly rejected the claim that a citizen perceived subtle pressure to participate in prayers that violate their beliefs in order to please the board members from whom they are about to seek a favorable ruling constitutes coercion.at kennedy,plurality opinion.this is true even where the legislative body may know many of their constituents by name,making anonymity less likely for those citizens who decline to rise or otherwise participate in the invocation.id.likewise,merely exposing constituents to prayer they find offensive is not enough.i n the general course,legislative bodies do not engage in impermissible coercion merely by exposing constituents to prayer they would rather not hear and in which they need not participate.id.at.
to be sure,legislative prayer may stray across the constitutional line if town leaders allocate benefits and burdens based on participation in the prayer,or that citizens were received differently depending on whether they joined the invocation or quietly declined.id.at.but there must be evidence in the record to support allegations of that sort.there is no such evidence in this case.
plaintiffs make several arguments in support of the district court coercion ruling.they first claim that the prayer practice here was an external act focused on the broader public,which has a type of coercive power that the internally directed prayers in town of greece did not.response br.plaintiffs point to several invocations where the commissioners offered prayers on behalf of others as well as themselves.this evidence,in plaintiffs view,shows that the commissioners did not consider the prayer practice an internal act directed at one another,but rather,that it is also directed toward citizens and for the benefit of all.id.at.
town of greece notes the internal or external nature of a prayer practice in determining whether impermissible coercion occurred.see.at kennedy,plurality opinion the principal audience for these invocations is not,indeed,the public but lawmakers themselves,who may find that a moment of prayer or quiet reflection sets the mind to a higher purpose and thereby eases the task of governing.the supreme court rationale here is obvious.the probability of coercion can be heightened should the prayers be directed at those in attendance.plaintiffs argument,however,posits that any prayer referencing a person or concern beyond the members of the legislative body is externally directed and thus prohibited.that can not be.legislative prayer does not lose its constitutionally protected status because it includes a request for divine protection for persons other than those serving in office,such as our troops overseas or first responders.the supreme court has never required such a purpose.indeed,the prayers in town of greece contained similar expressions focused at persons other than fellow legislators.see id.at.the fact that individual commissioners here sometimes prayed that god bless,protect,and heal wounded soldiers in iraq and injured police officers does not take the prayers outside the realm of constitutionally protected legislative prayer 
plaintiffs next argue that the commissioners unacceptably directed public participation in the prayers.to reiterate,the board opening ceremony usually began with the chairperson asking everyone to stand for the invocation and pledge of allegiance.lund,d at.the designated commissioner would then offer an invocation that typically started with let us pray or please pray with me.id.plaintiffs maintain that these statements amount to unconstitutional coercion.the district court agreed,concluding the commissioners statements fall squarely within the realm of soliciting,asking,requesting,or directing,and thus within the territory of concern in town of greece.id.at.
again,we disagree.similar invitations have been routinely offered for over two centuries in the congress,the state legislatures,and countless local boards and councils.no case has ever held such a routine courtesy opening a legislative session amounts to coercion of the gallery audience.it would come as quite a shock to the founders if it had.
when the supreme court in town of greece expressed concern about direct ing the public to participate in the prayers,it did not have the foregoing in mind.at kennedy,plurality opinion.coercion is measured against the backdrop of historical practice.id.at.as a practice that has long endured,legislative prayer has become part of our heritage and tradition similar to the pledge of allegiance or inaugural prayer.id.it is presumed that the reasonable observer is acquainted with this tradition and understands that its purposes are to lend gravity to public proceedings and to acknowledge the place religion holds in the lives of many private citizens.id.viewed through this lens,no reasonable person would interpret the commissioners commonplace invitations as government directives commanding participation in the prayer.the phrase let us pray is a familiar and almost reflexive call to open an invocation that hardly compels in the rational mind thoughts of submission.id.at alito,concurring.the same goes for the board request for audience members to stand.we may safely assume that mature adults,like plaintiffs,can follow such contextual cues without the risk of religious indoctrination.see marsh,at.telling here is plaintiffs own evidence,which indicates that some portion of the audience often chose not to participate.see noting only most of the audience stood.in sum,opening a legislative prayer with a short invitation to rise and join hardly amounts to orchestrat ing the performance of a formal religious exercise in a fashion that practically obliges the involvement of.myers,at.
lastly,plaintiffs claim they were singled out for opprobrium by board members signaling their disfavor of those who did not fall in line.response br.plaintiffs cite to several public statements where acting commissioners were critical of those in the religious minority.see,lund,d at.jim sides i am sick and tired of being told by the minority what best for the majority.my friends,we come a long way the wrong way.we call evil good and good evil.even giving these comments the weight plaintiffs would like,which is itself doubtful because most came and in response to other issues having nothing to do with legislative prayer,they are insufficient to carry the day.such isolated incidents do not come close to showing,as town of greece requires,a pattern of prayers that over time denigrate,proselytize,or betray an impermissible government purpose.at.indeed,the comments cited here are not materially different from those referenced in town of greece,where several invocations referred to prayer opponents as the minority and ignorant.id.a few stray remarks are simply insufficient to despoil a practice that on the whole reflects and embraces our tradition.id.
participation in the board opening ceremony,including the invocation,is voluntary.yet the district court concluded that plaintiffs are subject to unconstitutional coercion because they claim to be compelled and coerced based on their subjective speculation about how their abstention might be received.that conclusion can not be reconciled with town of greece and its rejection of the notion of coercion of adults in similar circumstances.town of greece identified a narrow range of exceptional circumstances that could render a legislative prayer practice coercive and outside the historical tradition of invocations that comport with the establishment clause.the board legislative prayer practice is not close to crossing that constitutional line.
none of the constitutional contentions raised by the plaintiffs have validity under the facts of this case for the reasons set out above.similarly,even taking all the plaintiffs claims as an amalgamated whole,they do not reflect a meritorious claim for the same reasons such claims failed in marsh and town of greece.
the board legislative prayer practice falls within our recognized tradition and does not coerce participation by nonadherents.it is therefore constitutional.the district court erred in concluding to the contrary.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint.
reversed and remanded with directions 
welcome to the meeting of the rowan county board of commissioners.as many of you are aware,we customarily begin these meetings with an invocation.those who deliver the invocation may make reference to their own religious faith as you might refer to yours when offering a prayer.we wish to emphasize,however,that members of all religious faiths are welcome not only in these meetings,but in our community as well.the participation of all our citizens in the process of will help our fine county best serve the good people who live here.
message of religious welcome 
the message actually delivered in this case was not one of welcome but of exclusion.that is a pity,because even a brief prefatory statement akin to that above might have helped to set a different tone for the meetings here while not requiring the judiciary to police the content of legislative prayer.
religious faith is not only a source of personal guidance,strength,and comfort.its observance is also a treasured communal exercise which serves in times of need as the foundation for mutual support and charitable sustenance.but when a seat of government begins to resemble a house of worship,the values of religious observance are put at risk,and the danger of religious division rises accordingly.affidavits of nancy lund,liesa,and robert voelker.this,i respectfully suggest,is what is happening here.it can not be right.this case is more than a factual wrinkle on town of greece galloway,d.it is a conceptual world apart.
rowan county prayer practice featured invocations week after week,month after month,year after year,with the same sectarian references.to be sure,town of greece ruled that sectarian prayer is not by itself unconstitutional.at.but the issue before us turns on more than just prayer content,the primary concern in town of greece.whereas guest ministers led prayers in that case,it was public officials who exclusively delivered the invocations in rowan county.those prayers served to open a meeting of our most basic unit of government,a local board of commissioners that passes laws affecting citizens in the most daily aspects of their lives.the prayers,bordering at times on exhortation or proselytization,were uniformly sectarian,referencing one and only one faith though law by definition binds us all.
i have seen nothing like it.this combination of legislators as the sole,official invitation for audience participation,consistently sectarian prayers referencing but a single faith,and the intimacy of a local governmental setting exceeds even a broad reading of town of greece.that case in no way sought to dictate the outcome of every legislative prayer case.nor did it suggest that no constraints remain on prayer content.id.at.the establishment clause still can not play host to prayers that over time denigrate nonbelievers or religious minorities,threaten damnation,or preach conversion.id.to assess those risks,c ourts remain free to review the pattern of prayers over time.id.at.
above all,the supreme court stressed that t he inquiry into legislative prayer remains a one that considers both the setting in which the prayer arises and the audience to whom it is directed.id.at emphasis added.the parties have not cited any legislative prayer decision combining the particular speakers,audience involvement,prayer content,and local government setting presented here.rowan county counsel conceded during oral argument that this case is without precedent.oral argument at,lund rowan cty.i am left to wonder what limits,if any,to sectarian invocations at meetings of local government appellants would be prepared to recognize.
no one disputes that localities enjoy considerable latitude in opening their meetings with invocations and prayers.but the legislative prayer practice here pushes every envelope.i would not welcome this exceptional set of circumstances into the constitutional fold without considering its implications.a ruling for the county bears unfortunate consequences for american pluralism,for a nation whose very penny envisions one out of many,a nation whose surpassing orthodoxy belongs in its constitutional respect for all beliefs and faiths,a nation which enshrined in the first and fourteenth amendments the conviction that diversity in all of its dimensions is our abiding strength.
though the majority treats this case as all but resolved by town of greece,that decision did not touch upon the combination of factors presented here,particularly the question of prayer.indeed,prayers by public officials form a distinct minority within establishment clause case law.the great majority of legislative prayer cases have not involved legislators at all,but invocations by guest ministers or local religious leaders,marsh chambers,d invocation by a chaplain paid by the state at the opening of state legislative sessions joyner forsyth,cir.prayers by leaders of local congregations at county commission meetings.the invocations in town of greece were likewise delivered solely by ministers from local congregations.at.nearly all the congregations were christian,and every minister selected during an period came from that faith.id.but crucially,no public officials delivered prayers or influenced their content in any way.id.as the district court noted,town of greece consistently discussed legislative prayer practices in terms of invited ministers,clergy,or volunteers providing the prayer,and not once described a situation in which the legislators themselves gave the invocation.lund,d at.
by contrast,the only eligible at rowan county commission meetings were the five board commissioners,each of whom took up the responsibility in turn.not only did they lead the prayers,but they also composed all the invocations according to their personal faiths,which were uniformly christian denominations.id.at affidavits of the five rowan county commissioners.compared to town of greece,the much greater and more intimate government involvement by the rowan county board led the district court to find its prayer practice unconstitutional.lund,d at.
of course,the prayer practice was not infirm simply because it was led by the commissioners.as the majority and the states amicus brief rightly remind,there exists a robust tradition of prayers delivered by legislators.according to a national survey and amici own research,all but two state legislative bodies engage in legislative prayer or a moment of silence.br.of amici curiae state of west virginia and other states at.lawmakers lead at least some legislative prayers in just over half of those states,including seven of the ten state legislative chambers within our circuit.id.at.many county and city governments also call upon elected officials to give prayer.id.at.
the tradition of prayer by legislators is but one indicator of how unrealistic it would be to divorce democratic life from religious practice.we see their intertwined nature whenever candidates for all levels of political office proclaim their faith on the campaign trail.voters may understandably wish to factor the religious devotion of those they elect into their political assessments.it could not be otherwise.as justice william douglas aptly observed,we are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a supreme being.zorach clauson.
the supreme court thus recognized that a moment of prayer or quiet reflection sets the mind s of legislators to a higher purpose and thereby eases the task of governing.town of greece.at.the solemnizing effect for lawmakers is likely heightened when they personally utter the prayer.in deference to that purpose,i would not for a moment cast all prayer as constitutionally suspect.as the supreme court has emphasized,l egislative prayer lends gravity to public business,reminds lawmakers to transcend petty differences in pursuit of a higher purpose,and expresses a common aspiration to a just and peaceful society.id.at.
prayers delivered by legislators,however,are themselves quite diverse.we can not discern from the general survey proffered by amici which prayers were primarily for the benefit of legislators or commissioners as in town of greece and which focused,as the prayers did here,on requesting the citizens at the meeting to pray.nor do we know from the survey what percentage of prayers given by elected officials generally contain sectarian references or proselytizing exhortations,or which are or delivered by legislators of diverse faiths.and in fact,the very survey on which the majority and amici rely takes care to note that highly sectarian prayers represent not only a breach of etiquette,but also an insensitivity to the faith of others.national conference of state legislatures,inside the legislative process hereinafter ncsl survey see op.at br.of amici curiae state of west virginia and other states at.further,the survey cautions,the should be especially sensitive to expressions that may be unsuitable to members of some faiths.ncsl survey at.
we should focus then not on any general survey but on the interaction among elements specific to this case legislative exclusively of one faith,legislative invitation to the citizens before them to participate,and exclusively sectarian prayers referencing a single faith in every regular meeting of a local governing body over a period of many years.at a certain point,the interaction of these elements rises to the level of coercion that town of greece condemned.id.at.
i shall discuss each of the aforementioned elements in turn,beginning with the fact that the commissioners themselves delivered the invocations.prayer,when combined with the other elements,poses a danger not present when ministers lead prayers.the rowan county commissioners,when assembled in their regular public meetings,are the very embodiment of the state.from november,when the county began recording its board meetings,to the start of this lawsuit in march,out of meetings,or,began with legislators delivering prayers explicitly referencing christianity.lund,d at see also lee weisman,d defining sectarian prayer as us ing ideas or images identified with a particular religion.the vast majority of those prayers closed with some variant of in jesus name.transcript of all rowan county prayers on record.only four invocations,given by the same commissioner,were,and no prayer mentioned a religion other than christianity in years,lund,d at.
the five commissioners,all christian,maintain ed exclusive and complete control over the content of the prayers.lund,d at.at times,the prayers seemed to blend into their legislative role.as one commissioner put it,lord,we represent you and we represent the taxpayers of rowan county.when the state rep
