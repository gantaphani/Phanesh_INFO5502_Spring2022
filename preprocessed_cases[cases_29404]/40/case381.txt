appellant overseas military sales corporation,omsc,a government contractor operating at fort buchanan,puerto rico,seeks reversal of the district court order dismissing its complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the department of consumer affairs of the commonwealth of puerto rico daco from enforcing puerto rico consumer protection law against it.this appeal is unopposed.in fact,the commonwealth of puerto rico concedes that the position taken by omsc is correct.nevertheless,omsc urges us to decide this case and to issue a fully reasoned opinion reaching the merits of its claim.we decline to do so.in light of the commonwealth concession,this case has become moot.we therefore dismiss this appeal and vacate the district court judgment.
appellant omsc serves as an intermediary through which authorized customers working on military bases may purchase automobiles from manufacturers that have contracted with the united states army and air force exchange service aafes under this arrangement,omsc administers the aafes vehicle program,accepting orders from authorized customers and relaying them to the manufacturers.this case arises from a dispute between omsc and ernesto,who purchased an automobile from omsc at fort buchanan in puerto rico.all relevant parties stipulated before the district court that fort buchanan is a federal enclave under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the united states government.
on march,nieves filed an administrative complaint against omsc with daco,alleging that the vehicle he had purchased from omsc was defective.daco has the authority to adjudicate consumer disputes under puerto rico law and may refer complaints to other puerto rico agencies or to the federal government.laws ann.tit.
before daco took action on nieves complaint,omsc filed a suit in federal district court in august seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against nieves and noema,in her capacity as secretary of daco.omsc argued that the federal enclave doctrine barred daco from adjudicating nieves complaint and that had violated that doctrine by allowing nieves complaint and others like it to be brought before daco.
the federal enclave doctrine provides that t he congress shall have power t o exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever,over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be,for the erection of forts,magazines,arsenals,and other needful buildings.const.art.i,cl.in addition,a provision in article iv states in relevant part the congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states,art.iv,cl.accordingly,omsc argued that neither puerto rico consumer protection laws nor daco authority to resolve disputes under that law applied to consumer complaints arising from activities at fort any complaints against omsc.omsc filed an emergency request for a preliminary injunction to prevent nieves from proceeding with his particular claim and to bar daco from exercising jurisdiction over omsc in any further complaints against it.
the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge.after an evidentiary hearing,the magistrate judge recommended denying the preliminary injunction for three reasons.first,she found that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claim under the doctrine second,she found omsc claim barred by principles of claim and issue preclusion.finally,she found that,even if the court could consider omsc petition,omsc was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its claim.see esso std.oil,cir.the magistrate judge based this assessment on her view that the federal enclave doctrine permitted the application of state law to activities on federal enclaves except where federal and state law conflict.the magistrate judge found no conflict between federal and state law in this instance.
the district court subsequently issued a decision adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation in its entirety and denying omsc motion for a preliminary injunction less than a month later,the district court sua sponte entered an order dismissing the entire case for the reasons stated in its prior opinion and order.omsc timely filed this appeal,challenging the order dismissing the case.
two months after omsc filed its brief in this court,the parties filed a joint motion informing the court that they had settled the case.the settlement agreement explained that the parties had agreed to abide by the agreed opinion and order attached to this settlement agreement as though it were properly and duly issued by the united states court of appeals for the first circuit.it also explained that 
the parties agree that the agreed opinion and order shall have preclusive effect under the doctrines of res judicata,collateral estoppel,issue preclusion,the doctrine as to all issues described therein.the parties agree that any and all decisions,opinions,or judgments entered in the district court opinion and order shall not have any preclusive effect under the doctrines of res judicata,collateral estoppel,issue preclusion,and the parties have agreed to voluntarily set aside all decisions,opinions and judgments entered in the district court opinion and order.
the settlement agreement also made it clear that settlement was conditional on this court approval 
the parties will jointly request that this settlement agreement be approved by the united states court of appeals for the first circuit.to ensure the enforcement of this settlement agreement,the parties will further request the united states court of appeals for the first circuit to issue the injunction order attached as exhibit b.the parties agree and understand that an injunction order by the united states court of appeals for the first circuit shall have preclusive effect under the doctrines of res judicata,collateral estoppel,issue preclusion.should the united states court of appeals for the first circuit decide not to approve this settlement agreement or deny the parties request that it enter the order attached to this settlement agreement as exhibit b,the parties will continue with the appeal until the united states court of appeals for the first circuit rules on the merits of the appeal.
emphasis added.an proposed order discussing and confirming the merits of omsc claims was attached as exhibit a and a injunction order permanently enjoining daco from exercising jurisdiction over omsc operations within fort buchanan was attached as exhibit 
we did not approve the settlement agreement or the attached orders.our order denying the joint motion explained 
t heir settlement agreement,if approved by this court,would effectively reverse the judgment of the district court.generally,we are not at liberty to vacate the judgment of the district court on the basis of a settlement,let alone to reverse it.see bancorp mortgage bonner mall partnership,d vacatur is generally not justified when the party seeking relief from the judgment below caused the mootness by voluntary action in settling the case.
the order went on to state our denial is without prejudice to the parties requesting vacatur of the district court judgment by filing in the district court a joint motion pursuant to.b in an effort to preserve settlement.instead of pursuing this suggested course of action in the district court,omsc chose to continue with its appeal in the hope of obtaining from us a decision on the merits that mirrored the decision that it had asked us to adopt on the basis of its settlement with the secretary.
shortly in response to an order alerting appellees that they would not be heard at oral argument because they had failed to timely file a submitted an informative motion explaining this failure g iven that appellee has attempted to settle this case and,indeed,concedes that appellant arguments are correct as a matter of law,it is unnecessary to file our brief in the instant case.three days before we heard oral argument in this case,the new secretary of the department of consumer affairs,alejandro garc√≠a padilla,filed an urgent informative motion
