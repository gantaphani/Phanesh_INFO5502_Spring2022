officer ray appeals a district court order denying his motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity concerning amanda smith excessive force claim.finding no error,we affirm.
in reviewing the denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity,we accept as true the facts that the district court concluded may be reasonably inferred from the record when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.waterman batton,cir.to the extent that the district court has not fully set forth the facts on which its decision is based,we assume the facts that may reasonably be inferred from the record when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.id.application of these rules produces the following facts 
on the afternoon of september,officer ray,a uniformed police officer for the city of virginia beach,was assisting private citizen tony bullard in finding,who bullard had represented was his missing juvenile stepson.bullard and ray had information that was at a house on marlewood way,which was an area with a high occurrence of criminal activity involving juveniles.when they arrived there,they looked through a window and saw several young men standing inside the residence.bullard tentatively identified one of the young men as ray then knocked on the door of the house and heard scurrying sounds coming from inside.
smith opened the main door of the home.when ray instructed her to come outside,she opened the screen door and stepped out.both doors closed behind her.
at that point,smith was standing on the front stoop,which was two or three steps up from the ground and which extended about one foot wider than the front door on each side.ray asked smith a few questions,as bullard stood a few steps back.smith answered all of ray questions clearly and cogently.he first asked her name and age and whether she owned the home.smith told ray her first name and that she was years old,and she explained that she did not reside in the home.ray then asked if was inside,and smith answered that he was not.
ray next asked if joel,an adult acquaintance of,was in the home.smith told ray that joel was there and that she would get him.she asked ray to hold on,as she turned back toward the door.as she opened the screen door,ray reached over her right shoulder and slammed the door shut.startled,smith took a single step away from the house off the small stoop but did not turn her back to ray.according to smith,ray grabbed her arm with no verbal communication.smith pulled her arm away,and,facing ray,asked what he was doing.rather than responding verbally,ray tried to grab smith again,and she again pulled her arm away.in the process of pulling away and asking what ray was doing,smith called ray who is white a n however,she did not turn away from ray or run.
rather than explain his actions,ray grabbed smith and threw her to the ground.when she hit the ground,he jumped on her,jamming his full weight into her back with his knee,and painfully twisting her right arm behind her back.
at that point,ray ordered smith to show him her arms.ray already had her right arm,however,and smith was using her left arm to press against the ground to try to relieve pressure from her chest so that she could breathe.as smith resisted ray attempts to force her to submit,ray continued to demand that she show her hands,and she repeatedly responded that she needed to keep her arm under her to breathe because he was pressing down so hard on her.ray subsequently punched her three times in her right side to try to gain her compliance.he then succeeded in yanking her left arm around and handcuffing her once she was handcuffed,he grabbed her ponytail and yanked her to her feet by her hair,ripping chunks of hair from her scalp.
at some point during this struggle,a small pocketknife fell to the ground from smith sweatshirt,although ray did not notice the knife until smith was standing and in handcuffs.throughout the encounter,smith never struck out at ray,and ray never explained that smith was subject to an investigative detention or under arrest.
ray brought smith to his police car,searched her,and put her into the back seat.he eventually drove her to the police station.she was taken before a magistrate and charged with obstruction of justice and unlawfully carrying a concealed weapon.
as a result of ray actions,smith suffered visible bruising and a broken rib,and she also complains of continuing shoulder pain and limited range of motion due to the arm twisting.she further claims that she suffered psychological injuries.
smith brought suit in virginia state court alleging multiple claims against ray and another unknown officer,and the case was removed to federal district court.the somewhat complicated procedural history of this case and smith other claims and the factual basis therefor are fully explained in our opinion disposing of a prior appeal and in the district court app x,wl,at cir smith ray,d.the only claims remaining at this stage of the litigation,however,are smith claim against ray for excessive force and her claim against ray for assault and battery.see smith,d at.both parties moved in the district court for summary judgment on these claims,with ray seeking summary judgment on the claim on the basis of qualified immunity.the district court denied both motions.see id.
in denying ray motion,the court noted that smith was not suspected of any crime prior to the encounter,ray had no arrest warrant,and smith was lawfully on the porch of the private residence.see id.at.viewing the record in the light most favorable to smith,the court added that she was not intoxicated,or belligerent,and that ray did not learn that she was carrying a knife until after she was in handcuffs.id.the court concluded that,in light of these facts,a reasonable jury could find that ray employed excessive force in detaining smith.see id.considering the state of the law as it existed at the time of the incident,the court also determined that any reasonable officer in ray position would have known that the force used was excessive.see id.at.
on appeal to us,ray argues that the district court erred in denying his summary judgment motion concerning the claim.we disagree.
we review de novo a district court decision to deny a summary judgment motion asserting qualified immunity.see danser stansberry,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
the doctrine of qualified immunity balances two important need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment,distraction,and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.pearson callahan,d.it gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments,and protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.stanton sims,d per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.
in determining whether an officer is entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity,courts engage in a inquiry see tolan cotton,d per curiam.the first asks whether the facts,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,show that the officer conduct violated a federal right.see saucier katz,d.when a plaintiff has alleged that an officer employed excessive force in making an arrest,the federal right is the fourth amendment right against unreasonable seizures.see tolan.at.
the second prong of the inquiry asks whether the right was clearly established at the time the violation occurred such that a reasonable person would have known that his conduct was unconstitutional.see ridpath board of governors marshall,cir.we do not require a case directly on point in order to conclude that the law was clearly established so long as existing precedent has placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.ashcroft,d.
an order denying summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine because qualified immunity provides not only immunity from liability,but also immunity from suit.see mitchell forsyth,d.however,the conclusion of the district court that a disputed issue of fact exists as to a particular point is not appealable under the collateral order doctrine.see behrens pelletier,d.rather,on appeal from the denial of summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity,we merely decide whether on the facts assumed by the district court for summary judgment purposes,the defendant was entitled to qualified immunity.see id.
a claim that a police officer employed excessive force is analyzed under the fourth amendment under an objective reasonableness standard.henry purnell,cir en banc.the officer actions do not amount to excessive force if they are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him,without regard to his underlying intent or motivation.graham connor,d.in considering the reasonableness of an officer actions,we must consider the facts at the moment that the challenged force was employed.see henry,at.
evaluating the reasonableness of the officer actions requires a careful balancing of the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual fourth amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.graham,at internal quotation marks omitted.to properly consider the reasonableness of the force employed we must view it in full context,with an eye toward the proportionality of the force in light of all the circumstances.artificial divisions in the sequence of events do not aid a court evaluation of objective reasonableness.waterman,at internal quotation marks omitted.we also must give careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case,including three factors in particular the severity of the crime at issue,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.graham,at.ultimately,the question to be decided is whether the totality of the circumstances justifie s a particular sort of seizure.tennessee garner,d.
here we conclude that the district court properly denied ray summary judgment motion.the facts of this case are strikingly similar to those we considered in rowland perry,cir.in that case,a police officer witnessed a woman drop a bill in a bus station and saw rowland,a year old,mildly retarded man,pick it up without returning it.id.at.the officer approached rowland and told him to return the money to the woman who had dropped it.see id.rowland walked over to the woman and offered it to her but she stated that it was not hers.see id.rowland then left the bus station.see id.
rowland was standing at a street corner when the officer approached,and rowland never attempted to flee.see id.without being provoked,the officer grabbed rowland collar,jerked him around,and yelled at him.see id.at.frightened by the sudden assault,rowland instinctively tried to escape the officer grasp.see id.the officer responded by punching rowland and throwing him down,throwing his weight against rowland right leg and wrenching the knee until it cracked,tearing rowland anterior cruciate ligament.id.
as is relevant here,we reviewed a denial by the district court of the officer motion for summary judgment on rowland claim on the basis of qualified immunity.the officer argued that we should take a segmented view of the sequence of events and hold that each step taken by the officer was reasonable based on rowland immediately preceding actions.id.at.we rejected this approach,however,concluding that it miss es the forest for the trees.id.rather,we determined that t he better way to assess the objective reasonableness of force is to view it in full context,with an eye toward the proportionality of the force in light of all the circumstances.id.
viewing the officer actions in this manner,we concluded that the crime at issue was a minor one and that there was no evidence that the relatively passive,retarded man was a danger to the larger,trained police officer.id.at.we also noted that rowland maintain ed that he resisted only to the extent of instinctively trying to protect himself from the defendant onslaught.id.with the graham factors so unfavorable to the officer,we concluded that the district court properly determined that he was not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.see id.
a similar analysis leads to the same conclusion in the present case regarding the first graham factor,severity of the suspected crime,at the time ray grabbed smith arm without explanation,he at most had reason to suspect that she may be guilty of the misdemeanor of contributing to the delinquency of a minor,see smith,fed.app x at,wl,at concluding that a reasonable officer would have had a basis for suspecting that smith was contributing to the delinquency of a minor.as in rowland,this nonviolent misdemeanor offense was not of the type that would give an officer any reason to believe that smith was a potentially dangerous individual.see young county of los angeles,cir while the fact that young was suspected only of misdemeanor offenses weighs against a finding that the use of significant force against him was justified,it is ultimately the nonviolent and relatively minor nature of his suspected offenses that is of more importance.parker gerrish,cir though driving while intoxicated is a serious offense,it does not present a risk of danger to the arresting officer that is presented when an officer confronts a suspect engaged in an offense like robbery or assault.
the second graham factor,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,weighs even more strongly in smith favor.ray is a pretty good size man,while smith is a smaller woman.see also j.smith testimony that she was being attacked by a something pound man.ray did not have any reason to believe that smith was armed.and,up to the point that ray grabbed smith,smith had answered ray questions clearly and cogently and given no indication that she was at all inclined to cause him any harm or that she had any capacity to do so,especially with bullard standing only a few steps away.
the third graham factor,whether the suspect was actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight,also strongly favors smith.before ray slammed the screen door shut,smith had been fully compliant and responsive to ray instructions and questions.even when ray surprised her by slamming the screen door closed,she took only a single step back off of the small stoop in front of the door.in so doing,she neither turned her back to ray,nor attempted to flee.when ray grabbed smith without warning or explanation,smith reaction,like rowland,was to instinctively attempt to pull herself from his grasp.but even at this point,she did not strike at ray,attempt to flee the scene,or even turn her back to him.rather,she simply pulled her arm away and,as she stood facing him,demanded angrily to know what he was doing.
ray argues that he reasonably perceived smith to be attempting to flee.even assuming arguendo that he might have reasonably perceived her as attempting to flee in the moment in which she took one step off of the stoop,she took no further steps after that one,and remained facing ray as she demanded an explanation for why he was trying to grab her.a reasonable jury could find that at that moment any perception by ray that smith had attempted or was attempting to flee would have been unreasonable.see tolan.at on appeal of grant of summary judgment on basis of qualified immunity,holding that court must draw inferences in favor of plaintiff where officers testimony concerning what they perceived was at odds with testimony of other witnesses regarding how dark the area was,whether a woman spoke to officers in an agitated tone,whether her son was screaming,whether his words amounted to a threat,and whether the son was looking as if he was going to move forward to intervene in an officer altercation with his mother.
especially in light of rowland,no reasonable officer could have believed that,rather than answer the previously compliant young woman legitimate ques
