the grand jury in the eastern district of virginia charged the rosen,the director of foreign policy issues at the american israeli public affairs committee aipac,and keith weissman,the senior middle east analyst in aipac foreign policy issues violations of the espionage act.the operative indictment,returned as a superseding indictment on august,asserts that between and,the defendants obtained national defense information from various sources within the united states government and unlawfully passed that information to other aipac staffers,foreign officials,and members of the news media in this interlocutory appeal,the government challenges the district court pretrial evidentiary rulings on the handling at trial of classified information.the defendants have moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.as explained below,we deny the motion to dismiss and affirm the challenged evidentiary rulings.
the district court evidentiary rulings were made pursuant to the classified information procedures act,app.cipa as we have recognized,cipa is merely a procedural tool requiring a pretrial court ruling on the admissibility of classified information.united states smith,cir.cipa a defines c lassified information,in pertinent part,as any information or material that has been determined by the united states government pursuant to an executive order,statute,or regulation,to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national security.
as relevant here,if a defendant expects to disclose or cause the disclosure of classified information at trial or in a pretrial proceeding,he is required,pursuant to cipa a,to notify the district court and the government of the potential disclosure.under cipa a,the government may then request the court to conduct a hearing to make all determinations concerning the use,relevance,or admissibility of classified information a request that the court must fulfill if the court authorizes disclosure of classified information,the government may then move,under cipa c,that the court order,inter alia,the substitution for such classified information of a summary of the specific classified information.the court must conduct a hearing on any cipa c motion,and it shall grant such a motion if it finds that the summary will provide the defendant with substantially the same ability to make his defense as would disclosure of the specific classified information.the government is entitled,pursuant to cipa,to pursue an interlocutory appeal from any ruling of the court authorizing the disclosure of classified information.see united states fernandez,cir recognizing that cipa allows appeals from adverse cipa a and c rulings.finally,cipa a prohibits a defendant from disclosing classified information until proper notice has been given,the government has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to seek a cipa determination from the court,and the government time to initiate a cipa appeal from any such determination has expired.
here,rosen and weissman gave notice to the district court and the government,pursuant to cipa a,that they expected to disclose at trial a large volume of classified information.the government promptly moved,pursuant to cipa a,for a hearing on the use,relevance,and admissibility of the classified information at trial.the court,after conducting such a cipa hearing,determined that a substantial volume of the classified information was indeed relevant and admissible.
as a result of the district court rulings,the government sought permission,pursuant to a motion filed under cipa c,to introduce substitutions for many of the classified documents that had been deemed relevant and admissible.the government proposed to create the substitutions by redacting and otherwise summarizing classified information in the original documents.during a cipa hearing conducted over the course of days in to address the government c motion,the court ruled that,although some of the government proposed redactions were acceptable,other such redactions would not afford the defendants the same opportunity to defend themselves as would the admission of the unredacted documents containing classified information.in some instances,the court concluded that less extensive redactions,or the use of replacements for particular names,places,or terms,would adequately protect the defendants rights while simultaneously offering adequate protection for classified information.the court thus directed the parties to fashion substitutions for the classified documents in accordance with the oral rulings it made during the hearing.thereafter,the court entered an order adopting the parties substitutions,over the government objection.see united states rosen,under seal the cipa order.
the government has timely noted this interlocutory appeal,pursuant to cipa,challenging the district court cipa order with regard to two specific documents the fbi report and the israeli briefing document.the defendants have moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
in disposing of this appeal,we must first assess the defendants motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.in this regard,rosen and weissman contend that the government lacks authorization under cipa to pursue such an interlocutory appeal for two reasons.first,the defendants assert that the government has failed to establish,as an essential predicate for this appeal,that the substitutions for the fbi report and the israeli briefing document contain classified information.second,the defendants maintain that the government was obtain the imprimatur of the heads of the agencies charged with responsibility for the classified information before noticing the appeal.we address these aspects of the defendants cipa jurisdictional contention in turn.
the first aspect of the defendants jurisdictional contention is premised on their assertion that the government has failed to establish that the substitutions for the fbi report and the israeli briefing document contain classified information.as background,both the fbi report and the israeli briefing document were produced by the government during discovery.with respect to the fbi report,the government contended that weissman disclosed the report existence and disclosed that the report is redacted,and that the information disclosed by weissman was classified.the government provided notice to the defendants that it intended to use the report at trial to establish these contentions,even though there is no allegation that weissman actually received the report,or that he ever disclosed the report itself.in response,the defendants provided notice that they,too,intended to use the report at trial,seeking to show that the report was not classified on the basis of the information weissman disclosed rather,the report was classified to protect sensitive details regarding sources and methods,details that were neither known to nor disclosed by weissman.
after the district court deemed the fbi report to be relevant and admissible,the government sought to redact the information in the report relating to sources and methods.in response,the defendants contended that such redactions would deprive them of their ability to put on their defense.now that the district court,by its cipa order,has adopted the parties substitutions for the report,the defendants argue that the substitutions may not contain classified information.as such,according to the defendants,the government should be required to go back through the appropriate classification procedures before pursuing this interlocutory appeal.
with respect to the israeli briefing document,although the government produced the document in discovery,it does not plan to introduce it at trial.the defendants,however,intend to use the document to support their assertion that redacted,and that their disclosure of that information was accordingly not a violation of.the district court initially concluded that the document was not relevant and,thus,was not admissible.on reconsideration,however,the court ruled that the document was both relevant and admissible.the court then permitted the government to offer a redacted document for us
