opinion of the court 
we consider the scope of individual liability under the trust provision of the perishable agricultural commodities act paca,c.appellants,producers of perishable agricultural commodities,argue that,as an officer of ellis fleisher produce fleisher produce,jacqueline fleisher is individually liable to them under paca for money owed by the corporation the district court disagreed,holding that fleisher was not secondarily liable to trust creditors under paca because she was not actively involved in running the corporation.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of no liability.
in,paca was enacted to deter unfair business practices and promote financial responsibility in the perishable agricultural goods market,paglia,cir.it provided that no person shall at any time carry on the business of a commission merchant,dealer,or broker without a license valid and effective at such time.a.in,paca was amended to allow for a floating trust for the protection of producers and growers.id.at the trust provision provided as follows 
perishable agricultural commodities received by a commission merchant,dealer,or broker in all transactions,and all inventories of food or other products derived from perishable agricultural commodities,and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of such commodities or products,shall be held by such commission merchant,dealer,or broker in trust for the benefit of all unpaid suppliers or sellers of such commodities or agents involved in the transaction,until full payment of the sums owing in connection with such transactions has been received by such unpaid suppliers,sellers,or agents.
c.this provision seeks to protect sellers of fresh fruits and vegetables who were unsecured creditors and receive d little protection in any suit for recovery of damages where a buyer ha d failed to make payment as required by the contract,at quoting,reprinted in.the amendment provide d a remedy by impressing a trust in favor of the unpaid seller on the inventories of commodities and products derived therefrom and on the proceeds of sale of such commodities and products in the hands of the commission merchant,dealer,or broker.id.quoting.the produce purchasers are require d to hold sufficient paca trust assets in trust to pay all suppliers.consumers produce volante wholesale produce,cir.in order to preserve trust benefits,a n unpaid produce supplier or seller must give written notice of its intent to preserve to the produce dealer,broker,or commission merchant.id.at citing c.
t he trust provision provides unpaid suppliers with priority over secured lenders with regard to paca trust assets held in trust by produce purchasers.id.at emphasis in original.federal district courts are vested with jurisdiction specifically to entertain i actions by trust beneficiaries to enforce payment from the trust,and ii actions by the secretary of agriculture to prevent and restrain dissipation of the trust.c.
the theme of the paca trust devolves to this to benefit producers of perishable agricultural items sold nationally to consumers,paca places duties on those entrusted with such items for licensed sellers,or middlemen between producers and prefer the producers over others.in the event of a breach of those duties,liability attaches first to the licensed seller of perishable agricultural commodities.if the seller assets are insufficient to satisfy the liability,others may be found secondarily liable shepard fruit vegetable,see also fresh source produce,cir same sunkist growers,fisher,cir same.
individual liability is not derived from the statutory language,but from common law breach of trust principles,at see also nickey gregory,llc agricap,llc,cir general trust principles govern paca trusts unless the principle conflicts with paca.sunkist,at ordinary principles of trust law apply to trusts created under paca.under the common law,the trustee of a trust is under a duty to the beneficiary in administering the trust to exercise such care and skill as a man of ordinary prudence would exercise in dealing with his own property,at quoting shepard.at.following these basic trust principles,a n individual who is in the position to control the paca trust assets and who does not preserve them for the beneficiaries has breached a fiduciary duty,and is personally liable for that tortious act.id.quoting morris okun,harry zimmerman,second alteration in original see also austin wakeman scott,william franklin fratcher mark ascher,scott and ascher on trusts i f the trustee has misappropriated trust funds due to a beneficiary,the trustee is liable in an action at law.
ii.facts procedural history 
fleisher produce was a wholesale produce dealer in philadelphia.from through february,the corporation was operated at least on paper by a husband and wife team ellis and jacqueline fleisher.fleisher produce then went out of business.when it did so,it owed appellants payments for produce supplied between may and march.
under paca,appellants became beneficiaries of a statutory trust consisting of all of the corporation assets.they properly preserved their status as trust beneficiaries under paca.after fleisher produce failed to pay appellants for their produce,they filed this action to enforce fleisher produce trust obligations.not only did they sue fleisher produce,but ellis and jacqueline fleisher as well.
in march,the district court entered an order for a preliminary injunction.this provided all related creditors with an opportunity to intervene in this action and assert their respective claims.in october,the court ordered pro rata distribution of the available trust assets to the valid paca trust creditors.it found that fleisher produce jointly and severally with other responsible parties owed appellants approximately.at the same time,fleisher produce had only in trust assets remaining.it then sold its warehouse,which netted around.there was thus no dispute that fleisher produce corporate assets were insufficient to meet all outstanding paca trust claims.
the district court granted summary judgment against fleisher produce and ellis fleisher,holding both liable for the paca shortfalls.at the same time,the court denied appellants motion for summary judgment against jacqueline fleisher.in its order,the court began by conceding that we the third circuit court ha d not produced a clear,rule for determining when liability attache d under paca.nevertheless,it concluded that related precedent from our court,as well as from our sister courts of appeals,consistently expressed concern that liability only be imposed where involvement with the corporation is sufficient to establish some significant relationship between the individual and the corporation.it added that o nly if the plaintiff can demonstrate that such a relationship existed through evidence of active involvement,not simply evidence that the defendant was in a position of control,can the individual be held legally responsible for acting on behalf of the corporation.emphases added.
the district court then held a bench trial on the issue of fleisher individual liability under paca,describing the main issue as whether jacqueline fleisher is secondarily liable for plaintiffs claims under paca.following the trial and an additional round of briefing the court concluded that,although fleisher was an employee of the company for a time,the facts showed that she was not involved in any of the fundamental business decisions,and that there was no evidence that she had any managerial role in the operation of the company.it added that,even assuming that fleisher was a director officer during the relevant periods of time,there is no evidence that she was actively involved in running the corporation.in this context,she was not secondarily liable under paca.
appellants then filed a timely notice of appeal in that appeal,they focus solely on fleisher status as an officer,and not on any claim relating to whether she was a director of fleisher produce.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under c i.we have jurisdiction under.
to the extent that the issues on appeal involve questions of law,we exercise de novo review.tracinda daimlerchrysler ag,cir.to the extent that the district court made findings of fact,we review them for clear error.id.
iv.analysis 
whether jacqueline fleisher is individually liable under paca turns not on whether she nominally held an officer or,if argued,director position,nor even the size of her shareholding,but whether she had the authority to direct the control of,manage paca assets held in trust for the producers.if so,she is secondarily liable for breaching the duty to preserve the paca trust.if not,then only the corporation itself and fleisher were responsible for the breach and therefore liable for the shortfall under paca.the test for individual liability thus continues,as each case depends on facts found by the trier at trial or the district court at summary judgment when there is no genuine issue of material fact.
fleisher involvement with the corporation is a matter of considerable dispute.indeed,the parties can not even agree on whether fleisher was an officer of the corporation during the relevant time period,to say nothing of the legal analysis that should follow once her formal status is settled.appellants argue that fleisher was an officer throughout the relevant time period and that,as a corporate officer,she was necessarily in a position to control the paca trust assets.indeed,when and fleisher set up the corporation bank signature cards,she signed as fleisher produce vice to say nothing of other documents that list her as its secretary and treasurer.fleisher counters that she was an officer only until june.in addition,she contends that,regardless of her formal title,she was not in a position to control the paca trust assets during the relevant time period.
we conclude that,no matter fleisher title s or ownership status during the relevant time period,the evidence presented at trial established that she did not possess the power to manage plaintiffs paca assets.supporting this conclusion is that,among other things,the district court found that all management decisions were made by fleisher,aided by his office manager estelle matsinger.in this context,we hold that fleisher is not secondarily liable for the remaining shortfall under paca 
paca trust liability and the position of control test 
we have only addressed individual liability under the paca trust provision in one previous.there,the paca creditors sued an individual officer and shareholder for allegedly breach ing his fiduciary duty under the paca trust provision,at we began our analysis by acknowledging that w e ha d not previously decided whether an individual corporate officer can be held liable for breaching his or her fiduciary duty to protect paca trust assets.id.at.from there,we explained that the other courts of appeals to have considered this issue concluded that individual liability does exist in certain circumstances.id.at emphasis added.we then agreed to follow those courts,and h e ld that individual officers and shareholders,in certain circumstances,may be held individually liable for breaching their fiduciary duties under paca.id.at the same time,we did not specify what those certain circumstances might be 
this appeal affords us the opportunity to consider one such circumstance when an officer also a shareholder is found not to have actual control over the management by the corporation of paca products.since offers us few clues on how to address such a circumstance,we turn to the guidance available from other courts of appeals.see coosemans specialties,gargiulo,cir patterson frozen foods,crown foods int l,cir,hiller cranberry,koplovsky,cir sunkist growers,although they have not addressed a circumstance precisely like ours,they have each adopted a similar rule for assessing generally claims of secondary liability under paca i ndividual shareholders,officers,or directors of a corporation who are in a position to control trust assets,and who breach their fiduciary duty to preserve those assets,may be held personally liable under paca,at emphasis added see also coosemans,at similar test sunkist growers,at same.
this case also presents the imprecision of a test an individual held one or more officer titles and was a shareholder,but the evidence indicates she had no actual control over paca trust assets.appellants argue for a rule if an individual is an officer,director,or shareholder of a corporation,then she is by that fact in a position to control the paca trust assets.on this view,position is to be understood as meaning just formal position within the corporation.context should not matter.
needless to say,this is a temptingly simple approach.yet we choose to reject it in favor of an approach that is more sensitive to how each corporation is actually managed,as we conclude that context should matter in these circumstances.importantly,such a contextual approach finds support in the decisions of other courts of appeals 
take,for instance,the ninth circuit court decision in sunkist growers.there,a husband and wife were a corporation officers,directors,and sole shareholders who allegedly controlled its operations.sunkist growers,at.a citrus producer brought a federal action claim ing that the husband and wife,as fiduciaries,had breached their duties to maintain the paca trust assets and pay the producer.id.the ninth circuit court concluded that the defendants may be individually liable under paca,but not because of their formal titles.instead,it explained that a court considering the liability of an individual under paca may look at the nature of the corporation,the individual active management role,and any evidence of the individual acting for the corporation.id.at quoting frio ice sunfruit.it then remanded to the district court to apply the appropriate test in the first instance.context mattered.
similarly,in hiller cranberry products,the first circuit court noted that paca imposes liability on a controlling person of th e corporation,who uses the trust assets for any purpose other than repayment of the supplier.at quoting morris okun.at emphasis added.this case involved a suit against an individual who was the president and sole shareholder of the produce dealer.id.at.it resulted in a remand to the district court to assess the potential liability of the individual defendant.context again came into play.
the fifth circuit court decision in is not to the contrary.there,the court concluded that the defendant sole shareholder was liable under paca because he manifestly had absolute control of the corporation,at.though the defendant maintain ed that he was a passive shareholder,his position as the sole shareholder meant that he could not escape liability based on a real or claimed failure to exercise his right and obligation to control the company.id.given his position,the defendant refusal or failure to exercise any appreciable oversight of the corporation management was a breach of his fiduciary duty to preserve the trust assets.id.context once again individual defendant three was necessarily responsible for oversight of the corporation management.id.he could control entrusted assets 
taken together,these cases suggest a test whether ascribed as position of control or otherwise that takes into account formal position s but relies primarily on context.it calls on courts to determine whether an individual holds a position that suggests a possible fiduciary duty to preserve the paca trust assets,officer,director,controlling shareholder and assess whether that individual involvement with the corporation establishes that she was actually able to control the paca trust assets at issue the ability to control is core.a formal title alone is when faced with a small,mom and pop corporation such as fleisher produce,where formalities may be less meaningful.
we turn now to fleisher involvement with fleisher produce and apply this test shorn only of its possibly misleading name.
applying the test to fleisher 
fleisher situation presents a close question under this contextual approach.although there is some dispute whether she was an officer of the corporation,we assume without deciding that she was during the relevant time per
