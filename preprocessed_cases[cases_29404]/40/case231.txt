factual background 
for the purpose of background,we recite here some of the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.visible.unisys,cir we recount the trial evidence in more detail when we analyze defendants challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.
served as an executive secretary to luisa flores,director of public works,from until her transfer in.in the course of processing incoming mail,noticed that flores was receiving tickets to political fundraisers and invitations to meetings for the popular democratic party pdp,the party to which the mayor and flores belonged.was concerned that the receipt of this material violated ethics rules prohibiting the use of government resources to further political campaigns.nevertheless,she duly logged the materials and delivered them to flores.
on two occasions in,raised her concerns with flores about the receipt of political materials in the office.flores ignored her complaints and continued to receive political materials sometimes,she stapled political fundraiser tickets to office employees paychecks.next raised her concerns with roberto carrasquillo,a distant relative and municipal assemblyman for the puerto rican independence party pip.carrasquillo confirmed the merits of her concerns and reported the matter to the puerto rico government ethics office.carrasquillo also denounced the practice in press releases,newspaper columns,and media interviews.
on december,was summoned to appear before the ethics office,where she provided sworn testimony regarding her complaint.as part of its investigation,the ethics office issued summonses to a number of other municipal employees,including flores,who notified mayor that she had been summoned.
on february,flores had a discussion with,unrelated to the ethics office investigation,about the assignment of a particular job task.left the office upset and did not come to work the following day.when she returned on february,she had a heated discussion with flores about the missed day of work.shortly after that discussion,fainted and required medical treatment on the recommendation of her doctor,she rested at home for several weeks.on february,she delivered a copy of her medical release to human resources and then met with vice mayor puig to discuss her absence and planned return to work.she returned to work several days later,on february or.
on the morning of her return,called puig office to explain that she was back at the public works office.she was instructed to leave public works and report to human resources,where she was informed that she would be transferred to another department.after initial assignment to the education department,which had no work or space for her,was transferred to federal funds.she had not requested a transfer and asked to return to her position in public works.although retained the same job title and salary in federal funds,her job responsibilities were significantly reduced.
attempted reinstatement 
on march,wrote a letter to human resources requesting a written explanation for her transfer in the months that followed,her attorney,eladio cartagena,wrote three letters on her behalf to mayor,who had the final authority to transfer and reinstate municipal employees.cartagena first letter to the mayor,dated march,requested reinstatement to public works and suggested that her transfer was motivated by the ethics office complaint.cartagena received a reply from human resources dated march that began,the william miranda marín,mayor,has referred to us your letter dated march,concerning the transfer of.the letter stated that the transfer had been made at request,that it was considered a temporary transfer,and that we would have no inconvenience in newly reinstating to her former position in public works.
cartagena sent a second letter to the mayor on april requesting the offered reinstatement.a copy of the letter was also sent to heriberto martínez,director of the legal advisor office.in a conversation on april,martínez informed cartagena that reinstatement was pending and there would be a meeting between the personnel department and supervisor in public works,flores.cartagena sent a third letter to dated may,informing him that,on the basis of the offered reinstatement,had met with the interim human resources director and the director of public works and they had refused to reinstate her.the may letter further notified the mayor of intention to file a civil action based on the retaliatory transfer and refusal to reinstate her.
later that year,in september,happened upon mayor in a public square.she approached him,grabbed his arm,shook him,and asked about her case.he asked what was happening to her.before she could elaborate,she was escorted away by his assistants.
in october,filed a petition against the municipality and flores in the superior court of puerto rico cartagena spoke to the press about the suit,explaining allegations that she had been unlawfully transferred in retaliation for her ethics office complaint.responded to claims in a television interview.
on june,wrote to a final time,complaining that she lacked significant work responsibilities and was depressed.she entreated him to resolve her complaint and reinstate her to her former position.she was never reinstated to her position at public works.she remained in her position at federal funds until sometime in,when she was transferred to the department of building conservation.
procedural history 
on november,filed this action in federal court against the municipality,mayor,and vice mayor puig.she alleged that the defendants transferred and refused to reinstate her because of her political affiliation and in retaliation for her testimony before the ethics office,in violation of the first amendment and puerto rico law.she brought her federal law claims pursuant to,and.
in august,the district court granted partial summary judgment to defendants,dismissing political discrimination claim and her claims under and.in december,proceeded to trial on her surviving retaliation claim.in a pretrial evidentiary ruling,the court ruled that cartagena march,april and may letters to the mayor,and the march letter in response,could be offered as evidence only for the limited purpose of negating defendants contention that plaintiff herself requested a transfer,and not as evidence of the mayor knowledge of claim.at the close of case,the court granted judgment as a matter of law to in his personal capacity under federal rule of civil procedure a,concluding that the remaining evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that the mayor knew of employment situation,and therefore he could not be held personally liable for her transfer or nonreinstatement.
at the trial conclusion,the jury found in favor of puig,rejecting claim that the vice mayor had taken an adverse employment action against her.however,the jury found that she had established municipal liability for that adverse employment action and awarded her in damages.the court granted the municipality judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b,finding the verdict inconsistent with theory at trial that municipal liability derived from puig retaliatory acts 
on appeal,we affirmed the jury verdict in favor of puig,but held that the court erred in dismissing the case against based on its erroneous limitation on the use of the letters between attorney cartagena and the mayor.rodríguez ii,at.as we explained,if the letters had been correctly admitted as evidence of his knowledge of complaint and the mayor personal involvement in addressing it,she would have had a basis for arguing that the mayor knew about and was directly involved in the disposition of her transfer and the failure to remedy it.id.at.we therefore granted request for a new trial against the mayor and,because municipal liability could be premised on the mayor liability,against the municipality as well.id.at.
prior to the start of the second trial,and the municipality hereafter,defendants filed a motion in limine requesting that the jury be instructed that puig took no adverse employment action against,based on the jury verdict in the first trial.the court denied the motion.defendants also filed a motion in limine arguing that should be barred from presenting a claim under puerto rico law,laws ann.tit,because,inter alia,she had waived that claim by not pursuing it in the first trial.law,which prohibits discrimination against employees for offering testimony before a legislative,administrative or judicial forum,provides that t he employer liability regarding the damages and the unearned salaries shall be double the amount determined as having caused the violation of this provision.laws ann.tit,a,b.the court denied the motion,concluding that could proceed to trial on her law claim.
at the close of case,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under rule a,which the court denied.the jury returned a verdict in her favor against both the mayor and the municipality and awarded in compensatory damages for emotional pain and suffering.the court doubled the damages award pursuant to law,issuing a judgment against defendants in the amount of.
in motions,defendants challenged both the verdict and the damages award.defendants filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule b,contending that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of liability as to either the mayor or the municipality.defendants also moved for a new trial and for remittitur of the damages award under federal rule of civil procedure,contending that the court erred in refusing to give the requested jury instruction as to puig and that the damages award was excessive.finally,defendants moved to alter or amend the judgment under rule e on the ground that had waived her law claim and therefore the court should not have doubled the jury award 
the court denied defendants motions for judgment as a matter of law,a new trial,and remittitur,but granted their motion under rule e on the ground that had waived her law claim.accordingly,it entered an amended judgment in the amount of.
and the municipality appeal,contending that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding of liability,the court erred in failing to give the requested jury instruction as to puig,and the damages award was grossly excessive.as a result,defendants argue,the court erred in denying their motions under rules b and for judgment as a matter of law,a new trial,and remittitur,contending that she did not waive her law claim and therefore the court erred in granting defendants rule e motion to amend the judgment.

sufficiency of the evidence 
defendants contend that the court erred in concluding that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the jury finding that defendants retaliated against her for speaking out against the receipt of political materials in her office 
public employees do not lose their first amendment rights to speak on matters of public concern simply because they are public employees.curran cousins,cir.instead,t he first amendment prevents the government,except in the most compelling circumstances,from wielding its power to interfere with its employees freedom to believe and associate,or to not believe and not associate.rutan repub.party of.we have articulated a test for determining whether a challenged employment action violated a public employee first amendment right to freedom of speech.first,the court examines whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.curran,at quoting garcetti ceballos.second,the court must balance the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.id.at quoting pickering bd.of.third,the employee must show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.id.at.if the employee demonstrates that the speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the employer retaliatory action,the employer may avoid liability by showing that it would have reached the same decision even absent the protected conduct.id.this is the healthy defense.see healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle.
defendants primarily contend that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to support the jury finding that suffered an adverse employment action sufficient to support her claim,defendants would not have taken the same adverse employment action in the absence of her protected conduct,the mayor is personally liable for retaliation under,and the municipality is liable under.we address each challenge in turn 
adverse employment action 
actions short of dismissal or demotion,including denials of promotions,transfers,and failures to recall after layoff,can constitute adverse employment actions.rutan,at see also power,cir.employment actions are sufficiently adverse to support a first amendment claim if those actions,objectively evaluated,would place substantial pressure on even one of thick skin to conform to the prevailing political view.bergeron cabral,cir quoting,cir en banc,abrogated on other grounds by maldonado fontanes,cir.this standard is met when the employer challenged actions result in a work situation unreasonably inferior to the norm for the position,at see also id.at,explaining that factfinder must canvass the specific ways in which the plaintiff job has changed and determine whether the employee has retained duties,perquisites and a working environment appropriate for his or her rank and title.
emphasizing that did not receive a reduction in salary or change in job title when she was transferred to federal funds,defendants contend that the evidence does not support a finding that her transfer and nonreinstatement amounted to an adverse employment action.we disagree.although she retained the same job title and salary after her transfer to federal funds,her job duties and working environment were substantially altered.in public works,a large,active office,had a variety of job responsibilities including logging incoming mail,maintaining the director schedule,organizing files,taking dictation,creating letters,and working with other departments on human resources and administrative matters.after her transfer to federal funds,a small office that already had an executive secretary,had few tasks assigned to her.although she occasionally scanned the newspaper for announcements of federal funds proposals,opened incoming mail,made photocopies,or answered the phone if the other executive secretary was absent,she spent most of her time doing nothing.she could not assist in many office tasks,such as performing internet searches and taking dictation in english,because she was not proficient in english,and she could not compete for employment awards or bonuses because she performed few job duties.in addition,she was assigned to work in a windowless storage area alongside cleaning materials and inactive files.a reasonable jury could conclude that these assignments and working conditions were unreasonably inferior to the norm for position of executive secretary 
healthy defense 
defendants do not contend that failed to establish that her protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.instead,they argue that no reasonable jury could have rejected their healthy affirmative defense.a defendant seeking the protection of the healthy defense bears the burden of persuasion to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the adverse employment action would have been taken even in the absence of the protected conduct.guilloty perez pierluisi,cir quoting healthy,at.thus,even if the defendant actions were motivated in part by the plaintiff protected conduct,the defendant can still prevail if he or she can show that the protected conduct was not the cause of the adverse action,cir.
defendants argue that the evidence conclusively established that would have been transferred even absent her involvement in the ethics office investigation.their healthy defense relies primarily on testimony from vice mayor puig.puig testified that in early february,came to his office distraught and informed him that she had had a heated argument with flores and did not want to return to public works and that,for health reasons,her doctor had recommended that she be transferred out of that department.puig further testified that he then arranged for her transfer to accommodate this request.presented a different account of her transfer.she testified at trial that she had not requested the transfer,her doctor had not recommended it for health reasons,and she preferred to stay in her position in public works.she also offered the letters she and her attorney had sent to human resources and mayor shortly after her transfer,which sought an explanation for the transfer and requested reinstatement to her position in public works.given this conflicting evidence,a reasonable jury could find that testimony before the ethics office,and not her purported transfer request,was the cause of the transfer we conclude that the jury could reasonably reject defendants healthy defense 
personal liability of mayor 
although government officials may not be held liable for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior,sanchez,quoting ashcroft iqbal,officials may be held liable if the plaintiff can establish that her constitutional injury resulted from the direct acts or omissions of the official,or from indirect conduct that amounts to condonation or tacit authorization,rodríguez ii,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.under either a direct or indirect theory of liability,the plaintiff must show that the official had actual or constructive notice of the constitutional violation.id.citing lipsett of,cir an important factor in making the determination of liability is whether the official was put on some kind of notice of the alleged violations,for one can not make a deliberate or conscious choice to act or not to act unless confronted with a problem that requires the taking of affirmative steps.
defendants maintain that the mayor can not be held personally liable because he knew nothing about ethics office complaint,her claim that she was transferred in retaliation for that complaint,or her request for reinstatement until after this action was filed in federal court.however,ample evidence supports a finding to the contrary.the jury heard evidence that attorney sent at least three letters to regarding her transfer and request for reinstatement,dated march,april,and may.human resources responded to the march letter,stating that the letter had been referred by the mayor and that would be reinstated.in addition,herself sent a letter to the mayor dated june,again complaining of her transfer and requesting reinstatement.defendants insist that the mayor never personally received any of these letters,pointing to evidence that correspondence addressed to the mayor was routinely diverted to the appropriate municipal office or department before reaching him.however,as we determined in rodríguez ii,whether the mayor personally received the letters sent to him is a factual question appropriate for jury determination,id.at,and here the jury heard the evidence and rejected the mayor claim of lack of notice.
furthermore,apart from letters to the mayor,the record contains additional evidence that the mayor was aware of the ethics office investigation,her claim of retaliatory transfer,and her request for reinstatement.sometime after testified before the ethics office in december,flores informed that she had been summoned by the ethics office,and the mayor offered to help her secure legal representation.in september,confronted the mayor in a public square,grabbed him,and asked what he intended to do about her case.in october,filed a lawsuit against the municipality in superior court,alleging that her transfer and nonreinstatement were in retaliation for her ethics office complaint.shortly thereafter,the mayor commented on lawsuit in a television interview although the mayor testified at trial that he remained unaware of employment situation or the subject of her complaint despite these events,the jury was free to reject that testimony.
thus presented,the evidence adduced at trial is sufficient to sustain the imposition of liability on the mayor for his own direct acts or omissions with respect to nonreinstatement.see id.a reasonable jury could find that had knowledge of the ethics office investigation,had knowledge of claim that she was transferred and deprived of duties in retaliation for her testimony before the ethics office,and received her repeated requests for reinstatement.moreover,as mayor,had final authority over transfers and reinstatements of municipal employees.nevertheless,the mayor declined to reinstate to her position in public works in response to her repeated requests.
liability of the municipality 
as with government officials,a municipality can not be held liable for the constitutional violations of municipal employees on a respondeat superior theory.monell dep t of soc.instead,liability attaches to a municipality under only if the violation occurs pursuant to an official policy or custom.welch ciampa,cir.a plaintiff can establish an official policy by showing that the alleged constitutional injury was caused by a person with final policymaking authority.see also rodríguez ii,at it is well established that the deliberate acts or omissions of a municipal policymaker with final authority over the subject matter in question may expose the municipality itself to liability.although liability may not be imposed on a municipality for a single instance of misconduct by an official without final policymaking authority,liability may be imposed on a municipality for a single decision by a final policymaker.welch,at citing pembaur city of cincinnati,
we have recognized on a number of occasions that mayors in puerto rico are the government officials ultimately responsible for employment decisions of the municipality.rodríguez ii,at quotation marks and citations omitted see also monroig,cir noting that under puerto rico law,mayors of municipalities have the power to appoint and remove municipal officials and employees,and thus mayor employment decisions ipso facto constituted the official policy of the municipality internal quotation marks and citation omitted.therefore,liability can be imposed on the municipality for own direct acts or omissions with respect to 
requested jury instruction as to vice mayor puig 
recounting what happened in the first jury trial in this case,defendants contend that the court erroneously declined to instruct the jury in the second trial that vice mayor puig had not taken an adverse employment action against.following that first trial,in which puig and the municipality were defendants,the jury rejected claim that the vice mayor had taken an adverse employment action against her.presented with a special jury verdict form that asked,did plaintiff establish by preponderance of the evidence that defendant wilfredo puig took adverse employment action against her,the jury answered in the negative.prior to the second trial,defendants and the municipality invoked collateral estoppel and moved that the court instruct the jury that puig took no adverse employment action against.the court denied the motion in limine in a thorough written order,concluding that the requested instruction would likely confuse and unduly influence the jury and would not promote judicial economy because closely related issues remaining in the case would require that much of the same evidence be presented to the jury.
collateral estoppel,now often called issue preclusion,prevents a party from relitigating issues that have been previously adjudicated.enica principi,cir.the doctrine serves the twin goals of protecting litigants from the burden of relitigating an identical issue and promoting judicial economy by preventing needless litigation.parklane hosiery shore.collateral estoppel may be applied where the issue sought to be precluded in the later action is the same as that involved in the earlier action the issue was actually litigated the issue was determined by a valid and binding final judgment and the determination of the issue was essential to the judgment.ramallo.printing,el dia,cir.
in the past,courts adhered to the doctrine of mutuality of estoppel,which ordained that unless both parties or their privies in a second action are bound by a judgment in a previous case,neither party nor his privy in the second action may use the prior judgment as determinative of an issue in a second action,at quoting labs.of.however,mutuality is no longer strictly required for the application of collateral estoppel in federal courts.fiumara fireman fund ins,cir.instead,the central question is whether a party has had a full and fair opportunity for judicial resolution of the same issue.id.nonmutual collateral estoppel may be invoked either offensively,by a plaintiff who seeks to foreclose the defendant from litigating an issue the defendant has previously litigated unsuccessfully in an action with another party,or,as in this case,defensively,by a defendant who seeks to prevent a plaintiff from asserting a claim the plaintiff has previously litigated and lost against another defendant.parklane hosiery,at see id.at.we have also recognized that collateral estoppel is no longer limited to ultimate issues necessary intermediate findings can now be used to preclude relitigation.biggins hazen paper,cir see also restatement second of judgments,cmt.j.
makes two arguments in support of the court decision not to apply collateral estoppel.first,she argues that collateral estoppel can not be applied in this case because the parties in the two proceedings were not identical.this argument is foreclosed by the precedent permitting defensive nonmutual collateral estoppel.second,argues that the issue litigated and decided in the first trial,whether vice mayor puig took an adverse employment action against her,is not the same as the issue to be decided in the second trial,whether mayor is personally liable for the alleged retaliation.
as we explained in rodríguez ii,could be held liable either based on his own direct acts or omissions,that is,his direct participation in the unconstitutional conduct,or based on his indirect condonation or tacit authorization of unconstitutional conduct by his subordinates.at internal quotation marks omitted see also whitfield,cir.a finding of liability under the former theory,that directly participated in the refusal to reinstate,would not depend in any way on whether the vice mayor took an adverse employment action against her.however,a finding of liability under the latter theory,that condoned or tacitly authorized an adverse employment action taken by a subordinate such as vice mayor puig,could require the jury to decide precisely the same issue that was decided by the jury in the first the vice mayor took an adverse employment action against.
here,although the special verdict form used in the second trial does not indicate whether the jury found liable on a direct or indirect theory of liability,we can be reasonably sure that the jury found the mayor liable on a direct liability theory theory of liability at the second trial was that was directly involved in her nonreinstatement,not that the mayor condoned or tacitly authorized any alleged adverse action by puig.she offered evidence that had the ultimate authority to transfer and reinstate municipal employees,knew that she had been transferred in retaliation for her ethics office complaint,knew of her repeated requests for reinstatement,and nevertheless refused to reinstate her.she did not offer any evidence that puig received her requests for reinstatement or was involved in the decision not to reinstate her.as the trial court explained in its order denying defendants motion for a new trial 
defendants overstate the importance of puig actions as they relate to plaintiff theory of the case as it was presented through evidence in the second trial although there was evidence elicited mainly by the defendants that puig authorized plaintiff initial transfer in february,no evidence was presented that puig received any of plaintiff requests for reinstatement,or that he was involved in any decision not to reinstate her from february until early rather,the evidence presented at trial indicated that all such requests were made to and were referred to the head of human resources.
opening and closing arguments similarly focused on the mayor direct participation in nonreinstatement,rather than any indirect authorization of alleged adverse actions by puig.thus,a finding of liability under the theory pressed at the second trial,that the mayor was directly involved in the decision not to reinstate her,is consistent with the jury verdict in favor of puig in the first trial.
moreover,n onmutual issue preclusion is not available as a matter of right.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure ed.instead,a district court may refuse to apply nonmutual collateral estoppel when,for example,its application would badly distort matters before the jury,biggins,at citing federal rule of evidence,or would not result in efficiency gains because litigation of the live issue may require introduction of some of the same evidence pertinent to the estopped issues,at.although,as defendants point out,biggins and involved offensive nonmutual collateral estoppel,concerns about juror confusion and judicial economy are relevant to defensive nonmutual collateral estoppel as well.see wright,miller cooper,supra,at whatever values may be gained by nonmutual preclusion are substantially diminished when the need to try related issues requires consideration of much the same evidence as bears on the issue tendered for preclusion beyond the lack of time saving,moreover,preclusion on one issue while closely related issues must be tried may substantially distort decision of the issues that remain open.footnote omitted restatement second of judgments.
the district court carefully weighed the merits of the requested jury instruction and concluded that it was not appropriate in this case.citing federal rule of evidence,the court found that the requested instruction could lead the jury to make improper inferences as to related issues remaining in the case,such as whether transfer or nonreinstatement constituted an adverse employment action,whether she was transferred at her own request rather than in retaliation for her protected activity,and whether municipal actors other than the vice mayor took an adverse employment action against her.the court further found that the instruction would not promote judicial economy because these remaining,closely intertwined issues would require introduction of much of the same evidence at trial.in view of the court concerns about juror confusion and judicial economy,we conclude that the court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that vice mayor puig had not taken an adverse employment action against.
finally,defendants argue that the trial court erred in declining to reduce the damages award,asserting that the award was grossly excessive.the jury awarded in compensatory damages for her emotional pain and suffering.
we may overturn a damages award only if it is grossly excessive or so high as to shock the conscience of this court,at.we accord broad discretion to the trial court decision to affirm the jury award of damages because of that court greater familiarity with local community standards and with the witnesses demeanor at the trial.id.quotation marks and citation omitted.damages for pain and suffering,in particular,defy exact mathematical computation and are not susceptible to proof by a dollar amount,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.

fontanez,who treated from july until december,testified that her psychological condition deteriorated over this period.although had typical symptoms of depression as of,over time her condition grew more acute,requiring increased medication and,beginning in june,repeated hospitalizations.fontanez testified to recurring complaints about her work situation after the transfer,and identified that situation as an important factor in her deteriorating condition.
in light of this evidence,we can not say that the court abused its discretion in affirming the damages award.although generous,the award of was not grossly excessive or so high as to shock the conscience.moreover,this award is similar to noneconomic compensatory damages awards we have upheld in other employment discrimination and retaliation contexts.see,monteagudo asociación de empleados del estado libre asociado de,cir upholding damages award in sexual harassment case where plaintiff testified that she suffered from depression,cried every evening and was unable to sleep mcdonough city of quincy,cir affirming damages award in title vii retaliation case,the bulk of which was for emotional distress in the form of humiliation and damage to reputation and family relationships.

following our decision in rodríguez ii remanding the case for a new trial against the mayor and municipality,raised a law claim in the joint proposed pretrial order pretrial order.defendants objected,arguing that she had waived this claim by failing to include it in the joint pretrial order filed by the parties and approved by the court prior to the first trial pretrial order.the court concluded that could proceed to trial on her law claim,and it subsequently doubled the compensatory damages award pursuant to that provision.however,on defendants motion to alter or amend the judgment under rule e,the court determined that its prior ruling was in error.in a written order,the court thoroughly analyzed the record and concluded that had waived her law claim by not including it in the pretrial order or successfully moving to modify the order,and she had not shown any manifest injustice that would result from not permitting her to modify the pretrial order to include this claim.the court then entered an amended judgment in the amount of.
we review the court decision on a rule e motion for abuse of discretion.see santiago,cir.a final pretrial order is intended to control the subsequent course of the action,and can be modified only to prevent manifest injustice.correa hosp.san francisco,cir quoting.e.therefore,a n appellate court should not lightly relieve a litigant from the condign consequences of its failure to list a theory at that critical stage of the proceedings,and issues not included in the final pretrial order are generally waived,id.citing becton dickinson,cir.
as the court explained in its detailed order granting defendants rule e motion,even assuming that complaint adequately raised a law claim she waived that claim by failing to include it in the proceedings.in the pretrial order,raised several claims arising under puerto rico law but did not assert a law claim and did not request double damages.defendants noted this omission,stating in the pretrial order that had not sought a remedy under law.thereafter,made no objection to the language of the pretrial order and did not seek to modify the order prior to the first trial.furthermore,at the first trial,the court rejected her attempt to proceed under law.after the close of evidence,argued to the court that law statute of limitations governed the action.however,defense counsel argued that this is not a law case and opposed any attempt by plaintiff to amend her complaint to include a law claim.the court agreed,ruling that they are not amending their case to be law.
takes issue with the trial court analysis,contending that she did not waive her law claim prior to the first trial.she points to statements in the pretrial order,by the judge during the first trial,and in our opinion in rodríguez ii,that refer to her claims under state law or puerto rico law.see,rodríguez ii,at.for example,the court instructed the jury in the first trial that plaintiff claim under puerto rico law was identical for all practical purposes to the federal claim,and if the jury found defendants liable under federal law,they would also be liable under puerto rico law.however,as noted above,the complaint and the pretrial order expressly included several claims arising under puerto rico law.there is nothing to suggest that the statements points to,which refer generally to state or puerto rico law,encompassed law.
in sum,we conclude that the court determination that waived her law claim,and that its earlier ruling to the contrary was erroneous,was not an abuse of discretion.see pfizer pharmaceuticals,llc,cir a court may grant a rule e motion where the movant shows a manifest error of law or newly discovered evidence quotation marks and citation omitted.
