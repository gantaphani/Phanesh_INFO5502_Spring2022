this case involves the judicial review of the final decision of appellee united states of america,acting through the united states department of agriculture usda,denying appellant holly hill farm corporation application for farm benefits.because we agree with the district court that the agency decision was not arbitrary or capricious nor the result of an abuse of discretion,we affirm.
holly hill farm corporation holly hill owns a estate in caroline county,virginia,and operates a farm,farm serial number fsn,under the direct program dcp,administered by the usda.the dcp provides income support to producers of eligible crops.at issue in the present case is field of fsn,which is located between the mattaponi river and route in caroline county.field consists of three and acres and includes approximately one acre that has been designated as an illegally converted wetland.this designation rendered holly hills ineligible for program benefits and is thus the subject of this appeal.
the chain of events resulting in the designation at issue began on may,when george ways,district conservationist for the soil conservation service scs,confirmed the presence of hydric soil on fsn.because such soil indicates the possible presence of wetlands,ways advised holly hill in a letter dated february,to seek a determination of the wetland status of fsn before beginning the clearing of any woodland.ways explained that the clearing of woodland that may also be wetland for use as a pasture would not violate the farm bill,but attached an article suggesting that destruction of wetland for any purposes may violate other laws.
in a subsequent letter dated march,ways noted that at that time field was designated as woodland and that clearing was in progress in that field and others without prior planning or approval by scs.ways advised holly hill that the clearing of wetland could result in a violation of federal wetland laws and made arrangements for scs to map the soils on the entire property and make a wetlands determination.
on june,scs notified holly hill that fields,and an unnumbered area northeast of field were designated as wetlands.the soil map accompanying the report and the wetland determination itself specifically stated that w etland determinations have been made only for areas specifically delineated.the disclaimer on the soil map additionally provided that a reas not marked as wetlands may contain areas of wet hydric soils.investigation will be required to determine if these areas are wetlands.holly hill appealed,and there were some revisions to the dimensions of the land designated as wetland in fields and.a review of the record performed during this appeal process revealed that wetland determination disclaimer statements are inappropriate on the soil map.on august,scs completed and certified a revised wetland determination designating fields,and an unnumbered area northeast of field as wetlands.there was no reference to field in this official wetland determination.
also in,the usda received a complaint regarding possible wetland conversions on holly hill property.holly hill refused usda officials access to the property in order to investigate the complaint,and accordingly the usda automatically denied farm benefits according to farm services agency fsa procedure.holly hill again denied usda access to investigate the whistle blower complaint in.additionally,in,the environmental protection agency epa issued an order for compliance instructing holly hill to cease unauthorized filling of wetlands in violation of the clean water act and noted in the order that holly hill had previously denied the usda,army corps of engineers,and nrcs access to the property in order to investigate the matter.
for crop year,holly hill applied for program benefits for fsn.nrcs responded in november that holly hill would be ineligible unless it allowed nrcs officials access to investigate the outstanding wetland noncompliance complaint and establish a conservation plan for the farm.holly hill initially resisted,but eventually granted access to the property in june.on august,nrcs conducted an initial survey and determined that one acre of land in field of fsn contained wetlands converted after november.this determination was based on the presence of hydrology and hydric soils,and on aerial photographs from demonstrating a conversion from bottomland hardwoods to pastureland in or around.
the determination became final,and on november,holly hill appealed to the fsa county committee fsa county committee.the fsa county committee held a hearing on december,decided that the case warranted a review by the nrcs state conservationist,and referred the matter to nrcs.on january,the state conservationist concluded that the converted wetland determination was technically accurate and final.the county executive director of the fsa county committee notified holly hill of the state conservationist conclusion and informed holly hill that it was thus not eligible for program benefits.
holly hill appealed to the national appeals division nad of the usda on april.holly hill requested subpoenas for four nrcs and three epa employees to testify at the hearing.the hearing officer faxed this subpoena request to the usda,and the usda responded that it would send dan solomon,farm bill program manager,and jerry quesenberry,the soil scientist responsible for wetland determinations in the area of virginia encompassing holly hill property,neither of whom were among those witnesses requested by holly hill.the nad hearing officer denied all of holly hill subpoena requests on the grounds that the requested witnesses did not possess specific relevant information not otherwise available.
the nad hearing was held june.during the hearing,holly hill objected when the nad hearing officer questioned the usda officials,arguing that the hearing officer was thereby leading the government through the case.on july,the nad hearing officer issued a decision holding that the fsa denial of program benefits based on the nrcs technical determination of wetland conversion after november,was not erroneous.holly hill requested that the nad director review the nad hearing officer determination,and the nad director upheld the nad hearing officer determination on october,constituting final agency action.holly hill appealed to the district court,asserting that the usda abused its discretion,took unreasonable action,and issued an arbitrary and capricious decision.
in its memorandum opinion granting the government motion for summary judgment,the district court found that the nad hearing officer did not abuse his discretion when he confined the evidence presented at the hearing to what he determined was relevant and the nad hearing officer did not abuse his discretion when he denied holly hill requests for witness subpoenas the nad hearing officer ex parte communication did not relate to the merits of the appeal,but rather only to procedural matters,and was thus not prohibited the nad hearing officer attempt to clarify questions and answers,and to obtain all the applicable evidence,did not evidence an improper bias or prejudice toward the defendant and the usda substantive decision to deny program benefits based on its determination that field contained converted wetlands was supported by substantial evidence and thus not arbitrary or capricious.
on appeal,holly hill makes four substantive arguments in support of its claim that the usda denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious.first,holly hill argues that the usda determined that field was not a wetland in,and that the usda should be bound by this determination as well as by ways statement in his february,letter to holly hill that clearing of field would not violate the farm bill.second,holly hill contends that the usda determination that field was converted after november,is arbitrary and capricious.third,holly hill argues that even if the wetlands on field were converted after november,all of the evidence regarding the alleged scope of the conversion supports the conclusion that holly hill is entitled to a minimal effects exception under the regulations.lastly,holly hill challenges the manner in which the nad hearing was conducted,asserting that the hearing officer denial of subpoena requests,ex parte contact with the usda,and questioning of government witnesses violated due process.

before turning to holly hill substantive arguments,it is useful to set forth the statutory framework underlying this appeal.the swampbuster provision of the food security act of prohibits farmers who participate in usda programs from converting wetlands and then producing an agricultural commodity on those converted wetlands.a b west.the food,agriculture,conservation and trade act facta,passed in,extended the prohibition so that it is a violation when a wetland is converted in a way that production of an agricultural commodity is possible,even if an agricultural commodity has not actually been produced.c west a.facta also added a stronger penalty for converting a wetland.while converting a wetland prior to november,resulted in only a proportional loss of benefits,conversion after that date results in the loss of all usda benefits on all land the farmer controls until the wetland is restored or the loss mitigated.c,i west.the usda defines converted wetland as follows 
converted wetland is a wetland that has been drained,dredged,filled,leveled,or otherwise manipulated including the removal of woody vegetation or any activity that results in impairing or reducing the flow and circulation of water for the purpose of or to have the effect of making possible the production of an agricultural commodity without further application of the manipulations described herein if 
i such production would not have been possible but for such action,and 
ii before such action such land was wetland,farmed wetland,or pasture and was neither highly erodible land nor highly erodible cropland 
a see also a west.
responsibility for administering the swampbuster provisions is divided between two usda and fsa.nrcs makes all technical determinations,evaluates any restoration and mitigation plans,and conducts monitoring activities.j west see also c setting forth specific determinations to be made by nrcs.the responsibilities of the fsa include making determinations on the ineligibility of benefits whether the violations were made in good faith and whether any other exemptions apply to the conversion of the wetland.a,b viii.
with this statutory regime in mind,as well as the applicable standard of review set forth above,we now turn to address each of holly hill four substantive arguments.
in its first argument,holly hill contends that any alleged conversion on its part is justifiable because field was reviewed and designated as woodland as part of the final determination in,and george ways advised,in his february,letter,that any conversion of woodland that contains a wetland would not violate the farm bill.
in support of its argument,holly hill relies on general due process principles as well as two regulatory provisions setting forth exemptions for situations in which applicants have placed reliance on nrcs wetlands determinations.the first exemption states that a person shall not be ineligible for program benefits as a result of taking an action in reliance on a previous certified wetland determination by nrcs.b i.the second exemption provides that the usda may make program benefits available if the appropriate usda agency finds that the action of a person which would form the basis of any ineligibility was taken by such person in reliance on erroneous advice,information or action of any other authorized representative of usda.
holly hill argument regarding the february,letter from ways is clearly without merit.first,holly hill conceded during oral argument that there is no evidence in the record to show that holly hill actually relied on the letter from ways.indeed,holly hill asserts that no clearing took place on field after november.while holly hill is free to make alternative arguments in support of its position,arguing that no conversion took place during the relevant time period obviously undermines any contention that,had there been a clearing after november,it was made in reliance on ways letter.
furthermore,the february,letter is an insufficient basis for the reliance exemptions for two additional reasons.the february letter stated that 
as previously discussed the clearing of a woodland that may also be wetland for use as pasture is not a violation of the farm bill.however,the attached article sheds a different light on the destruction of wetland for any purpose.
i suggest that before you proceed with any clearing of woodland that you request the nrcs to make a determination as to wetland status of the area.
first,ways specifically cautioned holly hill to consult with nrcs prior to any clearing of woodland.furthermore,at the time ways sent the letter,the stricter law punishing a wetland conversion that merely makes the production of an agricultural commodity possible had not yet been enacted.thus,ways statement that clearing for use as a pasture did not violate the farm bill was accurate at the time it was made.
the law is clear that such statements would not excuse the clearing of woodland after november,when facta was enacted into law.indeed p rotection of the public fisc requires that those who seek public funds act with scrupulous regard for the requirements of law and as such they are held to the most demanding standards.heckler cmty.health servs.of crawford county,d.those who deal with the government are expected to know the law and may not rely on the conduct of government agents contrary to law.id.citing fed.crop ins.merrill.statements regarding the propriety of clearing land for use as a pasture on february,do not justify any ignorance on the part of holly hill regarding the significant changes to the law that occurred subsequently on november.
holly hill argument regarding the wetland determination is a closer question,but ultimately fails as well.the wetland determination fails to address field.it could be argued that by designating fields,and an unnumbered area as wetlands,scs implicitly concluded that field was not a wetland.ways march,letter tends to support this argument,because he noted that fields and are designated as woodland and explained that scs would map the soils on the entire property prior to making the wetland determination.nonetheless,both the designation itself and the soil map accompanying that initial determination clearly contain the same disclaimer wetland determinations have been made only for areas specifically delineated.the soil map contains an additional disclaimer providing that areas not marked as wetlands may contain areas of wet hydric soils.investigation will be required to determine if these areas are wetlands.
admittedly,during the appeal of the initial determination,scs noted that wetland determination disclaimer statements are inappropriate on the soil map,and the soil map accompanying the revised,final determination contained no disclaimers.however,the same disclaimer that was present on the initial determination and initial soil map is included in the final determination completed on august.also,before the f
