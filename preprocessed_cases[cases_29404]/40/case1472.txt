plaintiffs warren holliday and holliday amusement company of charleston,holliday,seek just compensation for an alleged regulatory taking.holliday claims that act,which outlawed video gaming machines in the state of south carolina,destroyed holliday business and thus effected an unconstitutional taking of his property without just compensation.holliday brought suit in federal district court,and the court granted summary judgment to the state and its officials.we now affirm.
from to,holliday amusement of charleston,a business owned and operated by warren holliday,distributed video poker machines in the state of south carolina.on july,south carolina enacted act codified at ann,which outlawed the possession of video gaming machines in the state and subjected such machines to forfeiture,effective july.
after the act was passed and before it went into effect,certain owners and lessees of video gaming machines filed suit in south carolina court challenging the constitutionality of the act.see westside quik shop,stewart.they sought an injunction against the act enforcement,on the ground that it represented an unconstitutional taking of their property without just compensation.id.at.holliday was not a party to this litigation,although he was a member of the south carolina coin operators association,which filed an amicus brief.the south carolina supreme court held that act did not constitute a taking of plaintiffs video gaming machines,business,or real property and that compensation was thus not required under either the south carolina or the constitution.id.the act went into effect on july.at that time,holliday owned operational video poker machines,costing approximately each.
on january,holliday brought this action in federal district court,claiming that act worked a taking of his property,for which he was entitled to just compensation under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.holliday claimed that,as a result of the act,his video poker machines which had been modified to south carolina specifications such that they could not be used elsewhere lost all market value,and his business became worthless.holliday sought compensation for these losses under the constitution and.
the district court first granted the state motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the doctrine.on appeal,this court vacated the district court judgment,because only applies to parties to the previous litigation.see holliday amusement of charleston,south carolina,cir citing johnson de grandy,d.
upon remand,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants.the district court held that,under supreme court precedent,no taking had occurred in addition,it held that plaintiff claim was collaterally estopped by the westside decision,and that sovereign immunity barred some claims.holliday appeals.
as an initial matter,we doubt this federal action to be ripe under the requirements of williamson county regional planning commission hamilton bank of johnson city,d.williamson set forth two independent prudential hurdles to a claim for just compensation for a regulatory taking brought against a state entity in federal court.suitum tahoe reg l planning agency,d.first,the property owner must have a final administrative decision regarding the application of the challenged regulations to the property.williamson,at.second,if a state provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation,the property owner can not claim a violation of the just compensation clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.id.at.
it is the second williamson requirement,the state procedures requirement,which poses an obstacle here.plaintiff has not satisfied this requirement because,as he admits,he has not sought just compensation through a state court procedure.in our view,given that south carolina opens its courts to inverse condemnation claims arising from regulatory takings,see,hardin south carolina of,byrd city of hartsville,the plaintiff was obligated under williamson to avail himself of those procedures.
we recognize,of course,that the state procedures requirement does not apply to facial challenges to the validity of a state regulation.see san remo hotel,city and county of san francisco,d see also lingle chevron,d.this case is not a facial challenge,nor is it a challenge to a statute requiring direct transfer of funds to the government.see eastern enters.apfel,d plurality see also washlefske winston,cir suit was ripe where only question to be determined was legality of state program.rather,it is a regulatory takings case,in which the plaintiff has made clear throughout that he does not seek to prohibit the taking of his property under act but,to the contrary,accepts the validity of the governmental action as a prerequisite of maintaining this suit for just compensation.brief of appellant at,holliday,cir see also brief of appellant at.being such a suit,state procedures for the award of just compensation must be utilized.
plaintiff argues,however,that he is exempt from the state procedures requirement by virtue of the fact that another group of videogaming operators unsuccessfully asserted a takings claim in westside quik shop,stewart.he further argues that his position is supported by the supreme court decision in city of monterey del monte dunes at monterey,d,in which,he claims,the court recognized a futility exception to the state procedures requirement.
we conclude,however,that the relevant supreme court precedent does not establish an exception to the state procedures requirement in a case such as this.although the court has not categorically defined what constitutes an adequate state procedure,its cases discussing when a plaintiff might eschew state procedures involve instances where state procedures were not available for plaintiff claim.in williamson itself,for instance,the court found plaintiff claim unripe because the state of tennessee had available a statutory inverse condemnation scheme which state courts had interpreted to allow recovery through inverse condemnation where the taking is effected by restrictive zoning laws or development regulations.id.at.in contrast,in suitum tahoe regional planning agency,while refraining from deciding the state procedures issue because it was not addressed below,the court noted that the parties appeared to agree that the defendant local planning agency d id not have provisions for paying just compensation,thus making a federal suit the sole remedy for the alleged taking.at.
although plaintiff argues that the present case merits an exception under city of monterey del monte dunes at monterey,d,we do not take that case to say anything different from williamson and suitum,much less to create a new exception broad enough to accommodate the present circumstances.rather,the situation in del monte dunes was of the kind anticipated in williamson itself in contrast to williamson,where the court explicitly noted that tennessee allowed claims for regulatory takings,at the time of the alleged taking in del monte dunes,california provided no inverse condemnation procedure for regulatory takings.id.at.this deficiency meant that del monte dunes was not required to pursue relief in state court as a precondition to federal relief.id.at.del monte dunes and the present case,by contrast,are in no way identical.in this case,the plaintiff asserts that his claim will be unsuccessful in del monte dunes,a state court claim did not exist at all.
finally,san remo hotel,city and county of san francisco,d,confirms the prior cases on the state procedures requirement.san remo suggested that the plaintiff must obtain the entry of a final state judgment denying just compensation,id.at,and stated that no claim that a state agency has violated the federal takings clause can be heard in federal court until the property owner has been denied just compensation through an available state compensation procedure,id.at.emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
we recognize that various circuits have characterized the state procedures requirement differently.some have spoken in terms of a futility exception,but even those have applie
