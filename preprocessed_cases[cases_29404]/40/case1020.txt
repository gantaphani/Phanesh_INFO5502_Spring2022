background 
factual background 
on the evening of june,theresa went to her husband home in warren,new jersey,to pick up their youngest daughter for visitation after ringing the doorbell,ray observed a man whom she believed to be her husband moving about in the home.ray continued to ring the doorbell and knock on the door for several minutes in an attempt to alert the man to her presence.after receiving no response,she called the police.
sergeant angelo paolella and officers donald calabrese and larry frank responded to the call and were soon joined by officer joseph cohen collectively,the responding officers.some of the responding officers had been called by the rays in the past to deal with domestic problems and were aware of the acrimonious nature of the ray sic divorce proceedings and child custody disputes at the home.app.at.on the evening in question,ray informed the responding officers that she had arrived at the home to pick up her child for visitation pursuant to a final restraining order that,in part,addressed visitation rights she informed the officers that she had seen someone inside the home who was not responding to the door,whom she believed to be her husband and whom she assumed had custody of the child at the time ray was visibly upset and told the officers that she was concerned for the of her daughter the officers shared her concern.they circled the perimeter of the house,knocked on the doors and windows,and called ray home telephone,but received no response.that heightened the officers apprehensions because on other occasions when police had been called to the residence,ray had always responded and turned over his daughter to his wife.
in light of the circumstances,officer calabrese,at sergeant paolella instruction,contacted a municipal court judge for guidance as to whether the officers could go in the house to look for the child app.at.exactly what was discussed during the phone call is not clear.paolella and calabrese testified that they only sought approval to enter the home out of concern for the rays daughter and that the judge gave them such authorization.both paolella and calabrese testified that they did not regard the call to the judge as a request for a warrant of any kind.in contrast,the judge understood the officers to be asking for an arrest warrant based on ray violation of the terms of the restraining order,though he indicated that officer calabrese was afraid for the safety of the kids.app.at.based on the call,the judge issued an arrest warrant for ray,which was later voided.regardless of the ambiguity regarding the call to the judge,the record reflects that the primary motivation of the officers on the scene was to enter the home so that they could check on the child 
the officers entered ray home through an unlocked door that was ajar,but obstructed by a piece of lumber meant to keep the door secured the lumber was moved aside with a slim jim,a device used to gain access to a locked vehicle.upon entering the home,the officers encountered ray father,who explained to the officers that he had been sleeping and that his son was not at home.after quickly looking through the home,the officers found neither ray nor his daughter.the event was captured on video by cameras installed in ray home.shortly after the incident,the officers were informed that someone had made contact with ray and that he was bringing the child to police headquarters.
procedural history 
ray filed a complaint asserting a claim under and several state law claims based upon the allegedly unconstitutional search of his home.ray named as defendants the responding officers and lieutenant leffert in their individual and official capacities,the township of warren,the township of warren police department,and chief of police william stahl in his official capacity,all of whom filed a joint motion for summary judgment in that motion,the responding officers and leffert appellees asserted that they were entitled to qualified immunity.
the district court agreed and,based upon qualified immunity,granted summary judgment to the appellees on ray claim the district court also dismissed ray claims against the officers,lieutenant leffert,and chief stahl in their official capacities,as well as his claim against the warren township police department,because all of those claims were redundant of the claim against the township.thereafter,the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the claims against the township.ray then filed this timely appeal.

the doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.pearson.callahan,internal quotations omitted.thus,if a reasonable officer is not on notice that his or her conduct under the circumstances is clearly unlawful,then application of qualified immunity is appropriate.qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs.
the supreme court has established a analysis that governs whether a government official is entitled to qualified immunity.saucier katz.the first question in the saucier analysis asks whether the official conduct violated a constitutional or federal right.id.this is not a question of immunity,but whether there is any wrong to address.curley klem,cir.the second question asks whether the right at issue was clearly established.saucier,at.to be clearly established,t he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson creighton.if the officer made a reasonable mistake about the legal constraints on his actions,then qualified immunity should protect him from suit.curley,at.in considering that question,we judge the officer actions from the perspective of an objectively reasonable law enforcement officer under the circumstances,and we endeavor to avoid hindsight.graham connor.
the supreme court has held that the questions in the saucier analysis need not be addressed in sequence.pearson.instead,courts may exercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.id.
the constitutional right at issue in this appeal is ray right under the fourth amendment to be free from an unreasonable search of his home.const.amend.iv.searches of a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable,though the warrant requirement is subject to carefully defined exceptions.see illinois rodriguez.since the responding officers did not have a warrant to search ray home,the question of whether ray rights have been violated rests on whether an exception to the warrant requirement applies.while one might have thought the officers would claim that their search was justified by exigent circumstances,which is a exception to the warrant requirement,they do not.to justify their actions,they instead point to what has come to be called the community caretaking exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement.ray,of course,contends that no such exception applies here.
the supreme court first recognized the community caretaking exception in cady dombrowski.in cady,a chicago police officer named dombrowski was visiting in wisconsin and reported to the local police that he had been in an automobile accident.the police picked him up and returned to the scene of the accident.id.at.dombrowski had been drinking,appeared intoxicated to the officers,and offered conflicting versions of the accident.id.he informed the local officers that he was a chicago policeman.id.at.the local officers believed that members of the chicago police force were required to carry a service revolver at all times,so,when no gun was found on dombrowski person,an officer checked the front seat and the glove compartment of the wrecked car,but to no avail.id.the effort to find the weapon was motivated by the obligation of the police to protect the public from the possibility that a revolver would fall into untrained or perhaps malicious hands.id.at.the police had the vehicle towed to a privately owned garage,where it was left parked outside.id.at.after taking dombrowski to a local hospital for treatment of injuries he sustained in the accident,one of the wisconsin officers returned to dombrowski car to again try to recover the service revolver,id.at,again pursuant to standard departmental procedure to protect the public from a weapon possibly falling into improper hands.id.at.upon opening the trunk,the officer discovered various items that linked dombrowski to a murder.id.at.
the supreme court held that the search of dombrowski vehicle was permissible because it was the result of a police officer community caretaking function,totally divorced from the detection,investigation,or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.id.at see also united states smith,cir in performing this community caretaking role,police are expected to aid those in distress,combat actual hazards,prevent potential hazards from materializing and provide an infinite variety of services to preserve and protect public safety.quoting united states,cir.the court determined that the search for the gun was reasonable,though its holding was based largely on the constitutional distinction between automobiles and dwellings 
because of the extensive regulation of motor vehicles and traffic,and also because of the frequency with which a vehicle can become disabled or involved in an accident on public highways,the extent of police citizen contact involving automobiles will be substantially greater than contact in a home or office the court previous recognition of the distinction between motor vehicles and dwelling places leads us to conclude that the type of caretaking search conducted here of a vehicle that was neither in the custody nor on the premises of its owner,and that had been placed where it was by virtue of lawful police action,was not unreasonable solely because a warrant had not been obtained.
the cady court recognized that,while some contact between police officers and vehicles will occur because of a possible violation of a criminal statute,much of the contact will be completely unrelated to criminal law enforcement and will occur when officers are acting as community caretakers.id.at.the court expressly distinguished automobile searches from searches of a home,saying that a search of a vehicle may be reasonable although the result might be the opposite in a search of a home.id.at.that distinction recognizes that the sanctity of the home has been embedded in our tradition since the origins of the republic.payton new york.indeed,the supreme court has emphasized that t he physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the fourth amendment is directed.united states united states district court.
there is some confusion among the circuits as to whether the community caretaking exception set forth in cady applies to warrantless searches of the home.the majority of circuits have reasoned that the community caretaking doctrine announced in cady is limited to searches of automobiles.the ninth circuit,in united states erickson,cir,held that cady was based on the distinction made between vehicles and residences and that an officer acting as a community caretaker may only enter a building based on an already acknowledged exception to the warrant requirement,like exigent circumstances.at although it involved a community caretaking function,cady clearly turned on the constitutional difference between searching a house and searching an automobile.the seventh circuit took a similar approach in united states pichany,cir,which concerned a warrantless search of a privately owned warehouse.the court held that cady was limited to automobile searches and refused to create a warehouse exception,even if the officers were acting as community caretakers.id.at t he plain import from the language of the cady decision is that the supreme court did not intend to create a broad exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement to apply whenever the police are acting in an investigative,rather than a criminal function.likewise,the tenth circuit held that the community caretaking doctrine announced in cady applies only to automobiles.united states.bute,cir.there the court found that the search of an old manufacturing plant under the auspices of the community caretaking doctrine was unconstitutional because the holding in cady was based on the constitutional difference between searches of automobiles and searches of homes or businesses.id.
some circuits do appear to have relied on the community caretaking exception created in cady to uphold warrantless entries into houses.in united states quezada,cir,the eighth circuit held that an officer acting in a community caretaking role may enter a residence when the officer has a reasonable belief that an emergency exists that requires attention.at.the sixth circuit took a similar approach in united states rohrig,cir,when it held that two officers warrantless entry into a home was permissible since they were acting as community caretakers to abate a significant noise nuisance.at.
those cases,however,do not simply rely on the community caretaking doctrine established in cady.they instead apply what appears to be a modified exigent circumstances test,with perhaps a lower threshold for exigency if the officer is acting in a community caretaking role.for example,in quezada,the eighth circuit held that the officer had to have a reasonable belief that an emergency exists requiring his or her attention for the community caretaking doctrine to apply to a warrantless search of a home.at emphasis added.and in rohrig,the sixth circuit recognized that some situations addressed by officers within their community caretaking functions,though not within the scope of traditional law enforcement,can still present important government interests that may rise to the level of traditionally recognized exigent circumstances.at.in fact,the sixth circuit itself has questioned whether rohrig created a new community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement for entry into a home.united states williams,cir d espite references to the doctrine of rohrig,we doubt that community caretaking will generally justify warrantless entries into private homes.
we agree with the conclusion of the seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits on this issue,and interpret the supreme court decision in cady as being expressly based on the distinction between automobiles and homes for fourth amendment purposes.the community caretaking doctrine can not be used to justify warrantless searches of a home.whether that exception can ever apply outside the context of an automobile search,we need not now decide.it is enough to say that,in the context of a search of a home,it does not override the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment or the carefully crafted and exceptions to that requirement.
those exceptions include exigent circumstances,which may involve circumstances beyond those confronted by police in a criminal investigatory context.see united states coles,cir examples of exigent circumstances include,but are not li
