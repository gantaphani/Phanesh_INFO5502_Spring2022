arlene villamia drimal brought this action against sixteen fbi agents alleging that they violated title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of,title iii,when they listened to her private calls with her husband.the calls were intercepted during an authorized wiretap on the telephone of drimal husband as part of an investigation into a conspiracy to commit securities fraud.defendant fbi agents moved to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim and on qualified immunity grounds.the district court for the district of connecticut warren eginton,judge denied their motion,finding the complaint sufficient to state a claim despite its failure to mention minimization.we hold that drimal complaint in its present form does not plausibly state a claim because it recites only legal conclusions.we also conclude that in its qualified immunity analysis the district court should have assessed the reasonableness of the agents minimization efforts as they relate to each defendant.accordingly,we reverse the district court denial of the motion to dismiss,and remand for the district court to dismiss the complaint without prejudice to repleading and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
on may,drimal filed a civil complaint against sixteen fbi agents who had administered an authorized wiretap of her husband cellular telephone,alleging that they violated title iii by listening to her private conversations with her husband although the complaint does not refer to minimization,under section of title iii,it is a violation to fail to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception.section gives any person whose wire,oral,or electronic communication is intercepted,disclosed,or intentionally used in violation of this chapter the right to recover from the person or entity,other than the united states,which engaged in that violation such relief as may be appropriate,including damages.a.
i.drimal criminal case 
drimal complaint arises out of an earlier criminal prosecution in the southern district of new york that was ultimately tried before judge richard sullivan.see united states goffer,d,aff,cir.the trial was preceded by a federal securities fraud investigation that included a wiretap of her husband cellular phone during which fbi agents intercepted and monitored his calls with drimal.
a court order authorizing the wiretap of drimal cellular telephone for two periods in late and early,id.at,specified that m onitoring of conversations must immediately terminate when it is determined that the conversation is unrelated to communications subject to interception if a conversation is minimized,monitoring agents shall spot check to ensure that the conversation has not turned to criminal matters.id.
the assistant united states attorney who supervised the wiretap also issued written instructions on the minimization requirement.he instructed agents to listen to the beginning of each communication only so long as is necessary to determine the nature of the communication and,in any case,no longer than a few minutes unless the communication is pertinent.id.in addition,he advised that i f,after several days or weeks of interception it became apparent that conversations between drimal and another party involved invariably innocent,related matters,then communications between those parties should not be recorded,listened to,or even spot monitored.id.finally,the agents were told to discontinue monitoring if you discover that you are intercepting a personal communication solely between husband and wife unless the conversations included a third party or addressed ongoing as opposed to past violations of law.id.at.during the wiretap,agents monitored over one thousand of drimal telephone conversations,including approximately calls with drimal that were not pertinent to the investigation.id.at.
in,drimal moved before judge sullivan to suppress the entire wiretap on the basis that the government had failed to properly minimize calls with his wife.id.at.at the hearing,several agents testified,including defendant special agent lomonaco who admitted that he had listened to a privileged conversation which he had no right to hear and defendant special agent ford who remembered kicking him self for listening to a privileged marital conversation.
the district court denied the motion to suppress all of the wiretapped phone calls.focusing on eighteen calls it identified as potentially violative,the district court stated that the monitoring of three of these calls had been particularly egregious,d at,and that another five calls raise d questions about the sufficiency of the agents minimization efforts,id.at.the district court concluded,however,that on the whole,the wiretap was professionally conducted and generally,id.at,even as it described certain failures to minimize private calls between husband and wife as inexcusable and disturbing,id.at.the district court observed that the most egregious failures occurred in the early stages of the wiretap,when agents might still be learning to identify drimal voice,and that agents minimized the calls satisfactorily later in the wiretap id.at.
ii.drimal civil lawsuit 
following the conclusion of her husband criminal case,drimal filed this action in the district of connecticut against sixteen fbi agents who monitored or supervised the monitoring of the wiretap,seeking compensatory and punitive damages against the agents in their personal capacities.the district court denied the defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and on qualified immunity grounds.
defendants now appeal from the denial of qualified immunity.
discussion 
we review de novo the denial of a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.brown daikin am,cir see also garcia does,cir.although a district court denial of a motion to dismiss is not a final judgment,we review it here because the defendants qualified immunity claim occasions an interlocutory appeal.see ashcroft iqbal,stating that decision denying qualified immunity can be appealable order see also mitchell forsyth,holding that a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,is an appealable final decision within the meaning of notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.
the district court rulings on the pleadings and on qualified immunity suffer from two deficiencies.first,the district court erred in finding drimal complaint sufficient to plead a violation of title iii because drimal simply asserted in a conclusory fashion that intercepting marital telephone calls violated title iii without any reference to the duty to minimize.second,in evaluating defendants claims of qualified immunity,the district court ruled on all the defendants as a single group instead of evaluating drimal claims against each defendant individually.
accordingly,we vacate the district court denial of the motion to dismiss and direct the dismissal of the complaint with leave to replead under federal rule of civil procedure a because it appears that amending the complaint would not be futile.panther partners ikanos commc ns,app x,cir summary order remanding where granting leave to amend anew may not be futile in this case.
i.the plausibility of drimal complaint 
to survive a b motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.iqbal,at internal quotation marks omitted.courts are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.id.internal quotation marks omitted.while this standard does not require detailed factual allegations it demands more than an unadorned,accusation.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
drimal complaint fails to plausibly allege a violation of law because she recites only legal conclusions.conspicuously absent from the complaint is the concept of minimization.drimal simply alleges that each defendant unlawfully intercepted and listened to privileged,confidential marital communications,ide
