virginia certificate of need con program governs the establishment and expansion of certain medical facilities inside the state.in this case two providers of medical imaging services,colon health centers of america and progressive radiology,argue that the con law unconstitutionally violates the dormant aspect of the commerce clause.the district court held that the certificate requirement neither discriminated against nor placed an undue burden on interstate commerce,and granted summary judgment to the commonwealth.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
much of the background and many of the claims in this case have been set forth in our prior opinion.see colon health centers of,llc hazel,cir.virginia is one of states that requires medical service providers to obtain a certificate of public need in order to establish or expand operations within its borders.ann.et.admin.code et.virginia con program applies to most health care capital expenditures,including investments in new computed tomographic ct and magnetic resonance imaging mri facilities.see ann.it does not,however,cover the r eplacement of existing equipment.id.at.the program requires that an applicant show a sufficient public need for its proposed venture in the relevant geographic area.virginia asserts that this preapproval mechanism helps prevent the redundant accretion of medical facilities,protect the economic viability of existing providers,promote indigent care,and assist health care spending.
firms that seek to obtain a certificate of need must file their completed applications with the department of health and the appropriate regional health planning agency.id.at.applicants pay a fee of one percent of the project expected capital cost,but no less than and no more than.admin.code b.the submissions are grouped into subcategories based on project type and evaluated in a process called batching.the code mandates that the review process be completed within days of the start of the applicable batch cycle.ann.
five regional health planning agencies across the state are charged with conducting,within days,initial investigations into their respective regions applications.during this stage of review the agencies must hold a public hearing in the vicinity of the proposed investment site,where interested individuals and local governing bodies may submit comments to assist the agencies in their evaluations.after examining the data and reviewing the testimony before them,the agencies are directed to provide the department of health with their recommendations to approve or deny each application.id.
the department,concurrently with the regional health planning agencies,reviews the completed applications upon the commencement of the appropriate batch cycle.the department is required to assess whether an informal conference is warranted.such a proceeding will be held if the department independently determines that it is necessary or if an intervening party demonstrates that good cause exists to conduct it.ann.e.the date on which the record closes on the application varies depending on whether an informal conference is conducted.
the code instructs that a certificate may not be issued unless the state health commissioner has determined that a public need for the project has been demonstrated.id.at a.the commissioner decision is due days after the record closes,but that period may be extended by an additional days.id.at e.in making his assessment,the commissioner must consider a number of factors,although no single factor is dispositive.id.at b.for example,the commissioner evaluates t he extent to which the proposed service or facility will provide or increase access to needed services for residents of the area to be served,and t he relationship of the project to the existing health care system of the area to be served,including the utilization and efficiency of existing services or facilities.id.at b.an application is considered approved and a certificate is granted if the commissioner fails to issue a decision within seventy days after the closing of the record.
constructing new facilities or augmenting existing operations without a certificate of need is a class misdemeanor,punishable by fines of up to for each day a service provider is in violation of the statute.id.at.applicants and other interested persons dissatisfied with the commissioner decision may seek judicial review under the virginia administrative procedure act.see id.at.
appellants colon health centers and progressive radiology are medical providers who wish to establish,through the use of private funds,specialized mri and ct services in virginia.appellants challenged the constitutionality of the con program,claiming that it violates the dormant commerce clause as well as the fourteenth amendment equal protection,due process,and privileges or immunities clauses.the district court dismissed appellants suit under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.colon health centers of,llc hazel,wl,at.
on appeal,we affirmed the dismissal of appellants fourteenth amendment claims,reversed the dismissal of the dormant commerce clause claim,and remanded the case for further factual development on the commerce clause issue.colon health,at.after careful consideration of the parties arguments,we made clear that this case is one of heightened importance,and emphasized the quality of the dormant commerce clause analysis.id.at.
the district court conducted an extensive discovery process on remand,and ultimately granted summary judgment in favor of the commonwealth.colon health and progressive radiology now urge us to reverse that decision on two grounds.first,appellants argue that virginia con requirement violates the dormant commerce clause by discriminating against interstate commerce in both purpose and effect.second,appellants contend that even if the program does not unconstitutionally discriminate,it nevertheless violates the dormant commerce clause because it places an undue burden on interstate commerce.we address each of these arguments in turn.
the general framework of the law in this area is well settled.the commerce clause gives congress the power t o regulate commerce among the several states.const.art.i,cl.although by its terms the clause speaks only of congressional authority,the supreme court long has recognized that it also limits the power of the states to erect barriers against interstate trade.dennis higgins,quoting lewis bt inv.managers.this implicit or dormant constraint is driven primarily by concerns over economic protectionism that is,regulatory measures designed to benefit economic interests by burdening competitors.new energy of.limbach.
to that end,the supreme court has instructed that t he principal objects of dormant commerce clause scrutiny are statutes that discriminate against interstate commerce.cts dynamics of,emphasis added.w hen a state statute discriminates against interstate commerce,it will be struck down unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism.yamaha motor jim motorcycle,cir quoting wyoming oklahoma.while discrimination simply means differential treatment of and economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter,or.waste,dep t of envtl.quality of state of,u,not all economic harms or anticompetitive choices can or should be remedied through application of the dormant commerce clause.see brown hovatter,cir.under the prevailing framework courts must chart a narrow course between rebuff ing attempts of states to advance their own commercial interests by curtailing the movement of articles of commerce and generally supporting their right to impose even burdensome regulations in the interest of local health and safety.hood sons,du mond.
recognizing this difficulty,the supreme court has advised courts in this context to eschew formalism for a sensitive,analysis.lynn creamery,healy,u.in other words,courts are not bound by t he name,description or characterization given the law by the legislature or the courts of the state.colon health,at quoting hughes oklahoma.the principal focus of inquiry must be the practical operation of the statute,since the validity of state laws must be judged chiefly in terms of their probable effects.lewis,at see also yamaha,at.the discrimination test can thus be described as both flexible and finite courts are afforded some latitude to determine for themselves the practical impact of a state law,but in doing so they must not cripple the states authority under their general police powers to regulate matters of legitimate local concern.maine taylor,internal quotation marks omitted.
a state statute may discriminate against interstate commerce in one of three ways facially,in its practical effect,or in its purpose.envtl.tech.council sierra club,cir.a discriminatory measure is virtually per se invalid,and will survive strict scrutiny only if it advances a legitimate local purpose that can not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.or.waste,at internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the parties are in agreement that virginia con law is not facially discriminatory.the program applies to all firms establishing or expanding covered health care operations within the state,and makes no distinction between and service providers.see,ann.t o obtain a certificate for a project,every applicant,regardless of geographic location,shall file a completed application.
appellants do,however,maintain that the con program discriminates in both purpose and effect.with regard to purpose,they note that the law is intended to protect the economic viability of existing service providers by impeding the development of new medical facilities.appellants br.at citing.admin.code t he con program discourages the proliferation of services that would undermine the ability of essential community providers to maintain their financial viability.because current health care firms are categorically entities,the argument goes,the primary goal of the certificate requirement is to shelter those providers from competition at the expense of businesses seeking entry into the market.
that argument misses the main point.regimes in place in many states across this designed in the most general sense to prevent overinvestment in and maldistribution of health care facilities.see lauretta wolfson,state regulation of health facility planning the economic theory and political realities of certificates of need,depaul health care.indeed,as we discuss in greater detail below,virginia program serves an array of legitimate public purposes improving health care quality by discouraging the proliferation of underutilized facilities,enabling underserved and indigent populations to access necessary medical services,and encouraging consumer spending.see infra part.appellants may be dissatisfied with the virginia general assembly policy choices in this complex field,but we can not discern a sinister protectionist purpose in this straightforward effort to bring medical care to all the citizens of the commonwealth in the most efficient and professional manner.we thus turn our attention to the issue of discriminatory effect.
appellants allege that in practice virginia con program systematically advantages established providers at the expense of new,primarily firms.appellants br.at.specifically,appellants claim that the con application process impermissibly grants current virginia firms the authority to thwart the market entrance of providers in three ways.first,the code allows interested parties to request an informal conference so that the merits of a particular application can be further scrutinized.see ann.this authorization,according to appellants,can significantly lengthen the administrative review period and increase the costs and uncertainty borne by applicants.second,the intervention proviso also grants local firms,who may be in competition with an applicant,the power to stymie the process through an adversarial presentation at conference.appellants assert that despite the informal label,conferences often resemble litigation and a pplicants regularly retain counsel.appellants br.at.finally,appellants argue that the process gives a structural edge to established interests because applications are grouped and reviewed in batches,entities can submit competing applications within the appropriate batch cycle in order to block applications they want to see denied.id.at.
we are unconvinced by appellants arguments.in order to prove discriminatory effect,appellants must demonstrate that virginia con law,if enforced,would negatively impact interstate commerce to a greater degree than intrastate commerce.colon health,at quoting waste mgmt.holdings,gilmore,cir.the fulcrum of this inquiry will be whether the certificate requirement erects a special barrier to market entry by entities.id.at.here,the commonwealth expert,john mayo,revealed that over a period ending in january,approval rates for applications submitted by and by firms considered by the virginia department of health were virtually identical at just under percent.the state expert also reported that obtaining a certificate took the same length of time for both and applicants to days.id.at.in short,both the application process and its end result in virginia showed no appreciable difference in the treatment of and entities.this in contrast to programs that revealed marked disparities in the handling of and applications.see,walgreen rullan,cir in which o ver fifty percent of entities were forced to undergo the entire administrative process compared to less than percent of local applicants.
appellants,for their part,condemn the state expert approach.they argue that the district court erred by crediting the commonwealth expert decision to base his analysis entirely on whether a particular entity was legally incorporated in virginia or elsewhere.appellant br.at.according to appellants,the inquiry should be practical,rather than formal,and established service providers in virginia should be counted as regardless of their state of legal incorporation.id.at.
we find no error in the approach taken by the district court.it was plainly reasonable for the state expert to consider an entity state of incorporation in demarcating the boundary between and applicants.the district court noted simply that state of incorporation is relevant to whether an entity is an business discriminated against by virginia regulatory scheme.and indeed it is relevant.not only is the state of incorporation an easily applied criterion.by choosing to incorporate within a particular state,a corporation opts to identify itself with both state law and state process in a way that an corporation does not.james cox thomas lee hazen,treatise on the law of corporations ed.in selecting the state of incorporation,the corporation makes a decision not only as to the relevant statutory law but also as to the case law that will govern all corporate questions,including the duties of the corporation officers and directors and the rights of its stockholders.
appellants further contest the district court decision on the ground that the court improperly credited the testimony of the commonwealth expert over their expert analysis.appellants br.at.they argue that their expert established that the virginia law undisputedly and expressly favors granting cons to entities that have previously completed projects in the state.appellants br.at citing.admin.code.in other words,appellants expert concluded that the certificate requirement discriminates in favor of incumbent health care providers at the expense of new,predominantly firms.
we reject appellants argument as a matter of law,for incumbency bias in this context is not a surrogate for the negative impact on interstate commerce with which the dormant commerce clause is concerned.colon health,at.the dormant commerce clause is exclusively designed to address the differential treatment of and economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.granholm heald,internal quotation marks omitted.thus,what appellants label as an impermissible foray into a battle of the experts is a simple recognition of the fact that incumbency is not the focus of the dormant commerce clause.
allowing incumbency to serve as the proxy for status would be a risky proposition.one can be,for example,an incumbent recipient of some state contractual benefit without necessarily being an resident.in fact,the vitality of interstate commerce relies upon the ability of one state to have some allegedly incumbent companies of another state provide its citizens with needed goods and services.as the district court explained,u nder appellants view,the success rate of new applicants should be measured against the success rate of new applicants combined with every entity currently operating in virginia.this approach tips the scales in favor of new applicants it does not provide an accurate depiction of whether virginia program discriminates against interstate commerce.
finally,appellants specify that percent of ct scanner and mri machine manufacturers are located outside the state of virginia.appellants br.at.because medical imaging manufacturers are by definition entities,appellants assert that the burdens of virginia con requirement are anything but evenhanded.id.at.but that point is easily turned around.we think it axiomatic that there can be no discrimination in favor of manufacturers when there are no manufacturers in the state.how are we to properly assess,for example,whether the certificate requirement erects a special barrier to market entry by entities,colon health,at,when there is no domestic business with which to compare those entities 
we do not doubt that appellants are frustrated by the state legislature decision to impose a certificate requirement in this area.however,we will not take the potentially limitless step of striking down every state regulatory program that has some alleged adverse effect on market competition.we live in such an interconnected economy that for any regulation some effects are almost bound to be felt out of state.to accept appellants arguments would broaden the negative commerce clause beyond its existing scope,united haulers ass n,oneida herkimer solid waste mgmt,scalia,concurring,such that the states power to engage in economic regulation would be effectively destroyed.see am.motors sales div.of motor vehicles,cir.
even where a law does not facially,in effect,or purposefully discriminate against interstate commerce,we have in past cases undertaken a second analytical step,asking whether any of the law incidental burdens on interstate commerce might still be clearly excessive in relation to its putative local benefits.sandlands c d llc cty.of horry,cir quoting pike bruce church.our previous opinion in this case was skeptical of pike balancing test.we noted that the discriminatory effects test represents a superior framework of analysis and that the pike approach is often too soggy to properly cabin the judicial inquiry or effectively prevent the district court from assuming a role.colon health,at.because it so often casts judges into disputes involving subjective or technically difficult decisions properly committed to the discretion of state legislatures,pike balancing risks an unwarranted expansion of the judicial function.
pike balancing frequently requires judges to make highly subjective calls.w eighing or quantifying a law benefits and burdens may be a very subtle exercise.dep t of revenue of davis.the exercise is complicated by the difficulty of determining by what criteria benefits and burdens ought to be assessed.sometimes i t is a matter not of weighing apples against apples,but of deciding whether three apples are better than six tangerines.id.at scalia,concurring.making that decision often in turn requires one to decid e which interest is more important a policy call of the kind ordinarily entrusted to representative government.id.
judges are,for better or worse,not often economists or statisticians.we are to the empirical judgments of lawmakers concerning the utility of legislation.cts,at.simply put,there are cases in which the judicial branch is not institutionally suited to draw reliable conclusions of the kind that would be necessary to satisfy a pike burden.davis,at.the supreme court still generally leave s the courtroom door open to plaintiffs invoking the rule in pike,davis,at,and so we proceed to the merits of appellants argument.we do so only after recognizing our own institutional limitations,however,and only after giving due deference to the body whose primary responsibility it is to judge the benefits and burdens of virginia legislation the virginia legislature.
while the supreme court applies a virtual per se rule of invalidity to enforce the dormant commerce clause against plain attempts at local protectionism,laws which do not so discriminate face only less strict scrutiny.wyoming oklahoma.in identifying the putative local benefits to be weighed against incidental burdens on interstate commerce,pike,at,we therefore apply a rational basis standard of review.colon health,at.
virginia advances a number of legitimate interests in support of its con program.first,it argues that the con program boosts healthcare quality.the virginia health department designee erik bodin noted in deposition testimony that by reducing excess medical capacity,the con program may increase the quality of the care that being provided because the expertise of the people using the equipment and interpreting the results is higher.a subcommittee of the virginia general assembly similarly found that studies provide strong evidence that quantity and quality are closely related and experience and practice with complex procedures are assumed to increase skill and improve expertise.in other words,practice makes perfect,or at least familiarity with sophisticated medical devices is to be preferred to only infrequent use of them.in this regard,the con program helps ensure that new entrants do not overly dilute the market and thereby prevent medical personnel from practicing and performing procedures on a regular basis.
second,the con program may help underserved and indigent populations access needed medical care.certificates of need may be granted on the condition that the recipients provide a certain level of indigent care each year.ann.f ann.c.and applicants for certificates of need have at least on occasion use d their performance of charity care at a rate higher than the average as a factor in why they should be approved in the first place.bodin dep.the impact of all this may be substantial possibly in excess of several hundred million dollars of care for needy patients each year.id.at.such additional care would be impressive in any state,but it may be all the more so in virginia,which has few public hospitals,principally the university of virginia and virginia commonwealth university medical centers.without the assistance of private caregivers serving indigent patients,service at least in part motivated by the con program,those hospitals might be even more burdened than they already are.
a related purpose of the con program is geographical in nature.for reasons not difficult to discern,medical services tend to gravitate toward more affluent communities.the con program aims to mitigate that trend by incentivizing healthcare providers willing to set up shop in underserved or disadvantaged areas such as virginia eastern shore and far southwest.in determining whether to issue a certificate,for example,virginia considers the effects that the proposed service or facility will have on access to needed services in areas having distinct and unique geographic,socioeconomic,cultural,transportation,or other barriers to access to care.ann.b.
the con program may also aid underserved consumers in a more indirect fashion.by reducing competition in highly profitable operations,the program may provide existing hospitals with the revenue they need not only to provide indigents with care,but also to support but nonetheless important operations like trauma centers and neonatal intensive care units.appellants expert agreed in his deposition that hospitals have long been in the practice of unprofitable services with the profits from those that are profitable.it is perhaps no accident that the con applicants in this case sought to open
