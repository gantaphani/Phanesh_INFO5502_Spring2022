opinion of the court 
this matter is before us on the order of the supreme court of the united states dated june,which granted the petition for a writ of certiorari filed by dupont,vacated the judgment of this court,and remanded for further consideration in light of its opinion in united states atlantic research,d.in our earlier opinion,a majority of this court held that dupont could not pursue an action under cercla to recover from the united states a portion of its cleanup costs.the dissent would have held that dupont could maintain an action for cost recovery under of cercla.in light of the supreme court order,we return to the issue presented.
introduction 
appellants dupont de nemours,conocophillips,and sporting goods properties,collectively dupont or appellants own and operate industrial facilities throughout the united states that are contaminated with hazardous waste.dupont admits that it contaminated those sites,but alleges that the united states also contaminated parts of the sites.after dupont voluntarily cleaned up a site jointly polluted by both dupont and the government,dupont filed this suit under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et,seeking an order requiring the government to reimburse it for a share of the cleanup costs.the district court granted the motion of the united states for summary judgment.dupont de nemours united states,d.the district court thereafter entered judgment on the pleadings for the united states with respect to the remaining sites.dupont de nemours,dist.lexis,at.this court affirmed.
in the opinion accompanying the judgment,we held that two of our castle county halliburton nus,cir,and matter of reading,cir precluded dupont claims.see dupont de nemours united states,cir.we read our opinion in new castle county as barring potentially responsible parties from pursuing a cost recovery action under cercla a,a,thereby limiting potentially responsible parties to an express cause of action for contribution under cercla,id.in our opinion in reading,which was decided a few weeks after new castle county,we held that the statutory remedy in was the exclusive remedy for potentially responsible parties seeking contribution,thereby replacing any judicially created implied cause of action for contribution under.id.we held that because the supreme court decision in cooper industries,aviall services,d,limited use of to parties that cleaned up contaminated sites pursuant to an order adjudging them liable or who settled such an action,dupont,which had cleaned up voluntarily,had no viable claim.id.
subsequently,the supreme court decided united states atlantic research,d,holding that a private party may recover under voluntarily incurred cleanup costs from another party,including the government,without any establishment of liability to a third party.it is apparent that atlantic research impels us to reconsider our precedents.
statutory framework 
the apportionment of cleanup costs among the entities generally referred to as potentially responsible parties prps is set forth in the applicable provisions of cercla.congress enacted cercla in to address the serious environmental and health risks posed by pollution.united states bestfoods,d.cercla has two principal purposes.see morton int l,staley,cir.first,cercla is a remedial statute that grants the president broad power to command government agencies and private parties to clean up hazardous waste sites.key tronic united states,d.second,the statute requires everyone who is potentially responsible for contamination to contribute to the costs of cleanup.bestfoods,at.emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.
several sections of cercla are relevant to our discussion.
sections and 
cercla a provides that the united states may act to secure such relief as may be necessary to abate a substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance from a facility.a.cercla a defines covered persons,that is,the class of persons responsible for the costs incurred pursuant to or other sections,as follows 
the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility,
any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of,
any person who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment,or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment,of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,by any other party or entity,at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances,and 
any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities,incineration vessels or sites selected by such person,from which there is a release,or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs,of a hazardous substance 
section a a d provides that those covered persons shall be liable for 
a all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the united states government or a state or an indian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan 
b any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan 
c damages for injury to,destruction of,or loss of natural resources,including the reasonable costs of assessing such injury,destruction,or loss resulting from such a release and 
d the costs of any health assessment or health effects study carried out under section i of this title.
in,congress enacted the superfund amendments and reauthorization act sara,stat,which added to cercla.section f provides 
any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section a cercla a of this title,during or following any civil action under section cercla of this title or under section a cercla a of this title in resolving contribution claims,the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action for contribution in the absence of a civil action under section cercla of this title or section cercla of this title.
there are three subsections of that are of particular relevance.they provide that a prp that has resolved its liability to the united states or a state in an administrative or judicially approved settlement will not be liable for claims for contribution from other prps with respect to matters addressed in the settlement,id.f a settling prp may seek contribution from prps,id.f b and the statute of limitations for an action under a is six years,whereas the statute of limitations for an action under f is three years,id.g.
cercla a contains a waiver of the united states sovereign immunity.a.section a provides that e ach department,agency,and instrumentality of the united states shall be subject to,and comply with,this chapter in the same manner and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity,including liability under section cercla of this title.see fmc dep t of commerce,cir en banc w hen the government engages in activities that would make a private party liable under cercla if the private party engaged in those types of activities,then the government is also liable.emphasis omitted.
facts and procedural history 
as we noted in our earlier opinion,dupont owns fifteen facilities in various states,each of which is contaminated with hazardous waste dupont,at.the united states also owned each site during world war i,world war ii,the korean war.the united states polluted the sites during its period of ownership.
in january,dupont commenced this action against the government in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,seeking recovery for some of the cost of its voluntary cleanup efforts.the complaint alleged causes of action for cost recovery under a of cercla,as well as for contribution under f of cercla.dupont voluntarily dismissed its claims under a and for recoupment of costs without prejudice.in order to curtail the expenses of discovery,the district court designated the louisville,kentucky facility as a test case to determine whether dupont could maintain its action against the government.following completion of discovery,the government moved for summary judgment,arguing that dupont had no cause of action for contribution under because it was a prp that had voluntarily undertaken cleanup costs without having been sued or without settling its liability.
on december,the district court granted the government motion for summary judgment with respect to the louisville,kentucky site.dupont,d at.the district court concluded that because dupont had not been sued under or and had not otherwise settled its liability with respect to the louisville facility,it could not pursue an action for contribution under.see id.at.a contribution action under required,according to the district court,a prior or ongoing lawsuit.id.at.the district court had correctly foreseen the subsequent decision of the supreme court in that respect.
on march,the district court issued a ruling and order granting the government judgment on the pleadings with respect to the other fourteen sites.the district court concluded that the pleadings did not suggest any basis to conclude that the fourteen other sites would yield a different result than the louisville site.
dupont appealed.we stayed the appeal pending the supreme court decision in cooper industries,aviall services,d,which held that a party who had neither been held responsible following an action under or nor settled could not pursue a claim under.after the cooper industries opinion was filed,dupont argued that we should rule that as a matter of law,in light of cooper industries,dupont has a right of contribution under cercla that is independent of the remedy provided by,even in the absence of a civil action under or a prp,such as dupont,has a cause of action implied under cercla to recover an equitable share of response costs from another prp pursuant to the text of a b or federal common law even in the absence of a prior or pending or civil action or a f b settlement the district court erred by declining to imply a right of contribution based on any other provision of cercla and that the decision in cooper industries demolished the assumptions underlying our analysis in reading and the district court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings by dismissing dupont f contribution claims with respect to all fifteen sites.
on august,a divided panel of this court issued an opinion,principally affirming the district court judgment.dupont,at.dupont filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court.on june,the court granted the writ.see dupont de nemours united states,d.the court vacated the judgment and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of atlantic research.id.we asked the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the effect of atlantic research on the issues in this case.
rights of a prp under cercla and sara 
the district court grant of summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings is subject to plenary review.see sikirica nationwide ins,cir on review,we construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the party,and j udgment will not be granted unless the movant clearly establishes there are no material issues of fact,and he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.at.questions of statutory interpretation are also subject to plenary review.lafferty riel,cir.
although our precedents,new castle county and reading,counseled that dupont could not maintain a cause of action against the united states for cost recovery of voluntarily incurred cleanup expenses under cercla,the supreme court decision in atlantic research causes us to reevaluate our precedents.notwithstanding this court strict adherence to our precedents,we have made clear that those precedents may be reevaluated when there has been intervening authority.see george harms constr.chao,cir we recognize that we may reevaluate a precedent in light of intervening authority even without en banc consideration.reich sabia,cir although a panel of this court is bound by,and lacks authority to overrule,a published decision of a prior panel,a panel may reevaluate a precedent in light of intervening authority.
even though we must be particularly cautious in revisiting cases involving questions of statutory interpretation,a reevaluation of precedent is appropriate in this case.as the supreme court has explained,in cases where statutory precedents have been overruled,the primary reason for the court shift in position has been the intervening development of the law,through either the growth of judicial doctrine or further action taken by congress.where such changes have removed or weakened the conceptual underpinnings from the prior decision,or where the later law has rendered the decision irreconcilable with competing legal doctrines or policies,the court has not hesitated to overrule an earlier decision.patterson mclean credit union,d citations omitted.
the supreme court decision in atlantic research is such intervening authority.it impels us to reevaluate our holdings in reading and new castle county because atlantic research weakens the conceptual underpinnings of those decisions.
section states that various parties,including the owner or operator of a facility,may be responsible for any necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan,a b,and provides a cause of action to parties that incur cleanup costs but have not themselves been sued under or.for years after the enactment of cercla,district courts almost unanimously found that contained an implied cause of action for contribution.see,united states new castle county,holding that contribution right arises under federal common law colorado asarco,same wehner syntex agribusiness,holding that contribution right is implied from language of e.however,with the enactment of,the courts turned to that section and away from to provide the cause of action.
as we noted briefly above,we too veered away from in our decision in new castle county,where we stated that provided a potentially responsible person with the appropriate vehicle to recoup that portion of its expenditures which exceeds its fair share of the overall liability.at.we further held that a section action brought for recovery of costs may be brought only by innocent parties that have undertaken.id.at emphasis in original similarly,in reading,we held that a potentially responsible party may not seek contribution under a b.in fact,we stated f specifically permits an action for contribution to be brought in the absence of civil action under section.at internal punctuation and quotation marks omitted.
the trend toward application of was halted by the supreme court decision in cooper industries,where the court held that the plain language of f does not allow prps to bring contribution actions unless and until a related civil action is brought against them under either or.at.the court reserved judgment on the question whether prps who are not subject to an action under or may instead seek relief under a b.
in reading and new castle county,we assumed that all potentially responsible whose responsibility had been adjudicated and those who voluntarily admitted their potentially responsible parties who could recoup losses by bringing suit pursuant to f.cooper industries changed that premise,however,by holding that only a party who has in fact been held responsible via adjudication or settlement with the epa may bring an action under f,whereas a party who concedes it is a prp but whose responsibility has not been established may not.after the cooper industries decision,therefore,a prp that had not been subject to suit or settled its liability had no recourse to recover cleanup costs under cercla because under our precedents it could not bring a claim,and under cooper industries,it could not bring a claim.
following the decision in cooper industries,the court of appeals for the eighth circuit considered the effe
