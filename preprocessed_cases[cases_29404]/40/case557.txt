in,congress enacted the mccarran amendment,a law that waived the sovereign immunity of the united states in suits for the general adjudication or administration of water rights.this appeal turns on the scope of that waiver.
the underlying litigation flows from puerto rico efforts to impose restrictions on the extraction of water from a river known as the rio blanco.the commonwealth asserts that the mccarran amendment divests the united states of its sovereign immunity in respect to the compelled participation of the united states navy in administrative proceedings concerning that subject,commenced pursuant to puerto rico law of waters,laws ann.disagreeing with this assertion,the navy asked the united states district court for the district of puerto rico for surcease.the district court stayed the administrative proceedings pending final resolution of the suit.in due course,the court found the mccarran amendment inapplicable and granted the navy sanctuary.see united states puerto rico,d.
although our reasoning differs significantly from the district court,we too hold that the mccarran amendment does not waive the sovereign immunity of the united states with respect to the administrative proceedings here at issue.the mccarran amendment speaks of suits,and the local proceedings,instituted by the commonwealth department of natural and environmental resources dner under the law of waters,can not be so characterized.
background 
insofar as pertinent here,the facts are uncontroversial.during world war ii,the navy began construction of the united states naval station at roosevelt roads nsrr.to ensure an adequate supply,the navy obtained a permit the permit from the puerto rico public service commission to withdraw up to ten cubic feet per second from the rio blanco.the navy then proceeded to construct a primary water intake in the tailrace of a hydroelectric power plant and an emergency intake just upstream of the plant.shortly thereafter,a federal agency acquired title to the hydroelectric plant and conveyed it to the puerto rico water resources authority prwra.in consideration of the conveyance,the prwra issued a permit the permit granting the federal government the right to continue the use,operation,and maintenance of the water supply system free of charge for as long as the nsrr remained operational 
puerto rico enacted the law of waters in.the statute directs the secretary of the dner to formulate an integrated plan for conservation,development,and use of the commonwealth water resources,laws ann.a,set water consumption priorities,id.e,and establish and administer a system that allocates water based on those priorities,id.j.the statute contemplates the issuance of permits for the drilling of water wells and the granting of franchises for the utilization of surface waters.id.
the statutory regime further provides that when a body of water lacks sufficient volume to meet the demands that are made upon it,the secretary may institute a process to allocate the available water among competing claimants.id.the statute grants affected parties the right to a hearing before the hearing that incorporates the right to counsel,the right to present evidence,and similar procedural protections.id.although the statute terms such hearings,no court officer is involved the details of the process are spelled out in the dner regulations,and the secretary decision is final unless an aggrieved party seeks review within thirty days in a court of first instance.id.
in,the dner,acting under the law of waters,admonished the navy that it needed to update its franchise for diverting water from the rio blanco.thinking this a mere formality,the navy submitted a renewal application.the secretary never acted upon the application,claiming that it was incomplete.
the matter remained on the back burner until july,when the dner served the navy with a order.this order rested on the premise that the navy was withdrawing water from the rio blanco without a valid franchise and thereby transgressing the law of waters.after some intermittent contacts,marked chiefly by bureaucratic wrangling,the secretary issued a second order,dated october,directing the navy to initiate a franchise request for the primary and emergency water intake locations,install metering devices to measure water extraction from both intakes,reimburse the commonwealth for prior water consumption,and pay provisional user fees until its water rights claims were administratively determined.this order informed the navy,in no uncertain terms,that it was obliged to participate in franchise application proceedings,and that the dner might ultimately grant or deny a franchise,taking into account the needs of the entire community of the area.
dismayed by the dner dismissive attitude toward its rights under the and permits,the navy sued the commonwealth and the secretary.its complaint asked the federal district court both to enjoin the defendants from enforcing the dner orders,and to confirm the navy right to withdraw water from the rio blanco as provided in the and permits.the navy advanced a golconda of arguments in support of these prayers for relief,alleging,inter alia,that the permit bestowed an affirmative right to withdraw water from the rio blanco free of charge,and that the secretary efforts to plunge the navy into administrative water use proceedings infringed the sovereign immunity of the united states.the defendants took a much dimmer view of the combined force and effect of the navy permits.in addition,they maintained that the ongoing dner proceedings fell within the waiver of sovereign immunity effected by the mccarran amendment.
on november,the district court enjoined all dner proceedings against the navy pendente lite.the defendants then moved to dismiss the action.pertinently,they posited that the waiver contained in the mccarran amendment extended to administrative proceedings of the type and kind initiated by the secretary under the law of waters.the navy opposed the motion.in regard to the sovereign immunity issue,it advanced several reasons why the mccarran amendment did not pave the way for the dner proceeding.among other things,the navy asseverated that the proceeding was not a general adjudication of the sort envisioned by the mccarran amendment,but,rather,a purely administrative proceeding limited to a single user.
in response,the defendants reiterated their argument that the administrative proceedings were covered by the mccarran amendment.they suggested that the particular administrative proceeding they had initiated was merely the first in a series of proceedings which,in due course,would involve other water rights claimants.to emphasize this last point,the defendants moved on january,for a limited modification of the stay in order to permit them to join other parties in the ongoing administrative proceeding and carry out a general allocation referable to the rio blanco.
the district court denied both motions on march,and set the case for trial.on may,the court reversed its field and advised the parties that it would address the issues raised by the defendants motion to dismiss in advance of trial.roughly four weeks later,the court issued an opinion that not only denied the motion to dismiss but also declared that federal sovereign immunity barred the secretary from compelling the navy to participate in the ongoing administrative proceeding the court based this conclusion on the fact that the navy water rights antedated the mccarran amendment.see united states puerto rico,d at.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
although a plethora of other interesting questions lurk in the penumbra of this case,we deem the sovereign immunity issue dispositive.consequently,we start by describing the legal framework applicable to that issue,explain briefly why we reject the district court rationale,and then proceed to the merits.since the existence vel non of sovereign immunity here depends upon a question of waiver,and that question in turn depends on statutory construction,we afford plenary review.strickland comm r,me.dep t of human,cir.
