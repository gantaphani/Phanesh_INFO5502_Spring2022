the city of travelers rest,south carolina the city,has a significant interest in ensuring that its streets and sidewalks remain safe,orderly,and accessible.see madsen women health,d.this case concerns whether a local parade ordinance,enacted by the city to effectuate that significant interest,is consistent with the first amendment.the city appeals a decision of the district court striking down two sections of the ordinance as facially unconstitutional.timothy cox appeals a decision of the district court dismissing his challenge to the ordinance and rejecting his claim for damages.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
facial challenge 
cox is a citizen of south carolina who frequently engages in protests throughout the state.in june,he and approximately individuals were standing on a public sidewalk in the city,holding signs,praying,sharing their religious beliefs,and handing out pamphlets that advocated alternatives to abortion.though never arrested,the demonstrators were informed by travelers rest police officers that they were in violation of travelers rest ordinance ch.the ordinance,which provides that i t is unlawful for any person to organize,hold or participate in any parade,meeting,exhibition,assembly or procession of persons vehicles on the streets or sidewalks of the city,unless such activity shall have first been authorized by a written permit.travelers rest,ordinance cox filed this action challenging the ordinance as facially unconstitutional under the first amendment.see const.amend.i.the district court ruled that the ordinance violated the first amendment to the extent that it require d small gatherings,including sole protestors,to obtain a permit before protesting in a public forum,and to the extent that it prohibited issuing permits for activities that would occur between and on sundays,see ordinance.we agree with the district court that both of these sections of the ordinance violate the first amendment.
an ordinance that requires individuals or groups to obtain a permit before engaging in protected speech is a prior restraint on speech.see shuttlesworth city of birmingham,d.although a city may be justified in setting forth regulations and ordinances requiring advance parade permits as a traditional exercise of control by the local government,reyes city of lynchburg,cir,any permit scheme controlling the time,place,and manner of speech must not be based on the content of the message,must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,and must leave open ample alternatives for communication,forsyth county nationalist movement,d.to be narrowly tailored,an ordinance need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of effectuating the relevant interests,ward rock against racism,d,but it may not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government legitimate interests,id.at.as a prior restraint,the ordinance is laden with a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity,bantam books,sullivan,d,and the city bears the burden of proving its constitutionality,see new york times united states,d per curiam.
the district court ruled,and neither party questions on appeal,that the ordinance is not and that it leaves open ample alternatives for communication.thus,the only issue before us is whether the district court correctly decided that the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to the extent that it applies to small gatherings of individuals and to the extent that it absolutely prohibits the activities on sunday mornings.
lack of exception 
this circuit has not yet decided whether a permit requirement that does not contain an exception for small gatherings can nevertheless be narrowly tailored to effectuate a city legitimate interest in maintaining the safety,order,and accessibility of its streets and sidewalks.in united states johnson,cir,however,we upheld a permit requirement that applied to groups of or more seeking access to,and use of,national forest system land.see johnson,at.there,the department of agriculture argued that its permit requirement was necessary for three purposes to protect resources and improvements on national forest system lands,allocate space among potential or existing uses and activities,and address concerns of public health and safety.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we ruled that t he permit requirement serves these three goals in a narrowly tailored manner by providing a minimally intrusive system to notify forest service personnel of any large groups that will be using the forest.id.at emphasis added.
unlike the permit requirement at issue in johnson,the ordinance is not limited to large groups.the city concedes that the ordinance applies to gatherings of only a few people and that on at least one occasion a group of only three applied for a permit.however,the city disputes the conclusion of the district court that the ordinance applies even to only one individual protester.the city argues that the ordinance can only be reasonably read to apply to expression by more than one person,emphasizing that the ordinance prohibits only a parade,meeting,exhibition,assembly or procession of persons vehicles ordinance emphasis added 
we need not choose between these competing interpretations,for even if we accept the city interpretation,we nevertheless believe that the unflinching application of the ordinance to groups as small as two or three renders it constitutionally infirm.it is worth noting,first,that the ordinance applies to political speech,which is at the core of the first amendment,shapero.bar ass n,d.the burdens placed on such treasured expression by the ordinance are substantial.both the procedural hurdle of filling out and submitting a written application,and the temporal hurdle of waiting for the permit to be granted may discourage potential speakers.grossman city of portland,cir.and,because of the delay caused by complying with the permitting procedures,immediate speech can no longer respond to immediate issues.id.alteration internal quotation marks omitted.
the city argues that the ordinance need not contain a exception because s afety issues remain whether the parade or protest is large or small.joint answering opening br.city br.at.some small but particularly inflammatory protests may be a greater security concern than even much larger ones,the city argues,and s mall towns with limited resources need advance warning of even small protests to adequately police the events.id.at.but,the city fails to explain how a small demonstration that may become inflammatory would tax its police force any differently than,for example,a street fight between two individuals,so as to justify requiring advance warning of all small demonstrations.while it may be true that the permit requirement succeeds in mitigating the potential of any of the activities listed in the ordinance to threaten the safety,order,and accessibility of city streets and sidewalks,it does so at too high a cost,namely,by significantly restricting a substantial quantity of speech that does not impede the city permissible goals.cmty.for creative turner.
a few simple examples illustrate the overbreadth of the ordinance.consider three friends who are walking along the sidewalk in travelers rest.they come upon a newspaper stand displaying a headline that outrages them.so moved by the headline,they walk to the end of the street and hold up handmade signs protesting the headline.even if their expression does nothing to disturb the peace,block the sidewalk,or interfere with traffic,the ordinance renders it criminal.see grossman,at spontaneous expression,which is often the most effective kind of expression,is prohibited by the o rdinance.only had they first visited the city administrator assuming his office was open at the time,filed the appropriate permit application,and obtained a permit would the threesome have been permitted under the ordinance to engage in the protest.similarly,the ordinance criminalizes a small meeting of individuals who gather on the sidewalk in travelers rest to hand out religious tracts without first obtaining a permit,even if their expression does nothing to di
