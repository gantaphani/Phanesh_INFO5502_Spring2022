political discrimination 
employment decisions with respect to civil servants in career positions may violate the first and fourteenth amendments if they are motivated by an employee exercise of constitutionally protected first amendment freedoms,such as membership in or activism on behalf of a political party.healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.to establish a prima facie case of political discrimination,a plaintiff must show that his conduct was constitutionally protected,and that this conduct was a substantial factor or to put it in other words,that it was a motivating factor in an adverse employment decision.id.at.in order to be redressable,an alleged adverse employment decision must result in conditions unreasonably inferior to the norm for that position.velazco,cir.the plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion on the prima facie case.santiago,cir.once a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of political discrimination,the burden then shifts to the state to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to plaintiff employment even in the absence of the protected conduct.healthy,at.
