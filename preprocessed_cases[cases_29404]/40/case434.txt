plaintiff,daniel carpenter carpenter,filed a freedom of information act foia,request with the united states attorney office usao for the district of massachusetts requesting documents that a third party provided to the usao in connection with the government investigation and prosecution of plaintiff business activities.this appeal is taken from a district court order granting summary judgment for defendants,the united states department of justice and the usao for the district of massachusetts the government,and thereby denying carpenter foia request.on appeal,carpenter maintains that the requested materials are subject to disclosure because the public interest in disclosure outweighs any privacy interest maintained in the materials.we affirm the district court order.
background 
by letter dated august,carpenter filed a foia request with the usao in boston.carpenter petitioned for materials that a third party,john koresko,koresko,allegedly provided to the usao in support of the government prosecution of carpenter business activities according to carpenter,he and koresko are direct competitors in the field of welfare benefit plan design and administration.carpenter alleges that koresko provided information and materials to the usao,on which his indictment was based,and that he needs the materials to ensure that koresko did not provide false or misleading materials.the foia request,therefore,sought to compel disclosure of a ll documents,correspondence,records or files provided by or obtained from koresko that related to carpenter businesses,welfare plans or criminal prosecution,or reflect any conversation with koresko.
after several rounds of correspondence and because the government failed to respond to the foia request within the statutory time limit,a a,carpenter filed this foia suit on january.the government responded to both the foia request and the lawsuit by declining to either confirm or deny the existence of the requested materials a glomar response and asserting that any such records would be exempt from disclosure carpenter moved for summary judgment on june,and the government for summary judgment on july,
after conducting an in camera review,the district court denied carpenter motion for summary judgment and granted the government for summary judgment via an endorsement order the district court held that the materials at issue were exempt from disclosure under exemption c of the foia,which exempts from disclosure records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes but only to the extent that such information could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b c.
carpenter filed a timely motion for reconsideration,arguing that the court had erred in relying upon quinon fbi,in reaching its decision.on december,the district court denied plaintiff motion.this appeal followed.
our review of the district court determination that the materials are exempt from disclosure is de novo.church of scientology int l dep t of justice,cir.our discussion begins with a general review of the foia standards and its exemptions.
ii.discussion 
the foia was intended to expose the operations of federal agencies to the light of public scrutiny.dep t of the air force rose,d providence journal dep t of the army,cir noting that the foia seeks to prevent the development and application of a body of secret law.the basic policy of full agency disclosure within the foia furthers the right of citizens to know what their government is up to,dep t of justice reporters comm.for freedom of the press,d quoting epa mink,d douglas,dissenting,and promotes an informed citizenry,which is vital to democracy.nlrb robbins tire rubber,d.thus,in response to a foia request,a governmental agency must make promptly available to any person those materials in the possession of the agency,unless the agency can establish that the materials fall within one of nine exemptions.a.
to effectuate the goals of the foia while safeguarding the efficient administration of the government,the foia provides that certain categories of materials are exempted from the general requirements of disclosure.id.b providence journal,at.the nine foia exemptions are to be construed narrowly,with any doubts resolved in favor of disclosure.dep t of justice julian,d providence journal,at.the government bears the burden of proving that withheld materials fall within one of the statutory exemptions,a b orion research,epa,cir,and district courts are required to make de novo determinations as to the validity of the asserted exemptions.a b see also reporters,at.providence journal,at.
exemption c formed the sole basis for the district court determination that the requested materials need not be disclosed.
this exemption permits an agency to withhold records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes but only to the extent that the production of such materials could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.b c.the application of exemption c requires the court to balance the privacy interest at stake in revealing the materials with the public interest in their release.reporters,at.maynard cia,cir.
a.the privacy interest 
the privacy interest protected by exemption c is not a cramped or limited notion of personal privacy.see reporters,at.instead,exemption c protects a broad notion of personal privacy,including an individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.id.at.this notion of privacy encompass es the individual control of information concerning his or her person,and when,how,and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.id.at.the individual,and not the agency in possession of the records,controls the privacy interest.see reporters,at.sherman dep t of the army,cir providing that the individual controls the privacy interest at stake in foia exemptions.
furthermore,where the provider of the information or records is a private individual,the privacy interest is at its apex.reporters,at.archives records admin.favish,d.in reporters committee,the supreme court pointed to the provisions of the foia allowing the redaction of an individual identifying information and the segregation of exempt portions of the record in concluding that the disclosure of records regarding private citizens,identifiable by name,is not what the framers of the foia had in mind.at.the central purpose of the foia is to reveal government action,not to expose the actions of private third parties and their participation in law enforcement to the public.see id.at.t he foia central purpose is to ensure that the government activities be opened to the sharp eye of public scrutiny,not that information about private citizens that happens to be in the warehouse of the government be so disclosed.with this general understanding of the privacy interest protected by exemption c,we turn to the facts at hand.
carpenter brought this foia action to compel disclosure of information or records provided by or concerning koresko in connection with the government investigation and prosecution of carpenter business activities.we agree with the district court that a person need not be the subject of the investigation to have a substantial privacy interest in maintaining the secrecy of his involvement with the investigation.see maynard,at fitzgibbon cia.rather,precedents suggest that individuals maintain a privacy interest under the foia in their identity as government informants and in not being positively associated with a criminal matter.see,maynard,at fitzgibbon,at.
although koresko is not,strictly speaking,a government informant,his privacy interest is analogous to that of an informant.this court has long protected the identities of witnesses and informants in law enforcement records.maynard,at stating that fbi agents,support personnel,confidential sources,and investigatory targets all have significant privacy interests in not having their names revealed new england apple council donovan,cir see also fitzgibbon,at p ersons involved in fbi if they are not the subject of the investigation have a substantial interest in seeing that their part
