these appeals are distinctive in two respects.first,they require us to ponder a question of first impression under the employee retirement income security act erisa,which concerns the operation of erisa minimum funding requirement.see id.second,the appeals provide us with an opportunity to discuss,for the first time,the supreme court recent teachings in hardt reliance standard life insurance,which clarified the operation of erisa section g,g.the tale follows.
background 
the underlying action was brought by the gastronomical workers union local metropolitan hotel association pension fund the fund,a pension plan covered by erisa,and the trustees of the fund.the fund,as an entity,was dismissed by the district court for lack of standing,and that ruling is not challenged on appeal.we therefore refer to the trustees as the plaintiffs.
the complaint named the eleven employers who composed the metropolitan hotel association as defendants.along with local,these employers were parties to a collective bargaining agreement cba,which had been renegotiated and renewed from time to time.a current iteration of the cba remains in effect.it provides in pertinent part that the employers will make periodic contributions to the fund.in the first instance,the cba for any given year effectively dictates the amounts to be contributed by a particular employer.
local and the employers established the fund in,by means of a declaration of trust.its primary purpose is to provide pensions for eligible employees.
the fund operates on a may fiscal year.erisa mandates that covered pension plans,such as the fund,must meet the statutory minimum funding standard in each fiscal year.see erisa section.when a plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirement for a given year,the plan make additional contributions to bridge the gap.see id.a b.in a plan,this responsibility is shared among participating employers.see id.c a.
the focal point of this case is the fund plan year.the cba then in effect provided for employer contributions of per eligible employee per month.in the spring of,the fund actuary determined that these contributions would not be adequate to allow the fund to satisfy erisa minimum funding standard.the actuary projected that an additional sum of would be needed.erisa allows employers a grace period of eight and months after the end of a plan fiscal year within which to cure an accumulated funding deficiency.see c.with this in mind,the actuary calculated that the necessary sum could be raised by increased employer contributions of per eligible employee per month.
the cba recognized that the agreed contribution levels might have to be adjusted if and when an actuarial evaluation indicated a funding shortfall.in that event,the parties promised to seek to reach an agreement as to an increase in the contributions stipulated in the cba.presumably with this language in mind,the trustees,by letter dated may,notified the employers of the projected deficiency for plan year and advised them that increased monthly contributions,as recommended by the actuary,would be required beginning june.the employers turned a deaf ear to this importuning,eschewing any increased contributions.
on march,the fund filed form with the internal revenue service irs,reporting an accumulated funding deficiency of for the plan year.the trustees notified the employers that they had reported a funding deficiency in this amount to the irs.
the principal enforcement mechanism for the repair of minimum funding deficiencies is the imposition of excise tax penalties.see,see also lee,comm r,cir the excise tax was intended by congress to enforce compliance with the minimum funding requirements.if a pension plan has a minimum funding deficiency that is not corrected by additional employer contributions within eight and months of the end of the plan year,the employer becomes liable for a mandatory excise tax of five percent of the amount of the deficiency.a.if the deficiency is not thereafter seasonably corrected,an additional tax,equal to one hundred percent of the funding deficiency,is imposed.id.b,c.
on may,the fund requested a waiver with respect to the accumulated funding deficiency for plan year.to date,the irs has not acted on this application.
during calendar,one employer,dorado beach hotel dbhc,withdrew from the fund.erisa requires an employer who wishes to withdraw from a plan to continue contributing toward its vested but unfunded liabilities,accrued as of the date of its withdrawal,until those liabilities are fully funded.see id.the trustees,acting on actuarial advice,promulgated a schedule of dbhc monthly withdrawal liability payments.dbhc began complying with this payment schedule.
in february of,the trustees advised dbhc that the fund would not meet the minimum funding requirement for the plan year unless it received in additional contributions within the cure period.dbhc agreed to make a payment in that amount in exchange for a favorable variance in its scheduled withdrawal liability payments.dbhc and the fund entered into a similar arrangement for the plan year the former again advanced to enable the latter to avoid a looming minimum funding deficiency for the plan year and again received a favorable variance in the previously amended schedule of withdrawal liability payments.
ii.travel of the case 
on march,the trustees commenced an action against the employers in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.the trustees brought this action under a,which supplies a cause of action in favor of an erisa fiduciary a to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of erisa or the terms of the plan or b to obtain other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of erisa or the terms of the plan the scope of the action has narrowed over time out of eleven employers originally named as defendants,only two,dbhc and la mallorquina,remain in the case.seven employers have settled,and two others have defaulted.
pertinently,the trustees alleged that the employers failed to make sufficient payments to keep the fund in compliance with erisa minimum funding requirement,erisa section a,a,for plan year.they sought equitable relief,including an injunction,an order requiring the employers to contribute the additional monies needed to satisfy the minimum funding requirement for plan year,liquidated damages,attorneys fees,interest,and costs.
the employers moved to dismiss,asserting that i their liability for fund contributions was limited to the schedule of contributions described in the cba,and ii the trustees lacked standing to sue.the district court denied the motion.gastronomical workers union dorado beach hotel gw i,d.the part of the district court ruling that resolved the issue of standing is not challenged on appeal.
in due course,the trustees moved for summary judgment,seeking judgment against each employer for its pro rata share of the accumulated funding deficiency for plan year,along with liquidated damages,prejudgment interest,attorneys fees,and costs under erisa section g,g.the employers opposed this motion and for summary judgment in their favor.
the district court granted the trustees motion to the extent that it sought enforcement of the minimum funding requirement for plan year.gastronomical workers union dorado beach hotel gw ii,civ,slip op.at.the court ruled that the employers were liable under section for additional sums needed to cure the funding deficiency.id.at.the court refused,however,to grant any ancillary relief.id.at.at the same time,the court denied the.id.the court entered a judgment against each employer for a dollar amount representing that employer pro rata share of the accumulated funding deficiency that had been reported at the end of the plan year.
invoking federal rule of civil procedure d and erisa section g,g,the trustees filed a postjudgment motion for attorneys fees,interest,and costs.the district court denied this motion without comment.both sides appealed,and we consolidated the two appeals.
iii.analysis 
the employers appeal and the trustees appeal focus on different aspects of the district court orders.we address them sequentially.
a.the employers appeal.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the trustees on their minimum funding requirement claim.see,kouvchinov parametric tech,cir.we assay the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most hospitable to the parties against whom summary judgment was granted here,the employers.id.if the record,so viewed,demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and the moving parties entitlement to judgment as a matter of law,we will uphold the order.see see also.c.
resolving the employers appeal requires an understanding of the statutory framework.congress has mandated that erisa plans must meet a minimum funding standard for each plan year.a.a plan satisfies this standard if as of the end of such plan year the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency.id.leaving to one side the series of adjustments needed to reach that determination,an accumulated funding deficiency occurs when a plan liabilities exceed its assets.see id.a,b.when a pension plan has an accumulated funding deficiency at the end of the plan year,the participating employer s must make sufficient additional payments to erase the deficiency.otherwise,the employers face substantial excise tax liabilities.see id.c a see also uaw keystone consol,cir.a failure to make contributions required for this purpose also may be enforced by means of a civil action brought under a.see mcmahon mcdowell,cir see also,at,reprinted in,explaining that the responsible employer may be subject to civil action in the courts on failure to meet the minimum funding standards.employers have up to eight and months beyond the end of a plan year within which to remedy an accumulated funding deficiency.c.
in the case at hand,certain critical facts are not in dispute.first,the fund actuarial computations are unchallenged.thus,we can take as true that the fund had an accumulated funding deficiency of at the end of the plan year and required additional employer contributions to offset this shortfall.second,the allocation methodology with respect to that deficiency that is,the division of the total funds needed among the participating employers is not controverted on appeal.thus,the amounts at issue are the amount of the judgment against dbhc and the amount of the judgment against la mallorquina.finally,it is uncontradicted that no additional contributions to the fund were made during the eight and months next following the end of the plan year.
in their appeal,the employers argue that the district court erred because i the suit is not ripe ii the cba foreclosed the trustees from seeking increased employer contributions iii the accumulated funding deficiency was attributable to trustee mismanagement and,therefore,not properly chargeable against the employers and iv the accumulated funding deficiency no longer exists.we confront these arguments in turn.
ripeness.under erisa,the minimum funding requirement is enforced,in part,by the imposition of an excise tax to punish noncompliance.see.the irs,in its sole discretion,may waive strict compliance with the minimum funding requirement upon timely application.lee,at.
to obtain a waiver,the employer must demonstrate that it has experienced a substantial business hardship,which impedes its ability to make the necessary contributions in a timely manner.a b.if the irs grants the waiver,the employer is exempted from the excise tax,the plan account is credited with the amount of the deficiency,and the employer becomes obligated to pay that amount,with interest,on an extended amortization schedule of up to fifteen years.see id.see also.because the irs has not yet acted upon the waiver application filed in connection with the fund plan year,dbhc maintains that the trustees suit is unripe.
it is common ground that federal courts may adjudicate only actual cases and controversies.see const.art.iii daimlerchrysler cuno,ernst young depositors econ.prot,cir.an array of doctrinal safeguards ensures the integrity of this justicibility principle.ripeness is one such doctrine that is rooted in both constitutional and prudential considerations.see ernst young,at.
courts evaluate whether a case is ripe by assessing the fitness for adjudication of the issue presented and determining whether a refusal to adjudicate that issue will work a hardship on the party who seeks a remedy.see ass of realtors,whitehouse,cir.fitness involves questions about whether the necessary factual predicate is sufficiently matured to allow a court to resolve the issue presented.see id.hardship typically turns upon whether the challenged action creates a direct and immediate dilemma for the parties.id.quoting ernst young,at.
this case is ripe for adjudication.all of the events giving the existence of the accumulated funding deficiency for plan year and the employers responsibility for it are matters of historical fact.moreover,it is clear that,if the trustees version of those events is accurate,the fund has suffered an injury.a refusal to adjudicate the parties conflicting claims would serve only to delay the vindication of that injury.consequently,there is a matured dispute between the parties,ripe for adjudication.
dbhc,though couched as a claim of lack of ripeness,is really something quite different.fairly viewed,that claim does not suggest that the trustees have alleged a speculative injury,the existence of which depends upon future events that may or may not occur.rather,the claim is that a future event may change the type of remedy available to redress an existing injury.consequently,it is the future event,not the trustees injury,that is speculative.viewed in this light,dbhc argument is not a ripeness argument at all.see,me.med,cir citing charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure,at ed demauro demauro,cir.
the cba defense.belaboring the obvious,the employers next declaim that,under erisa,the duty to contribute to a pension plan is contractual in nature.see see also laborers health welfare trust fund advanced lightweight concrete.the cba in effect here contains an,schedule of such contributions.because the employers paid these contributions as required under the cba,this argument runs,they have no further payment responsibilities notwithstanding the occurrence of an accumulated funding deficiency.
we agree with the employers that pension contribution obligations are contractual in nature.int l of painters allied trades union george kracher.but this tenet does not exist in a vacuum.whatever a private contract may provide,erisa continues to govern employers funding obligation with respect to covered pension plans.see advanced lightweight concrete,at.the statutory mandates operate in tandem with contractually imposed duties.see hughes aircraft jacobson,keystone consol,at.when a plan fails to meet the statutorily imposed minimum funding requirement for a given plan year,the employer must satisfy that requirement by making further payments,regardless of the terms of the cba.see a.the statutory obligation is independent of whatever arrangements private agreements may contemplate.see hughes aircraft,at esden bank of,cir stating that t he plan can not contract around erisa.
were the rule otherwise,parties could elude erisa commands by the simple expedient of sharp bargaining.this result,intolerable in itself,also would frustrate one of erisa primary goals to ensure that covered pension plans provide employees promised retirement benefits.see nachman pension ben.guar.corp,in re merrimac paper,cir.we hold,therefore,that an employer can not shield itself from erisa liability under section simply by performing its obligations under a collective bargaining agreement.
here,the contributions dictated by the cba proved insufficient,in the plan year,to allow the fund to satisfy erisa minimum funding requirement.accordingly,additional contributions sufficient to eliminate that deficiency were required.those contributions were the employers collective responsibility,over and above the payments described in the cba.
