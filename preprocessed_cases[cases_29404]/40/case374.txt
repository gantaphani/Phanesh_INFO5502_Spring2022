the suit was filed against rey and others by a group of drivers and two of their spouses,by a probationary attorney edith and by luis,an investigator who had served the secretary in the previous administration.each plaintiff claimed to have suffered injury resulting from political discrimination in violation of the first amendment and subject to redress under section.rutan republican party of,d.
the case was tried twice.on the first attempt,in may and june,the jury deadlocked and a mistrial was declared.in a retrial in october and november,the jury returned a verdict largely in the plaintiffs favor on november.because the case embraced four different mini trials with different parties and different episodes,we do no more here than summarize the verdicts as modified after motions.
seven drivers obtained verdicts against rey and lizzette,who was rey assistant secretary for human resources,based on the drivers transfer to a central transportation pool and loss of overtime pay.the awards ranged from to in compensatory damages with nominal awards for punitive damages.
the same seven drivers prevailed against jose,the supervisor of the office to which they were transferred,for alleged acts of harassment.sauri was held liable with rey and pillich with no allocation of damages as between transfer and harassment claims.
edith,who worked as a probationary attorney in the legal division of the department,was awarded plus nominal punitive damages against carmen,the new director of the division who had evaluated and terminated.
luis was awarded in compensatory damages against rey and motta and a further in punitive damages against motta.garcia had accused both of fostering administrative charges against him that led to temporary suspension and delayed his intended retirement.
the district court also granted equitable relief in light of the jury findings.specifically,the court ordered that a plan be adopted to ensure that overtime work not be distributed to career drivers based on political affiliation that perez be reinstated and that an admonishment be expunged from garcia employment file.plaintiffs counsel were awarded attorneys fees in the amount of.

the supreme court,in a set of decisions beginning with elrod burns,d,has declared it to be a violation of the first amendment for government officials to take adverse least of a certain level of severity and with certain other government employees based on their political party affiliation the rationale is to avoid chilling the employees rights of political free speech and association.rutan,at.
inevitably,the case law recognizes that political affiliation is a legitimate touchstone for or those who serve in a confidential capacity.elrod,at.often,but not always,this category overlaps with those not protected by civil service laws,called trust employees in puerto rico.nor does liability attach where an adverse employment action,even though resting in part on political motives,would have been taken anyway for permissible reasons,misconduct or incompetence.healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.
a prima facie case requires evidence that the plaintiff and the defendant belong to opposing political affiliations the defendant has knowledge of the plaintiff affiliation a challenged employment action occurred and political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind it.santiago,cir quoting family,cir.a defendant may contest this showing,offer a healthy defense or both.
the usual vehicle for such claims against state actors is section,whose remedy embraces actual and sometimes punitive damages,as well as attorneys fees because of the eleventh amendment,the damages claims are usually brought against individual government officials in their personal capacities while equitable relief runs against officers in their official capacities,effectively against the state entity itself.will.dep t of state police,d quern jordan,d.

driver claims against rey and pillich.prior to december,all seven worked at the office of the secretary,on the twelfth floor of the main department of education building in san juan.all were affiliated with the npp.primarily,they drove department officials,but in practice,their work included many other from messenger service to answering the each of them performed a substantial amount of overtime work,in some cases almost doubling their base salaries.
when rey took office in january,two of the seven drivers had transferred to another facility but the other five testified that they then received less work and that several pdp members appeared on the twelfth floor and were doing some of the duties that the seven had earlier done.in february rey approved a plan whereby drivers,whether assigned to the twelfth floor or not,were to a general comprising some supervised in an annex to the main building.
the seven drivers were reassigned to this pool effective february.in the subsequent weeks,several more pdp drivers were assigned work on the twelfth floor and thereafter enjoyed substantial overtime.various officials on the twelfth floor often sought assignment of particular drivers who were pdp members and the overtime flowed to these drivers.none of the seven thereafter enjoyed substantial overtime.
the drivers theory at trial was that the sequence of events just described added up to a plan,for which rey and pillich were responsible,to displace the npp drivers on the twelfth floor and the two brothers who had transferred to naranjito with pdp drivers who would thereafter enjoy the overtime,and that the motive was political discrimination against the former and in favor of the latter.rey and pillich say that the evidence for such a determination was lacking.
the jury could have concluded that overtime did shift from the five drivers who initially remained on the twelfth floor to pdp drivers and that the two brothers who had transferred see note,above were seriously inconvenienced by their to the pool,impairing their ability to keep evening jobs.that there was no entitlement to overtime or to a particular location is no barrier under the precedents and their rationale.rutan,at.
probably the jury was also entitled to conclude that the npp affiliation of the seven was sufficiently well known that rey and pillich were aware of it,at perhaps,also,that after the transfer the defendants were aware that overtime previously available to the npp drivers now went to pdp drivers.no one disputes that the pool plan was approved by rey and the transfers pursuant to the plan of all seven were signed by pillich.
but fatally,there is no evidence that rey or pillich conceived the pool plan or transfers as a means of favoring pdp drivers over npp drivers or that they approved or fostered the of twelfth floor work or overtime to pdp drivers.the pool arrangements merely centralized supervision of the drivers.so far as the record reveals,the pdp drivers achieved such benefits almost entirely as a result of decisions by various other twelfth floor officials who,on an individual basis,requested particular drivers generally or for specific assignments.
on this record,rey and pillich can not be held liable for discrimination by others.section does not impose purely supervisory liability,rizzo goode,d it aims at persons who have actually abused their positions of authority,dunham crosby,cir,and hence only persons who were directly involved in the wrongdoing may be held liable.kostka hogg,cir.exceptions exist but are either irrelevant here or have not been invoked 
true enough,a couple of pdp members showed up on the twelfth floor early in the new administration to do some of the work done by the npp drivers but there was no proof as to who had assigned them or that they earned overtime pay.three more appeared after the february transfer,but again there is no proof who sought them.plaintiffs at trial pointed to two more pdp drivers,but one was clearly requested by the office of communications,and another appears to have worked in san german,not in san juan.
pillich in an administrative capacity signed off for overtime earned by various pdp drivers on the twelfth floor but there is no indication that she chose the drivers.indeed,in some cases the officials who actually ordered the overtime were pillich superiors in the department.the suggest that pillich knew that pdp drivers were doing well at the expense of npp drivers but not that she caused them to be so favored.
on its face,the pool plan was a plausible piece of agency reorganization,centralizing some or so drivers including both npp and pdp members under one office.if rey or pillich had instigated or approved the subsequent favoring of pdp members,it might be inferred that they had conceived the plan for this purpose.but there was no such evidence.the officials who systematically summoned pdp drivers for overtime might perhaps have been sued but they were not.
the drivers did show,and the jury was free to believe,that defendants were committed political partisans.more pertinent to a discrimination claim,pillich but not rey was accused of uttering two arguably hostile political remarks and the jury may have credited the testimony although the remarks were pretty mild by current standards but this hardly shows that either rey or pillich devised the pool plan to mask a discriminatory scheme to be executed by others.
contrast this with fernandez chardon,cir,which also concerned a facially neutral policy promulgated by a of education.although the policy had the ultimate result of demoting employees of one party in favor of those belonging to the other,the critical evidence against the,id.at,comprised his comments that his party would ensure that its political opponents would not fill any vacancies.
if the reorganization in this case was hatched as a plan to clear the decks of npp drivers so that pdp drivers could be favored,it was up to plaintiffs to conduct the necessary discovery and offer the evidence.liability without such proof would effectively preclude any reorganization that happens to affect adversely employees connected to the previously dominant party,cir.the verdicts for the drivers and for the spouses can not stand as against rey and pillich.
driver claims against sauri.the claim of the seven drivers against sauri is this that after their transfer to his pool he harassed them because of their political,by subjecting them but not pdp drivers to humiliating roll calls,by following them to the cafeteria on their breaks,by selectively blaming them when things went amiss,by falsely altering their time sheets and by forcing them to sit inside an office that was too small.
actions of informal harassment,as opposed to formal employment actions like transfers or demotions,can be the basis for first amendment claims if the motive was political discrimination but this is so only if the discriminatory acts are sufficiently severe to cause reasonably hardy individuals to compromise their political beliefs and associations in favor of the prevailing party,cir en banc.
this threshold is implicit in the rationale for granting rutan safeguard political speech and distinguishes the wheat of real impairments from the chaff of minor irritants and frustrations in any workplace,at.an ambiguous footnote in rutan,at,could imply that even withholding of a birthday party might be enough but rutan text does not so suggest and our cases have continued to apply the standard,at 
if everything alleged by the drivers was supported by the record,we would agree such actions could,taken together,be deemed by a jury sufficiently weighty to discourage political affiliation or speech and then,if improper motivation were expressed or reasonably inferred,a first amendment claim would be made it is puzzling how such harassment could have caused substantial economic damages unless altering the time sheets caused a loss of pay for which no proof was offered.
but the drivers case substantially weakens as one examines the evidence.there was no proof that sauri ordered selective roll calls they were conducted by a secretary and ceased within days after complaints were made.the alleged casting of blame by sauri concerns one offhand,isolated,sarcastic comment by sauri that the castillo brothers would know the location of a missing key the drivers also testified that sauri tended to suspect them whenever a car broke down,but no specific incidents were described.
the room assigned to the drivers waiting for tasks may well have been too small but it was shared by all drivers,pdp and npp alike.the district judge found no evidence to suggest that sauri discriminated with respect to the allocation of duties.as for following the drivers to the cafeteria,sauri agrees that he did so on occasion because he was concerned that the seven drivers,or at least some of them,were abusing their breaks.none of this adds up to culpable harassment by sauri.
turning to the time sheets,false alterations for improper purposes would be close to fraud,and the economic consequences for the drivers could be serious.but sauri apparently reviewed time sheets as part of his job and made adjustments both for and against the seven drivers the evidence is very muddled but we are given no basis to infer that his changes were deliberately false or formed a suspicious pattern.
wrongdoing might perhaps have been inferred if the had shown that the changes adversely affected their pay or tenure.but it appears from the record that the drivers had fixed salaries for their basic work and that sauri confirmed on the time sheets that they had satisfied all their work requirements.the drivers countered with only the vague and undetailed suggestion that somehow their benefits might have been affected.this is hardly enough.
unlike the verdict against rey and pillich,the verdict against sauri has no single glaring flaw,and we are reluctant to second guess a jury on a confusing record.but even resolving doubts in favor of the plaintiffs,what the hopeless allegations are stripped just too thin to support a finding of liability.allowing a judgment to rest on this collection of complaints would trivialize the first amendment.bart telford,cir.
perez claim against motta.perez claim is by far the most straightforward discrimination claim presented.perez,then serving as a probationary employee doing legal work,says that motta,the new department head and a pdp supporter,gave perez a failing evaluation because of perez affiliation with the npp.on appeal,motta says that the evidence was insufficient.we think that the case is close but that the jury was within bounds in imposing liability.
perez testified that she had been given a favorable evaluation prior to the pdp election,that motta took over the legal department in january,and that perez received no work for about two weeks thereafter.then she got a batch of contracts to review,which took about three days,and thereafter got no new assignments until february,when motta gave her a new evaluation ranking her unsatisfactory.in consequence,perez lost her position.
perez also claimed that she had sought repeatedly to
