introduction 
this matter comes on before the court on appeal by plaintiff deanna turner from an order of the district court entered march,granting summary judgment in favor of crawford square apartments iii,crawford square and mccormack baron management services,mccormack baron sometimes together called defendants.the district court concluded that the doctrine barred turner complaint alleging violations of title viii of the civil rights act of the fair housing act or fha.
on appeal,we first consider whether the district court erred in concluding that the doctrine barred turner action,particularly in light of the supreme court recent opinion in exxon mobil saudi basic industries,d,decided after the district court decided this case.as we shall explain,the doctrine in certain limited circumstances deprives a district court of jurisdiction following a adjudication in a related case.in exxon mobil the court clarified the scope of the doctrine and made clear that courts have applied it beyond its appropriate boundaries.if we conclude that application of the doctrine does not bar turner action,we then must determine whether application of principles of res judicata bars this action for the reasons set forth below,we find that the doctrine is not applicable in this case,but we will affirm the grant of summary judgment on res judicata grounds.
ii.factual and procedural history 
in december,turner and her two children moved into a rental housing development in pittsburgh,pennsylvania,owned by crawford square and managed by mccormack baron turner asserts that she has been fully and permanently disabled since august when her nervous system broke down,and a hole had formed at the base of her spine,rendering her unable to work.app.at.in december,turner was delinquent in her rent and sought an accommodation from mccormack baron allowing her to pay her rent late until she could again obtain a regular source of income.app.at.according to turner,mccormack baron did not accommodate her or refer her to local social services agencies that could provide information on rental assistance programs,but,instead,commenced an eviction action in the state courts against her.in point of fact,however,crawford square not mccormack baron filed the eviction action which the court of common pleas of allegheny county ultimately entertained 
while the eviction action was pending in state court,turner continued to pay her rent late.in august,turner learned of her eligibility for the federal section rental assistance program consequently,she applied for a section voucher,and shortly thereafter was notified that she would be issued section vouchers to subsidize future rent.at around the same time,turner also learned of an emergency shelter assistance program that the urban league of pittsburgh administered through which she believed she could obtain assistance to pay the back rent she still owed.
in october,turner proffered a section voucher to mccormack baron and notified it that she had an upcoming appointment with the urban league to discuss assistance in paying rent.turner claims that mccormack baron asserted that it would not accept her voucher because she had been habitually late in making rental payments.
contemporaneously with the state court proceedings,turner filed a petition in bankruptcy which delayed the state proceedings until june at that time turner filed a counterclaim against crawford square and a separate petition seeking an injunction prohibiting her eviction in the court of common pleas of allegheny county.turner state counterclaim and petition together alleged that crawford square wrongfully failed to refer turner to the social services which would have prevented her inability to pay the rent due,app.at engaged in a wrongful and discriminatory refusal to accept a section voucher for rent issued to turner,app.at failed to consider a reasonable accommodation that would have allowed her to pay her rent late violated the notice of termination provisions in the lease initiated a retaliatory eviction action after she complained to the local housing authority and committed a variety of unfair or deceptive acts in violation of pennsylvania law.
notably,in the common pleas court,though turner attributed her inability to pay her rent in a timely manner to her disability,she did not premise her allegation that there had been a discriminatory refusal of her section vouchers based on her disability.rather,she alleged that crawford square had never accepted a section voucher on behalf of a current tenant initially approved for occupancy.app.at.nor did turner base any of her claims on the fair housing act,et,which formed the basis of an unsuccessful complaint she filed with the united states department of housing and urban development hud charging defendants with housing discrimination instead,turner based her allegations in the state court on a regulatory agreement executed by crawford square and the pennsylvania housing finance agency,and a management plan executed by crawford square and mccormack baron,pursuant to which turner claimed rights as a beneficiary.
on september,following a trial,the court of common pleas found in favor of crawford square on its claims for eviction and damages,and ruled against turner on her counterclaims.the court predicated its outcome on the merits of the controversy though the verdict by which it made its decision known merely stated the result the court reached.turner was unsatisfied with the result and thus filed motions for relief which the court denied,explaining in its opinion that 
i found that crawford square did not wrongfully refuse to accept her section rent voucher because it was not required to do so as long as rent remained in arrears.i found that crawford square did properly refer turner to a social service agency the urban league,and that its alleged failure to refer turner to other agencies with which she was in fact in contact was immaterial.
finally,crawford square is correct that pennsylvania does not recognize a cause of action or defense of retaliatory eviction in this setting.in any event,i determined from the evidence at trial that crawford square efforts to evict turner were not taken in retaliation for any complaints she made,but instead were motivated solely by her failure to pay rent in a timely fashion.
on august,turner filed this action in the district court against defendants turner alleged that defendants violated the fair housing act and discriminated against her on account of her disability by failing to refer her to the section program and by refusing her section rent vouchers as defendants had done with families.she also claimed that defendants violated the fha by failing to make reasonable accommodations in rules,policies,practices or services.app.at.defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing,inter alia,that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the doctrine,the action was barred by the doctrine of res judicata,and the district court should abstain from entertaining the claim pursuant to younger harris,d.
on march,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants,concluding that in light of turner prior state court action,the doctrine barred the subsequent federal action the district court explained 
if the court were to assert jurisdiction over this case,it would be ignoring the clear mandates of the doctrine.to do so would be tantamount to reviewing the final decision of the court of common pleas of allegheny county such action is barred by,as the constitutional claims at issue in this case are inextricably intertwined with the state court decision in addition,if the court were to grant turner the relief she seeks,it would necessarily have to take action that would render the state court decision ineffectual.
app.at.turner then filed a timely notice of appeal.by this opinion we adjudicate the appeal.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over turner complaint under and,and we have jurisdiction over the appeal under.our review of the district court application of the doctrine is plenary.see parkview assocs.city of lebanon,cir.
iv.discussion 
the doctrine deprives a federal district court of jurisdiction in some circumstances to review a state court adjudication.the doctrine derives from the supreme court opinions in rooker fidelity trust,and district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d.in exxon mobil,the court,however,emphasized the narrow scope of the doctrine,holding that it is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.at.at see also lance dennis,d discussing narrowness of doctrine.the court in exxon mobil admonished that the doctrine has sometimes been construed to extend far beyond the contours of the rooker and feldman cases.at.at.
here,the district court erred by applying the doctrine beyond the contours of the rooker and feldman cases,because turner action in the district court did not complain of injuries caused by the state court judgment.id.at.at.rather,turner complaint raised federal claims,grounded on the fha,not caused by the judgment but instead attributable to defendants alleged fha violations that preceded the judgment.holt lake county bd.of comm rs,cir plaintiff action barred by because plaintiff injury was caused by the state court judgments and absent the state court judgment plaintiff would not have the injury he now seeks to redress.
though turner district court complaint undoubtedly overlaps her adjudicated claims,and is based on the same operative facts,this overlap does not mean that the doctrine is applicable here.as the court explained in exxon mobil,a district court is not divested of jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.see at.at if a federal plaintiff presents some independent claim,albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party,then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.quoting gash assocs.village of rosemont,cir.therefore,the district court erred in holding that the doctrine deprived it of jurisdiction.
res judicata 
although we reject the district court stated grounds for granting summary judgment in favor of defendants,we nonetheless may affirm the district court order granting summary judgment on other grounds.see wittekamp gulf,cir.this approach is particularly appropriate in this case inasmuch as the supreme court in exxon mobil explained that the continuing vitality of a federal action filed after entry of judgment often depends on state preclusion law.see at.at.in this case the record provides an adequate basis for us to make a determination of whether the doctrine of res judicata is applicable.therefore,we next will consider whether the doctrine of res judicata or claim preclusion bars turner action 
in determining the applicability of principles of res judicata,we must give the same preclusive effect to the judgment in the common pleas court case that the courts in pennsylvania,the state in which the judgment was entered,would give.see lance dennis,d congress has directed federal courts to look principally to state law in deciding what effect to give judgments.see also allegheny int l,allegheny ludlum steel,cir citing kremer chem.constr,d,and.the supreme court of pennsylvania has explained that res judicata 
bars a later action on all or part of the claim which was the subject of the first action.any final,valid judgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction precludes any future suit between the parties or their privies on the same cause of action.res judicata applies not only to claims actually litigated,but also to claims which could have been litigated during the first proceeding if they were part of the same cause of action.
balent city of,citation omitted emphasis added.for the doctrine of res judicata to prevail,pennsylvania courts require that the two actions share the following four conditions the thing sued upon or for the cause of action the persons and parties to the action and the capacity of the parties to sue or be sued.bearoff bearoff,citations omitted.
in this case,the parties dispute whether factors and are present but we hold that they are first,in both actions the thing sued for is the same turner seeks to remain in her residence by obtaining injunctive relief that would,among other things,prevent her eviction with respect to the second factor,this action shares the same cause of action as the previously adjudicated state claims.contrary to turner contention that there is a new cause of action because,unlike the theories for her claims in the common pleas court,she based her claims in the district court on the fha,pennsylvania courts have held that the mere advancement of a different legal theory does not necessarily give rise to a different cause of action.see mcardle tronetti.as the court in mcardle explained 
as to the identity of cause s of action,rather than resting upon the specific legal theory invoked,res judicata generally is thought to turn on the essential similarity of the underlying events giving rise to the various legal claims i n determining whether a single cause of action is present one may consider the identity of the acts complained of,the demand for recovery,the identity of witnesses,documents,and facts alleged.a lack of identity of these facets would,of course,support the conclusion that there is no identity of cause of action.
id.citations omitted.
in this case,the underlying events giving rise to the various legal claims are identical because in both actions turner alleges the same wrongful refusal of her section vouchers,failure to refer her to social services agencies,and failure to evaluate her request for accommodation.as a result,the actions share the same acts complained of,identity of witnesses,documents and facts alleged.in short,as the above quoted language from mcardle suggests,by interposing a theory of liability under the fha in the district court that she had withheld in the common pleas court,turner did not create a separate cause of action and thereby insulate her claim in the district court from the application of the doctrine of res judicata.rather,what she did do was ensure that neither court would consider her fha claims on the merits.even though this result may seem to be unfortunate,it is a product of her own litigation strategy,and she is obliged to accept it.
the pennsylvania supreme court decision in balent is instructive.see.the plaintiffs in balent first filed an inverse eminent domain action in which they sought compensation on the grounds that the city demolition of their building was a de facto taking.following the dismissal of their action,the plaintiffs filed a second action in which they alleged various fifth and fourteenth amendment violations.the court found that the doctrine of res judicata barred the plaintiffs second action because both claims derived from the same cause of action compensation for the destruction of plaintiffs building,which would require that the parties rehash the facts and legal arguments presented in the prior action.id.at.likewise,turner present action and the prior litigation originated from the same cause of action,inasmuch as they are based on the same allegedly wrongful acts.as in balent,adjudicating turner new theory of recovery would require the parties to rehash the facts and legal arguments raised before the court of common pleas.in sum,because turner could have raised her fha claims in her prior action based on the same cause of action,application of the doctrine of res judicata bars the claims 
by applying res judicata in this action we are acting consistently with the approach of the pennsylvania courts in adhering to the restatement second of judgments in analyzing res judicata issues.see,mcardle,at noting that conclusion is consistent with restatement second of judgments,cmt.e.the restatement provides in part 
a given claim may find support in theories or
