opinion of the court 
in,in response to the threat to health and safety posed by large trucks on local roads,the new jersey department of transportation adopted emergency highway safety regulations the regulations designed to detour some of those trucks away from local roads and congested areas.the regulations require truck combinations and tractor trailers collectively,restricted vehicles traveling through new jersey,with neither an origin nor a destination in the state,to use the national network of interstate highways the national network rather than new jersey state highways and local roads the new jersey network.this case requires us to determine whether the regulations discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce clause.because the regulations favor instate businesses over those businesses that are neither buying nor selling goods in new jersey by imposing economic burdens on the interests while not imposing similar burdens on the instate interests,we hold that the regulations discriminate against interstate commerce.furthermore,as there exist available nondiscriminatory alternatives,we hold that the regulations violate the dormant commerce clause.we accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
in the,in response to the trucking industry desire to use wide trucks and truck combinations,the federal government required states to establish the national network,a connected network of interstate highways to permit interstate travel by these vehicles.new jersey complied with this directive,resulting in miles of roads in new jersey that contribute to the national network.
years later,in response to the threat to health and highway safety posed by large trucks on local roads,the new jersey department of transportation adopted the regulations,which were designed to reroute large trucks onto the national network.the regulations require restricted vehicles that do not have an origin or destination in new jersey to use the national network while in new jersey,except as necessary to access food,rest,repairs,and fuel.admin.code.however,restricted vehicles engaged in purely intrastate commerce or in interstate commerce that includes an origin or destination in new jersey are able to use both the national network and the new jersey network.admin.code.the new jersey network consists of roadways secondary to the national network that often snake through populated areas and are heavy with traffic.admin.code a.penalties for violating the regulations include a mandatory fine of no more than for the first violation,a mandatory fine of for the second violation,and a mandatory fine of for each subsequent violation.
soon after the adoption of the regulations,plaintiffs american trucking associations,american trucking and xpress filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey alleging that the regulations violate the dormant commerce clause of the united states constitution.const.art.i,cl.american trucking is a national trucking trade association suing on behalf of its members.us xpress,a nevada corporation,is an interstate motor carrier based in tennessee.the defendants are former new jersey officials that the plaintiffs sued in their official capacities.
the plaintiffs sought an order declaring the regulations unconstitutional and an order enjoining the defendants the state officials from enforcing the regulations.after a period of discovery,both parties filed motions for summary judgment,which the district court denied.the judge hearing the motions determined that the regulations are not facially discriminatory because,although the regulations distinguish between trucks with and without an origin or destination in new jersey,they are applied with equal force to all truck drivers.am.trucking ass ns,whitman,d.though the district court concluded that the regulations are not facially discriminatory,it denied summary judgment because an evidentiary record was needed to determine whether the regulations impose costs and delays on trucking.according to the district court,e vidence of a significant expense to trucking not suffered by trucking would demonstrate that the regulations discriminate in their effect against interests.id.at.
in september,the parties commenced a bench trial before a different judge.during the trial,lazar spasovic,testifying for the state officials,stated that,despite a new jersey department of transportation study demonstrating that the regulations would force many interstate trucks to take longer and costlier routes when required to use the national network rather than the new jersey network,the regulations would not adversely affect interstate commerce.spasovic based this conclusion on a theory that some truck drivers were using the new jersey network only to avoid tolls,even when that choice involved higher aggregate costs of time and fuel for those trucks.according to spasovic,those interstate trucks would save money by using the national network,and those savings would outweigh the additional costs the regulations cause other interstate trucks thus the regulations would have a net positive impact.
the state officials also argued that,even if the regulations were discriminatory,they do not violate the dormant commerce clause because there are no available means with which to achieve the legitimate goal of decreasing truck traffic on local roads.assistant commissioner and state planning engineer dennis keck testified that a statute that prohibited all restricted vehicles from using the new jersey network,except as necessary to reach new jersey origins or destinations or for food,rest,repairs,and fuel,would be nearly impossible to enforce.keck testified that such a statute would require law enforcement officials to stop trucks on the new jersey network randomly to ensure compliance with the statute,and to perform complex calculations to discern whether the trucks needed to be at that point on the new jersey network to reach a new jersey destination or to reach the national network from a new jersey origin.
at the conclusion of the trial,the district court held that the regulations violate the dormant commerce clause and accordingly enjoined the state officials from enforcing them.am.trucking ass ns,whitman,wl,at.the district court found that spasovic conclusion was based on the unreasonable assumption that truck drivers were acting against their economic interest.id.at.in other words,the district court did not accept spasovic assertion that interstate truck drivers were using the new jersey network to avoid paying tolls even though those truck drivers paid more in fuel and increased travel time by taking local road detours.the district court therefore rejected spasovic conclusion that the regulations would result in a net positive economic impact by correcting the irrational behavior of many interstate truck drivers.id.at.moreover,the district court found that,regardless of whether the regulations provide a net positive economic impact,the evidence showed that the regulations force many truckers to engage in conduct counter to their economic interests.id.the district court concluded that the regulations are discriminatory in effect.id.at.
additionally,the district court found that,although the regulations advance the legitimate local purpose of improving highway safety,there are available means to accomplish that goal.id.at.specifically,the district court noted that the state officials could accomplish the same legitimate local purpose by prohibiting all restricted vehicles from using the new jersey network except as necessary to reach a new jersey destination from the national network reach the national network from a new jersey origin or access food,rest,fuel,or repairs.id.at.because a alternative was available,the district court held that the regulations discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the dormant commerce clause.id.at.
the state officials timely filed a notice of appeal on april.
ii.regulatory background 
first,we must consider the state law at issue.the regulations,enacted in,determine which roads may be used by restricted vehicles traveling in new jersey.the regulations describe their purpose as follows 
the new jersey department of transportation has determined that it is in new jersey best interest to limit interstate through travel of large trucks to the national network,the nj turnpike,and the atlantic city expressway.large trucks restricted herein include wide standard trucks and double trailer truck combinations.interstate through travel for the purposes of this chapter shall be a trip with both an origin and destination outside of new jersey.reasonable access shall be permitted to terminals and to facilities for food,fuel,repairs and rest.
admin.code.
a double combination is defined as a truck combination,and which meets the equipment length requirement as set forth in and cfr.admin.code.the regulations define wide standard truck as a truck greater than inches but not greater than inches in width,exclusive of mirrors and other safety devices,and which meets the equipment length requirements as set forth in and,as amended.id.interstate through travel is defined as a trip with neither an origin nor destination in new jersey.id.
under the regulations,truck combinations and wide standard trucks in interstate through travel may be operated in new jersey only on the national network in addition to the new jersey turnpike,and the atlantic city expressway.admin code a.however,the regulations allow that,
a truck combination is permitted access from the national network to facilities providing food,fuel,repairs and rest,within one mile roadway distance from the designated system except upon those roads,highways,streets,public alleys or other thoroughfares which can not safely accommodate a truck combination and are so designated by the department.
admin code c.
thus,under the regulations,restricted vehicles traveling through new jersey with no origin or destination in new jersey must use the national network,and are prohibited from using the new jersey network except as necessary to access food,fuel,repairs or rest.restricted vehicles engaged in intrastate travel or in interstate travel with an origin or destination in new jersey have unlimited access to the new jersey network.
iii.legal analysis 
a.the commerce clause 
the commerce clause gives congress the power to regulate commerce among the several states.const.art.i,cl.although the clause thus speaks in terms of powers bestowed upon congress,the court has long recognized that it also limits the power of the states to erect barriers against interstate trade.lewis inv.managers,d.in other words,there is a dormant commerce clause which limits state authority to regulate areas where congress has not affirmatively acted to either authorize or forbid the challenged state activity.harvey harvey,county of chester,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.because congress has neither prohibited nor authorized the highway safety regulations at issue here,we must determine whether the regulations violate the dormant commerce clause.
the dormant commerce clause prohibits the states from imposing restrictions that benefit economic interests at interests expense,thus reinforcing the principle of the unitary national market.spring dairies.milk mktg,cir quoting west lynn creamery,healy,d.the dormant commerce clause therefore prohibits a state from impeding free market forces to shield businesses from competition.id.a state law that discriminates against interstate commerce faces a virtually per se rule of invalidity under the dormant commerce clause.philadelphia new jersey,d.
b.the appropriate level of scrutiny 
to determine whether the regulations violate the dormant commerce clause,the district court applied the heightened scrutiny standard.the state officials argue that the district court erred because,under american trucking ass ns larson,cir,all highway safety regulations are entitled to deferential treatment.defendants brief at.
we have previously stated that the level of scrutiny to be applied to a statute or regulation that affects interstate commerce is contingent upon whether the court finds that the statute or regulation is discriminatory.see,at harvey harvey,at old coach dev.tanzman,cir.there are two ways in which a statute could discriminate against interstate commerce and thus be subject to heightened scrutiny on its face interchangeably referred to as having a discriminatory purpose or in effect see old coach,at norfolk oberly,cir.if a regulation discriminates against interstate commerce on its face or in effect,then heightened scrutiny applies.see,at harvey harvey,at.under the heightened scrutiny standard,the state must demonstrate that the statute serves a legitimate local interest,and that this purpose could not be served as well by available means.see,at harvey harvey,at.if the statute at issue does not discriminate against interstate commerce,it is subjected to a balancing test whereby the statute must be upheld unless the burden imposed on interstate commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits,at quoting pike bruce church,d harvey harvey,at.in larson,however,we held that highway safety statutes must be given a more deferential treatment,and may not be overturned absent a showing that the safety benefits are slight,problematic,or illusory.see larson,at 
we find the state officials contention that all highway safety regulations are entitled to deferential treatment to be without merit.the state officials misinterpret larson,which explicitly limits its deferential standard to highway safety regulations.larson,at.there is simply nothing in larson that implies that the deferential standard adopted in larson should be applied to discriminatory highway safety regulations.moreover,in support of their argument,the state officials cite cases decided before c a carbone,town of clarkstown,d,in which the supreme court held that regulations that discriminate in effect and design are subject to the heightened scrutiny test.see at.harvey harvey,at.therefore,we agree with the district court conclusion that discriminatory highway safety regulations are subject to heightened scrutiny 
whether the regulations are discriminatory 
at the summary judgment stage,when determining the appropriate level of scrutiny,the district court found that the regulations are not facially discriminatory am.trucking,d at.the motion judge noted that the regulations distinguish between trucks with and trucks without an origin or destination in new jersey,but that the regulations are not facially discriminatory because they apply evenhandedly without regard to citizenship of the truck driver or owner.id.perhaps considering himself bound by the motion judge ruling,the trial judge did not consider whether the regulations are facially discriminatory.we conclude that they are.
the regulations state that their purpose is to limit interstate through travel of large trucks,defining interstate through travel as a trip with both an origin and destination outside of new jersey.admin.code.the regulations achieve this purpose by mandating that restricted vehicles engaged in interstate through travel may be operated in new jersey only on the national network,except as necessary to access food,fuel,rest,or repairs.admin.code a.
the text of the regulations explicitly distinguishes trucks that are passing through new jersey and imposes additional burdens on these trucks.the regulations deny trucks of businesses that pass through new jersey access to miles of new jersey network roads.these trucks are only exempt from this restriction under limited,if they doing business in new jersey that would require the dropping off or picking up of goods in new jersey,or to access food,fuel,repairs,or rest.meanwhile,trucks doing business in new jersey are allowed unlimited access to the new jersey network.as was demonstrated at trial by the state officials own expert and a new jersey department of transportation study,forcing trucks that are passing through new jersey to use only the national network imposes increased costs on those trucks appendix app.at plaintiffs supplemental appendix.at.by grantin
