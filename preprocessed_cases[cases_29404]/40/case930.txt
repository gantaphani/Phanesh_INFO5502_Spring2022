francisco rosario appeals from the february,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york eugene nickerson,judge convicting him after a jury trial of conspiring to make false statements and making false statements,in violation of and,respectively.although defendant assigns a number of trial errors to the district court,including a substantial challenge premised on batson kentucky,d,we focus here only on his claim that he was entitled to immunity based on the government promise.although the district court had the principal parties before it while we have only a record,we conclude that the district court should not have dismissed so quickly rosario claim,which he supported with two affirmations in the face of the government unsworn denial.because the record is insufficiently developed regarding rosario immunity allegations,we remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
the criminal charges against rosario stem from the government investigation of the august,assault on abner louima in brooklyn by members of the new york city police department.rosario was a police officer who was present in the precinct station house at the time of the assault.his partner,rolando aleman,also was present,and the officers were processing an arrest unrelated to louima.both rosario and aleman saw a police officer escort had just been brutally assaulted in the station house a holding cell.however,rosario and aleman subsequently agreed to lie to investigators by saying that neither of them was present.
rosario gave interviews about the assault to federal investigators on september,and november.during the first interview,rosario denied being nearby when another officer brought louima to a holding cell.during the second interview,rosario admitted that he lied on september and that he was present when an officer brought louima to the cell.rosario claimed that the officer who escorted louima was not justin volpe,who later pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his commission of the assault.rosario gave a description of the officer he saw that matched the physical characteristics of officer thomas bruder,but rosario did not name bruder.aleman gave statements to investigators that materially comported with rosario account of events.in his later statements,aleman also admitted that he initially lied,and aleman said that he knew it was not volpe who escorted louima to the holding cell.
according to rosario,before he granted the second interview,assistant united states attorney catherine palmer told his attorney that if rosario agreed to the second interview and told the truth then the government would not prosecute him and even would help him keep his job.rosario claims that palmer also told his lawyer that the police department was following her office lead although the department would make the final decision regarding rosario job.according to rosario attorney at the time,he understood the government clearly to be offering immunity to officer rosario if he told the truth and agreed to testify on behalf of the government.rosario claims to have agreed to the second interview based on the government promise of immunity.
no immunity to rosario was forthcoming.a federal grand jury indicted rosario and aleman on june,and charged them in seven counts with conspiring to make false statements and making false statements.on april,aleman pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements and later received a sentence of two years probation and special assessment.rosario went to trial in may.
in a pretrial motion,rosario asked the district court to dismiss the indictment based on the government promise of immunity.in the alternative,defendant asked the court to charge the jury that it may acquit him on all counts should it find that he told the truth when interviewed by the government in november.rosario also sought a hearing on the issues of whether the government promised not to prosecute rosario if he told the truth and the government proved by a preponderance that rosario did not tell the truth.
importantly,the government in opposing the motion offered no evidence denying rosario account of the immunity agreement.instead,the government argued that even if rosario version of the facts were true,he was entitled to no relief because he was not truthful in refusing to identify volpe as the officer who escorted louima to the holding cell.during motion practice,rosario offered his affirmation and that of his former defense attorney.his current counsel also represented to the court that three other lawyers were prepared to testify that palmer told them that the government would not prosecute rosario if he agreed to a second interview and told the truth.the district court denied defendant motions stemming from the alleged immunity promise,calling them more a pure piece of pettifogging than a serious contention.
the trial jury convicted rosario of conspiracy and of making false statements during his first interview on september,but it acquitted him of making false statements during his second interview on november.on february,the district court sentenced rosario to three years probation with the special condition of three months home detention and special assessment.
in the appeal of his conviction,rosario raises three points.first,rosario argues that the district court erred not only when it granted the government challenge to his discriminatory use of peremptory strikes during jury selection but also when it refused to give defendant additional peremptory strikes to make up for the ones that he lost.second,defendant contends that the district court erred in denying his motions based on the alleged immunity agreement.third,rosario argues that the district court prevented him from presenting his theory of the case during defense counsel summation argument to the jury.as discussed more fully below,we find that significant questions remain unresolved regarding the government alleged promise of immunity.because determination of this issue may significantly impact whether a trial in this case was proper,we do not at this time address rosario assignment of error to other aspects of the trial.
discussion 
defendant asked the district court to dismiss the indictment or,in the alternative,provide a jury instruction based on the government alleged immunity promise.while he maintains that the district court erred in denying this relief,defendant on appeal contends that he at least was entitled to a hearing on the issues of whether an immunity agreement existed and whether he performed his obligation under the agreement by telling the truth during his second interview.during oral argument,the government acknowledged that it specifically declined to offer any proof denying the existence of an immunity agreement in order to avoid a hearing concerning contested facts.instead,the government argues that even if it made the offer,rosario did earn immunity because he lied during the second interview when he denied that volpe brought louima back to the holding cell.further,the government contends that only it is in a position to evaluate the truthfulness of rosario statements because it could not use rosario as a witness if the government believed that he was lying.
