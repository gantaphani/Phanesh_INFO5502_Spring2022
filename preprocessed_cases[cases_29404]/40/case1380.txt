the west virginia department of environmental protection wvdep appeals an injunction requiring it to obtain national pollutant discharge elimination system permits under the clean water act cwa,see et,for reclamation efforts at abandoned coal mining sites.the injunction was based on the district court conclusion that the plain language of the cwa and applicable epa regulations require such a permit.
the trial court ruling was correct.the text of the cwa,as well as the corresponding regulations issued by the environmental protection agency,confirm that the permit requirements apply to anyone who discharges pollutants into the waters of the united states.under the cwa,it does not matter that a mining company may have created the conditions that call for reclamation.what matters is that an entity,private or public,is currently discharging pollutants into the waters of the united states.in fact,the statute contains no exceptions for state agencies engaging in reclamation efforts to the contrary,it explicitly includes them within its scope.
at bottom,wvdep arguments stem from little more than policy disagreements with the statutory text.finding that to be an insufficient basis for deviating from the law as written,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
congress enacted the federal water pollution control act amendments of,better known as the clean water act cwa,in order to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters,stat.codified as amended at et.in furtherance of those goals,the cwa bans,among other things,the discharge of any pollutant by any person.a.on its face,the ban is sweeping in scope the act defines person to include not just private individuals and companies,but also states and municipalities,see,and covers any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source,see a.
in the coal industry,the discharge of pollutant s occurs frequently.the mining process often contaminates water associated with the mine site such as stormwater or wastewater with pollutants like iron and manganese.this polluted water is known as acid mine drainage because mining makes the water quite acidic,often decreasing the ph to well below.under the ph scale,a ph of is neutral,a ph of less than is acidic,and a ph of greater than is basic.the fact that acid mine drainage has a ph of at most means that it is substantially more acidic than a neutral solution.
of course,the cwa does not set out to ban coal mining.instead,it allows mining companies to apply for pollution permits,known as national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits.these permits set forth limitations on the type and quantity of pollutants that will ultimately be released into navigable waters.see.water mgmt.dist.miccosukee tribe,natural res.def.council costle,observing that the permit scheme recognizes that pollution continues because of technological limits,not because of any inherent rights to use the nation waterways for the purpose of disposing of wastes.while npdes permits are normally issued by the epa,states can petition to run their own npdes permit programs.see a b.in administering these programs,states are free to treat the epa pollution limits as a floor and impose more stringent requirements.see i.once an npdes permit has been issued,however,the state,the epa,and citizens alike can sue to enforce it.see a epa enforcement,a provision.
west virginia has successfully petitioned to run its own npdes permit program,meaning that putative mine operators must apply to the west virginia department of environmental protection wvdep rather than the epa see.may,approving west virginia program et setting forth regulations governing npdes program.because acid mine drainage is one of the most serious water quality problems facing west virginia,its npdes permits carry a corresponding obligation to neutralize the adverse effects of the effluent.see a requiring the submission of a reclamation plan along with a permit application id.at outlining reclamation plan requirements.in other words,mine operators must raise the overall ph level and reduce the harmful chemical levels in the acid mine drainage.west virginia,however,does not just blindly trust the mine operators to carry out their obligations.instead,as a condition of receiving their permits,mine operators must post bonds with the state designed to guarantee their compliance.see a.if the mine operators default on their duties,wvdep can revoke the permits and force the performance bonds into forfeiture.see b.
the consequences of revocation are what bring this case before us.state regulations require wvdep to treat acid mine drainage at bond forfeiture sites in accordance with the epa effluent limitations for coal mining point sources and applicable water quality standards.e referencing standards set forth in see id.at.b.the epa limitations are known as limitations because they are predicated upon the best practicable known technologies for treatment.based on average daily emissions,these standards require,among other things,a ph level between to,an iron concentration of no more than of effluent,and a manganese concentration of at most.see.these limits are stringent,but ultimately less so than west virginia applicable water quality standards,as the state has decided to require iron and manganese limitations that are twice as strict and,respectively.see,app.e,tbl,parameters.
according to wvdep own regulations,wvdep must meet these standards by taking the most effective actions possible to remediate acid mine drainage,including chemical treatment where appropriate,with the resources available.generally speaking,wvdep initially employs the existing treatment system as a temporary salve and then installs a series of water wheels that mechanically release neutralizing agents.that system increases the ph of the water out of the acidic range and precipitates out the harmful chemicals.in short,it is intended to turn acid mine drainage back into normal water.
as effective as this treatment may be,it is not cheap.wvdep regulations require the agency to direct the entire proceeds of the forfeited penal bond towards reclamation.often,the bond proceeds are insufficient in such circumstances,wvdep must continue treatment by drawing upon the special reclamation fund srf.d see also west virginia ex rel.highlands conservancy,wvdep,holding that duty to expend srf funds is mandatory and nondiscretionary,may,removing limitations on expenditure of funds.the srf is funded by a tax on coal mined throughout the state.g,h setting tax at.
the dispute before us stems from wvdep reclamation efforts at several bond forfeiture sites in preston,monongalia,and upshur counties in north central west virginia.in,the west virginia highlands conservancy and west virginia rivers coalition collectively,the conservancy requested water quality data from those sites.based on the data,the conservancy determined that there were eighteen bond forfeiture sites in northern west virginia that were actively discharging acid mine drainage into state streams.
in,the conservancy filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of west virginia under the cwa provision.see.the lawsuit sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring wvdep to obtain npdes permits at the bond forfeiture sites within thirty days according to the conservancy,it was not enough for wvdep to comply with its state regulatory mandate to take the most effective actions possible to remediate acid mine drainage.see.instead,wvdep had to obtain npdes permits for the bond forfeiture sites because it was violating the cwa by discharging pollutants into navigable waters.see,a.
after the suit was filed,wvdep stipulated that the ph,iron,manganese,and aluminum levels in the water at the sites frequently exceeded both the epa and west virginia water quality standards.it also stipulated that those chemicals are pollutants under the cwa and that they are being discharged into navigable waters.at his deposition,wvdep designated representative larry ellison further acknowledged that the pollutant levels at the sites would not meet the west virginia water quality standards and admitted that the discharge points have the physical characteristics of a point source under the cwa.ellison also conceded that wvdep had not issued itself any permits for the eighteen bond forfeiture sites despite having issued permits to the former site operators when the sites were active.in recent history,in fact,wvdep has issued itself only one permit for a bond forfeiture site,and only did so after being sued by the conservancy and receiving a letter from the epa stating that a permit was required.
notwithstanding these facts,wvdep maintained that npdes permits were unnecessary for bond forfeiture sites on its view,permits are simply not necessary for state agencies cleaning up acid mine drainage generated by others.unpersuaded,the conservancy moved for summary judgment in august.the district court granted the motion on january.after additional briefing on the timing of injunctive relief,the court issued a final judgment on march,ordering wvdep to apply for permits within days and obtain final permits within days.this appeal followed 
wvdep chief obstacle in this appeal is that the clean water act is a broadly worded statute.see rapanos united states,plurality opinion the terms discharge of a pollutant and pollutant in section a are defined broadly united states riverside bayview homes,congress chose to define the waters covered by the act broadly.the plain text bears this point out,declaring that the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful.a emphasis added.the definitions do the same the cwa defines person to include states,municipalities,and political subdivisions of a state,and describes a point source as any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance,see emphasis added.lest there be any remaining doubt about the cwa scope,the definition of discharge of a pollutant resolves it according to that provision,the cwa bans any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.see a emphasis added.any is a powerful statutory term.the clean water act uses it frequently.
at first blush,wvdep conduct at bond forfeiture sites appears covered by these provisions.as a political subdivision of west virginia,wvdep is a person under the cwa.see.wvdep has stipulated that water is being discharge d at the bond forfeiture sites,and that the water contains pollutant s.a.wvdep designated representative has further acknowledged that the outfalls from these sites have the physical characteristics of a point source and that permits would be required if the mines were still privately owned.and the parties have agreed that the receiving streams are water s of the united states as defined at.put together,these facts establish that wvdep is a person proceeding in violation of a by discharging pollutants into navigable waters from a point source.as a result,wvdep must obtain npdes permits for the bond forfeiture sites.
as if the statutory language were not clear enough,the applicable epa regulations confirm that wvdep needs to obtain npdes permits.the epa has issued a series of regulations addressing the operations of the npdes permit scheme.see et.those regulations define the term person to include state agencies.see.they also confirm the broad reach of the term discharge of a pollutant,which,under the regulations,includes additions of pollutants into waters of the united states from surface runoff which is collected or channeled by man and discharges through pipes,sewers,or other conveyances owned by a state,municipality,or other person which do not lead to a treatment works.see also id.defining a p rivately owned treatment works as any device or system which is a used to treat wastes from any facility whose operator is not the operator of the treatment works and b not a potw defining a potw or publicly owned treatment works as a treatment works which is owned by a state or municipality.
what is more,the epa issued regulations in establishing that discharges are covered by the npdes scheme.see.in those regulations,the epa reemphasize d that release discharges are subject to regulation under the clean water act,observing that i f a point source discharge occurs after bond release,then it must be regulated through an npdes permit.id.at.the comments to the rule sharpen this point,flatly stating that a ny point source discharge after bond release does require a permit.id.at emphasis added.to the extent parties do not comply,the regulations state that they will be subject to enforcement action by epa under section of the act and by citizens under section a of the act.id.at.while these regulations explicitly address situations where a bond is released rather than forfeited to the state,the epa intent is pellucid.both those who generate pollution and those who superintend ongoing discharges must obtain npdes permits.
wvdep,however,advances a welter of arguments for why it should not have to obtain npdes permits.we shall address them in turn.
first,wvdep argues that it should be exempt from the npdes scheme because it is a state agency engaging in reclamation efforts rather than a private company intentionally discharging pollutants.but both the text of the cwa and the epa implementing regulations squarely reject any exemption for state agencies like wvdep.see defining person as both a state and a political subdivision of a state defining a person as,among other things,a state or federal agency.indeed,the regulations describing the content of a permit application require the operator to disclose its status as federal,state,private,public,or other entity,thus denoting that state agencies are covered by the act.f emphasis added.
moreover,the statute contains no exemption for reclamation efforts to the contrary,it bans the discharge of any pollutant by any person,regardless of their motives.a emphasis added.nonetheless,amicus interstate mining compact commission imcc argues that the word addition in the definition of discharge of a pollutant implies agency,responsibility for creating the polluting condition and excludes actions which actually reduce the load of pollutants which will enter the receiving surface water.however,the word addition,in context,means something different from what imcc suggests.by defining discharge of a pollutant as any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source,a emphasis added,the statute clearly covers all matter how than merely net additions.in other words,t he act does not impose liability only where a point source discharge creates a net increase in the level of pollution.rather,the act categorically prohibits any discharge of a pollutant from a point source without a permit.comm.to save mokelumne river bay mun.util,cir.indeed,wvdep itself offers no serious response to this textual reality to the contrary,it concedes that some entity will always be responsible for obtaining an npdes permit when discharges requiring a permit are occurring.
the regulations are fatal to wvdep position in other ways as well.sets forth a list of e xclusions from the npdes permit requirement,but none of them come close to covering wvdep.nevertheless,wvdep urges us to find its conduct covered by the water transfers rule,which states that no permit is required for activity that conveys or connects waters of the united states without subjecting the transferred water to intervening industrial,municipal,or commercial use.i.but that exception only applies when pollutants are transferred from one navigable water to another,june,t he water being conveyed must be a water of the prior to being discharged to the receiving waterbody.see also friends of the everglades.water mgmt,cir t he epa water transfer regulation accepts the unitary waters theory that transferring pollutants between navigable waters is not an addition to navigable waters.here,by contrast,neither the acid mine drainage nor the bond forfeiture sites constitute navigable waters.see.more importantly,the defendants were not transferring pollutants they were discharging them.any other construction would vitiate the act.
wvdep also argues strenuously that it should not have to obtain npdes permits becaus
