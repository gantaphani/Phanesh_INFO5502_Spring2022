opinion of the court 
this appeal arises from a pro se action brought by appellant wardell leroy giles,who suffered injuries including a broken rib and punctured lung after being forcibly subdued and kicked or kneed in the side by correctional officers while he was incarcerated at sussex correctional institution sci.giles filed claims under against the officers and other parties,alleging excessive force and deliberate indifference to medical needs in violation of the eighth amendment.giles appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment based on qualified immunity for three officers in their individual capacities,and from the district court judgment in favor of the remaining appellees.
because giles testified that he was kicked and punched while fully restrained on the ground,after he ceased to resist,giles alleges conduct in violation of his eighth amendment rights that a reasonable officer would have known was a violation under the circumstances,and we will reverse the district court grant of summary judgment for the three correctional officers in their individual capacities.we will affirm the judgment of the district court with regard to the other appellees 
giles contends that the district court did not accept his factual allegations as true or adequately address the defendants use of force in its summary judgment analysis.giles also contends that the district court did not properly consider the five factors established in whitley albers,d,in its conclusion that the force used against him was not excessive,and that the district court erred in finding that the correctional officers were not deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs and did not adequately address conflicting testimony as to whether giles had requested medical treatment.
on an appeal from a grant or denial of summary judgment,our review is plenary and we apply the same test the district court should have utilized initially.see alexander fire,cir brooks kyler,cir.a court may grant summary judgment only when the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.rule c,federal rules of civil procedure.in this analysis,t he evidence of the is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor in determining whether there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.the mere existence of some evidence in support of the nonmovant is insufficient to deny a motion for summary judgment enough evidence must exist to enable a jury to reasonably find for the nonmovant on the issue.id.at.where the plaintiff is a pro se litigant,the court has an obligation to construe the complaint liberally.see haines kerner,d gibbs roman,cir.
a district court findings of fact under rule a are reviewed for clear error.united states gypsum.rule a requires that the district court ultimate decision be supported by subordinate factual findings.united states,cir.however,
in reviewing the decision of the district court,our responsibility is not to substitute findings we could have made had we been the tribunal our sole function is to review the record to determine whether the findings of the district court were clearly erroneous,whether we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.it is the responsibility of an appellate court to accept the ultimate factual determination of the unless that determination either is completely devoid of minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of credibility,or bears no rational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data.
krasnov dinan,cir internal citation omitted.in bench trials,a district court application of the deliberate indifference and excessive force legal standards to a set of facts is also guided by the clear error standard.see goffman gross,cir deliberate indifference quezada county of bernalillo,cir excessive force jacobs city of new orleans,cir excessive force.
clear error review is deferential if the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.anderson bessemer city,d.when a district court findings are based on credibility determinations,rule a demands even greater deference.id.nevertheless,a court may not insulate its findings from review by denominating them credibility determinations,because factors other than demeanor go into the decision whether or not to believe a witness.id.at.
the relevant evidence concerns two related incidents at sci after giles had been transferred there,as well as the medical aftermath of those incidents.one incident occurred in a prison shower during giles intake process the second occurred several hours later in a cell in the prison infirmary.
giles was transferred to sci from another facility on november.on that day,he was brought to the receiving and processing area for new inmate intake procedures including a strip search and shower.present in the intake area were corporal dean blades,sergeant charles steele and sergeant bob cassase.
giles was wearing a red religious cap called a kufi,which blades asked him to remove and informed him was in violation of a new sci policy that permitted only white kufis.giles became angry and refused to hand over his kufi,cursing at blades and arguing that he did not believe there was such a policy.after repeated orders,giles eventually relinquished his kufi.cassase then ordered giles to strip down to be searched.giles initially refused to remove his boxer shorts or expose himself for inspection,but complied after the orders were repeated.
giles was then ordered to take a shower.he cursed at the guards and argued that he had already taken a shower that day,but ultimately complied.after he entered the shower,giles had trouble turning on the water,and blades entered to show giles how to operate the shower.a verbal altercation ensued,with giles resisting blades assistance and cursing him.when giles cursed blades in the shower,blades pulled out his cannister of potent form of pepper sprayed giles,temporarily blinding him.after being capstunned,giles swung his arm and struck blades in the mouth.for hitting blades,giles later was found guilty of assault on a staff member,in an administrative hearing on december.on july,giles also pled no contest to misdemeanor assault in the third degree for the same conduct,in the superior court of delaware in sussex county,pursuant to,tit.state of delaware wardell giles,crim.july.
blades called for reinforcement to subdue giles,and steele,cassase and sergeant gary campbell responded to the scene.the officers tackled giles,blades and campbell wrestled giles to the floor of the shower,and blades sat on giles middle back and held his legs.the record reflects that giles is feet inches tall and weighed pounds,and blades weighed pounds.the officers testified that giles continued struggling and pushing against blades and did not comply with orders to put his hands behind his back to be handcuffed,shaking his head no in response to requests to do so.giles testified that he stopped resisting once on the ground but was unable to put his hands behind him because blades was sitting on his back.giles explained that he was shaking his head to indicate that he was unable to present his hands.giles stated that the officers kicked him in the ribs and punched him in the head after he had stopped resisting,while he was prostrate on the ground with blades sitting on him.campbell incident report stated that campbell hit inmate giles in his side with my knee to try to make him give up his arms to be cuffed.app.
after the officers finally had him cuffed,giles had a bloody nose and complained of other injuries.he was assessed by nurse amy whittle,who reported that giles complained of pain in his left side and told her that he had heard one of his ribs snap.giles also insisted that he could not breathe and complained of shortness of breath.nurse whittle observed a large red area under giles left nipple and a slightly elevated respiratory rate.she concluded that giles did not have a punctured lung,and spoke with a doctor by phone who arranged an order for the following day and instructed that giles condition should be monitored.giles was then transferred to a security cell in the infirmary.
around,giles started banging forcefully on his cell door,shouting and cursing and demanding pain medication.the parties dispute whether giles also requested medical attention or requested to see a physician at this time,and they dispute whether any of the officers on duty were informed of giles possible injuries when their shift began.correctional officers on duty ordered giles to stop shouting and beating on the door he did not comply.officer michael ackenbrack responded to giles cell and told giles he would check about his request for medication.the nurse on duty informed ackenbrack that no medicine was prescribed for giles,so ackenbrack told giles that he would not receive any medication.giles became even more agitated and continued hitting and shaking the cell door.sergeant keith lloyd,officer michael milligan and officer rick justice joined ackenbrack outside the cell.lloyd opened the cell,and ackenbrack capstunned giles with a single spray from about two to four feet away.a nurse on duty examined giles after this second capstunning and found his breathing and blood oxygen levels to be normal.
the next day,november,giles received that revealed he had a broken rib and collapsed lung.he was transferred by ambulance to a local hospital where he had surgery and received treatment,more than hours after his initial injury.giles was returned to sci on december.
on december,giles was transferred to delaware correctional center dcc.on june and june,giles filed internal grievances while at dcc for his injuries caused by the correctional officers use of force at sci.on august,giles was transferred to a facility in maryland.giles received no response to his grievance,and prison records state that the grievance was resolved at level,which means it was closed when giles was transferred out of state to maryland,on august,the sequence of giles subsequent transfers is unclear,but at the time he filed the underlying complaint in this case,on november,he was incarcerated in delaware again,at morris community correction center.
on november,giles filed the underlying pro se complaint pursuant to in the district court for the district of delaware,against warden richard kearny,nurse whittle,and correctional officers campbell,cassase,steele,lloyd,blades,milligan,justice and ackenbrack.
on june,the district court granted whittle motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and granted summary judgment in favor of kearney campbell,cassase,steele,lloyd,blades,milligan,justice and ackenbrack in their official capacities and cassase,steele and campbell in their individual capacities.the district court held that officials of reasonable competence could disagree as to whether the force used was reasonable under the circumstances,and found it significant that giles had pled no contest to misdemeanor assault related to the incident.summary judgment was denied to blades,lloyd,justice,milligan and ackenbrack in their individual capacities.
giles was provided with counsel through the federal civil panel on april.a bench trial was held on november,and december,on the remaining claims.giles medical expert gave unrebutted testimony that giles was subject to the risk of a injury due to the delay of over hours in his diagnosis and transfer to the hospital.the district court made findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a and held that giles had not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants had violated his rights under.the district court also stated that with respect to its factual determinations,it found the testimony of giles to be less credible than that of defense witnesses.judgment was entered in favor of the defendants on september.
giles timely filed a pro se notice of appeal on october,and a notice of appeal was filed on his behalf on october.giles moved for appointment of counsel by this court on november.the appellees moved for summary affirmance on december.giles was given leave to appeal in forma pauperis on january.on may,a motions panel of this court determined that giles appeal had arguable merit and would not be dismissed under e,denied appellees motion for summary affirmance,and appointed appellate counsel for giles.
giles contends that cassase,steele and campbell were improperly granted summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.government officials are immune from suit in their individual capacities unless,taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right and the right was clearly established at the time of the objectionable conduct.saucier katz,d.for a right to be clearly established,t he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.id.at.quoting anderson creighton,d.if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on th e issue,immunity should be recognized.malley briggs,d.the supreme court recently held that the sequence of the saucier analysis is no longer mandatory trial courts are now permitted to use discretion as to which prong of the analysis to apply first.see pearson callahan,d.
qualified immunity is a complete immunity from suit,not just a defense to liability,and is considered at the earliest possible stage of proceedings,apart from the analysis of the underlying claim itself.saucier,at.the issue of qualified immunity is generally a question of law,although a genuine issue of material fact will preclude summary judgment on qualified immunity.see deary three police officers,cir czurlanis albanese,cir.
the appellees contend that cassase,steele and campbell were properly awarded qualified immunity because giles was a belligerent,uncooperative,unrestrained inmate who did not respond to capstun and who struck an officer.the appellees contend that no constitutional violation was alleged on the facts,and that under the circumstances,it was not clearly established that it was a violation of giles constitutional rights to exercise the force used to subdue him.
the primary step in assessing the constitutionality of the officers alleged actions is to determine the relevant facts.scott harris,d.the district court was required to view the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see saucier,at.see also scott,at.in qualified immunity cases on summary judgment,this usually means adopting the plaintiff version of the facts.also,an inmate who is proceeding pro se,is in a decidedly difficult position from which to generate record evidence on his behalf under these circumstances,his affidavits are about the best that can be expected from him at the summary judgment phase of the proceedings.brooks kyler,cir quoting norman taylor,cir hall,dissenting.giles testified that he was kicked in the ribs and punched in the head while restrained on the ground,after he ceased to resist.accepting giles version of the events as true,he has alleged facts showing that cassase,steele and campbell violated his eighth amendment rights during the shower incident.
the test for whether a claim of excessive force is constitutionally actionable is whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.whitley albers,d.the relevant factors for a court to consider are the need for the application of force the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used the extent of injury inflicted the extent of the threat to the safety of staff and inmates,as reasonably perceived by the responsible officials on the basis of the facts known to them and any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.see also brooks,same.
although the qualified immunity inquiry is not a merits analysis,the whitley t
