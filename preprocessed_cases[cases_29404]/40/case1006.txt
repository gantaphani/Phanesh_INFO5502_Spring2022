opinion of the court 
this case that involves the rights of the posthumously conceived children of a deceased wage earner and his us to consider the intersection of new reproductive technologies and what is required to qualify for child survivor benefits under the social security act the act.it goes without saying that these technologies were not within the imagination,much less the contemplation,of congress when the relevant sections of the act came to be,and that they present a host of difficult legal and even moral questions.we need not reach those difficult questions given the discrete factual circumstances of this case.we,nonetheless,can not help but observe that this is,indeed,a new world.
background 
factual history 
robert capato was born in the state of washington in and,aside from a period when he resided in california,lived in washington until the.capato met his future wife,karen,in washington and subsequently moved with her to colorado,where they lived for two years.in early,the couple moved to florida for capato business,and lived in florida for approximately three years.at some point while in florida,they decided to move to new jersey and took some steps in that regard,but did not leave florida prior to capato death.
in august,shortly after the capatos wedding in new jersey,capato was diagnosed with esophageal cancer,and was told that the chemotherapy he required might render him sterile.the capatos,however,wanted children,and thus,before he began his course of chemotherapy,capato deposited his semen in a sperm bank,where it was frozen and stored.somewhat surprisingly,given the treatment that capato was by then undergoing,capato conceived naturally and gave birth to a son in august.the capatos,however,wanted their son to have a sibling.
capato health deteriorated in,and he died in florida in march of.his death certificate listed his residence as pompano beach,florida.three months before his death,he executed a will in florida naming as his beneficiaries the son born of his marriage to capato and two children from a prior marriage.although capato claims that she and her husband spoke to their attorney about including unborn children in the will,so that it would be understood that they have the rights and be supported in the same way that their natural born son was already privileged to,app.at,the will did not contain any such provision.
shortly after capato death,capato began in vitro fertilization using the frozen sperm of her husband.she conceived in january and gave birth to twins on september,eighteen months after capato death.
procedural history 
in october,capato applied for surviving child insurance benefits on behalf of the twins based on her husband earnings record.the social security administration denied her claim,and capato timely requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.a hearing was held on may,with testimony taken from capato and two friends.on november,the alj rendered his decision denying capato claim.observing that t his is a case where technology has advanced faster than the regulatory process,id.at,and that this is a very sympathetic case in which allowing benefits would appear to be consistent with the purposes of the social security act,the alj nonetheless believed himself constrained by applicable laws and regulations to find disentitlement.id.at.finding that the twins,conceived after the death of their father,are not for social security purposes the child ren of the deceased wage earner,robert capato,under florida state law as required by section h a of the social security act,the alj concluded that they were not entitled to child insurance benefits in accordance with sections d and e of the act and the relevant regulations.id.at.the district court affirmed,echoing the alj interpretation of the act and his conclusion that capato was domiciled in florida on the date of his death and,thus,that florida law of intestacy should be applied.this timely appeal,over which we have jurisdiction pursuant to,followed.we will affirm in part and vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings

entitlement to child insurance benefits 
title ii of the social security act,codified at et,allows certain categories of children to receive a survivor benefit following the death of a fully or currently insured individual.d.the purpose of federal child insurance benefits is not to provide general welfare benefits,but to replace the support that the child would have received from his father had the father not died.jones ex rel.jones chater,cir citing mathews lucas,see also adams weinberger,cir the purpose of the act is to provide support to children who have lost actual or anticipated support.in general,the act is to be accorded a liberal application in consonance with its remedial and humanitarian aims.eisenhauer mathews,cir.
to qualify for child insurance benefits,the applicant must be the child,as defined in e of the act,of an individual entitled to benefits or who is fully or currently insured.d.section e defines child broadly as,in relevant part,the child or legally adopted child of an individual.id.e.additionally,and as relevant here,the child a must have filed an application for benefits,b must be unmarried and less than eighteen years old or an elementary or secondary school student under nineteen,and c must have been dependent upon the deceased individual at the time of his or her death.id.d a c.every child as defined in section e of this title will qualify,assuming,of course,that the other requisites have been met.id.d.
section h,entitled determination of family status,offers other ways by which to determine whether an applicant is a child 
in determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of a fully or currently insured individual for purposes of this subchapter,the commissioner of social security shall apply such law as would be applied in determining the devolution of intestate personal property by the courts of the state in which such insured individual is domiciled at the time such applicant files application or,if such insured individual is dead,by the courts of the state in which he was domiciled at the time of his death.
moreover,if an applicant is unable to inherit from the deceased wage earner under state intestacy law,the act provides three alternative mechanisms by which to deem the applicant a child for purposes of survivor benefits.these alternatives are,on their face,inapplicable here and are set forth only for completeness.first,the applicant is deemed to be the child of the insured individual if the applicant is the son or daughter and the covered parent went through a marriage ceremony that would have been valid but for a legal impediment.id.h b.second,the applicant is deemed to be the child where the insured individual,before death,either a acknowledged in writing that the applicant was his or her child b was decreed by a court to be the mother or father of the applicant or c was ordered by a court to pay child support.id.h c i.third,the applicant is deemed to be the child where the deceased individual is shown to be the mother or father,and the deceased individual was living with or contributing to the child support at the time of death.id.h c ii.
thus,child is defined in different subsections of the act e and again in h a,h b,and h.were we to determine that the h a definition of child is appropriate here and go on to apply the law of intestacy of florida,as the commissioner argues we should,we would affi
