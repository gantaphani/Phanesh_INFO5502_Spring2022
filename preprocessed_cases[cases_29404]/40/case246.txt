this is the second appearance here of a civil rights suit under brought by a group of contract employees against the municipality of aguada in puerto rico and two municipal officers.see iv,cir.that opinion,with which we assume familiarity,states the underlying facts.
in the earlier phases of this case,before the appeal and remand,a jury rejected plaintiffs claim that they suffered political party affiliation discrimination in violation of their first amendment rights.this left only one federal claim in the case whether plaintiffs had,on the facts of this case,a sufficient property interest in their employment by the municipality to invoke federal constitutional procedural due process rights and whether those rights were violated.
between june and september,the mayor of aguada gave plaintiffs approximately contracts of employment with the municipality,through june.these contracts stated that plaintiffs employment was by way of a grant from the commonwealth to the municipality under law.that law authorizes the commonwealth to grant municipalities certain funds to promote local employment.see laws.ann.tit.law funds initially paid for plaintiffs salaries.after six months of funding under law ended on december,plaintiffs were paid for another month with municipal funds.the municipality terminated their employment on january,without notice or hearing,some five months shy of the expiration of their contracts.
in order for plaintiffs to have procedural due process rights in their employment,each plaintiff must have had a reasonable expectation,based on a statute,policy,rule,or contract,that he or she would continue to be employed.see wojcik.state lottery comm n,cir.these interests are commonly called property interests,and we look to state law to see if such property interests exist.iv,at citing bishop wood.whether these property interests rise to a level sufficient to trigger procedural due process protections remains a federal question.id.
in our prior decision,we vacated the district court entry of judgment in favor of defendants,which was based on its determination that either the law contract or municipal law required that each plaintiff hiring contract be read to include the implicit condition that the term of employment was conditioned on the municipality receipt of law funding.id.at.
after a discussion of law and pertinent municipal law,we held that this rationale was not dispositive or supported,that more analysis was needed,and that puerto rican law on the subject was unclear.id.at.we vacated and remanded so the court could address whether puerto rican law supplies any sort of property interest once the law funding ceased.id.at.
on remand,the district court directed both parties to file for summary judgment,granted summary judgment for plaintiffs,and held an evidentiary hearing on related facts.the district court held that on the undisputed facts,plaintiffs had a continued expectation of employment even though the law funding had expired.see,d,v.it so held because municipal law did not prohibit the municipality from using general funds to continue paying plaintiffs salaries,and the municipality knew it had substantial uncommitted funds when it terminated plaintiffs contracts.id.at.
the court further found that plaintiffs expectation constituted a property interest in continued employment cognizable under the due process clause.id.at.it also held that there was no indication from defendants that there were any adequate state remedies.id.at.after a trial on damages,a jury granted compensatory damages,punitive damages,and back pay to plaintiffs.
the municipality and the individual defendants have appealed.we address their contentions in turn.
denial of certification to puerto rico supreme court 
after more than nine years of litigation,a prior appeal,and having lost at trial,defendants ask that questions be certified to the supreme court of puerto rico.the request is more than a little was not raised until after the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying certification.see steel dematteo constr,cir.
in addition to being untimely,the two questions defendants ask to be certified are the wrong questions.defendants say the dispositive,unsettled questions of puerto rican law on the procedural due process claim are whether a appointment made under law creates a legitimate expectation of continued employment for the entire year if,at the time of appointment,the law allotment was only for six months and whether the municipality must continue funding those appointments from other funds once law funds expire.
the more significant question of puerto rican law necessary to resolve plaintiffs claim,however,is whether,under municipal law,the municipality could choose to use general municipal funds to pay for law positions beyond the funding from the law grant,so as to create a legitimate expectation of an approximately appointment.the district court held that the municipality was allowed,but not required,to do so under municipal law.see v,d at.the remaining questions concerning the application of that principle to the facts of this case were for the federal court to resolve.we decline to certify,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so.
ii.existence of procedural due process rights 
the district court granted summary judgment for plaintiffs because it found as a matter of law that plaintiffs had a property interest under state law,which was cognizable under the due process clause,and that defendants deprived plaintiffs of that right without due process of law.id.at.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo and will affirm if there is no genuine issue as to any issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.dep t of,cir.
there are no contested material facts.the only questions before us are legal ones,specifically whether,based on contractual,policy,or other sources derived from puerto rican law,plaintiffs had a property interest in continued employment with the municipality whether that interest is a constitutionally protected right under the due process clause of the federal constitution and whether the municipality deprived plaintiffs of that right without providing constitutionally adequate process.see maymi ports,cir.plaintiffs satisfied all these conditions,and we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in their favor.
existence of property interests 
we first address whether plaintiffs had a reasonable expectation of continued employment,based on their contracts,surrounding puerto rican law,and the facts of the case.we hold that they did.
the undisputed established that when the municipality hired plaintiffs,the contracts committed the municipality to employing plaintiffs for almost a year,through june,though the municipality knew that the law grant expired on december,approximately six months into that period.
the municipality also had the power to commit to employing plaintiffs for their full contractual terms,despite the limited duration of the law funds.law does not,by its terms,prohibit municipalities from supplementing law monies with municipal funds,see laws.ann.tit,and the commonwealth law agreement with the municipality here specifically provided that i f the municipality offers to the employees other benefits which are not part of this agreement,the municipality assumes responsibility therefore and pays them with its funds.iv,at.
nor was the municipality prohibited by law from making this commitment.indeed,the autonomous municipalities act authorizes the mayor to propose readjustments to the municipality general expenses budget when there are anticipated surpluses.see laws.ann.tit.
further,it is undisputed that the municipality acted in ways to confirm plaintiffs contractual expectations.after the law funds expired,the municipality paid plaintiffs for some weeks out of municipal funds,confirming plaintiffs expectation that their employment would continue under their contracts even after the law funds expired.this is sufficient to show that plaintiffs had a property interest in continued employment under state law.
