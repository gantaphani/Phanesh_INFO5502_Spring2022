in,appellee,buck doe,brought an action against appellant,the united states secretary of labor the government,seeking damages under the privacy act for the wrongful disclosure of his social security number.we previously on a reading of the act a party must show some actual damages in order to recover in statutory damages.that decision was affirmed by the united states supreme court and we remanded to the district court,where the court granted doe motion for attorney fees and costs.neither the supreme court opinion nor our original opinion addressed the separate question presented today,which is whether a person who can not show actual damages under the act may still recover costs and reasonable attorney fees.we now affirm the district court conclusion that doe is entitled to costs and reasonable attorney fees even though he suffered no actual damages.because,however,we conclude that the district court did not properly calculate the amount of attorney fees,we reverse the district court judgment and remand the case for further proceedings in light of this opinion.
because this is the second time this case is before us,we only briefly recite the pertinent facts and procedural history.
like most applicants for benefits under the black lung benefits act,doe provided his social security number to the department of labor office of workers compensation programs.the government,in order to facilitate the processing of black lung claims,used applicants social security numbers as unique identifiers.the social security numbers were often reproduced to other applicants,their employers,and counsel,and were frequently included in published administrative law decisions.
robert doe,who was also a black lung benefit claimant,filed suit against the secretary of labor on february.the government promptly recognized that in reproducing social security numbers in such a way,it exceeded the limits set by the privacy act.see b west supp.on february,the government stipulated to a district court consent decree in robert doe case prohibiting future publication of black lung benefit applicants social security numbers.later that day,doe and five other claimants initiated six separate lawsuits seeking equitable relief and money damages under the privacy act.see doe chao,d,doe iv summarizing case history these lawsuits were consolidated with robert doe suit on june,and the seven claimants sought monetary damages for violations of the privacy act,as well as certification of the class of every black lung benefit claimant who applied for benefits since the passage of the act.
the parties filed for summary judgment and on july,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification and granted summary judgment in favor of the government for all claimants except doe.doe herman,no,wl.july,doe i.the court also granted summary judgment in favor of doe and awarded him in statutory damages despite the fact that doe suffered no actual damages.id.at.
the parties and we affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the government and reversed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of doe.doe chao,cir doe ii.we held that because doe could not show actual damages,the plain language of the privacy act precluded him from obtaining an award of statutory damages.id.at.
the supreme court granted certiorari to decide whether some actual damages must be proven before a plaintiff may receive the minimum statutory award under the privacy act.see doe chao,d doe iii.the supreme court affirmed the judgment of this court on february,holding that doe was not entitled to an award of statutory damages because he failed to show any actual damages.id.at.
after the supreme court decision,the case was remanded to the district court,where doe made a motion for attorney fees and costs under g b of the privacy act,which the district court granted.doe iv,d at.the district court reasoned that both the language of the statute and congressional intent favored recovery of costs and fees by a party who did not recover any actual damages as long as the party could show an adverse effect caused by an intentional or willful violation.id.at.because the district court concluded that doe earlier suit established that he was adversely affected by the government intentional or willful violation,it awarded him in costs and attorney fees.id.at.
the government timely appealed,arguing that when a party is unable to show actual damages,he or she is also precluded from recovering costs and fees.the government bases its argument on the plain text of the privacy act,language from the supreme court opinion in doe iii,and canons of construction.in the alternative,the government argues that the only reasonable attorney fee in this case is no fee at all.
we review de novo the district court legal determination that g of the privacy act permits a party who does not recover actual damages to recover costs and attorney fees.see in re coleman,cir a ruling concerning the proper interpretation of a statute is a legal determination,which we review de novo.as always,we begin our analysis with the text of the statute.see state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers,d noting that we begin as we do in any exercise of statutory construction with the text of the provision in question.
section g provides 
in any suit brought under the provisions of subsection g c or d of this section in which the court determines that the agency acted in a manner which was intentional or willful,the united states shall be liable to the individual in an amount equal to the sum of 
a actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure,but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of and 
b the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.
g.subsection g d,under which doe suit is maintained,authorizes individuals to bring a civil action for the government failure to comply with the privacy act when that failure causes an adverse effect on the individual.
the text of g d and g clearly provide that if an individual can show an adverse effect caused by the government intentional or willful breach of the statute,the government shall be liable to that individual for the sum of a actual damages and b the costs and reasonable attorney fees of the action.it is undisputed that doe suffered an adverse effect caused by the government intentional or willful violation of the privacy act.under a plain reading,then,the government is liable to doe for the sum of his actual damages and costs and fees.
the government,however,argues that the plain language of the statute shows that g authorizes an award of attorney fees and costs only to parties who can show actual damages.in particular,the government argues that the term sum means that liability exists only if damages are established.appellant br.at.we find the government argument without merit.
the word sum as it is used in this a court to fulfill the simple act of adding actual damages and fees and costs once the preceding elements of the statute are satisfied.see webster ii new riverside university dictionary defining sum as t he total obtained as a result of adding thus,subsection g b acts independent of subsection g a.in other words,the statute does not require a showing of actual damages under g a in order to receive costs and reasonable attorney fees under g b.if a court determined actual damages to be and costs and reasonable attorney fees to be,for example,as a mathematical matter the sum of those two numbers is.likewise,if actual damages were determined to be and costs and fees were,the sum would again be.in short,the fact that one of two numbers might be zero does not prove that when added to another number,the sum of the two numbers must also equal zero.the word sum requires us to engage in addition,not multiplication 
thus,because doe suffered an adverse effect caused by the government intentional or willful violation of the act,the government is liable to doe for actual damages plus costs and reasonable attorney fees.the face of the statute leaves no room for confusion on this point 
when the language of a statute fairly can be understood to have only one,specific is the case with g b that fact would ordinarily signal the end of our discussion.see dodd united states,d when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.internal quotation marks omitted.there are,however,two reasons to pause in this instance.first,the government argues that language in the supreme court doe iii decision effectively decides this case in its favor.second,a result that grants costs and attorney fees to a party who does not recover monetary damages is quite unusual,and as the supreme court has previously noted,b efore we will conclude congress abandoned the established principle that a successful party need not pay its unsuccessful adversary fees a clear showing that this result was intended is required.ruckelshaus sierra club,d.
the government argument that the supreme court decision in doe iii precludes the holding we would reach based on the plain reading of the statute is primarily based on doe iii reading of the term liable in the act,footnote,and discussion of what completes a cause of action.we disagree with the government reading of doe iii.
in doe iii,the supreme court noted that the statute does not speak of liability and consequent entitlement to recovery in a,unqualified way,but in a limited way,by reference to enumerated damages.doe iii.at.in other words,the phrase entitled to recovery in subsection g a informs the nature of the government liability.a showing of an adverse effect and willfulness means not just that the government is generally liable rather,the government is liable for something specific.here,the government is liable for the sum of actual damages and costs and reasonable attorney fees.
the government interprets the supreme court language,however,to mean that o nly when a plaintiff proves actual damages as an element of his merits claim will the united states become liable for damages and the accompanying costs and fees.appellant br.at.it is unclear why the government reads this language from doe was concerned entirely with g a,not g b to have any implication on costs and attorney fees.in fact,in no place did the court in doe iii purport to interpret g b.instead,the government rephrasing should have stopped a few words short,as a proper interpretation of the supreme court language is the more obvious one that only when a plaintiff proves actual damages with his merits claim will the united states become liable for actual damages or the statutory damage amount that replaces actual damages.
the government argument fails to recognize that the statute separates damages from costs and fees in two different subsections and requires courts to add the two amounts when liability attaches.that such liability attaches upon a showing of an adverse effect and that the violation was intentional or willful is clear from the statute text.once such liability attaches,the government is liable for actual damages if there are any plus costs and reasonable attorney fees if there are any.the supreme court phrase,then,means nothing more than the obvious fact that the government can not be liable for actual damages if there are no actual damages.
the government also argues that doe iii footnote rejects any analysis that fails to treat actual damages as the recovery entitling a plaintiff to costs and attorney fees.again,we disagree with the government.
footnote was a response to a specific argument put forth in dissent by judge michael in doe ii.in his dissent,judge michael recognized that the statute text allows for a plaintiff who has proven an intentional or willful violation of the privacy act to recover costs and reasonable attorney fees even if the plaintiff has suffered no actual damages at all.doe ii,at michael,dissenting in part.this recognition was nothing more than a restatement of the plain meaning of the statute.judge michael went on,however,to argue that the majority erred in concluding that a person is not entitled to recovery under g a even though the united states is liable to that person for costs and attorney fees under g b.id.at.the majority in doe ii rejected this interpretation because it did not believe that congress would have invoked a term whose definition is dependent upon a subsequent statutory provision,and,in the context of g a,which concerns damages,recovery is not plausibly read to reference litigation costs in the absence of any underlying compensable injury.id.at.
in footnote,the supreme court also rejected judge michael argument.the supreme court understood judge michael to argue that any plaintiff who can demonstrate that he was adversely affected by intentional or willful agency action is entitled to costs and reasonable attorney fees under g b,and is for that reason a person entitled to recovery of actual damages under subsection g a.doe iii.at emphasis added.the court then dismissed the argument because i nstead of treating damages as a recovery entitling a plaintiff to costs and fees,this analysis would treat costs and fees as the recovery entitling a plaintiff to minimum damages it would get the cart before the horse.id.in other words,even assuming that doe is entitled to attorney fees,it would be a mistake to conclude that an award of fees makes doe a person entitled to recovery of actual damages under subsection g a.by so holding,the supreme court did not attempt to address in dicta whether doe was entitled to attorney fees,but instead confined its inquiry to the issue before it that is,whether doe would be entitled to recover monetary damages because he incurred attorney fees 
the government next argues that doe iii requires a showing of actual damages in order for a plaintiff to have a cause of action under subsection g.although the supreme court language may be subject to different interpretations,we do not believe it can be interpreted in the manner suggested by the government.
in doe iii,the court responded to doe argument that it would have been illogical for congress to create a cause of action for anyone who suffers an adverse effect from intentional or willful agency action,then deny recovery without actual damages.doe iii.at.justice souter opinion noted that subsection g d language recognizing a federal civil action on the part of someone adversely affected does not alone create a complete cause of action.id.there must also be proof of intent or willfulness in addition to adverse effect,and if the specific state of mind must be proven additionally,it is equally consistent with logic to require some actual damages as well.id.at.accordingly,then,an individual subjected to an adverse effect has injury enough to open the courthouse door,but without more has no cause of action for damages under the privacy act.id.at.
the government argues that this language stands for the proposition that actual damages are part of the underlying cause of action and that by failing to show actual damages,doe may not now recover costs and fees.we disagree.we understand the supreme court language as stating what must be shown or proved in order to prevail under the cause of action created by subsection g in order to be entitled to the remedy delineated in g a.in other words,in order to succeed on the underlying cause of action and be entitled to a remedy of actual damages,a litigant must show actual damages.because he could not show actual damages,doe was not entitled to monetary relief for the violation of the underlying cause of action that congress created with the privacy act.
the government and judge michael dissent read far too much into one single paragraph of the supreme court doe iii opinion while simultaneously ignoring longstanding precedent.to accept the government reading would be to conflate the underlying cause of action with the remedy provided.the government argument suggests that relief is part of the underlying cause of action.this is not so.such a reading fails to recognize traditional jurisprudential understandings of causes of actions 
in davis passman,d,the supreme court detailed the history of the phrase cause of action,and recognized that traditionally the phrase refers roughly to the alleged invasion of recognized legal rights upon which a litigant bases his claim for relief.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,t he concept of a cause of action is employed specifically to determine who may judicially enforce the statutory rights or obligations.id.at.the davis court noted that the question of whether a litigant has a cause of action is analytically distinct and prior to the question of what relief,if any,a litigant may be entitled to receive.id.moreover,the court recognized that it is possible for a plaintiff to have a cause of action even though he be entitled to no relief at all.id.at.therefore,a cause of action is not connected to the quality or extent of injury,but instead concerns whether the plaintiff belongs to a class of litigants that may use the courts to enforce a right see also transamerica mortgage advisors,lewis,d noting that the question of whether a cause of action exists is distinct from the question of the nature of relief available in such an action ragsdale wolverine world wide,d to prevail under a cause of action set out in,an employee must prove,as a threshold matter,that the employer violated by interfering with,restraining,or denying his or her exercise of fmla rights.even then,provides no relief unless the employee has been prejudiced by the violation.
in the case of g,then,congress created a cause of action for a class of litigants who are adversely affected by the government intentional or willful violation of the privacy act.in order to be entitled to monetary subsection g a,a litigant must show actual damages if there are no actual damages,of course,a litigant is entitled to none.just the same,however,in order to be entitled to subsection g b,a litigant must show that he incurred costs and reasonable attorney fees.but the cause of action itself is provided to those litigants who are adversely affected by the government intentional or willful violation of the privacy act the government argument,on the other hand,mirrors the very misunderstanding over the difference between a cause of action and the relief afforded under it that the supreme court attempted to clarify in davis.franklin gwinnett county pub.schools,d.
in short,we find nothing in the supreme court doe iii opinion that trumps the plain meaning of the statute.
the government argues that aside from doe iii,we must also interpret g b through the lens of two canons of statutory construction.first,it suggests that statutory grants of the right to recover attorney fees and costs must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign.second,the government argues that g does not amount to a clear showing of congressional intent to depart from the rule that a prevailing party need not pay a party litigation costs and fees 
the government correctly recognizes that the scope of the government waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign.lane pena,d.moreover,i t is that attorneys fees may be assessed against the united states only when it has waived its sovereign immunity by statute.moore,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.thus,we will conclude that congress intended to waive the government sovereign immunity for an award of attorneys fees only when congress expresses such intent unambiguously.see id.noting the court task of determining whether congress waiver of immunity for fees in civil actions unambiguously extends to habeas proceedings.
in examining g b,we find no ambiguity in congress waiver.as we noted in part ii,supra,we believe the text of this statute as it relates to doe quest for attorney fees is clear.our conclusion that the statute,on its face,undoubtedly allows for doe to recover an award of attorney fees could not have been made without a simultaneous recognition that the statute also unambiguously waives the government immunity and makes it liable to doe for costs and fees.the statute permits of no other reading.
in ruckelshaus,the supreme court noted that requiring a defendant,completely successful on all issues,to pay the unsuccessful plaintiff legal fees would be a radical departure from principles adhered to in a wide range of contexts.at.relying on ruckelshaus,the government argues that in order for doe attorney fee award to stand,we must find that congress made a clear showing of its intent to abandon the principle that parties may not recover costs and attorney fees.see id.at.
ruckelshaus concerned a provision of the clean air act,which permitted a court to award costs of litigation including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees whenever the court determines that such an award is appropriate.id.at.emphasis in original.in the underlying case,the sierra club was unsuccessful in its attacks against an epa regulation,but the circuit nonetheless granted the club attorney fees because their briefs and arguments were helpful to understanding a very complex issue.see sierra club gorsuch.the supreme court reversed the circuit decision,concluding that congress included the word appropriate in the statute in order to ensure that a party who was completely unsuccessful on the merits would not be able to recover costs and fees.ruckelshaus,at.ultimately,the court concluded that the provision lacked a clear showing from congress,which was needed in order for a party who wrongly charges someone with violations of the law to force a defendant to pay the costs of the wholly unsuccessful suit against it.id.at.
ruckelshaus does not aid the government here.the clean air act provision at issue in ruckelshaus was meaningfully different from the privacy act provision here.the provision at issue in ruckelshaus allowed the award of costs and reasonable fees when appropriate.other statutes have similar language,allowing for either when appropriate or in the interest of justice.see,a west stating that in addition to damages in a suit under the consumer product safety act,a litigant may recover costs and reasonable attorneys fees if the court determines it to be in the interest of justice.notably,however,congress took a decidedly different path under g b and did not condition the award of costs and reasonable fees on whether a court found them to be appropriate or in the interest of justice.instead,congress attached no qualifications,only requiring an intentional or willful violation that causes an adverse effect.moreover,in doe i,the district court found that doe suffered an adverse effect from the government intentional violation of the privacy act.the government was found to have violated the privacy act,but doe suffered no actual damages because of that violation.thus,unlike the sierra club in ruckelshaus,doe is not an example of a party who wrongly charges someone with violations of the law.ruckelshaus,at.
in addition,because the statute is unambiguous,it necessarily makes a clear showing that circumstances like doe should recover costs and reasonable attorney fees.by declining to include any qualifying phrase like appropriate or in the interest of the justice,congress created an explicit statutory scheme that has the potential of making the government liable for costs and reasonable fees even when the government is not liable for actual damages.although this scheme may produce atypical results,it is not the province of the courts to alter plain congressional text that does not offend the constitution instead,we must take congress at its word.see connecticut bank germain,d we have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.when the words of a statute are unambiguous,then judicial inquiry is complete.
as it relates to attorney fees and costs,and given the supreme court interpretation in doe iii,g is a clear statute.it makes the government liable for costs and reasonable attorney fees when the government intentionally or willfully violates the privacy act and that violation causes the litigant an adverse affect.moreover,it does so unambiguously and without qualification.
the government next contends that even if the district court was correct in concluding that the government was liable to doe for costs and reasonable attorney fees,the court abused its discretion and awarded doe an unreasonable fee.we agree.
we review a district court award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion.johnson city of aiken,cir.in reviewing such discretionary rulings,we have adhered to the proposition that discretion has been abused if a court has failed adequately to consider judicially recognized factors constraining its exercise of discretion,or in relying on erroneous factual or legal premises.mid atl.med,llc sereboff,internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has held that when statutes use similar language,they should be interpreted alike.indep.fed of flight attendants zipes,d.moreover,the word reasonable is a term of art frequently used by congress in statutes accordingly,the supreme court case law construing what is a reasonable fee applies uniformly to all statutes.city of burlington dague,d.
the government contends that because doe sought money damages from the united states,and was awarded none,the only reasonable attorney fee is no fee at all doe,on the other hand,counters by arguing that the real value and importance in his suit should not be measured by the monetary award,but instead by the declaratory and injunctive relief he obtained.accordingly,he argues that his attorney fee award can be justified based on that relief.
we find doe argument unpersuasive.first,doe did not win any declaratory or injunctive relief.while it is true that an injunction was entered prohibiting the government from identifying black lung claimants social security numbers in the future,doe had no meaningful role in that injunction.the district court issued a consent decree on february,granting the injunctive relief.it was not until later that day that doe joined the action,and he was not even a signatory to the decree.see doe iv,d at.
second,and more importantly,subsection g d of the privacy act does not allow courts to grant injunctive or declaratory relief.in fact,the only relief available to doe under that subsection is monetary relief.see doe iii,at.ginsburg,dissenting on other grounds it bears emphasis that the privacy act does not authorize injunctive relief when suit is maintained under g c or d.doe stephens,holding that aside from two specific subsections,the privacy act precludes other forms of declaratory and injunctive relief clarkson irs,cir the privacy act expressly provides for injunctive relief for only two types of agency misconduct,that is,wrongful withholding of documents under subsection d and wrongful refusal to amend an individual record under subsection d.the remedy for violations of all other provisions of the act is limited to recovery of damages upon a showing that the agency acted in an intentional or willful manner.internal citation omitted hanley united states dep t of justice,cir holding that the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiffs is precluded under the privacy act by the failure of congress to provide for such relief parks united states,cir same cell,inst.of health,holding that the privacy act makes no provision for injunctive relief to prevent violations of subsection b as part of the remedies that it does provide even assuming,for the sake of argument,that doe suit obtained some declaratory or injunctive relief,such relief could not possibly have been obtained,standing alone,under the relevant subsections of the privacy act.instead,any equitable relief obtained in the original action stemmed from the administrative procedures act see doe iii,at.indeed,the district court relied on the apa in determining that it had jurisdiction to enforce the stipulated order prohibiting the department of labor from using social security numbers in multiparty captions.simply put,because the privacy act does not allow doe to obtain injunctive relief under subsections g c or d,it also bars doe from securing an award of costs and fees based on any injunctive relief he actually obtained.
we therefore return to the question of whether doe fee award was reasonable in light of his failure to prove monetary damages.where recovery of private damages is the purpose of litigation,a district court,in fixing fees,is obligated to give primary consideration to the amount of damages awarded as compared to the amount sought.farrar hobby,d.moreover,a reduced fee award is appropriate if the relief,however significant,is limited in comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole.hensley eckerhart,d.accordingly,if a plaintiff recovers only nominal damages the only reasonable fee is usually no fee at all.farrar,at.finally,and most importantly,when a district court determines what fee is reasonable,the most critical factor in that determination is the degree of success obtained.hensley,at.
the basis of doe suit under the privacy act was monetary damages.he sought damages for emotional distress,but as we concluded in doe ii,he failed to show any actual damages.accordingly,the government asks us to find that when a plaintiff fails to prove any actual damages in his quest for monetary relief under g,the only reasonable fee is usually no fee at all.farrar,at.
the district court considered,but ultimately rejected this argument,finding that it was nothing more than a restatement of the government previous argument that since doe failed to recover actual damages he is not entitled to an award of costs and attorneys fees doe iv,d at.the district court found that the government argument reads reasonable attorneys fees as requiring that a party achieve some success on the merits before he can recover.id.at.thus,according to the district court,the government definition of the word reasonable impermissibly incorporates a substantially prevail requirement into the statute.id.
we disagree with the district court.statutes that require a complainant to substantially prevail in order to obtain costs and fees do so as a prerequisite to obtaining fees.see ruckelshaus,at.noting that most statutes require that a party prevail or substantially prevail in order to obtain fees emphasis added.that is to say,a party has no claim whatsoever to fees under such are not implicated in this the party substantially prevailed in their underlying claim.see,reinbold evers,cir noting that the question of whether a party who has substantially prevailed is entitled to recover attorneys fees is not reached unless and until the party has proved he has substantially prevailed emphasis in original.the word reasonable,as it is used in statutes,such as the one here,however,has a distinct meaning,and it is only after a district court determines that it may award attorney fees that the word reasonable comes into play.see hensley,at.stating that after a court determines that a party prevailed under the statute,i t remains for the district court to determine what fee is reasonable.put simply,reasonableness concerns the appropriate amount of fees once they are determined to be authorized,whereas whether a party substantially prevails concerns the appropriateness of awarding fees at all.
thus,the district court erred in its reasonableness analysis by failing to give primary consideration to the amount of damages awarded as compared to the amount sought by doe,a consideration that exists in order to constrain a court discretion in setting an award.see farrar,at.indeed,the most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee award is the degree of success obtained.id.internal quotation marks omitted.here,doe failed to recover any monetary award,despite the fact that damages were the primary goal of his suit.because his underlying litigation was largely unsuccessful,it is unlikely that doe may recover significant attorney fees.see hetzel county of prince william,cir holding that because the plaintiff gained but an insignificant portion of the relief she originally requested and because she has failed to prevail on her most consequential claims,she is entitled only to a fraction of her attorney fees.
accordingly,because we find that the district court abused its discretion in determining the reasonableness of the fee award,we vacate the award and because the district court is in the best position to determine what is a reasonable attorney fee award,we remand to the district court for recalculation of fees we do not,however,disturb the district court calculation of buck doe litigation costs.subsection g b states that the government shall be liable for the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees.doe is therefore entitled to the actual costs of his action unrestrained by any reasonableness inquiry.
in sum,we agree with the district court interpretation of the privacy act.it plainly states that the government shall be liable for costs and reasonable attorney fees when its intentional or willful violation of the act adversely affects a litigant,and neither the supreme court doe iii opinion nor canons of construction lead to an opposite conclusion.because,however,the district court failed to determine the reasonableness of doe attorney fee award in light of the fact that doe recovered no damages,we vacate that portion of the award pertaining to fees and remand to the district court for reconsideration.we affirm that portion of the award pertaining to costs.
affirmed in part vacated and remanded in part.
if this case had called for examination of the privacy act text and nothing else,perhaps i would have subscribed to the majority reading of the statute.the statutory text alone,however,can not be the sole focus here because the supreme court has spoken,if not on the exact question posed,then at least on a subject very closely related.as a subordinate appellate court,our responsibility is to give effect to statutory text in a way that hews to supreme court guidance on how to interpret that text.because i believe we must weigh the supreme court words more heavily than does today majority,i respectfully dissent.although i concluded when this case was previously before us that buck doe had the better argument,here the government ought to carry the day.the supreme court doe chao opinion virtually compels us to hold that a plaintiff who has not suffered actual damages under g a can not allege all of the elements of a claim for relief under the privacy act and may not as a result recover costs or attorney fees under g b.notwithstanding what the majority says,ante at,i am not attempting to rewrite the privacy act i am simply following the supreme court teachings on how to construe that act.
i dissented in part from our earlier opinion because i disagreed with the conclusion that a plaintiff such as buck doe must suffer actual damages to be eligible for statutory damages under g a.doe chao,cir doe ii michael,concurring in part and dissenting in part.the supreme court affirmed the result reached by the doe ii majority.doe chao,d doe iii.in doe iii the supreme court suggested clearly how we should analyze eligibility for a recovery of costs and fees under g b,even though that fee provision was not then in dispute.
specifically,justice souter wrote for the court a n individual subjected to an adverse effect has injury enough to open the courthouse door,but without more has no cause of action for damages under the privacy act.at.further,in a footnote rejecting part of the reasoning in my doe ii dissent,the supreme court indicated that proper analysis of the is,analysis that correctly places the horse before the cart would treat damages as a recovery entitling a plaintiff to costs and fees.id.at.today majority quotes these passages.ante at.despite doing so,the majority fails to follow the path that the supreme court marked for us in its interpretation of the privacy act.i believe that path is clear.since we must,so to speak,put the horse before the cart,damages must be a prerequisite to costs and fees.a plaintiff who has suffered no damages may have standing injury enough to open the courthouse door,doe iii,at,but because such a plaintiff has no cause of action under the act,he can not be eligible for judicial relief,including attorney fees and costs.
the majority avoids confrontation with footnote of doe iii by reading that footnote as pertaining only to doe g a claim.see ante at asserting that the supreme court did not attempt to address in dicta whether doe was entitled to attorney fees.this approach ignores the footnote direct statement that damages are treated as a recovery entitling a plaintiff to costs and fees.doe iii,at.this statement was not crucial to doe iii holding,and it is dicta so far as doe claim for attorney fees is concerned.that does not end the analysis,however.we said long ago that certainly dicta of the united states supreme court should be very persuasive.fouts maryland casualty,cir.moreover,c ourts frequently and properly cite and rely upon dicta that correctly set forth governing or relevant legal principles.new york life ins.united states.the question presented in doe iii did not have to involve attorney fees for the supreme court reasoning on how to interpret the privacy act to be highly persuasive authority.this reasoning should guide us here.
i also take seriously the supreme court lesson about the distinction between plaintiffs who have standing to sue and those who have a true cause of action under the privacy act.doe iii,at.the majority attempts to sidestep this precept by emphasizing the differences between a cause of action and the relief that a plaintiff who has a cause of action may recover.ante at,quoting franklin gwinnett county pub,d,and davis passman,d.the majority also criticizes the government for failing to appreciate these differences,ante at,but it is the majority that has missed the mark.
the supreme court has often stated that the question of what remedies are available under a statute that provides a private right of action is analytically distinct from the issue of whether such a right exists in the first place.franklin,at.quoting davis,at.this sentence clarifies that davis discussion of causes of action and appropriate relief arose in a particular legal context,namely the supreme court jurisprudence on implied private rights of action.in that context,it may be said that cause of action is a question of whether a particular plaintiff is a member of the class of litigants that may,as a matter of law,appropriately invoke the power of the court and relief is a question of the various remedies a federal court may make available.davis,at.
the relationship between that context and doe case is tangential at best,however,because congress has expressly empowered plaintiffs to bring private suits for money damages under the privacy act.the phrase cause of action has long denoted more than one legal concept.in the supreme court,speaking through justice cardozo,explained that the court ha d not committed itself to the view that the phrase is susceptible of any single definition that will be independent of the context or of the relation to be governed.united states memphis cotton oil.in the years since the court has continued to emphasize that the phrase meaning depends on context.see steel citizens for a better env t,d stevens,concurring indicating that davis construed only one meaning of the term.a more careful examination should have led the majority to see that the legal concept at issue in davis,a case assessing an implied right of action,was not the same as the concept at issue in doe iii,a case assessing the elements of an express statutory claim.our task is simply to identify and apply the concept appropriate to this case.
rather than look far afield to davis and franklin again,cases concerning implied rights of action to understand the privacy act cause of action,i would look principally to doe iii itself.some causes of action do not require damages as an element of a claim for relief others such as the traditional tort of negligence do.the supreme court taught us in doe iii that the privacy act cause of action is one of the latter.in particular,the supreme court found doe argument under g a inconsistent with the traditional understanding that tort recovery requires not only wrongful act plus causation reaching to the pla
