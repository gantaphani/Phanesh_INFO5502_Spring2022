obedience to the biblical injunction contained in the commandment remember to keep holy the sabbath day,and on it to do no work,directly conflicts,on this appeal,with appellant work schedule at his employment requiring us to determine whether his employer accommodation of appellant religious practices passes statutory muster.
plaintiff louis cosme plaintiff or appellant was employed by the defendant united states postal service defendant or appellee for many years as a letter carrier at the lincolnton station in upper manhattan.prior to the events that are the subject of this litigation,cosme became affiliated with the worldwide church of god,which holds as a condition of church membership that its members observe the sabbath,by refraining from work on the seventh day of the week that runs from friday sunset to saturday sunset.thus,on different saturdays running from december to march,appellant did not report for work at the lincolnton station.that failure on his part spawned the present litigation in which we must decide whether the postal service attempts to adjust cosme work schedule in light of his religious beliefs discharged the obligation congress imposed on employers under j of the civil rights act of,j.section j directs employers to reasonably accommodate an employee religious practices,so long as that accommodation does not cause undue hardship on the conduct of the employer business.believing such obligation was fully discharged by the postal service,we affirm.
saturdays off 
in plaintiff worked as a letter carrier driving a postal truck and delivered parcel post in those areas of upper manhattan served by the lincolnton station.cosme worked a fixed monday to friday schedule.in the lincolnton parcel post operation was relocated and,as a result,only one of six parcel post delivery trucks remained in operation.
stanley becton,the postal worker previously assigned to the remaining parcel post truck,had a work schedule with fixed days off on saturday and sunday.at the time of the parcel post relocation,becton resigned,thereby opening his position to bidding by other lincolnton employees.but when the route was posted for bidding by the lincolnton station manager,michele mcneill,the only fixed day off was now sunday,with saturday off rotating weekly among the other postal drivers.cosme insists that changing the days off guaranteed a conflict between his job and his religious beliefs and that mcneill changed the schedule to discriminate against him.mcneill explains,in response,that the change in the work schedule was required under the parcel post reorganization because otherwise overtime hours would be required to cover lincolnton parcel delivery demand and other drivers would have no opportunity to have a rotating saturday rest day.
even though the route no longer had a fixed saturday off,cosme decided to bid on the position,which he was sure to obtain with his accumulated seniority.when notified of cosme intentions,mcneill allegedly informed him that he would be required to work saturdays if he bid successfully and urged him to instead remain an unassigned regular,which would allow her to accommodate his scheduling needs.importantly,mcneill also allegedly advised cosme that as an unassigned regular,he could bid on vacancies at other postal stations in manhattan that did not require saturday work.dissatisfied with mcneill offer,cosme bid on the lincolnton route.
after plaintiff was awarded the position,he refused to work on saturdays,simply failing to report for work.for this failure,cosme was progressively disciplined,being first issued three letters of warning,and culminating finally in a notice of proposed removal in april.after receiving that notice,plaintiff entered into an arrangement with the postal service under which he worked four days at lincolnton,had saturday as a rest day,and worked sundays at another station.based on this agreement,the postal service terminated the proposed removal proceedings against him.with the saturdays off issue resolved,cosme turned his attention to a new position.
in addition to her attempt to accommodate cosme with an unassigned regular position,mcneill testified that she made three offers to plaintiff to transfer him to other postal stations within manhattan where he could work as a letter carrier with a fixed saturday off.specifically,mcneill said she offered to transfer him to the washington bridge,manhattanville,and church street stations.allegedly,mcneill spoke with the managers for these postal stations and obtained their agreement to take plaintiff with a schedule that afforded him saturdays off.although cosme suggests that some or all of these offers were not made,the district court found that a preponderance of the evidence supported mcneill account.in any case,plaintiff argues that these transfer offers were inadequate because he would suffer a loss of seniority for a period following any such transfer.at the expiration of days,however,he would regain his seniority and be able to bid on any open position.
postal inspector position 
in cosme applied for a position as a postal inspector,a highly competitive law enforcement position.plaintiff application was assigned to postal inspector david rivera for evaluation.after interviewing cosme,rivera visited lincolnton to review plaintiff employment records and to speak with supervisor mcneill.rivera learned that plaintiff had been censured for violating postal service driving policies once for leaving the scene of and failing to report an accident and another for making an illegal.according to rivera,these infractions were sufficiently serious to preclude him from recommending cosme for a postal inspector position.rivera also learned from mcneill that cosme had failed to report for work on numerous saturdays on account of his religion.rivera recommended against hiring cosme for a postal inspector position,and he was not hired.
prior legal proceedings 
after receiving a right to sue letter from the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc on february,plaintiff commenced this action on april,under title vii of the civil rights act of,et supp.v,alleging he was unlawfully discriminated against because of his religion when he was denied reasonable accommodation for his sabbath observance on saturdays.plaintiff further asserted that he was denied a promotion to postal inspector as a result of the same failure to accommodate him.defendant postal service filed an answer denying plaintiff claims.
on july,a bench trial was held in the united states district court for the southern district of new york before judge victor marrero.plaintiff called four witnesses stanley becton,michele mcneill,john frink the postal service manager for uptown manhattan that included lincolnton station,and ronald jackson the shop steward at lincolnton during the relevant time period.defendant called two witnesses stephen yamond the postal service manager,labor relations,new york district and david rivera.the testimony of these witnesses are reflected in the statement of facts just recited.plaintiff did not testify.
in its analysis of plaintiff claims,the district court first addressed cosme argument that the proposed transfers to other stations would not have accommodated his religious needs because the station managers where he would have been transferred were not obligated to give him saturdays off under the applicable collective bargaining agreement cba.in rejecting this argument,the district court noted that while the managers may not have been contractually obligated to adjust cosme schedule,the cba did not prevent them from doing so either.since the evidence established that the station managers had agreed to give cosme the time off,the court concluded that the cba was irrelevant.
having found that mcneill offered to accommodate plaintiff and that the cba did not prevent the postal service from implementing mcneill proposals,the district court next analyzed whether the options provided to cosme were reasonable.while plaintiff strongly objected to the loss of seniority he would suffer under the accommodations,the trial court nonetheless found this burden to be i
