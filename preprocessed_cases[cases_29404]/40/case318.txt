this appeal concerns the qui tam provisions of the false claims act the fca,which allow whistleblowers called relators to bring certain fraud claims on behalf of the united states the relators in this case,the mark duxbury and dean mcclellan together,the relators,alleged that ortho biotech products,obp violated the fca in unlawfully promoting the sale of its drug procrit.the district court dismissed all of the relators claims,and this appeal followed.after careful consideration,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
to provide context,we start with the statutory scheme.the fca contains qui tam provisions that supplement federal law enforcement resources by encouraging private citizens to uncover fraud on the government.rost,at.the qui tam provisions permit whistleblowers known as relators to bring certain fraud claims on behalf of the united states in return,a private relator is entitled to a portion of any proceeds from the suit,whether the united states intervenes as an active participant in the action or not.id.at.
the qui tam mechanism has historically been susceptible to abuse,however,by parasitic relators who bring fca damages claims based on information within the public domain or that the relator did not otherwise uncover.id.accordingly,congress has amended the fca several times to walk a fine line between encouraging and discouraging opportunistic behavior.see united states ex rel.prawer fleet bank of,cir quoting united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn,detailing the history of such amendments to the fca qui tam provisions.
as a result of these amendments,the fca includes jurisdictional bars that limit a district court subject matter jurisdiction over qui tam actions.two of these bars are relevant to this action.the first,known as the public disclosure bar,provides that a court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over any qui tam action that is based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions concerning the alleged fraud,unless,among other things,the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.e a.a relator qualifies as an original source if she has direct and independent knowledge of the information supporting her claims and she provided the information to the government before filing an action.id.e b.the second,known as the bar,provides that when a potential relator brings an fca action,no person other than the government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.id.b.
b.the complaints 
obp distributes and promotes brand name for epoetin drug approved by the fda for use to treat anemia resulting from chemotherapy,chronic kidney disease,hiv infection,and blood loss from certain types of surgery.both relators were sales representatives for obp who were responsible for the promotion and sale of procrit in the western united states.from to,obp employed relator duxbury,first as a product specialist and later as a regional key account specialist for obp western division oncology sales force.from to,obp employed relator mcclellan,also first as a product specialist but later as a territory manager for obp western division oncology sales force.
this appeal turns on a number of complaints filed by the relators and other parties,which we discuss in some detail below.
on november,duxbury,but not mcclellan,filed a complaint the original complaint in the district court for the district of massachusetts.the original complaint contained allegations concerning obp fraudulent reporting of the average wholesale price awp of procrit,a benchmark used by the medicare program for reimbursement purposes.it was filed hot on the heels of a master consolidated complaint the mcc filed in september in a litigation concerning the fraudulent reporting of awp.see generally in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,mdl,the awp mdl 
the original complaint contained two counts,one alleging substantive violations of the fca and the other a conspiracy count.compl.count i id.count ii.in support of the counts,the original complaint alleged that obp published a fraudulently inflated awp for procrit,which resulted in the filing of false claims for reimbursement with the medicare program.id.the original complaint further alleged that obp marketed the spread the difference between the higher,fraudulent awp and the lower,actual cost of induce medical providers to purchase procrit.id.thus,according to the original complaint,the spread not only caused the filing of false claims,but constituted an illegal kickback to health care providers.id.
the original complaint also alleged that obp provided free samples of procrit as well as financial inducements,such as rebates,discounts,unrestricted education grants,and phony drug studies.id.obp allegedly used these inducements to lower the providers net cost of purchasing procrit,and further inflate the awp,as the value of these services was kept off the book,so as not to be reflected in the awp.id.see also id.the original complaint alleged that these inducements also constituted illegal kickbacks.see id.
with respect to the phony drug studies,the original complaint alleged at paragraphs through that obp utilized phase iv marketing trials to,among other things,encourage the physician,clinic,or hospital to use the drug in a way which wa s inconsistent with its fda approved indications and administration methods.id.c.the original complaint referred specifically to a trial in which obp allegedly 
paid physicians to dose procrit at iu in a once per week dose instead of the fda approved dosage of iu three times per week dosage in patients.the trial was very successful and the once per week dosage is now universally accepted among oncologists.the trial success also resulted in medicare part b paying for of procrit in cancer chemotherapy patients instead of increase in in payments for each medicare beneficiary receiving procrit for treatment of their chemotherapy related anemia.
id.emphasis in original.the original complaint further alleged that t he iu dosage scheme was successful for ortho and doctors,but ortho ha d not received fda approval for such dosage.id.emphasis in original.
on december,about one month after the filing of the original complaint,kurt blair,also a former obp sales representative,filed a qui tam complaint the blair complaint against obp in the district court for the district of colorado.the blair complaint contained two counts.count i alleged that,beginning in,obp promoted a dosing regimen of units once per week even though it had not received approval from the fda for such a high dosage.blair compl.blair claimed that obp promoted this unapproved,dosage through a variety of means,such as direct marketing to medical professionals influencing the results of purportedly independent clinical studies and rebate programs offered to induce increased prescriptions of procrit,among other things.id.blair alleged that obp promotion of this use caused the filing of false claims for reimbursement with medicare and medicaid,insofar as the providers sought reimbursement for nonreimburseable uses.id.count ii alleged that obp caused the submission of false claims by,among other things,paying thousands of kickbacks to medicaid and medicare providers,causing the providers to write tens of thousands of prescriptions for procrit that would otherwise not have been written.id.
as required under the fca,both the original complaint and the blair complaint were filed under seal to allow the united states time to review both complaints and decide whether to intervene.b on march,the blair district court allowed the government motion to partially lift the seal on the blair complaint in order to disclose it to duxbury.
on july,duxbury,through his counsel,provided a written disclosure of information the information to the department of justice the doj.the information was sent in response to a april,letter by the doj summarizing the allegations in the original complaint and requesting further information.the information stated that w e believe the following paragraph describes a more important and damaging fraud identified in duxbury complaint,which we described see complaint but are not sure you have grasped based on your letter and the interview of duxbury.the following paragraph stated in part 
in,obp initiated an intentional scheme to promote an illegal,dosage of procrit for cancer patients that would increase sales and federal reimbursements by approximately a third.obp scheme worked,and starting in around medicare began reimbursing for procrit at a higher dosage than it had previously,without fda approval for this dosage and contrary to the medicare act rules for reimbursement of cancer drugs.the injury to the medicare program alone is in the hundreds of millions.
the information then went on to discuss this scheme in more detail 
on july,after an investigation,the doj declined to intervene in the original complaint.on december,the blair complaint was voluntarily dismissed and subsequently unsealed in full.
on october,over obp objection,the district court allowed duxbury motion to amend the original complaint,and the next day,on october,both relators filed a first amended complaint the amended complaint.the amended complaint added relator mcclellan as a party and alleged three counts,two of which are at issue on this appeal.
count i alleges that,beginning in december to the present,obp engaged in a scheme to provide kickbacks to health care providers to induce them to prescribe procrit.id.the kickbacks allegedly included free procrit,discounts and cash in the form of rebates,consulting fees,educational grants,payments to participate in studies or trials,and advisory board honoraria.id.the amended complaint alleges that the kickbacks,among other things,caused providers and hospitals to submit false claims for payment to medicare for procrit.id.
count iii alleges that,beginning in,obp unlawfully promoted t he administration of procrit at units per week to oncology patients,which was not approved by the fda.id.thus,the amended complaint alleges that obp inflated dosing scheme was a substantial factor causing the submission of false claims for payment for procrit,insofar as obp caused providers and hospitals to administer procrit to chemotherapy patients at units,and in the absence of obp scheme they would have administered procrit at iu.id.
c.the dismissal of the amended complaint 
on january,obp moved to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b and,in the alternative,for failure to plead fraud with particularity under federal rule of civil procedure b.on january,the district court allowed obp motion to dismiss with prejudice and entered judgment in obp favor.see united states ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,d.
as to count i,the district court first held that the kickback claims were based upon a public disclosure,in this case the allegations contained in the mcc filed in the awp mdl,which also alleged the use of illegal kickbacks.see id.at.the district court further held that duxbury qualifies as an original source for the kickback claims,but only for those claims that occurred during his period of employment,through,since his direct knowledge of obp activities only extends to the time he was employed by the company.id.at.having established its subject matter jurisdiction,the court nevertheless dismissed the through kickback claims because the amended complaint failed to plead the claims with sufficient particularity under rule b.id.at.
as to the kickback claims from to the present,the district court held that mcclellan did not qualify as an original source,as the amended complaint did not sufficiently allege that mcclellan offered information concerning the kickback claims to the government prior to the filing of the original complaint.id.at.relatedly,and in the alternative,the district court found that,even if mcclellan qualified as an original source,his claims were barred by the bar because he asserted his kickback claims after the filing of the original complaint.id.at.
as to count iii,the court dismissed the claims concerning promoting because they were barred by the rule.id.at.the district court first held that,even though paragraphs through of the original complaint mentioned unlawful promotion,the original complaint did not provide the essential facts regarding a widespread scheme to promote uses of procrit.id.at.thus,the district court considered the blair complaint the first complaint to allege claims based upon obp alleged marketing of procrit,and accordingly dismissed the promoting claims in count iii of the amended complaint.id.
as no claims survived,the district court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice as to the relators.relators now appeal.
ii.discussion 
the district court dismissed a portion of count i and all of count iii for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.thus,w e review the district court determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction de novo.muskat united states,cir.subject matter jurisdiction in this case is based on the allegations contained in the amended complaint.see rockwell,at.accordingly,we take as true all facts in the amended complaint,scrutinize them in the light most hospitable to the plaintiffs theory of liability,and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiffs favor.fothergill united states,cir see also id.at noting that t his standard applies to motions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction that are adjudicated on the pleadings,in advance of jurisdictional discovery and without the taking of any evidence.w e may affirm an order of dismissal on any ground made apparent by the record whether or not relied upon by the lower court.aguilar immig.customs,cir.
the district court dismissed the remaining portion of count i under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to plead fraud with sufficient particularity.we similarly review de novo the district court dismissal order for failure to comply with rule b.united states ex rel.gagne city of worcester,cir.
the relators contend that the district court erred in dismissing the kickback claims contained in count i,which the court dismissed,in part,based on the public disclosure bar,and,in part,based on rule b.
the threshold question in a false claims act case is whether the statute bars jurisdiction.rost,at.the district court dismissal of the kickback claims turns on the public disclosure bar,set forth at e.it provides 
a no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or general accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
b for purposes of this paragraph,original source means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.
e a b emphasis added.
as we discussed in rost,analysis of the public disclosure bar requires several inquiries 
whether there has been public disclosure of the allegations or transactions in the relator complaint 
if so,whether the public disclosure occurred in the manner specified in the statute 
if so,whether the relator suit is based upon those publicly disclosed allegations or transactions and 
if the answers to these questions are in the affirmative,whether the relator falls within the original source exception as defined in e b.
at.on appeal,the relators do not challenge the district court holding that the kickback claims contained in count i are based upon the public disclosure of allegations in a civil hearing,in this case the allegations of illegal kickbacks contained in the mcc filed in the awp mdl.thus,we turn our attention to the fourth question,whether the relators fall within the original source exception as defined in e b.
the provided language in the original source exception 
on appeal,obp and the united states,appearing as an amicus,propose an alternative ground to affirm the dismissal of count under the fca,an original source is defined as 
an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.
e b emphasis added.in determining whether the relators qualified as original sources,the district court held that t he plain language of the fca only requires the relator to provide his information to the government prior to filing his action,and that t his unambiguous statutory language must guide the court interpretation.duxbury,d at.
both obp and the united states argue that this was error,and contend that e b requires a relator to provide the information to the government before the public disclosure itself,not just before the filing of the relator suit.as there is no allegation in the amended complaint that either mcclellan or duxbury provided any information concerning their kickback claims to the government prior to the public disclosure of the kickback allegations in the awp mdl,both obp and the government contend that we can affirm the dismissal of the kickback claims on this alternative ground.as explained in more detail below,and after a careful analysis of the fca,we disagree,and conclude that the district court interpretation is the correct one.
we have not addressed the meaning of provided the information to the government before filing an action under e b,but the issue has divided the courts.the fourth circuit,consistent with the district court,has held that e b requires only that the relator voluntarily provide the information to the government before filing his qui tam action.united states ex rel.siller becton dickinson,cir emphasis in original.the second and ninth circuits have outlined a second approach,holding that the relator must have directly or indirectly been a source to the entity that publicly disclosed the allegations on which a suit is based.united states ex rel.dick long island lighting,cir see also united states ex rel.wang fmc,cir.the and sixth circuits have taken a third approach that stakes out a middle ground,holding that an original source must provide the government with the information prior to any public disclosure,but not requiring the relator to be the cause of the public disclosure.united states ex rel.findley employees club,see also united states ex rel.mckenzie bellsouth,cir.obp and the united states urge us to take this middle approach.
although we are about to travel a path,our first step remains the same.our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.robinson shell oil,d.the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.id.at.
by its terms,the original source exception only requires the relator to provide the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.e b.section e b does not impose any other timing requirement.nor does e a.thus,like the fourth circuit and the district court below,we conclude that the plain terms of e b begin and end the matter.see robinson,at.our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.quoting united states ron pair,d.
the government argues that the language of e b,when read in context,supports its view.following the circuit,the government points to the meaning of the terms original source itself,contending that a source is defined as t he originator or primary agent of an act,circumstance,or result.black law dictionary ed using the example she was the source of the information.thus,a source can not originat e information that has been publicly disclosed.the circuit similarly found significance in congress decision to use the term original source rather than simply incorporating subparagraph b description into subparagraph a.findley,at.
however,we decline to rely upon the plain meaning of the terms original source when the statute defines the term at e b.it is only w hen a word is not defined by statute that we construe it in accord with its ordinary or natural meaning.see smith united states,d.in addition,we decline to attribute significance to congress use of the terms original source rather than engraft the definition found at e b into e a.section e a sets forth two exceptions to the public disclosure bar,when the relator is an original source and when the action is brought by the attorney general.thus,setting forth the definition of one of these exceptions in a separate subparagraph,rather than shoehorning it into e a,avoids unnecessary confusion and does not imply anything further.finally,had congress intended to retain the plain meaning of original source and require relators to provide their information prior to the public disclosure,it easily could have done so.see rost,at rejecting argument that,for purposes of the meaning of public disclosure,equates the government with the public.
typically,we end our review when the plain language of a statute unambiguously reveals its meaning,and the revealed meaning is not eccentric.united states meade,cir noting that,in such circumstances,courts need not consult other aids to statutory construction.obp and the government,however,argue that such an eccentricity would result.
both obp and the government primarily argue that interpreting the provided language in e b by its plain terms would conflict with the intent of congress.see united states am.trucking ass n.in the interpretation of statutes,the function of the courts is to construe the language so as to give effect to the intent of congress.specifically,they argue that reading e b by its plain terms would permit relators to bring suit based upon fraud that was already publicly disclosed,so long as the relator had direct and independent knowledge of the fraud.for example,a relator who learns about fraud against the government in the huffington post would be permitted to bring a qui tam suit based upon that public disclosure if she has direct and independent knowledge of the fraud and provides that information to the government before filing suit,literally the day before filing.the same would be true if the public disclosure resulted from a government investigation,where a relator would be entitled to bring suit so long as he or she had direct and independent knowledge of the public disclosure.
the circuit concluded that,although the fca provides financial incentives to provide information about fraud to the government,o nce the information has been publicly disclosed,however,there is little need for the incentive provided by a qui tam action.findley,at.the sixth circuit discusses this point in more detail,holding that requiring a relator to disclose his or her information to the government prior to the public disclosure at issue advances the twin goals of alerting the government to potential fraud and creating incentives to do so as early as possible.mckenzie,at.as put by the sixth circuit,
t his approach furthers congress goal in amending the fca t o prevent parasitic qui tam actions in which relators,rather than bringing to light independently discovered information of fraud,simply feed off of previous disclosures of public fraud.siller,at.anyone who alerts the government and is a true whistleblower deserves any reward that may be obtained by pursuing a qui tam action under the fca.however,the individual who sits on the sidelines while others disclose the allegations that form the basis of her complaint should not be able to participate in any award.this would be contrary to the purpose of the statute.
id.at see also wang,at qui tam suits are meant to encourage insiders privy to a fraud on the government to blow the whistle on the crime.in such a scheme,there is little point in rewarding a second toot.thus,both obp and the government argue that requiring the relator to provide his or her information before the public disclosure corrects this problem and ensures that only productive suits are filed,that is,those suits in which a true whistleblower alerts the government of fraud not publicly disclosed.
after careful consideration of the arguments in favor of adopting the middle approach,we conclude that honoring the plain and unambiguous meaning of e b would not conflict with the intent of congress.our decision is supported by our own review of the language,structure,and history of e b and the public disclosure bar.see rost,at reviewing the language,structure and history of the terms public disclosure in rejecting interpretation that conflicted with the plain meaning of the statute.as we have just discussed the language of e b,we turn to the structure and history of the statute.
the structure of the fca mitigates many of the concerns that lead the and sixth circuits to adopt the middle approach and,in fact,demonstrates that the middle approach has the potential to prohibit productive suits.as an initial matter,the rule already provides potential relators significant incentive not to sit on the sidelines.as we discuss in more detail below,a goal behind the rule is to provide incentives to relators to promptly alert the government to the essential facts of a fraudulent scheme.united states ex rel.lujan hughes aircraft,cir.it is unclear why a relator would wait for a public disclosure and risk another relator bringing suit.
moreover,the supreme court recent decision in rockwell,which interpreted the direct and independent knowledge requirement of the public disclosure bar,substantially undercuts the conclusion by the and sixth circuits that little incentive is necessary for suits brought after a public disclosure.in addressing the meaning of the direct and independent knowledge requirement of the original source exception in e b,the rockwell court also addressed the meaning of the term information found in both e a and e b.it held that information for purposes of both subparagraphs refers to the information underlying the allegations of the relator action,not the information underlying the public disclosure.rockwell,at.the court noted 
section e a bars actions based on publicly disclosed allegations whether or not the information on which those allegations are based has been made public.it is difficult to understand why congress would care whether a relator knows about the information underlying a publicly disclosed allegation,what a confidential source told a newspaper reporter about insolid pondcrete when the relator has direct and independent knowledge of different information supporting the same allegation,that a defective process would inevitably lead to insolid pondcrete.not only would that make little sense,it would raise nettlesome procedural problems,placing courts in the position of comparing the relator information with the often unknowable information on which the public disclosure was based.where that latter information has not been disclosed by reason,for example,of a reporter desire to protect his source,the relator would presumably be out of court.to bar a relator with direct and independent knowledge of information underlying his allegations just because no one can know what information underlies the similar allegations of some other person simply makes no sense.
id.at.emphasis added.
rockwell clarifies that the information that the original source has direct and independent knowledge of does not have to be the same as the information upon which the public disclosure is based.thus,a public disclosure concerning governmental fraud resulting from a huffington post article may be based on information that is different to use the example in rockwell,what a confidential source told a reporter about insolid pondcrete than the information a relator may have in support of the same fraud that a defective process would inevitably lead to insolid pondcrete.see id.the same would be true of an ongoing governmental investigation,where the information upon which the government public disclosures are based may be different from the information that the relator has in his possession.
but as a result of that clarification,rockwell strongly suggests that situations can arise where the information upon which the public disclosure is based may be unavailable such as a reporter protecting a source or be of little value if based on rumors,while a relator may have different information of the publicly disclosed fraud such as eyewitness testimony,documents,of great significance.this has substantial plausibility when the public disclosure is based on the news media,where sources may fear to come forward to serve as witnesses but others with direct and independent knowledge may be so willing.although in such a situation,the relator,in a technical sense,is not a true whistleblower,we disagree that such a relator does not deserve any reward that may be obtained by pursuing a qui tam action under the fca.see mckenzie,at.thus,the approach taken by and sixth circuits has the potential to bar productive suits.
ii.history 
the history of the public disclosure bar and the provided language under e b also does not require us to deviate from the plain meaning.the legislative history of the public disclosure bar has been well rehearsed by this and other circuits.see,prawer,at see also findley,at.we only discuss legislative history relevant to our inquiry here.
the provided language in e b was specifically enacted to correct the holding of united states ex rel.wisconsin dean.findley,at see also siller,at fmc,at seeking only to correct opinions like dean,congress permitted one who publicly disclosed the information to bring a qui tam suit.dean was a seventh circuit decision decided prior to the amendments that resulted in the current public disclosure bar.the case concerned a previous jurisdictional bar,adopted in,that barred relator suits based upon evidence or information in the possession of the united states at the time such suit was brought.findley,at omission in original quoting act of december,stat,recodified in b superseded.the jurisdictional bar provided no exception for when the relator was the source of that information,although such an exception was proposed.id.in dean,the seventh circuit was faced with the question of whether the state of wisconsin should be allowed to act as a qui tam relator in a medicaid fraud action where the state,in accordance with the federal regulations,had already reported the fraud to the federal court.prawer,at citing united states ex rel.wisconsin dean,cir.the dean court answered in the negative,stating that i f the state of wisconsin desires a special exemption to the false claims act because of its requirement to report medicaid fraud to the federal government,then it should ask congress to provide that exemption.at.
congress obliged,and in congress amended the fca to encourage more private enforcement suits.findley,at quoting,at,reprinted in,see also rost,at same.as emphasized by the sixth circuit,one goal of the amendments was to prevent parasitic qui tam actions in which relators,rather than bringing to light independently discovered information of fraud,simply feed off of previous disclosures of fraud.mckenzie,at quoting siller,at.
but two additional changes are relevant here.the first was to abolish the government knowledge regime entailed by the jurisdictional bar,which congress concluded proved too restrictive of qui tam actions,resulting in the of the fca.rost,at.congress replaced the government knowledge regime with one,as shown by the public disclosure bar,focused on the public disclosure of information given to the government.id.as put by the circuit,congress thus changed the focus of the jurisdictional bar from evidence of fraud inside the government overcrowded file cabinets to fraud already exposed in the public domain.findley,at.to replace the government knowledge bar,congress broadened the universe of potential qui tam plaintiffs,with only four exclusions enumerated in e.rost,at quoting united states ex rel.leblanc raytheon,cir.
the second was to reinstate the original source exception proposed,but not adopted,in,so as to avoid the situation in dean where a potential relator who provided information to the government was not barred from bringing a qui tam suit.it is this second change that the provided language sought to remedy,by allowing individuals to maintain suit and provide their information to the government.as put by the fourth circuit 
to correct dean only required that congress adopt language that would ensure that a plaintiff who had provided his information to the government would not be barred from bringing a qui tam action on the ground that the government already possessed the information.this it did in section e b,by providing that a plaintiff who produces his information to the government is excepted from section e a jurisdictional bar.
the second additional change provides a direct justification of the provided language in e b,but it is the first that has been glossed over.both the circuit and the sixth circuit have focused on the concern with parasitic suits,concluding that any such suit brought after a public disclosure was necessarily parasitic.as noted above,we question that conclusion.but we also note that the amendments equally sought to end a regime that resulted in the of the fca,one that rested too much on government notice to prevent fraud.as we have noted,congress amended the statute to encourage more private enforcement suits.rost,at quoting,at.although we have recognized that a public disclosure regime has the benefit,one lacking in a government notice regime,of providing public pressure on the government to act,see rost,at,there also may arise situations when even that is not enough,and the government would benefit from suits brought by relators with substantial information of government fraud even though the outlines of the fraud are in the public domain.
the circuit was quite explicit that its approach may on occasion prevent qui tam lawsuits that may not be truly parasitic.findley,at.however,we have rejected readings of the public disclosure bar that would create a new exclusion not articulated in the text which would discourage productive private enforcement.see rost,at.in rost,we rejected an interpretation of public disclosure under e a to include made by a private party only to government agencies without further disclosure,as it would reinstate exactly what congress government knowledge bar.id.although the reading urged here would not return us to the government notice regime,it is overbroad so as to prohibit cases that are productive private enforcement suits.thus,just as we eschewed reading an exclusion in rost that did not have textual support and resulted in discouraging productive private enforcement,we similarly decline to do so here.
we conclude by emphasizing that we are cognizant of our institutional role and the limits of our competence in interpreting the fca.as noted by the fourth circuit,in criticizing the approaches taken by the second and ninth circuit 
it strikes us as especially inappropriate not to mention frighteningly treacherous to attempt,as these courts have done,to distill from such broad,generalized objectives,the answers to the kind of specific statutory questions that we herein address fine calibrations are just not possible through the use of such crude instruments.this is particularly so in this context,given that,although we can perhaps divine from these abstract purposes a congressional intention to balance the need to encourage qui tam actions against the need to prevent parasitic suits,we can discern virtually nothing as to precisely how congress ultimately believed it achieved that balance.if the language of law is to have any meaning at all,then surely it must prevail over the kind of speculation that is entailed in such an enterprise as these courts have undertaken.
siller,at.we agree.the fca has many moving parts,so that any attempt by us to move one may upset others.given the difficulty in determining the right balance,we conclude that the better approach is to rely upon the plain and unambiguous language of e b in the absence of any clear direction to do otherwise.
thus,we reject obp and the government contention that e b requires an original source to provide his or her information before the public disclosure at issue.instead,we will honor the plain and unambiguous terms of the statute,and hold that e b only requires that a relator provide his or her information prior to the filing of the qui tam suit.
the relators contend that the district court erred in holding that mcclellan failed to qualify as an original source.we disagree.as an initial matter,the amended complaint alleges that relator mcclellan does not bring any new legal claims against obp,but rather adds additional supporting facts to the legal claims previously made in the original complaint.thus,the district court correctly concluded that mcclellan was required,in order to qualify as an original source,to provide his information prior to the filing of the original complaint,rather than the amended complaint.see duxbury,d at.
although the amended complaint alleges that b oth relators have direct and independent knowledge of information on which the allegations are based,and have provided such information to the united states before filing suit,as required by e,the district court noted that duxbury proffered no support for this conclusory allegation and the district court refused to reasonably infer it,as duxbury did not move to add mcclellan as a relator until october.id.at.we agree.
mcclellan counters that we are required to take as true all facts in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in his favor.see fothergill,at.however,we are under no obligation to credit mcclellan conclusory allegations,which simply parrot the elements of the statute.see rodríguez sk f,cir per curiam affirming dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where the plaintiff has failed to allege grounds upon which to support either his conclusory allegation of diversity jurisdiction or federal question jurisdiction.ashcroft iqbal,d in reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.
we also refuse to reasonably infer mcclellan allegation concerning disclosure.on appeal,mcclellan points to a single allegation in the original complaint that he had over patient trial cards in his possession in one time.compl.this allegation does not support an allegation that he provided his information about the kickback claims prior to the filing of the original complaint.mcclellan also points to the information,which was provided to the government after the filing of the original complaint.the information provides significant detail concerning the relators promotion claims,not its kickback claims,and thus the information also provides no support for his allegation that he provided his information prior the filing of the original complaint.
for the above reasons,we hold that the district court did not err in holding that mcclellan did not qualify as an original source under d,and thus affirm the dismissal of those kickback claims attributable to mcclellan.accordingly,we do not need to address the district court alternative ground for dismissing the claim,that those kickback claims attributable to duxbury are barred by the rule.
we finally address the dismissal of duxbury claims under rule b.duxbury seeks reversal.we agree.
in applying rule b,the district court held that the rule requires relators to provide details that identify particular false claims for payment that were submitted to the government.duxbury,d at quoting rost,at emphasis added.this was error.in rost,we noted a distinction between a qui tam action alleging that the defendant made false claims to the government,and a qui tam action in which the defendant induced third parties to file false claims with the government.at noting that latter action is in a different category than former in the latter context,we held that a relator could satisfy rule b by providing factual or statistical evidence to strengthen the inference of fraud beyond possibility without necessarily providing details as to each false claim.rost,at see also united states ex rel.grubbs kanneganti,cir holding that fca claims under rule b may nevertheless survive by alleging particular details of a scheme to submit false claims paired with reliable indicia that lead to a strong inference that claims were actually submitted.
similar to this case,rost concerned allegations that false claims were allegedly submitted by doctors who were allegedly induced and seduced by defendants into prescribing genetropin for uses to their patients,including federally insured patients.id.at.we acknowledged that rost complaint amply describes illegal practices in which pfizer allegedly engaged.id.however,a s presently pled,the complaint d id not sufficiently establish that false claims were submitted for government payment in a way that satisfies the particularity requirement.id.at.we noted 
it may well be that doctors who prescribed genotropin for uses as a result of pharmacia illegal marketing of the drug withstood the temptation and did not seek federal reimbursement,and neither did their patients.it may be that physicians prescribed genotropin for uses only where the patients paid for it themselves or when the patients private insurers paid for it.rost did not plead enough to satisfy the concerns behind rule b.
here,as in rost,duxbury does not allege that obp itself submitted false claims to the government,but that,through obp illegal kickbacks,false claims to the medicare program were filed by medical providers for reimbursement of procrit purchases.however,unlike in rost,duxbury does more than suggest fraud was possible.id.at.duxbury sets forth allegations of kickbacks provided by obp that resulted in the submission of false claims by eight healthcare providers in the western united states joseph hospital in tacoma,washington.rainier oncology of puyallap,washington.memorial clinic in olympia,washington.western washington cancer treatment center.mid columbia kidney center in kennewick,washington.peter hospital in olympia,washington.memorial clinic oncology group in washington.swedish hospital in seattle,washington.as to each,duxbury provides information as to the dates and amounts of the false claims filed by these providers with the medicare program.one such allegation is instructive 
in western washington treatment center in olympia,washington received more than of free commercially packaged procrit from obp under the direction of robert ashe so that western washington could submit the free product for reimbursement to medicare under the false and fraudulent certification that the provider had paid for the product.obp intended the free commercially packaged procrit to be a cash equivalent kickback to western washington in order to induce the provider to purchase procrit and to administer procrit at the once a week dosing regimen.western washington was reimbursed by medicare for the free commercially packaged procrit.as a result,obp knowingly caused the presentation by western washington of these false claims to the united states government.
duxbury provides more specifics with respect to other medical providers.as to joseph hospital,duxbury alleges that the hospital submitted approximately claims a month for medicare reimbursement based upon obp unlawful kickbacks.
although a close call,duxbury claims satisfy rule b under this more flexible standard.see gagne,at.although duxbury does not identify specific claims,he has alleged the submission of false claims across a large of providers that alleges the the who,what,where,and when of the allegedly false or fraudulent representation.see rodi so.new england sch.of law,cir quotation omitted see also rost,at noting that rule b requires a plaintiff to allege the time,place,and content of an alleged false representation.quoting doyle hasbro,cir.in particular,duxbury has identified,as to each of the eight medical providers the who,the illegal kickbacks the what,the rough time periods and locations the where and when,and the filing of the false claims themselves.
moreover,as to his a claims,duxbury has also alleged facts with respect to the medical providers he identifies that support his claim that obp intended to cause the submission of false claims.see allison engine.at holding that an action under subsection a requires a relater to allege that the defendant intended that the false record or statement be material to the government decision to pay or approve the false claim see also gagne,at affirming dismissal of an a claim under rule b where r elators fail to connect the only falsity or fraud for which they provide any detail.
with respect to western washington,duxbury alleges that washington received more than of free commercially packaged procrit from obp so that western washington could submit the free product for reimbursement to medicare under the false and fraudulent certification that the provider had paid for the product,and that western washington was reimbursed by medicare for the free commercially packaged procrit.emphasis added.the same is true of the other medical providers.see,id.obp intentionally failed to report these payments to the government in order to keep secret the profit spread between the rate upon which medicare reimbursed medical providers like joseph for procrit.id.ranier oncology was provided more than of free commercially packaged procrit from obp under the guise of running an unlawful so that rainier oncology could submit the free product for reimbursement to medicare under the false and fraudulent certification that the provider had paid for the product.id.memorial clinic was provided approximately of free commercially packaged procrit from obp so that memorial clinic could submit the free product for reimbursement to medicare under the false and fraudulent certification that the provider had paid for the product.id.mid columbia kidney center submitted claims to medicare and was subsequently reimbursed by medicare approximately for the administering of procrit to mid columbia kidney center patients obp provided mid columbia kidney center with an rebate of for the purchase of procrit.obp intentionally failed to report those rebates in order to keep secret the profit spread between the actual acquisition cost to the provider and the medicare reimbursement rate so that the providers could benefit from the spread.id.peter hospital submitted claims to medicare for approximately two million dollars of procrit.peter contract with obp provided peter with an rebate of for the purchase of procrit.obp intentionally failed to report to the government these rebates in order to keep secret the profit spread between the actual acquisition cost to the provider and the medicare reimbursement rate so that the providers could benefit from the spread.id.memorial clinic oncology group purchased of procrit.memorial clinic oncology group agreement with obp provided memorial clinic oncology group with an rebate of for the purchase of procrit.obp intentionally failed to report to the government the rebates in order to keep the between the actual acquisition cost to the provider and the medicare reimbursement rate so that the providers could benefit from the spread.id.swedish hospital was given cash in the form of a unrestricted educational grant in the amount of approximately which was a kickback.provider subsequently purchased over of procrit of which approximately was submitted for medicare reimbursement.
unlike in rost,where the allegations gave rise to only speculation as to whether the alleged scheme caused the filing of false claims with the government,duxbury has alleged facts that false claims were in fact filed by the medical providers he identified,which further supports a strong inference that such claims were also filed nationwide.we thus have allegations of factual evidence to strengthen the inference of fraud beyond
