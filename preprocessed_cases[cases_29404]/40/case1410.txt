this appeal arises from the district court imposition of personal liability on charles erwin for payroll withholding taxes owed by gc affordable dining,gcad.erwin owned a interest in gcad and served as a gcad corporate officer and director,and,on behalf of gcad,selected business sites,hired and fired employees,and negotiated and personally guaranteed loans and other contracts for the company.the district court held as a matter of law that erwin was responsible for payment of these taxes and willfully failed to pay them.erwin challenges both holdings on appeal.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
over the last years,erwin,a north carolina entrepreneur,has owned or operated at least restaurants.in june,erwin joined with three other north carolina grenert,stephen coggin,and john form gcad,a franchisee of golden corral franchising system,golden corral.gcad eventually opened and operated five golden corral restaurants.
at gcad founding,erwin and grenert each owned one third of the corporate stock coggin and miracle each owned one sixth of the stock.shortly thereafter,grenert left the enterprise eventually,miracle sold his interest in gcad to mark cole.but at all times,erwin retained at least a interest in the company.
in addition to owning all of the corporate stock in gcad,erwin and his partners served as its directors and officers.coggin served as president,miracle and later cole as vice president,and erwin as vice president,secretary,and treasurer the partners hired two managers to oversee operations,payroll,and accounting.
in early,erwin and his with their guaranteed construction and operating lines of credit with first union bank for gcad.erwin and his partners also secured a construction line of credit for a corporation,tiffany,llc,which they established as a real estate holding company for gcad.tiffany leased or purchased land and equipment for the restaurants gcad,in turn,leased the land and equipment from tiffany.
erwin participated in selecting sites for the restaurants and signed documents for all restaurant locations on behalf of both tiffany and gcad.erwin also personally guaranteed rent payments on at least four of the leases,and personally guaranteed lines of credit from food vendors for the benefit of the gcad restaurants.
despite early profits,the gcad restaurants soon began to lose money.in january,erwin and his partners decided to fire one of the original managers and consolidate operations under the other.erwin expressly acknowledged his involve ment in both decisions.during,erwin conferred at least weekly with coggin regarding gcad affairs.moreover,erwin and his partners met monthly during,and at least quarterly in,to discuss gcad matters.in an effort to improve business,erwin also visited the gcad restaurants and met with store managers during and.
unfortunately,business did not improve.gcad had a negative operating cash flow of million by the end of,and thus had difficulty paying its creditors.in early,erwin and coggin negotiated a payment plan to settle gcad debts owed to one food vendor,lopresti,with whom erwin had personally guaranteed gcad line of credit.
during this period,erwin and his partners decided to replace the remaining original manager with william pintner,a seasoned golden corral employee.on a weekly basis,pintner and erwin discussed sales figures and strategies to increase profits early in pintner tenure,he recommended that the partners fire their accountant and hire barry and buddy light the light brothers to handle accounting and payroll for gcad the partners followed this advice.
despite these efforts,gcad continued to lose money.in december,erwin and his partners learned that the light brothers had failed to pay the entire quarterly payroll tax withholdings for the third quarter of.the partners made a capital call for approximately and wired the money to the light brothers with instructions.erwin,who contributed of the,testified that he personally instructed the light brothers that absolutely under no circumstances whatsoever were the light brothers ever to be late with any taxes.despite erwin admonition,the light brothers failed to pay in full the payroll taxes for the fourth quarter of.
coggin testified that in late,he and erwin also sent the light brothers for additional payment to the favored food vendor,lopresti,and instructed the light brothers not to pay the rent because erwin and coggin themselves would handle the rent payments directly.erwin never testified to the contrary.
also in late,erwin became involved in became final in may release gcad from obligations under one of its leases.the landlord,seeking to terminate the lease to accommodate another party,agreed to wire million to cnl american properties fund,cnl,a company financing gcad restaurant building and equipment,to cover rents gcad owed cnl on that and other leases.at that time erwin as personal cnl substantial rental payments.
gcad financial condition continued to worsen throughout,and gcad did not pay in full its withholding taxes for the first three quarters of that year.in august,erwin and his two partners learned of this latest delinquency.in december,the partners made another capital contribution of to help cure these deficiencies,but gcad never paid the taxes in full.nevertheless,erwin and his partners continued to employ the light brothers.
in february,erwin and his partners finally fired the light brothers.after doing so,erwin decided to take control of gcad accounting functions,including payroll.he moved gcad financial operations from ohio to the north carolina offices of his solely owned company,chelda.after that time,gcad remained current on its payroll withholding payments.in late,erwin became the percent owner of gcad shortly thereafter he dissolved the corporation.between august and the close of business in,the gcad restaurants generated approximately million in sales revenue.rather than paying the outstanding and tax deficiencies,however,gcad continued to pay rent and supplier expenses.erwin acknowledged that,pursuant to his direction,gcad paid its landlord and suppliers rather than the irs he maintained that gcad did so because this was the only way to remain in business.
following the demise of gcad,the irs assessed tax deficiencies against erwin in the amount of the unpaid payroll withholding taxes owed by gcad.erwin paid a portion of the assessed amounts and then brought this action against the united states to recover those amounts.the government counterclaimed for,the amount of gcad unpaid deficiencies from the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of,plus interest.the united states subsequently filed complaints against coggin,pintner,and the light brothers.
the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court,adopting the recommendation of the magistrate judge,denied erwin motion and granted the government.the court also granted the government motions to issue a final judgment against erwin and stay the proceedings against coggin,pintner,and the light brothers pending the outcome of erwin anticipated appeal.
erwin timely noted this appeal.
the internal revenue code requires employers to withhold social security and federal excise taxes from their employees wages.see a,a plett united states,cir.the employer holds these monies in trust for the united states.a.accordingly,courts often refer to the withheld amounts as trust fund taxes these monies exist for the exclusive use of the government,not the employer.see plett,at.payment of these trust fund taxes is no t excuse d merely because as a matter of sound business judgment,the money was paid to suppliers in order to keep the corporation operating as a going government can not be made an unwilling partner in a floundering business.collins united states,cir.
the code assure s compliance by the employer with its obligation to pay trust fund taxes by imposing personal liability on officers or agents of the employer responsible for the employer decisions regarding withholding and payment of the taxes.slodov united states,interpreting.to that end,a of the code provides that a ny person required to collect,truthfully account for,and pay over any tax who willfully fails to do so shall be personally liable for a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded,or not paid over.a.although labeled as a penalty,does not actually punish rather,it brings to the government only the same amount to which it was entitled by way of the tax.turnbull united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
personal liability for a corporation trust fund taxes extends to any person who is responsible for collection and payment of those taxes,and willfully fail s to see that the taxes are paid.plett,at united states,cir.once the government assesses a taxpayer for this liability,the taxpayer has the burden of proof at trial on both elements of liability.see,f d at.
but we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment to the government,resolving all disputed facts in favor of the taxpayer.see,at.of course,to defeat summary judgment,the taxpayer like any other litigant must identify an error of law or a genuine issue of material fact the taxpayer can not create a material fact by reliance on conclusory allegations or bare denials.see.c,e anderson liberty lobby,see also bouchat balt.ravens football club,cir.moreover,a material fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson,at.
i n the absence of disputed material facts,summary judgment represents a favored mechanism to secure the just,speedy,and inexpensive determination of taxpayer liability under.plett,at quoting.see also barnett irs,cir stating that,although the facts in a analysis are critical,extensive caselaw narrowly constrains a factfinder province in cases,and noting that for this reason countless courts have found responsibility for purposes of as a matter of law 
with these principles in mind,we turn to erwin contention that the district court erred in holding,as a matter of law,that erwin was a person responsible for the payment of gcad withholding taxes,and willfully failed to pay those taxes.we consider each argument in turn.
although the code defines a responsible person as one required to collect,truthfully account for,and pay over any tax,u.a emphasis added,the supreme court has interpreted this language to apply to all persons responsible for collection of taxes and not only to those persons in a position to perform all three of the enumerated duties.slodov,at.thus,the code deems anyone required to collect or account for or remit taxes a responsible person for purposes of.see plett,f d at.
more than one person may be held responsible for a corporation payroll taxes.indeed,t he term responsible person is broad and may include many individuals connected with a corporation,at see also barnett,at t here usually are multiple responsible persons in any company.assessing whether a person has the statutorily imposed duty to make the tax payments constitutes the key element in determining responsible person status,at.this duty is considered in light of the person authority over an enterprise finances or general decision making,and is generally found in high corporate officials charged with general control over corporate business affairs who participate in decisions concerning payment of creditors and disbursement of funds.id.citation omitted.
titular authority alone does not establish responsible person status.rather,the proper inquiry focuses on substance rather than form.id.the substance of the circumstances must be such that the officer exercises and uses his authority over financial affairs or general management,or is under a duty to do so,before that officer can be deemed to be a responsible person.id.put another way,the essential inquiry is whether a person has significant,but not necessarily exclusive,authority over corporate finances or management decisions.see plett,at see also kinnie united states,cir.
we have developed a list of factors to consider in determining whether the substance of the circumstances establishes responsible person status under.thus,we examine whether the employee served as an officer or director of the company controlled the company payroll determined which creditors to pay and when to pay them participated in the corporation management had the ability to hire and fire employees and possessed the power to write checks.plett,at see also,at.no single factor controls rather,we consider the totality of the circumstances.see vinick united states,cir see also barnett,at,at.
in this case,the undisputed facts demonstrate that erwin was a responsible person for purposes with respect to gcad payroll taxes.while not every plett factor so indicates,most do.moreover,the totality of the circumstances conclusively establishes that erwin had the effective power to pay the taxes owed by gcad.barnett,at.
as to the first factor,it is undisputed that erwin founded and served as an officer of gcad.in fact,erwin continually served as secretary,treasurer,and director of the corporation throughout its existence and,at all times,owned at least a interest in gcad.although erwin asserts that he acted as a mere passive investor who contributed capital and only held the title s to protect his interest in the venture,the evidence establishes that in fact his involvement in gcad was substantial.erwin was the only gcad owner with any experience in the restaurant business,and he himself acknowledged in deposition his active involvement in corporate decisions.
with respect to the second factor,although erwin and his two partners did not directly manage gcad payroll,they exercised substantial supervisory authority over the management and the light did control payroll.moreover,erwin conceded that he participated in setting financial policy for gcad and,on occasion,directed payment of gcad withholding taxes.see kinnie,at stating that a taxpayer need not always exercise his powers to remain responsible for seeing that withholding taxes are paid,and may not escape liability by delegating the task of paying over the taxes to someone else.
furthermore,within months of learning of gcad tax deficiencies,erwin took complete control of gcad financial operations,which establishes his authority to do so.erwin himself had no doubt as to his authority over the company payroll,testifying that,had he learned of the light brothers failures to remit payroll withholding taxes during the first quarter of,a lot of things would have happened differently.erwin testified that he would have taken remedial action at that time,noting that as soon as he did find out about the deficiencies,he did bring all the accounting back to his office.although erwin did not seize control of gcad during the tax periods at issue here,his subsequent exercise of authority over all of gcad financial operations certainly cast s light on the question of whether he was a responsible person during those periods.vinick,at.
with respect to the third factor,the undisputed facts demonstrate that erwin,along with coggin,indeed determined,on more than one occasion,which gcad creditors to pay and when to pay them.in january,erwin and coggin negotiated a payment plan with a food vendor,lopresti,to pay debt owed by gcad on a line of credit,which erwin had personally guaranteed.later in that same year,erwin and coggin infused into gcad,directing more payments to lopresti and according to coggin and undisputed by erwin himself took over the rent payments to cnl,a gcad landlord whose rent payments erwin had also personally guaranteed.moreover,from december through may,erwin,along with coggin,negotiated a of one of gcad leases,which resulted in an additional payment of million to cnl to cover rent owed on that and other leases.
thus,during the tax periods at issue,erwin actively negotiated substantial payments to gcad creditors on lines of credit and loans,some of which he had personally guaranteed.erwin personal guarantees of these lines of credit and other debts do not alone establish his status as a responsible person.but the undisputed evidence that erwin negotiated payments to these preferred creditors offers additional strong support for the conclusion that he use d his authority over financial affairs of gcad,at.in this way,he again acted as a responsible person for purposes of during the tax periods in question.
gcad dealings with the irs further demonstrate erwin control over the company financial priorities.in december and again in december,erwin and his partners infused capital into gcad and explicitly directed the light brothers to use that money to pay back taxes.erwin testified that he personally instructed the light brothers to stay current with gcad payroll withholdings erwin also testified that in,when gcad had significant revenues,he made the business decision to keep the restaurants doors open by paying the landlord and suppliers instead of paying the back taxes that gcad owed from previous years.
as to the fourth factor,erwin did not play the most active role in the management of the corporation during the relevant tax periods rather he delegated much authority to others.but,of course,delegation will not relieve one of responsibility.purcell united states,cir see also kinnie,at.moreover,the undisputed facts establish that erwin did involve himself in the company general decision making and never was,as he claims,a mere passive investor,at finding question of fact as to responsible person status when passive investor did not exercise authority in managing the company,did not dictate the financial decisions of the company,and had no authority to do so.
erwin helped to choose sites for the corporation restaurants,negotiated and signed leases and other contracts on behalf of the corporation,personally guaranteed lines of credit and rent payments for the corporation,met with its restaurant managers,and involved himself in negotiating payment plans and with corporate creditors.thus,albeit to a lesser extent than others,erwin participated in the management of the corporation 
consideration of the fifth and firing demonstrates that erwin was a responsible person for purposes.erwin himself acknowledged that he was involved in the hiring and firing of both sets of accountants and of all management.indeed,in early erwin took full control of the company operations and ultimately made the decision to close gcad.of course the latter conduct did not occur during the tax periods in issue,but it is nonetheless relevant in establishing that erwin was a consistently active presence in important personnel decisions at gcad during its entire existence.
with respect to the sixth factor,we agree with erwin that the record does not demonstrate that he had authority for gcad during the relevant tax periods.although this factor weighs in favor of erwin,we must consider it in the totality of the circumstances.see vinick,at see also barnett,at,at.those circumstances include inter alia erwin exercise of authority over gcad finances by directing certain payments to privileged creditors during the tax periods in question,and taking over gcad financial operations and exercise of ultimate authority immediately after the tax periods in question.taken together,the undisputed facts of the case clearly evidence that during the relevant tax periods erwin had the power to exercise authority had he chosen to do so.compare plett,at finding financial control indisputably in the hands of the taxpayer,with vinick,at explaining that determining responsibility goes to the central question of power and emphasizing that a t no time did the taxpayer exercise any authority over which creditors the corporation paid.
although in some cases questions as to responsible person status under can not be resolved at summary judgment,see,at in this case they surely can.given the undisputed facts here,we can only conclude that the government demonstrated erwin responsible person status as a matter of law.
we note that other courts have reached precisely the same conclusion in considering similar facts.see,jefferson united states,cir holding board president responsible person as a matter of law because he secured loans and directed past payment of taxes for the corporation,reviewed financial reports,and had authority thosteson united states,cir holding corporate officer and stockholder a responsible person as a matter of law even though he had limited check writing authority,up to only,without a countersignature taylor irs,cir holding corporate director and officer a responsible person as a matter of law because he possessed sufficient control over corporate finances,had authority to borrow funds and write checks and thereby had the effective power to pay the taxes quoting barnett,at greenberg united states,cir holding controller a responsible person as a matter of law even though he took instructions from the controlling stockholder and feared for his job were he to independently issue a check for the tax delinquency kinnie,at holding corporate vice president and shareholder a responsible person as a matter of law because he had authority,hired an accountant to review the books,and eventually took control of the business mazo united states,cir holding corporate stockholders,officers,and directors responsible persons as a matter of law even though others handled all operations and prepared all corporate checks.
erwin contention that others in the company may have been just as,or even more,responsible for gcad failure to remit payroll taxes during the tax periods in issue does not free him from liability.for imposes liability on all responsible persons,not just the most responsible person.turnbull,at.erwin own admissions conclusively demonstrate that he was a responsible person for purposes during the relevant tax periods.
to summarize,erwin admitted that at all times he owned at least one third of the stock of this corporation and served as its secretary,treasurer,vice president,and director.erwin admitted that he signed loan documents and leases on behalf of the corporation,thus evidencing that he shared responsibility for establishing the corporation financial policy.erwin admitted that he approved restaurant site selection and regularly reviewed sales data.erwin admitted holding quarterly meetings with his partners and weekly telephone calls with the general manager to discuss the restaurants.erwin admitted that he directed or negotiated payments to certain favored creditors to reduce gcad debt,which he had personally guaranteed.erwin admitted that he hired and fired employees,including gcad accountants.finally,although erwin delegated many of the financial responsibilities of the corporation to others,he admitted that he infused capital into gcad and admonished the light brothers,over whom he had significant control,to stay current with the company tax obligations 
in short,the undisputed erwin own,as a matter of law,that erwin was a responsible person under during the relevant tax periods.
having found erwin a responsible person,we turn to whether he willfully failed to collect,account for,or remit payroll taxes to the united states.plett,at.this inquiry focuses on whether erwin had knowledge of nonpayment or reckless disregard of whether the payments were being made.id.quoting turpin united states,cir.a responsible person intentional preference for creditors other than the united states establishes willfulness as a matter of law such an intentional preference occurs when the responsible person knows of or recklessly disregards an unpaid deficiency.turpin,at.
by the end of,erwin knew that gcad had financial difficulties.indeed,in december erwin made a special capital contribution to pay a tax delinquency from a prior quarter.at that time,erwin also admonished the light brothers to make timely payments in the future,but he did not monitor the situation personally to ensure future payment,nor did he advise the light brothers to implement additional internal controls.
although erwin lack of oversight in all likelihood contributed to the light brothers failure to remit payroll taxes for the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of,the record,viewed in the light most favorable to erwin,does not support a a matter of prior to august erwin had actual knowledge that the light brothers continually failed to pay gcad payroll taxes.thus,whether erwin acted willfully during this time,as a matter of law,depends on whether he acted with reckless disregard of gcad tax obligations.see turpin,at.
erwin claims that he thought that the light brothers would obey his instruction to stay current with gcad tax obligations,that coggin was monitoring the light brothers,and that the light brothers were professionals with experience accounting for golden corral restaurants in the past.arguably,a fact finder fully crediting this testimony might conclude that erwin actions,although negligent,did not rise to the level of recklessness.see id.at mere negligence in failing to ascertain facts regarding a tax delinquency is insufficient to constitute willfulness under a.internal quotation marks omitted.
even assuming,however,that erwin did not act willfully prior to learning of the full extent of the tax deficiencies in august,his conduct after that point unquestionably evidences willfulness as a matter of law.during the third quarter of,gcad paid just a fraction of its payroll tax liability.although erwin and coggin each made capital contributions to cover the deficiency in december,gcad still owed over for that quarter alone and had not satisfied deficiencies from and the first two quarters of.the record does not conclusively reveal the extent of erwin actual knowledge at this point in time,but certainly demonstrates that by that time he was on notice that gcad owed substantial payroll taxes to the irs.yet erwin and his partners continued to rely on the light brothers to address the problem for several more months.erwin failure to assess and remedy the payroll tax deficiencies immediately upon learning of their existence in august constitutes unreasonable willful conduct.id.at noting the relevance of responsible person immediate action to address deficiencies upon learning of them.this is particularly so given that,at erwin direction,gcad paid other creditors during this period.thus,erwin is liable for any outstanding deficiencies.see plett,at.
moreover,following the lead of every other circuit to consider the question,we adopt the rule that when a responsible person learns that withholding taxes have gone unpaid in past quarters for which he was responsible,he has a duty to use all current and future unencumbered funds available to the corporation to pay those back taxes.see,thosteson,at united states kim,cir honey united states,cir mazo,at.pursuant to this rule,as of august,erwin had a duty to use all unencumbered funds to reduce gcad tax liability from the prior quarters.
the record demonstrates that gcad generated several million dollars in gross receipts after august and paid rent and food vendors with those funds instead of paying the irs.erwin does not contend that any creditor held a security interest in these funds superior to the irs interest.see honey,at.accordingly,we hold that,by preferring gcad other creditors to the irs,erwin willfully failed to remit gcad payroll taxes for the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of 
for the reasons set forth above,the judgment of the district court is 
because i believe a reasonable,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to erwin and drawing all reasonable inferences from such evidence in his favor,could find that he was not a responsible person under,i would vacate the judgment in favor of the government and remand for trial.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.blaustein reich,buckles,cir.a motion for summary judgment should be granted if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists in this case,precluding the entry of summary judgment in favor of the government,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to erwin and draw all reasonable inferences from such evidence in his favor.edell,law offices of peter angelos,cir.we may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.id.at.and although we should review the record as a whole,we must disregard any evidence favorable to the government as the moving party that a jury would not be required to believe.id.at.see also reeves sanderson plumbing.that is,we should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached,at least to the extent that the evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.reeves,at internal quotation marks omitted.
mindful that in determining liability,the crucial inquiry is whether the person had the effective power to pay the is,whether he had the actual authority or ability,in view of his status within the corporation,to pay the taxes owed,plett united states,cir,i will focus on the application of the plett factors to the record evidence as we must view such evidence at the summary judgment stage.
i agree with the majority opinion that the first plett factor,which asks whether the party upon whom the government seeks to impose responsible person liability under served as an officer or director of the company,cuts in favor of the government.during the four quarters at issue,erwin served as,secretary,and treasurer of gcad,and served on its board of directors.
however,contrary to the majority opinion,i conclude that the second plett factor,which asks whether erwin controlled the company payroll,cuts in favor of erwin.the evidence shows that erwin did not control gcad payroll during the four tax quarters at issue.first,the record contains a sworn statement by erwin that he had no control over gcad payroll.second,there is no evidence that erwin personally oversaw gcad payroll.third,the undisputed evidence shows that for all four quarters at issue,a professional accounting and tax service was in charge of gcad payroll,including collecting withholdings and paying such withholdings to the government and although erwin did participate in the decision to hire such professional accounting and tax service,this circumstance is a far cry from controlling gcad payroll functions.
moreover,the fact that erwin and the other shareholders infused capital into gcad with instructions that the light brothers catch up the back withholding taxes,merely establishes that erwin and the other shareholders did not want to see their investment in gcad go down the drain because the corporation was not current in paying its federal withholding taxes.accordingly,such infusions and instructions,which erwin admitted during his deposition,are not inconsistent with erwin later sworn statement that he had no control over gcad payroll.similarly,erwin seizure of control over gcad payroll functions after the tax periods at issue and after he learned of the payroll withholding delinquencies for those periods reasonably suggests that erwin decided to become the responsible person under from then forward in order to protect his substantial investment.contrary to the majority opinion,such conduct does not require an inference that erwin was a responsible person under for the tax periods in question.
moving on to the third plett factor,such factor cuts in favor of erwin.specifically,a reasonable jury could find that erwin had limited authority about which creditors to prefer.for the most part,any creditor preferences made by erwin during the tax periods at issue were made with infusions of investor capital.the record also contains the sworn statement of erwin that,prior to october,he had limited,to no ability,about which creditors of gcad to prefer.
when the evidence is viewed through the proper summary judgment lens,the fourth plett factor also cuts in favor of erwin.specifically,the record shows that he did not participate in the operations of gcad.first,the record contains the sworn statement of erwin that,prior to october,he had no responsibility for the management of gcad moreover,the evidence in the record supports the reasonable inference that,during the four quarters at issue,with the exception of all aspects of accounting and payroll,pintner was solely responsible for the operations of gcad.indeed,pintner came to gcad upon the recommendation of various corporate officers of golden corral who presented him as a seasoned operator of the golden corral concept.the evidence supports the reasonable inference that,during the four quarters at issue,the light brothers were solely responsible for all aspects of accounting and payroll,including financial reporting to pintner and,by extension,the gcad shareholders.while erwin activities on behalf of gcad,for example,the negotiation of leases and the choosing of site locations for the restaurants,show that he was more than a passive investor,they do not establish that he participated in the operations of gcad.moreover,the fact that erwin reviewed gcad sales figures on a weekly basis can support the reasonable inference that he did so to monitor the status of his investment.it does not require the inference,as the majority suggests,that erwin participated in gcad management 
the fifth plett factor,which asks whether erwin had check writing authority,also favors erwin the evidence is undisputed that erwin did not possess the power to sign checks during the four quarters at issue,nor was he a signatory on any of gcad bank accounts during such quarters.the focus of this factor is whether the individual at issue possesses authority,because the lack of such authority suggests that he is not a responsible person under.
finally,the sixth plett factor,which asks whether erwin had the ability to hire and fire employees cuts both ways on the one hand,the undisputed evidence shows that erwin substantially participated in the hiring and firing decisions with respect to gcad top management,including hiring the light brothers.on the other hand,the evidence shows that erwin did not participate at all in routine personnel decisions.
examining the plett factors in toto,in my considered opinion,erwin has proffered sufficient evidence to stave off the government motion for summary judgment.more specifically,when the evidence in this case is viewed in the light most favorable to erwin,and all reasonable inferences are drawn in his favor,a reasonable fact finder could find,under the totality of the circumstances,that erwin was not a responsible person with respect to gcad withholding taxes for the last quarter of and the first three quarters of,erwin did not have the effective power to pay those taxes during those quarters.
my view is substantially supported by the first circuit decision in vinick united states vinick ii,cir,which is not cited by either party.in vinick ii,the government assessed a nearly penalty against arnold vinick vinick pursuant to.id.at.the assessment alleged failed withholding payments for the last three quarters of and the first two quarters of with respect to jefferson bronze,jefferson bronze.id.
