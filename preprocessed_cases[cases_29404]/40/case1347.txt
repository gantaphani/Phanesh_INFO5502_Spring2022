the question presented in these appeals is whether the tax court abused its discretion in denying the motion of the government of the united states virgin islands virgin islands to intervene in this tax case,which was filed in response to a notice of deficiency issued by the irs to emmit mchenry for not paying income taxes.the irs asserted that mchenry had participated in a tax avoidance scheme to take advantage of the lower taxes in the virgin islands.in seeking to intervene,the virgin islands asserted that mchenry was but one of many identified by the irs for tax enforcement under the tax laws pursuant to an irs change of position in applying those laws and that a tax court decision against mchenry in the circumstances would chill entrepreneurs like mchenry from coming to the virgin islands,as they were encouraged to do under the virgin islands economic development program adopted pursuant to the authorization afforded by the tax laws.
the tax court has issued no rules of procedure for intervention into tax court cases,but it is authorized,under tax court rule b,to prescribe such a procedure,giving particular weight to the federal rules of civil procedure to the extent that they are suitably adaptable to govern the matter at hand.tax.proc.b.the tax court has never adopted a procedure such as is prescribed in civil rule a for intervention as a matter of right,and it was not prepared to do so in this case.and while it has applied civil rule b for permissive intervention and did indeed consider the virgin islands motion by looking to that rule,it determined as a matter of discretion to deny permissive intervention.it concluded that intervention by the virgin islands would complicate mchenry deficiency case and would introduce redundancy into the proceedings,explaining that the virgin islands would have the right to introduce documentary evidence,call its own witnesses,and witnesses of the other parties,which could result in delay.
we affirm the tax court order denying intervention.because tax court rule b gives the tax court broad discretion in deciding whether and to what extent to follow federal rule of civil procedure governing intervention and because civil rule itself confers broad discretion on a trial court,we give great deference to a tax court decision to deny intervention,reviewing only for a clear abuse of discretion.because the tax court concerns over the consequences of granting the virgin islands motion to intervene are not unreasonable,we do not find a clear abuse of the tax court especially broad discretion.
to encourage economic development,congress authorized the virgin islands to reduce its income taxes on income from sources within the virgin islands or income effectively connected with the conduct of trade or business within the virgin islands.b.acting on this authorization,the virgin islands adopted an economic development program to promote economic growth in the virgin islands by granting substantial tax benefits to those who do business in the virgin islands.to qualify under the program,a person must,among other things,be a bona fide resident of the virgin islands and must file tax returns with the virgin islands bureau of internal revenue.
in,emmit mchenry sought to take advantage of the virgin islands tax benefits,and for the tax years,and,he filed tax returns with the virgin islands bureau of internal revenue,paying taxes at the reduced amount payable under the virgin islands tax code.he did not file tax returns with the irs for those three years.
in,the irs issued a deficiency notice to mchenry for the tax years,and,stating that he owed a total of in taxes and in penalties.the irs had determined that mchenry was not a bona fide resident of the virgin islands during those tax years and that he had participated in a tax avoidance scheme which involved improperly claiming to be a resident of the virgin islands and superficially recasting income from sources within the united states as income from sources within the virgin islands or as income effectively connected to a trade or business within the virgin islands in order to inappropriately and invalidly claim a tax credit of under the virgin islands economic development program.the deficiency notice stated that all transactions entered into pursuant to any arrangement between mchenry and his virgin islands corporate entities would be disregarded for federal tax purposes because they were devoid of economic purpose and economic substance and were engaged in for no purpose other than to avoid or evade tax.finally,the irs determined,based on the grounds given for the deficiency notice,that mchenry had been required to file a individual income tax return with the irs for tax years and and had failed to do so,a failure that was alleged to be due to fraud.
mchenry commenced this action in the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency,making numerous arguments.relevant to this appeal,he contended that he filed his tax returns for the years,and with the virgin islands bureau of revenue and that the irs effort now to assess deficiencies were time barred by the statute of limitations set forth in a.section a provides that taxes imposed by the internal revenue code shall be assessed within years after the return was filed.mchenry claimed that his virgin islands filings commenced this limitations period and that the irs was therefore barred from pursuing him for the tax years in question.the irs contended,however,that because mchenry did not file returns with the irs for the tax years,and,the statute of limitations has not yet begun to run.
the virgin islands filed a motion to intervene in the tax court proceedings because the irs current construction and application of a reverses the irs earlier internal understanding of the provision,under which the irs considered the filing of a virgin islands tax return to commence the running of the limitations period under a.the virgin islands claimed that the irs new position threatens the government taxing autonomy and fiscal sovereignty,and impairs the bureau virgin islands bureau of internal revenue ability to administer the tax laws of the virgin islands.the change in course,it argued,undermines the reasonable expectations of individual virgin islands taxpayers in filing their tax returns with the virgin islands bureau of internal revenue.it asserted that mchenry is just one of many taxpayers adversely affected by the irs unreasonable position on the statute of limitations.to support intervention procedurally,the virgin islands invoked tax court rule b,which authorizes the tax court to apply the federal rules of civil procedure,including rules a intervention of right and b permissive intervention.
the tax court denied the virgin islands motion to intervene by order dated march,stating 
the issues in this case are similar to those presented in appleton comm r,filed november,wherein the court declined to permit the virgin islands to intervene.we believe that because intervention by the virgin islands could result in trial complications,and for other reasons set forth in appleton,intervention is not the method which the virgin islands should use to express its position.
in appleton hereafter,appleton i the tax court reasoned that allowing the virgin islands to intervene solely to make an argument that petitioner has already identified as a matter central to his case would introduce redundancy to the proceeding.at.further,the tax court noted that if it were to grant the motion to intervene,the virgin islands would have the right to introduce documentary evidence,call its own witnesses,and witnesses of the other parties.such participation,as a practical matter,could result in trial complications as well as delay the resolution of the issue in which movant asserts an interest.id.at.
from the tax court order,the virgin islands filed this appeal,arguing that the tax court abused its discretion in denying its motion to intervene.
ii.permissive intervention 
the virgin islands contends first that the tax court abused its discretion in denying permissive intervention under federal rule of civil procedure b by improperly construing the rule.it argues that the tax court never seriously considered the question of whether intervention would cause undue delay,and that the tax court inappropriately imposed a requirement that the virgin islands had to show that its participation as a party was necessary to advocate for an unaddressed issue.
the irs contends that the virgin islands does not even qualify for permissive intervention because it was unable to satisfy the requirement of rule b that the virgin islands administer the statutory provisions implicated in the issue,which forms the basis of mchenry defense.the irs also argues that the tax court correctly found that the virgin islands seeks to raise an issue that is a cornerstone of the taxpayer defense and on which the virgin islands and the taxpayer completely agree,and that allowing the virgin islands to intervene would unduly delay the case.finally,the irs urges that we defer to the broad discretion given to the tax court to determine and apply its own procedures under tax court rule b,as well as the broad discretion given to district courts under civil rule b.it concludes that the tax court acted well within this double layer of broad discretion in denying permissive intervention.
the tax court rules make no provision for intervention by third persons in tax court proceedings,whether permissive or as of right,and the federal rules of civil procedure are not applicable to tax court proceedings.see t he proceedings of the tax court and its divisions shall be conducted in accordance with such rules of practice and procedure other than rules of evidence as the tax court may prescribe lasky comm r,cir aff.tax court rule b,however,grants the tax court broad discretion to borrow procedures from the federal rules of civil procedure.rule b provides 
these rules govern the practice and procedure in all cases and proceedings before the court.where in any instance there is no applicable rule of procedure,the court or the judge before whom the matter is pending may prescribe the procedure,giving particular weight to the federal rules of civil procedure to the extent that they are suitably adaptable to govern the matter at hand.
relying on rule b,the tax court has concluded that it,like other federal courts,may permit intervention by third parties in those unique situations where the ends of justice so require.estate of proctor comm r,memo,wl,at.and when applying civil rule b,the court has delineated the manner in which the tax court will assimilate the rule 
i f the moving party has a stake in the outcome of the litigation before the court which can not be adequately protected by the parties currently before the court,and permitting intervention will lead to a more complete presentation of the legal issues to be decided,we are more inclined to grant the party motion to intervene.motions to intervene have been denied where the moving party fails to demonstrate to the court that the was taking a position that was contrary to the moving party interests in the litigation before the court.
estate of proctor,wl,at.thus,while employing civil rule b for tax court proceedings,the tax court takes into account t he nature of the intervenor status in light of the tax court limited jurisdiction.estate of smith comm r.
in sum,the tax court does apply its rule b to allow permissive intervention,giving particular weight to civil rule b,but it only applies civil rule b when the ends of justice so require the moving party has a stake in the outcome of the tax court litigation which can not be adequately protected by the parties currently before the court and permitting the intervention will lead to a more complete presentation of the legal issues to be decided.estate of proctor,wl at.

with these principles in hand,we turn first to whether the virgin islands demonstrated to the tax court that it administers a statute or regulation on which mchenry limitations defense is based,as required by civil rule b,and then to the tax court consideration of whether the virgin islands demonstrated that its intervention would not cause undue delay or prejudice,as required by civil rule b.
civil rule b authorizes a court to grant a governmental officer or agency permissive intervention if a party claim or defense is based on a statute or regulation administered by the officer or agency.b.the irs contends that the virgin islands has totally failed to satisfy this requirement,as it does not administer a,which establishes the statute of limitations on which mchenry bases his defense.
the virgin islands does not claim that it directly administers a.but it argues that it has an interest in the irs enforcement of a which is sufficient to satisfy the administer requirement of civil rule b.it argues 
the virgin islands interest is based on its desire to protect the virgin islands tax structure,or more accurately,the economic development program.in this sense,while the issue that concerns both the virgin islands and mchenry is the same,namely,the statute of limitations,the virgin islands interest in the proceedings is certainly different from mchenry interest in dealing with this tax adjustment.
in cases like mchenry which will turn largely on the interpretation of the economic development program regulations,tax code sections and,and the statute of limitations in tax code section the virgin islands interest in how the courts interpret these laws is yet another powerful factor weighing in favor of permissive intervention.
in short,the virgin islands argues that the irs interpretation of the tax code statute of limitations affects the enforcement of c and,in which it has a direct interest,inasmuch as authorizes the virgin islands to reduce taxes as part of its economic development program.
to be clear,however,is a provision of the tax code,establishing a statute of limitations for imposing income tax assessments,and in no manner does it confer administrative responsibilities on the virgin islands.similarly,i.c is a provision of the tax code that provides that bona fide residents of the virgin islands who file their tax returns with the virgin islands need not include the gross income stated on their virgin islands tax returns in any united states gross income.finally,is a provision of the tax code,which authorizes the virgin islands to reduce taxes from sources within the virgin islands and on income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the virgin islands,thus enabling the creation of the virgin islands economic development program.while it might be true that these provisions of the united states tax code impact the policies of the virgin islands in the same way that tax law impacts many state laws,the virgin islands can not legitimately claim to be administering any of these provisions of the tax code.
to satisfy the requirement that it administers the statute on which mchenry bases his defense,a,the virgin islands must demonstrate that it manages,directs,or supervises the application of a.see lopez monterey,defining administer as to manage the affairs of,to direct or superintend the execution,use,or conduct of,to manage affairs,a government,have executive charge of,t o manage or conduct.yet,the virgin islands does not,and can not,claim that it has this type of control over these tax code provisions,or over any other tax code provisions.rather,it only claims that it has an interest in the irs policies in enforcing the tax code in that the virgin islands disagrees with the irs change in policy,which has affected its economic development program.but claiming an interest arising from this disagreement with the irs over enforcement of the tax code is quite distinct from claiming that the virgin islands administers any provision of the tax code.
indeed,proof of the matter is revealed by the irs reaction to mchenry alleged tax evasion techniques.as numerous persons were taking advantage of the virgin islands economic development program to avoid taxes,the irs and congress,not the virgin islands,acted in their respective capacities as administrators of the tax code particularly,and to alter the requirements and make evasion of taxes more difficult.in,the irs issued notice,entitled meritless filing position based on sections c and b,which it cited in the deficiency sent to mchenry.notice notified taxpayers that certain promoters are advising taxpayers to take highly questionable,and in most cases,meritless positions in order to avoid taxation and claim a tax benefit under the laws of united states virgin islands.the notice stated that the service intends to challenge these positions in appropriate cases and impose civil penalties on taxpayers or persons who participated in the promotion or reporting of these positions.further,to combat this type of tax evasion,congress,in,added a,which provided a stricter definition of bona fide residency of possessions added b,which imposed more stringent rules for determining whether income is derived from or connected with the conduct of business in a territory such as the virgin islands and changed the residency requirement in c to read resident during the entire taxable year,rather than resident at the close of the taxable year.american jobs creation act of.these changes to the tax code were accomplished by the irs and congress,not by the virgin islands.
the third circuit in appleton ii,on which the virgin islands relies heavily,stated conclusorily that rule b requirement that the virgin islands administer the statute at issue appears to be satisfied,as appleton tax assessments are based on an income calculation which takes into account credits created pursuant to,under the virgin islands economic development program.app x at.the first flaw in this analysis,however,is that the virgin islands did not move to intervene in the appleton i case or in this case on the calculation of the taxpayer virgin islands tax assessment under and the virgin islands economic development program,nor did it move to intervene on the question of the taxpayer virgin islands residency or income classification under c.rather,the virgin islands moved to intervene solely on the issue of whether the statute of limitations applicable to tax liability,a,provides the taxpayer a defense to the asserted tax deficiency.the virgin islands,however,does not administer a,which is part of the tax code and administered solely by the irs.and appleton ii never addressed the question of whether the virgin islands administers a,the provision at issue here.most certainly,it could not have concluded that the virgin islands administered that statute,as required under civil rule b.
moreover,we conclude that the third circuit was incorrect in assuming that the tax credits claimed by appleton were credits created pursuant to.appleton ii,app at.instead,they were credits created by the virgin islands for taxes payable to the virgin islands pursuant to the economic development program and the virgin islands tax laws.those virgin islands credits were in no way implicated in appleton statute of limitations defense under tax laws,nor are they in mchenry defense.section simply defined the limitations for purposes of taxation to which those credits had to adhere.
while we can recognize that the irs interpretations of the tax laws that it administers may have an impact on the virgin islands and its economic development program,the evidence of this impact in no way supports a claim that the virgin islands administers what are indisputably provisions of the tax code.
accordingly,we agree with the irs that virgin islands has not satisfied this basic and essential requirement of permissive intervention by a government officer or agency,as required by civil rule b.
even as it failed to satisfy civil rule b,the virgin islands nonetheless contends that the tax court abused its discretion in denying virgin islands motion to intervene also because the tax court misconstrued or misapplied the criteria to be considered for permissive intervention,as stated in civil rule b.that rule provides 
in exercising its discretion on a motion for permissive intervention,the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties rights.
this language is directive,instructing courts to consider the factors of undue delay and prejudice in exercising their discretion about permissive intervention,but findings on those factors are not determinative of or sufficient to decide a permissive intervention motion.regardless of what a court concludes in considering these factors,it may still either grant or deny intervention.
the virgin islands elevates civil rule b to serve as a gateway to intervention and,consistent with that approach,focuses on whether the tax court specifically found undue delay in haec verba.because the tax court did not use the term undue and,in addition,because it considered whether the virgin islands intervention was necessary to the presentation of mchenry defense a term not contained in civil rule b the virgin islands argues that the tax court misapplied rule b and therefore abused its discretion.
in making this argument,the virgin islands focuses almost entirely on whether the tax court used the word undue,not whether the tax court was substantively reacting to a possibility of undue delay.we decline,however,to impose a requirement that a district court or,in this case,the tax court,must,in making the discretionary decision under rule b,use particular words or phrases.the virgin islands has cited no case prior to appleton ii where a court of appeals,reviewing the denial of permissive intervention,imposed the kind of strict procedural and semantic requirements on a district court it asks us to impose here.
in fact,a review of other courts of appeals decisions reveals just the opposite,a profound reluctance to curb a district court discretion under rule b based on technicalities or semantics.see,south dakota,at upholding a denial of permissive intervention because the district court articulated a legitimate reason for denying the motion even though it did not determine whether the proposed intervention would cause undue delay or prejudice ingebretsen jackson pub.sch,cir noting the exceedingly deferential standard of review and upholding the district court denial of permissive intervention because of delay new york news kheel,cir,affirming new york news newspaper mail deliverers union of,finding the district court had properly considered undue delay even though the district court never used the word undue southmark cagan,cir finding undue delay even though the district court did not use those words because the issues raised by the prospective intervenor were collateral to the litigation manasota,tidwell,cir appellant urges reversal because the district court apparently did not consider whether intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the rights of other parties although the trial court did not specifically articulate its reasons for denying permissive intervention,we can find no abuse of discretion in the court denial of the motion.
in reviewing substantively whether the tax court considered undue delay,we note at the outset some ambivalence in the virgin islands position.in its motion to intervene,it indicated that it was filing a motion to intervene because of its vital interest in the proper resolution of one key aspect of the dispute the irs position th
