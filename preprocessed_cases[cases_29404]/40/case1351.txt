the commonwealth of virginia virginia brings this action against kathleen sebelius,the secretary of the department of health and human services the secretary.virginia challenges one provision of the patient protection and affordable care act as an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power.virginia maintains that the conflict between this provision and a virginia statute provides it with standing to pursue this action.after finding that this asserted conflict did give virginia standing to sue,the district court declared the challenged provision unconstitutional.for the reasons that follow,we hold that virginia,the sole plaintiff here,lacks standing to bring this action.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.
in march congress enacted the patient protection and affordable care act the affordable care act or the act,which seeks to institute comprehensive changes in the health insurance industry.the provision of the act challenged here requires,with limited exceptions,that individual taxpayers who fail to maintain adequate health insurance coverage pay a penalty.a b.we describe the affordable care act and this individual mandate provision in liberty geithner,cir.we need not repeat that discussion here.like the plaintiffs in liberty,virginia contends that congress lacked constitutional authority to enact the individual mandate.
this case,however,differs from liberty and every one of the many other cases challenging the act in a critical respect the sole provision challenged here the individual mandate imposes no obligations on the sole plaintiff,virginia.notwithstanding this fact,virginia maintains that it has standing to bring this action because the individual mandate allegedly conflicts with a state statute,the virginia health care freedom act vhcfa.
virginia filed this action on march,the same day that the president signed the affordable care act into law.the governor of virginia did not sign the vhfca into law until the next day.the vhcfa declares,with exceptions not relevant here,that n o resident of this commonwealth shall be required to obtain or maintain a policy of individual insurance coverage.ann.it contains no enforcement mechanism.
because the individual mandate applies only to individual persons,not states,the secretary moved to dismiss the suit for that virginia had not and could not allege any cognizable injury and so was without standing to bring this action.virginia insisted that it acquired standing from the asserted collision between its new statute,the vhcfa,and the individual mandate.although the district court recognized that the vhcfa was only declaratory in nature,it held that the vhcfa provided virginia standing.the court then declared the individual mandate unconstitutional,awarding summary judgment to virginia.
the secretary appeals,maintaining that virginia lacks standing to challenge the individual mandate and that,in any event,the mandate withstands constitutional attack.we review de novo the district court ruling as to standing.see benham city of charlotte,cir.because we hold that virginia lacks standing we can not reach the question of whether the constitution authorizes congress to enact the individual mandate.see steel citizens for a better env t.
article iii of the constitution confers on federal courts the power to resolve only cases and controversies.a federal court may not pronounce on questions of law arising outside of such cases and controversies.arizona christian sch.tuition org.winn,slip op.at.to do so would be inimical to the constitution democratic character and would weaken the public confidence in an unelected but restrained federal judiciary.id.
the standing doctrine prevents federal courts from transgressing this constitutional limit.see lujan defenders of wildlife.thus,to ensure that there exists the requisite case or controversy,a plaintiff must satisfy the three requirements that combine to form the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing.id.at.
specifically,a plaintiff must demonstrate that it has suffered an injury in fact there exists a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of and a favorable judicial ruling will likely redress that injury.id.internal quotations omitted.the burden rests with the party invoking federal jurisdiction,here virginia,to establish these elements.id.at.only if virginia meets the burden of establishing standing does the constitution permit a federal court to address the merits of the arguments presented.see steel,at.
standing here turns on whether virginia has suffered the necessary injury in fact.to satisfy that requirement,virginia must demonstrate that the individual mandate in the affordable care act inva des its legally protected interest,in a manner that is both concrete and particularized and actual or imminent.lujan,at internal quotations omitted.
we note at the outset that the individual mandate imposes none of the obligations on virginia that,in other cases,have provided a state standing to challenge a federal statute.thus,the individual mandate does not directly burden virginia,bowen public agencies,does not commandeer virginia enforcement officials,new york united states,and does not threaten virginia sovereign territory,massachusetts epa.virginia makes no claim to standing on these bases.
what virginia maintains is that it has standing to challenge the individual mandate solely because of the asserted conflict between that federal statute and the vhcfa.a state possesses an interest in its exercise of sovereign power over individuals and entities within the relevant jurisdiction,which involves the power to create and enforce a legal code.alfred snapp son,puerto rico.a federal statute that hinders a state exercise of this sovereign power to create and enforce a legal code at least arguably inflicts an injury sufficient to provide a state standing to challenge the federal statute.see wyoming united states,cir see also diamond charles,noting in dicta that a state has standing to defend the constitutionality of its statute emphasis added.virginia argues that the individual mandate,in assertedly conflicting with the vhcfa,has caused virginia this sort of sovereign injury.
the secretary contends that virginia claim is not of the sort recognized in wyoming.rather,according to the secretary,virginia actually seeks to litigate as parens patriae by asserting the rights of its citizens.as the secretary points out,such a claim would run afoul of the prohibition against states suing the united states on behalf of their citizens.see snapp,at massachusetts mellon.this prohibition rests on the recognition that a state possesses no legitimate interest in protecting its citizens from the government of the united states.see mellon,at.with respect to the federal government relationship to individual citizens,it is the united states,and not the state,which represents citizens as parens patriae.id.at.when a state brings a suit seeking to protect individuals from a federal statute,it usurps this sovereign prerogative of the federal government and threatens the general supremacy of federal law.pennsylvania kleppe.a state has no interest in the rights of its individual citizens sufficient to justify such an invasion of federal sovereignty.see id.at noting that the federalism interest in avoidance of state inference with the exercise of federal powers will predominate and bar any parens patriae lawsuit against the united states.
accordingly,the question presented here is whether the purported conflict between the individual mandate and the vhcfa actually inflicts a sovereign injury on virginia.if it does,then virginia may well possess standing to challenge the individual mandate.but if the vhcfa serves merely as a smokescreen for virginia attempted vindication of its citizens interests,then settled precedent bars this action.
faithful application of the above principles mandates a single answer to this question the vhfca does not confer on virginia a sovereign interest in challenging the individual mandate.virginia lacks standing to challenge th
