opinion of the court 
in this appeal we consider whether the members of the board of supervisors of salem township,pennsylvania are immune from suits brought against them in their individual capacities relating to their decision to deny an application for a permit for a conditional use.we conclude that they are entitled to absolute immunity.accordingly,we will reverse the decision of the district court.
when reviewing a ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,we accept the allegations in the pleadings as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.schrob catterson,cir.the relevant allegations can be stated briefly.the appellants,the defendants below,are salem township and the three members of its board of supervisors the board ernest ashbridge,john bower,and darren crispin.the appellees,the plaintiffs below,are norbert and joanne dotzel,the owners of a trucking business in the township,who applied for a permit to operate a small mining operation on their land.following a hearing in march,the salem township planning commission granted conditional approval of the dotzels application.the board then held a public hearing on april,and rejected the application.the board decision explained that the application was denied because t he proposed use jeopardize s the community development objectives of the ordinance.the dotzels contend that the board decision was not supported by the evidence before the board,but rather was based upon the personal animus of the individual board members and other improper motives.the dotzels allege that the board members failed to review prior to the hearing various submissions accompanying their permit application that the board members ignored the recommendation of the township solicitor to delay the hearing for days that the township engineer had advised the planning commission to approve the application that appellant ashbridge based his decision upon an inapplicable provision in the township zoning ordinance and that appellant bower brother had a quarry operation that would have been forced to compete with the dotzels proposed gravel pit.
as was their right under pennsylvania law,the dotzels appealed the permit denial in state court and prevailed,winning a reversal and an order that the permit be granted.they then brought suit in the district court under against the township and the board,raising several constitutional claims,including violations of their first amendment rights and their rights to procedural and substantive due process.the district court dismissed all but the substantive due process claim,holding that the state appellate review provided adequate procedural protection and that the complaint was devoid of any allegation that describes or particularizes any protected activity under the first amendment.the dotzels do not appeal from those dismissals.
the district court denied the defendants motion to dismiss the substantive due process claim,however,holding that discovery was necessary on two issues crucial to municipal liability whether the board denial of the dotzels application was so egregiously illegal as to shock the contemporary conscience,see desi pizza,city of,cir quoting county of sacramento lewis,d,and whether the board action constituted official policy,see monell dep t of soc,d.
the board members argued below that regardless of the merits of the claim against the township,they are entitled to immunity and can not be sued in their individual capacities based on their votes.the district court rejected that argument,explaining that it was unable to determine the capacity in which the board members were acting when they considered the dotzels permit application.the court therefore found itself unable to determine whether the defendants are protected by judicial immunity,and denied their motion to dismiss.on this question,we disagree with the district court and will reverse.analysis of the functions undertaken by the board in ruling on permit applications persuades us that the board members act in a capacity and are therefore entitled to absolute immunity from suit.
we begin,as we must,with an inquiry into whether we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal under the collateral order doctrine set forth in cohen beneficial indus.loan corporation,and its progeny.see lazy oil witco,cir w e have an inherent obligation to ensure that we only decide those cases for which there is a proper ground for appellate jurisdiction.
generally,as an appellate court,we have jurisdiction only over final orders of district courts as set forth in.a final order is one which terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case and leaves nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.richerson jones,cir quoting louis,iron mountain and southern ry.southern express.the denial of a motion to dismiss does not end the litigation between the parties and thus does not normally qualify as a final order under section.see petroleos mexicanos refinacion king a,cir.however,the supreme court in cohen explained that section is to be given a practical rather than a technical construction,and that there is a small class of orders which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.cohen,at.see also bell,pennsylvania public utility comm n,cir in re ford motor,cir.
the supreme court has held that the denial of absolute immunity is immediately appealable under the cohen collateral order doctrine because a finding of immunity constitutes an entitlement not to stand trial mitchell forsyth,d nixon fitzgerald,d.while there has been some debate as to the scope of appellate jurisdiction in absolute immunity cases where fact disputes persist about the nature of the challenged official function,we have read the court decisions to mean that an order denying qualified or absolute immunity,to the extent that the order turns on an issue of law,is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.giuffre bissell,cir.see hamilton leavy,cir schrob catterson,cir see also ellis v.the coffee county board of registrars,cir citing harris deveaux,cir absolute immunity does not depend on good faith or reasonableness thus it would be unlikely to find a case where disputed factual questions precluded review.
our inquiry into whether immunity attaches focuses on the nature of the public official job function,not the merits of the decision made by the official.see hamilton,at.thus,to determine whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal,we must ask whether the dotzels complaint reasonably alleges that the individual appellants were not acting in their capacity as board members.although the complaint alleges that the board members acted out of animus and other improper motivations,there is no allegation that any decision was made by any appellant other than in his capacity as a member of the board,or that any decision was made other than through procedures established by applicable state and local law.see pl.compl.accordingly,we have appellate jurisdiction to consider the appeal.
our remaining task is to determine whether the functions performed by the individual appellants were in nature.we exercise de novo review over the district court legal determination that the board members are not entitled to immunity.see hamilton,at.
as its name suggests,immunity is a doctrine under which government actors whose acts are relevantly similar to judging are immune from suit.absolute immunity attaches when a public official role is functionally comparable to that of a judge.hamilton,at.regardless of his job title,if a state official must walk,talk,and act like a judge as part of his job,then he is as absolutely immune from lawsuits arising out of that walking,talking,and acting as are judges who enjoy the title and other formal indicia of office.see omnipoint zoning hearing,cir holding that a zoning board acted in a capacity when it denied a conditional use permit.
