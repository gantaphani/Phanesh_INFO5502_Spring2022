current and former members of the united states armed forces plaintiffs,who allege they were victims of rape and sexual misconduct by fellow servicemembers during their military careers,brought suit against two former secretaries of defense,donald rumsfeld and robert gates defendants in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.alleging that defendants acts and omissions in their official capacities contributed to a military culture of tolerance for the sexual crimes perpetrated against them,plaintiffs sought money damages pursuant to bivens six unknown agents of federal bureau of narcotics,d.based on controlling supreme court precedent,the district court dismissed the complaint,concluding that judicial abstention was required.for the reasons explained below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background and proceedings below 
plaintiffs are women and three men who are all veterans of or currently serving in the united states army,navy,marine corps,or coast guard in their bivens complaint the complaint,plaintiffs describe acts of sexual assault committed against them by other armed forces personnel,and detail their often unsuccessful attempts to prosecute those responsible plaintiffs allege that their reports of serious crimes were met with skepticism,hostility,and retaliation by military authorities.the accused assailants,according to the complaint,often received only minimal punishment for the crimes alleged.in essence,the complaint describes a culture of sexual predation in the military fostered by the acts of defendants,which plaintiffs allege to be the cause of the rape and sexual assault committed against them.
plaintiffs further allege in the complaint that the defendants violated their constitutional rights by,inter alia,fail ing to investigate rapes and sexual assaults,prosecute perpetrators,provide an adequate judicial system as required by the uniform military justice act,and abide by congressional deadlines to implement institutional reforms to stop rapes and other sexual assaults.
the complaint also alleges,inter alia,that secretary rumsfeld expressed scorn and derision towards congressional efforts to eradicate sexual assault in the military,permitted military command to interfere with the impartiality of criminal investigations,ignored congressional commands to take certain actions,and did not make any efforts to eliminate retaliation against servicemembers who reported being raped,assaulted and harassed.
as to secretary gates,the plaintiffs pled that he failed to take reasonable steps to prevent plaintiffs from being repeatedly raped,sexually assaulted and sexually harassed,permitted military command to use nonjudicial punishment for such conduct,permitted military command to retaliate against those servicemembers who reported being raped,assaulted,and harassed,and interfered with and opposed congressional directives designed to eliminate rape and sexual assault in the military.
as a consequence of the foregoing allegations,plaintiffs assert that the defendants violated their fifth amendment rights to due process and equal protection,their first amendment rights to free speech,and their seventh amendment rights to trial by jury.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.before the district court,they argued that the supreme court has declined to extend bivens to permit suits for money damages against government officials in general,but particularly not to permit suits for alleged torts that arise out of military service 
after hearing argument,the district court issued an order granting defendants rule b motion and dismissing the complaint.relying heavily on chappell wallace,d,and united states stanley,d,the district court observed that a remedy is not available when special factors counseling hesitation are present.noting that the unique disciplinary structure of the military establishment is a special factor that counsels against judicial intrusion,the court concluded that i n the present case,the plaintiffs sue the defendants for their alleged failures with regard to oversight and policy setting within the military disciplinary structure.this is precisely the forum in which the supreme court has counseled against the exercise of judicial authority.although the court observed that the allegations raised in the complaint were egregious,it reiterated that the supreme court has strongly advised against judicial involvement.
plaintiffs noted a timely appeal of the district court judgment,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 
standard of review 
we review de novo the grant of a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.epps jp morgan chase bank,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d quoting bell atl.twombly,d.
the constitutional basis of a bivens action 
plaintiffs raise one assignment of error on appeal that the district court erred in concluding that a bivens remedy does not lie for the constitutional violations they allege in their complaint.in bivens,the supreme court held that violation of the fourth amendment by a federal agent acting under color of his authority gives rise to a cause of action for damages,despite the absence of any federal statute creating liability.at.the court explained that even without an explicit congressional authorization for a monetary remedy at law,t he very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws,whenever he receives an injury.id.at quoting marbury madison,cranch.
notwithstanding the breadth of that phrase,the court placed an important qualifier on the availability of an implied right of action against a government official,foreshadowing the extremely narrow reach established in cases.the court limited a bivens right of action by stating that the present case involves no special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by congress.id.at as the court would later explain,t he special factors counselling hesitation in the creation of a new remedy.relate to the question of who should decide whether such a remedy should be provided,rather than the merits of the particular remedy that was sought.bush lucas,d.
we recently examined the basis and application of bivens,particularly in a military setting,in lebron rumsfeld,cir.our explanation recognized the supreme court strict limits on a bivens proceeding exist in part because the supreme court has long counselled restraint in implying new remedies at law.lebron,at.such restraint counsels that we review a plaintiff invitation to imply a bivens action with skepticism.id.at.
as we emphasized in lebron,judicial abstention from sanctioning a bivens claim in the military context is,at its essence,a function of the separation of powers under the constitution which delegates authority over military affairs to congress and to the president as commander in chief.it contemplates no comparable role for the judiciary.id.
preserving the constitutionally prescribed balance of powers is thus the first special factor counseling hesitation in the recognition of the plaintiff bivens claim.the constitution contemplated that the legislative branch have plenary control over rights,duties,and responsibilities in the framework of the military establishment,including regulations,procedures,and remedies.chappell wallace,d.indeed,that control is explicit and not merely derivative of other powers congress has the enumerated powers to declare war,see,art.i,cl.establish the armed forces,see id.cl.and make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces,id.cl.as the supreme court has noted,what is distinctive here is the specificity of that technically superfluous grant of power had the power to make rules for the military not been spelled out,it would in any event have been provided by the necessary and proper is,for example,the power to make rules for the government and regulation of the postal service.united states stanley,d internal citation omitted.as a consequence,in no other area has the court accorded congress greater deference.rostker goldberg,d.
as a consequence of the constitution specific delineation of the powers allotted among the branches of government in military affairs,
whenever the supreme court has considered a bivens case involving the military,it has concluded that the insistence with which the constitution confers authority over the army,navy,and militia upon the political branches counsels hesitation in our creation of damages remedies in this field.stanley,at.put simply,such a remedy would be plainly inconsistent with congress authority in military affairs.chappell,at.
against that backdrop,the supreme court has only twice,in the more than forty years since deciding bivens,recognized a new implied monetary remedy against federal officials,and it has never done so in the military context.in davis passman,d,the court allowed a congressional staffer to sue a congressman for alleged violations of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.and in carlson green,d,the court permitted a suit to go forward against federal prison officials for an alleged violation of the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the eighth amendment.
it is clear that expansion of a cause of action,such as davis and carlson,is the exception,not the rule.the supreme court has further acknowledged that since those cases were decided it has responded cautiously to suggestions that bivens remedies be extended into new contexts.schweiker chilicky,d see also wilkie robbins,d a bivens suit is not an automatic entitlement.indeed,since davis and carlson,the court has consistently turned away plaintiffs seeking to avail themselves of novel applications of bivens.see,minneci pollard,d no bivens claim against employees of privately run federal prison wilkie,at no bivens action lies against bureau of land management employees accused of retaliating against a landowner correctional servs.malesko,d no bivens remedy against corporate operator of private prison fdic meyer,d no bivens cause of action against federal agencies schweiker,at bivens suit not permitted for due process violations alleged against government employees in their handling of social security applications stanley,at no bivens suits when injuries are sustained incident to military service bush,at no bivens remedy for a federal employee against a supervisor who has allegedly violated employee first amendment rights chappell,at military personnel may not sue superior officers in a bivens action.in light of this unbroken line of judicial abstention,we have emphasized that t he bivens cause of action is not amenable to casual extension.lebron,at quoting holly scott,cir.
moreover,the supreme court has recognized that implied causes of action for money damages are uniquely problematic in the context of claims against the military.in chappell,the court concluded that no bivens cause of action could lie against certain naval officers alleged to have engaged in racial discrimination against the plaintiffs,a group of enlisted sailors.chief justice burger,writing for the court,explained 
t he special status of the military has required,the constitution has contemplated,congress has created,and this court has long recognized two systems of justice,to some extent parallel one for civilians and one for military personnel.the special nature of military need for unhesitating and decisive action by military officers and equally disciplined responses by enlisted be undermined by a judicially created remedy exposing officers to personal liability at the hands of those they are charged to command.
id.at internal citation omitted see also id.at judges are not given the task of running the army.quoting orloff willoughby.it is for that reason,chief justice burger noted,c ivilian courts must,at the very least,hesitate long before entertaining a suit to tamper with the established relationship between enlisted military personnel and their superior officers that relationship is at the heart of the necessarily unique structure of the military establishment.id.at.accordingly,the court determined that the unique disciplinary structure of the military establishment and congress activity in the field constitute special factors which dictate that it would be inappropriate to provide enlisted military personnel a remedy against their superior officers.id.at.
in concluding that a bivens claim was unavailable to the plaintiffs in chappell,the court drew guidance from feres united states.in feres,the court analyzed whether the federal tort claims act ftca extends its remedy to one sustaining incident to military service what under other circumstances would be an actionable wrong.at.answering that question in the negative,the feres court concluded that the government is not liable under the ftca for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.id.at.drawing on that precedent,the court in chappell then observed,h ere,as in feres,we must be concerned with the disruption of the peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors that might result if the soldier were allowed to hale his superiors into court.at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
four years after chappell,the supreme court reaffirmed and clarified the chappell holding in stanley,wherein a former servicemember brought actions pursuant to the ftca and bivens alleging that he was the involuntary victim of army lsd experiments during his military service.at.the stanley plaintiff argued that because he was not suing persons directly in his chain of command,the concerns articulated in chappell were inapplicable.id.at.in holding that the plaintiff could not pursue a bivens action,the court explicitly adopted the incident to service test articulated in feres and chappell for application in a bivens proceeding.
today,no more than when we wrote chappell,do we see any reason why our judgment in the bivens context should be any less protective of military concerns than it has been with respect to ftca suits,where we adopted an incident to service rule.in fact,if anything we might have felt freer to compromise military concerns in the latter context,since we were confronted with an explicit congressional authorization for judicial involvement that was,on its face,unqualified whereas here we are confronted with an explicit constitutional authorization for congress t omake rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces,const.art.i,cl,and rely upon inference for our own authority to allow money damages.this is not to say,that all matters within congressional power are exempt from bivens.what is distinctive here is the specificity of that technically superfluous grant of power,and the insistence evident from the number of clauses devoted to the subject with which the constitution confers authority over the army,navy,and militia upon the political branches.all this counsels hesitation in our creation of damages remedies in this field.
id.at footnotes omitted.the court also emphasized the importance of the incident to service test insofar as it minimized the degree of disruption that a judicial inquiry would create 
a test for liability that depends on the extent to which particular suits would call into question military discipline and decisionmaking would itself require judicial inquiry into,and hence intrusion upon,military matters.whether a case implicates those concerns would often be problematic,raising the prospect of compelled depositions and trial testimony by military officers concerning the details of their military commands.even putting aside the risk of erroneous judicial conclusions which would becloud military decisionmaking,the mere process of arriving at correct conclusions would disrupt the military regime.the incident to service test,by contrast,provides a line that is relatively clear and that can be discerned with less extensive inquiry into military matters.
id.at emphasis added.the court reaffirm ed the reasoning of chappell that the special factors counselling hesitation the unique disciplinary structure of the military establishment and congress activity in the field,require abstention in the inferring of bivens actions as extensive as the exception to the ftca established by feres.id.at.
distilling these cases to their core holdings,we restate the principles guiding our analysis in the case at bar no bivens action will lie where special factors counsel hesitation in creating an implied right of action and special factors clearly counsel hesitation in implying a cause of action for injuries arising out of military service.the supreme court holding in stanley left no doubt as to this principle we hold that no bivens remedy is available for injuries that arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.at.as one treatise has succinctly explained the law is now settled that bivens suits are never permitted for constitutional violations arising from military service,no matter how severe the injury or how egregious the rights infringement.erwin chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction ed.
as we now explain,the injuries alleged by plaintiffs in their complaint,clearly arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.stanley,at.
incident to service 
the incident to service test,as articulated in feres,can not be reduced to a few bright line rules.united states shearer,d.nonetheless,the court concerns in feres are implicated where a suit requires the civilian court to military decisions,or raises an allegation that goes directly to the management of the military,calling into question basic choices about the discipline,supervision,and control of a serviceman.id.at.shearer is particularly instructive for the case at bar.
private vernon shearer was off duty and away from his duty station at fort bliss,new mexico,when he was kidnapped and murdered by private andrew heard,a fellow serviceman.id.at.private heard had previously been convicted of manslaughter by a court in germany,and then assigned by the army to fort bliss upon his release from german prison.id.at.private shearer mother,the administratrix of his estate,brought a ftca action against the army,claiming that the army negligently and carelessly failed to exert a reasonably sufficient control over private heard,resulting in her son wrongful death.id.
the supreme court ultimately held that feres barred the suit.in addition to implicating military management and calling into question the decisions of military commanders about the discipline,supervision,and control of servicemembers,the court opined that 
t o permit this type of suit would mean that commanding officers would have to stand prepared to convince a civilian court of the wisdom of a wide range of military and disciplinary decisions for example,whether to overlook a particular incident or episode,whether to discharge a serviceman,and whether and how to place restraints on a soldier conduct.but as we noted in chappell wallace,such complex,subtle,and professional decisions as to the composition,training,and control of a military force are essentially professional military judgments.
id.at quoting chappell,at.
applying the incident to service test in the case at bar,it is clear that the allegations raised by plaintiffs complaint are either incident to,or arise out of,their service in the military.
the complaint alleged that secretary rumsfeld,inter alia,
failed to appoint any members to a commission to investigate policies and procedures with respect to the military investigation of reports of sexual misconduct,as required by congress 
repeatedly permitted military command to rely on the article nonjudicial punishment process for allegations involving rapes,sexual assaults,and sexual harassment,
repeatedly permitted military command to interfere with the impartiality of criminal investigations,
repeatedly permitted the military command to charge those alleged to have raped or sexually assaulted a r under uniform code of military justice ucmj article adultery rather than under article rape,
repeatedly ensured that the military,not the civilian authorities,investigated and prosecuted charges of rape and sexual assault,
repeatedly permitted eighty percent of those military personnel convicted of sex crimes to be honorably discharged from the military and receive their full retirement benefits,
permitted military command to retaliate against those service members who reported being raped,assaulted and harassed,
granted waivers that permitted individuals convicted of domestic offenses to join the services and carry weapons,and 
permitted military personnel on duty to ridicule both male and female subordinates by using and offensive terms.
the allegations against secretary rumsfeld,though obviously troubling if true,fall within the heartland of the concerns identified in chappell,stanley,and feres.the plaintiffs allegations directly challenge the wisdom of a wide range of military and disciplinary decisions,shearer,at,and each directly challenge the decisions made within the ultimate chain of military command.allowing the suit against secretary rumsfeld to go forward would require the civilian court to military decisions,because the complaint raises allegations that go directly to the management of the military,calling into question basic choices about the discipline,supervision,and control of service members.shearer,at.
but apart from the separation of powers infringement that such a course of judicial second guessing of military command decisions would encompass,the stanley court was equally concerned with the occurrence of a judicial inquiry at all.such an inquiry would rais e the prospect of compelled depositions and trial testimony by military officers concerning the details of their military commands.even putting aside the risk of erroneous judicial conclusions which would becloud military decisionmaking,the mere process of arriving at correct conclusions would disrupt the military regime.stanley,at.consequently,both rationales compel judicial abstention.
the same is true of the plaintiffs allegations lodged against secretary gates.in addition to raising similar allegations to those brought against secretary rumsfeld,the plaintiffs contend that secretary gates permitted command to use nonjudicial punishment for sexual crimes and permitted retaliation against reporters of sexual crimes.further,the complaint alleges that secretary gates 
directed the director of the sexual assault prevention and response office to ignore a congressional subpoena,
failed to ensure that the department of defense met its deadline of january for implementing the sexual assault report database prescribed by the national defense act for fiscal year,and 
selected an inexperienced and tiny firm to receive the million contract designed to implement the army obligations to prevent sexual assault and harassment.
once again,though the allegations raised are serious matters,the chappell,stanley,feres and shearer precedents mandate that courts not permit a bivens action that challenges military decisionmaking.see stanley,at we hold that no bivens remedy is available for injuries that arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.see also chemerinksy,supra,at.
plaintiffs argue,however,that the injuries they allege did not arise out of and were not incident to military service.specifically,they assert that defendants have not made any evidentiary showing that rape and sexual assault,and the resultant failures to punish the perpetrators,served a military mission.appellants opening br.see also id.in order to fall within the scope of the incident to service test,the injury must actually arise from conduct done to further a military mission.
plaintiffs fundamentally misapprehend the nature of the incident to service rule,which does not inquire whether the discrete injuries to the victim were committed in support of the military mission.rather,the incident to service test asks,in relevant part,whether particular suits would call into question military discipline and decisionmaking and would require judicial inquiry into,and hence intrusion upon,military
