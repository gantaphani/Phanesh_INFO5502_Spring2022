plaintiffs,who are current and former employees of the state of vermont,appeal from the dismissal of the action by the united states district court for the district of vermont sessions,by reason of vermont sovereign immunity.the complaint alleges violations of the fair labor standards act of,et flsa,and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief,damages,and liquidated damages for back pay.defendants are the state of vermont,the state of vermont agency of administration,and the vermont secretary of administration,sued in his official capacity defendants.plaintiffs contend that,because their weekly pay is reduced for absences in excess of their accrued leave,they are not paid on a salary basis under the flsa and are thus entitled to overtime pay at one and times their regular rate.
plaintiffs brought this action in state court.defendants removed it to the federal district court.defendants then filed an initial motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under the flsa.the district court denied the motion.after further motion practice and discovery,defendants filed a second motion to dismiss,this time asserting state sovereign immunity from private flsa suit.plaintiffs responded that defendants had waived their immunity by express statutory waiver,by removal,and by other litigation conduct,including assurances given to plaintiffs that vermont would not present a sovereign immunity defense.the district court rejected each of these arguments for waiver and granted defendants motion to dismiss.we conclude that,while defendants may,by removing the action,have waived their eleventh amendment immunity from suit in a federal forum,defendants have not expressly waived vermont general sovereign immunity from private flsa suit,and their litigation conduct does not constitute such a waiver.
we affirm the judgment.
background 
i.the flsa claim 
plaintiffs are current and former members of various,supervisory,judicial,and corrections bargaining units within the vermont state employees association vsea.under their vsea agreements,plaintiffs are guaranteed a basic weekly salary,based on a hour work week at their relevant salary level,which is computed as an hourly rate.it is undisputed that vermont has and continues to offer plaintiffs a minimum of forty hours of work each week and does not reduce employees pay for absences occasioned by the state.under the vsea agreements,plaintiffs accrue personal leave for time worked,in addition to sick leave.when employees miss work for their own reasons,they must use either personal or sick leave in order to avoid deductions in their pay.
it is undisputed that as employees of a public agency,plaintiffs are covered by the flsa.it is disputed whether they are paid on a salary basis and therefore exempt employees under the flsa.exempt employees are not entitled to overtime.see a.the secretary of labor has promulgated a general rule and exceptions for determining whether an employee is paid on a salary basis and thus exempt from flsa overtime requirements.plaintiffs contend that,pursuant to this regulation,they are not paid on a salary basis because the minimum salary they receive varies with the quantity of work they perform,as absences uncovered by personal or sick leave result in a loss of pay their pay is calculated at an hourly rate and the state practice of docking their pay in increments for absences not covered by leave is impermissible with regard to salaried employees.defendants respond that the salary basis test allows for deductions in pay stemming from absences occasioned by the employee,rather than the employer according to regulation and judicial precedent,computation and recording of pay at an hourly rate do not vitiate its salary nature and public employers may make deductions for employee absences not covered by accrued leave without affecting the salaried,exempt status of employees under.
ii.proceedings below 
plaintiffs brought this action in vermont superior court on january,seeking relief under the flsa.the complaint asserted that vermont,by act of its legislature.stat.ann.tit,b,had expressly waived its sovereign immunity to private suit under the flsa.defendants removed the case to the federal district court on february,asserting that court jurisdiction under,because plaintiffs claim was based on federal law.in their initial motion to dismiss,defendants did not raise a sovereign immunity defense,but argued instead that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim under the flsa.in their opposition to the motion to dismiss,plaintiffs repeated the assertion that the vermont legislature had expressly waived sovereign immunity to private suits under the flsa by statute.defendants did not address the issue in argument on the motion.after the district court denied defendants first motion to dismiss,defendants filed an answer,which did not assert a sovereign immunity defense.
over a year later,at a conference discussing prospective summary judgment motions,plaintiffs again raised the possibility of a sovereign immunity defense.defendants responded that they were not asserting the defense and that it had been waived.plaintiffs then sent defendants a set of interrogatories,including does the state intend to rely upon the defense of sovereign immunity,to which defendants responded defendants removed the claim to federal court.accordingly,defendants do not intend to assert amendment immunity.defendants do not intend to assert they are otherwise immune from the flsa in this action.
three months after filing this interrogatory response,and more than two years after the beginning of the lawsuit,defendants amended their response,announcing that they now intended to present a sovereign immunity defense.defendants specifically asserted immunity from private flsa suit in both state and federal court,and moved to amend their answer to that effect.on july,the district court denied the motion to amend as to sovereign immunity and instead directed the parties to file dispositive motions on the issue after further discovery.on october,the court allowed further depositions on the sovereign immunity issue,and on november,defendants finally filed their motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds.shortly thereafter,both parties moved for summary judgment on the merits of the flsa claim,and plaintiffs moved also for partial summary judgment on the sovereign immunity defense.on september,after hearing argument on the pending motions,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the suit on sovereign immunity grounds.coniff vermont,cv,wl.
the concept of state sovereign immunity encompasses different species of immunity.the eleventh amendment,as interpreted by the supreme court,identifies a single species immunity of a state treasury from claims for damages brought by private entities in federal courts.see seminole tribe of florida.this immunity protects a state dignity and fiscal integrity from federal court judgments,woods rondout valley cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir,and acts as a limitation on the federal judiciary article iii powers.see alden maine,in re charter oak,cir the eleventh amendment effectively places suits by private parties against states outside the ambit of article iii of the constitution.states also a broader sovereign immunity,which applies against all private suits,whether in state or federal court.see alden,at,noting that states immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the states enjoyed before the ratification of the constitution and that the sovereign immunity of the states neither derives from,nor is limited by,the terms of the eleventh amendment,since in enacting the eleventh amendment congress acted not to change but to restore the original constitutional design.the eleventh amendment is but one particular exemplification of that immunity.see fed.comm state ports.accordingly,there are two types of sovereign immunity at issue here a particular species of sovereign immunity eleventh amendment immunity from suit in federal court and the states broader general sovereign immunity against all suits.
neither type of immunity is absolute.states may elect to waive either type of immunity either in federal or state court.coll.sav.bank.postsecondary educ.expense,lapides bd.of regents,jacobs state teachers ret.of.under limited circumstances,congress may override state sovereign immunity by exercising its fourteenth amendment enforcement powers.fitzpatrick bitzer.however,congress mere creation of a private right of action does not prevent a state from asserting its immunity to suit seeking enforcement of such a statute that ostensibly imposes obligations on states.see emps.of dep t of pub.health welfare,dep t of pub.health welfare,recognizing that the flsa was binding upon missouri but nevertheless upholding the state immunity to private suit to recover under that act see also alden,at when a state asserts its immunity to suit,the question is not the primacy of federal law but the implementation of the law in a manner consistent with the constitutional sovereignty of the states.
the defendants do not claim eleventh amendment immunity.they sought and were granted dismissal of the action on the basis of vermont broader immunity from suit in either state or federal court.plaintiffs do not contest that vermont sovereign immunity shields all three defendants unless that immunity has been waived or forfeited.the only question we face is whether either the state of vermont or the defendants have voluntarily waived or forfeited the state sovereign immunity to private flsa suit.plaintiffs argue that vermont has done so by express statutory waiver,and that defendants have done so by voluntary removal of the case from state to federal court,as well as their representations during the first two years of litigation that they would not assert a sovereign immunity defense.we address each argument in turn.
express statutory waiver 
the question of whether a state has waived its immunity from private flsa suits is answered,in the first instance,by reference to state law.see alden,at looking to maine law to determine whether maine had waived sovereign immunity against claims under the flsa.vermont courts have concluded that vermont state sovereign immunity can be waived only expressly by statute.jacobs,at lashay dep t of soc.rehab.
plaintiffs argue that a statutory provision.stat.ann.tit,b,constitutes an express waiver of the state immunity from private actions brought under the flsa.the pertinent part of that provision reads as follows 
b a n employer shall not pay an employee less than one and times the regular wage rate for any work done by the employee in excess of hours during a workweek.however,this subsection shall not apply to 
state employees who are covered by the federal fair labor standards act.
stat.ann.tit,b.plaintiffs contend that the plain,ordinary meaning of the term covered by in clause is that state employees are afforded the protections and remedies under the flsa.plaintiffs br.at.
plaintiff argument misunderstands the difference between the applicability of a federal statute to a state enacting lawful obligations upon the state,and the state amenability to a private entity suit to enforce such an obligation.there is no doubt that the flsa applies to vermont and creates a legal obligation on vermont to pay its employees in accordance with the statute terms.nonetheless,vermont sovereign immunity unless waived or forfeited bars suit by a private entity seeking to enforce the flsa terms.see emps.of dep t of pub.health welfare,at recognizing that the flsa was binding upon missouri but nevertheless upholding the state immunity to private suit to recover under that act.
vermont statutory reference to the fact that some of its employees are covered by the flsa implicitly acknowledges its legal obligations under federal law,but says nothing about how that obligation may be enforced against it.it does not constitute an implicit,much less an explicit waiver of its sovereign immunity from private suit.the fact that vermont state employees are covered by the flsa does not mean that those employees are entitled to sue vermont under the flsa private right of action.to the contrary,supreme court precedent is unequivocal in distinguishing between a state legal obligation to comply with a federal law and its immunity from private actions brought pursuant to that law.alden,at refusing to find a waiver of sovereign immunity despite maine policy of compliance with the flsa emps.of dep t of pub.health welfare,at recognizing that the flsa was binding upon missouri but nevertheless upholding the state immunity to private suit to recover under that act williams.dep t of human,app x,cir holding that oklahoma state law stating a policy of comply ing fully with the provisions of the federal fair labor standards act did not constitute waiver of sovereign immunity.mere state statutory recognition of vermont legal obligation to comply with the flsa does not express an intent to waive immunity from suit.
nor is there validity to the argument that,as vermont is subject to the flsa under the supremacy clause of the constitution regardless of whether it acknowledges its obligations,the statutory acknowledgment should be construed as a waiver because it would serve no purpose unless as a waiver of immunity.the statute has a different clear purpose,which is to provide that vermont own statutory overtime pay requirement does not apply to state employees who are covered by the flsa.stat.ann.tit,b.it clarifies that this latter category of employees,whose overtime entitlements are provided by the flsa,are not also entitled to overtime under state law.
the language of b is easily distinguishable from the sort of express language utilized by the vermont legislature and recognized by vermont courts as a waiver of sovereign immunity,exposing the state to private suit.see.stat.ann.tit,a stating that the state shall be liable for injuries caused by negligence of state employees lashay,a d at sovereign immunity protects the state from suit unless immunity is expressly waived by statute.the state of vermont has waived its immunity to certain suits under.
ii.waiver by removal 
plaintiffs also argue that the defendants waived vermont sovereign immunity by removing the suit to federal court.this argument misunderstands the difference between eleventh amendment immunity and the broader state sovereign immunity at issue here.as explained above,a state eleventh amendment immunity has a different purpose and is far narrower than the state general sovereign immunity.eleventh amendment immunity relates to the relationship between the states and the federal government.it deprives the federal courts of power to award money damages enforceable against a state treasury.it has no bearing on whether a plaintiff may sue the state for the same relief in the state own courts.even when a state may be sued in its own courts for a money judgment,the eleventh amendment protects it from a liability imposed by a federal court.but it would be unfair to allow a state which is liable in its own courts to remove a suit from its own courts to federal court and thereby escape all liability on the ground that the federal court lacks power to impose liability on the state.for this reason,the supreme court held in lapides board of regents of the university system of georgia that by removing a case from state court to federal court,a state defendant waives the right to rely on its eleventh amendment immunity from the federal court judgment.at.
on the other hand,neither logic nor precedent supports the proposition that a state waives its general state sovereign immunity by removing an action from state court to federal court.a state sovereign immunity from private suit is a common law doctrine historically recognized by both state and federal courts,though most clearly explicated in federal judicial precedents.see alden,at citing,inter alia,nevada hall,and hans louisiana.a state defendant sued in state court,when entitled to remove the suit to federal court,may well wish to do so in the belief that its entitlement to have the suit dismissed by reason of the state sovereign immunity,an entitlement largely elaborated by federal courts,will be better protected by the federal courts then by courts of the state.see,stewart north carolina,cir north carolina merely sought to have the sovereign immunity issue resolved by a federal court rather than a state court.furthermore,a state agency sued on a federal law claim,which contends that the state sovereign immunity remains intact but wishes to have the federal law claim adjudicated in federal court in the event of a finding that the state immunity has been waived or abrogated,should not be compelled to abandon its claim of immunity as the price of access to a federal court.see,bergemann dep t of envtl,cir plaintiffs argue that a state waives sovereign immunity whenever it removes a case to a federal court.if that proposition were to prevail,a state with a colorable immunity defense to a federal claim brought against it in its own courts would face a morton fork remove the federal claim to federal court and waive immunity or litigate the federal claim in state court regardless of its federal nature.either way,the state would be compelled to relinquish a right either its right to assert immunity from suit or its right to a federal forum.quoting martin franklin capital.accordingly neither logic nor fairness supports the proposition that a state defendant removal of a suit to the federal court should be construed as a waiver of the state general immunity from suit.and precedent does not support treating a state removal as such a waiver.
plaintiffs cite the supreme court opinion in lapides board of regents as authority for the proposition that by removing a suit to federal court,a state defendant waives the state general sovereign immunity.this is a misreading of lapides.it was undisputed in that case that the state had already waived its general immunity to suit prior to the litigation.lapides,u.at explaining that,with respect to the relevant claims,the state has explicitly waived immunity from proceedings.accordingly,the lapides defendant removal to federal court could not serve as a waiver of the state general immunity,which had already been waived.the supreme court ruled,for the very good reasons discussed above,that the state removal to federal court did constitute a waiver of its eleventh amendment immunity from suits for damages in the federal courts.the court explained that allowing a state which had waived its sovereign immunity to effectively recover immunity by removing the case to federal court and then claiming eleventh amendment immunity would give the state an unfair tactical advantage.id.at.the court expressly declined to address the scope of waiver by removal that might occur in a situation where the state underlying sovereign immunity from suit has not already been waived or abrogated in state court.id.at.lapides therefore furnishes no support whatsoever for plaintiffs contention that vermont removal waived its general immunity from flsa claims.
nor do plaintiffs get support from ford motor department of treasury of indiana,the case that lapides overruled.ford motor similarly focused on whether removal waived eleventh amendment immunity.in that case,as in lapides,the state had previously waived its general sovereign immunity and the question was whether it could effectively recover the previously waived immunity by removing the case to federal court and claiming the protection of the eleventh amendment.see at.following a line of reasoning that the court subsequently disavowed in lapides,ford ruled that,because the state law did not authorize the state attorney general to waive sovereign immunity,the attorney general removal to federal court likewise could not constitute a waiver of the state eleventh amendment immunity.see id.at.lapides rejected ford ruling on this point,crafting the doctrine of waiver of eleventh amendment immunity by removal precisely to prevent a state exposed to suit in its own courts by its own laws from fabricating immunity through flight to a federal forum.lapides,at a rule of federal law that finds waiver through a state attorney general invocation of jurisdiction avoids inconsistency and unfairness.there is no suggestion in either opinion supporting plaintiffs claims here.
there has,however,been some confusion in the circuit courts as to the meaning of lapides,and its impact on cases in which a state that has not previously waived its general immunity to a private action voluntarily removes the action to federal court,presumptively waiving its eleventh amendment immunity.our court has not ruled on the question.six circuits that have expressly considered the question have concluded that a state defendant voluntary removal of a private suit to federal court does not by itself waive the state general immunity from such a suit.see stroud mcintosh,cir we do not understand lapides to require the state to forfeit an affirmative defense to liability simply because it changes forums.bergemann,at rhode island sovereign immunity defense is equally as robust in both the state and federal court.consequently,there is nothing unfair about allowing the state to raise its immunity defense in the federal court after having removed the action.simply put,removal did not change the level of the playing field.lombardo.dep t of pub.welfare,cir we hold that while voluntary removal waives a state eleventh amendment immunity from suit in a federal forum,the removing state retains all defenses it would have enjoyed had the matter been litigated in state court,including immunity from liability.meyers ex rel.benzing texas,cir w hen texas removed this case to federal court it voluntarily invoked the jurisdiction of the federal courts and waived its eleventh amendment immunity from suit in federal court.whether texas has retained a separate immunity from liability is an issue that must be decided according to that state law.citation omitted stewart,at north carolina had not consented to suit in its own courts for the relevant claims therefore,by removing the case to federal court and then invoking sovereign immunity,north carolina did not seek to regain immunity that it had abandoned previously.instead,north carolina merely sought to have the sovereign immunity issue resolved by a federal court rather than a state court.citations omitted watters washington metro.transit,holding that an entity created by compact,which enjoyed immunity from suit to enforce attorney liens in the compactors own courts,did not waive that immunity by removal to federal court.
the foregoing cases,while emphasizing different points in justifying their arrival at a common result,concur in the altogether reasonable proposition that,where a state defendant has not waived its underlying state sovereign immunity,where it is arguably protected from private suit in its own courts as well as in federal fora,the state may avail itself of removal to the federal court without sacrificing this immunity,notwithstanding that by removing it gives up entitlement to eleventh amendment immunity from suit in a federal forum.
plaintiffs contend that their position is nonetheless supported by decisions of the seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits,and ask us to follow them.see bd.of regents of the of.phoenix int l software,cir embury king,cir estes.dep t of,cir.plaintiffs argue that these cases hold that a state voluntary participation in federal court litigation constitutes a waiver of the state general sovereign immunity.this is a misreading of the law of the relevant circuits,all of which adhere to the generally accepted proposition that a state defendant removal of an action to federal court waives the state objection,based on the eleventh amendment,to the exercise of federal jurisdiction,but do not subscribe to the proposition advocated by plaintiffs that by such removal the defendants also waive the state general sovereign immunity.
in the seventh circuit case,board of regents of the university of wisconsin system,at,a wisconsin state university instituted an action in federal district court alleging that the defendant infringed its trademark the defendant counterclaimed alleging that the state university was the infringer.the state university asserted its eleventh amendment immunity to bar the counterclaims in the federal
