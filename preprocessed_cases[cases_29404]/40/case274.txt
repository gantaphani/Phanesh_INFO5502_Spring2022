massachusetts officials appeal from an injunction against a massachusetts statute establishing differential methods by which wineries distribute wines in massachusetts.laws ch.the district court enjoined enforcement of on the ground that the law discriminates against interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause of the united states constitution.see family winemakers of cal.jenkins,at,order granting summary judgment.
we briefly summarize the basis for the lawsuit,the issues presented,and our resolution of them before turning to the supporting analysis.section only allows small wineries,defined by massachusetts as those producing gallons or less of grape wine a year,to obtain a small winery shipping license.this license allows them to sell their wines in massachusetts in three ways by shipping directly to consumers,through wholesaler distribution,and through retail distribution.all of massachusetts wineries are small wineries.some wineries also meet this definition.
wines from small massachusetts wineries compete with wines from large wineries,which massachusetts has defined as those producing more than gallons of grape wine annually.these large wineries must choose between relying upon wholesalers to distribute their wines or applying for a large winery shipping license to sell directly to massachusetts consumers.they can not,by law,use both methods to sell their wines in massachusetts,and they can not sell wines directly to retailers under either option.no large wineries are located inside massachusetts.
plaintiffs,a group of california winemakers and massachusetts residents,assert was designed with the purpose,and has the effect,of advantaging massachusetts wineries to the detriment of those wineries that produce percent of the country wine,in violation of the commerce clause.massachusetts defends on the basis that its law has neither a discriminatory purpose nor a discriminatory effect.massachusetts has not argued in its briefs that there are no legitimate alternative methods of regulation to serve asserted purposes.massachusetts also argues that under the amendment,state laws are immunized from commerce clause scrutiny unless the laws discriminate on their face.
the primary question before us is whether unconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce in light of both the commerce clause art.i,cl,and of the amendment 
it is clear that of the amendment does not protect state alcohol laws that explicitly favor over interests from invalidation under the commerce clause.granholm heald,d.but is neutral on its face it does not,by its terms,allow only massachusetts wineries to distribute their wines through a combination of direct shipping,wholesaler distribution,and retail sales.section instead uses a very particular gallonage cap to confer this benefit upon small as opposed to large wineries.
we hold that violates the commerce clause because the effect of its particular gallonage cap is to change the competitive balance between and wineries in a way that benefits massachusetts wineries and significantly burdens competitors.massachusetts has used its gallon grape wine cap to expand the distribution options available to small wineries,including all massachusetts wineries,but not to similarly situated large wineries,all of which are outside massachusetts.the advantages afforded to small wineries by these expanded distribution options bear little relation to the market challenges caused by the relative sizes of the wineries.section statutory context,legislative history,and other factors also yield the unavoidable conclusion that this discrimination was purposeful.nor does serve any legitimate local purpose that can not be furthered by a alternative.
we further hold that the amendment can not save from invalidation under the commerce clause.section of the amendment does not exempt or otherwise immunize facially neutral but discriminatory state alcohol laws like from scrutiny under the commerce clause.we affirm the grant of injunctive relief.
we engage in de novo review both because the district court entered summary judgment and because the issues presented are ones of law.there is no disagreement on the material facts.see.c see also sullivan city of springfield,cir.
the ratification of the amendment ended prohibition and gave states substantial control over the regulation of alcoholic beverages.most states,including massachusetts,then imposed a system to control the sale of alcoholic beverages within their territories.the hallmark of the system is a rigid,tightly regulated separation between producers,wholesalers,and retailers of alcoholic beverages.producers can ordinarily sell alcoholic beverages only to licensed wholesalers.laws ch,and.wholesalers then must obtain licenses to sell to retailers.id.retailers,which include stores,taverns,restaurants,and bars,must in turn obtain licenses to sell to consumers or to serve alcohol on their premises.id.recently,as to wine,massachusetts has adjusted the separation between these three tiers,as we describe below.
the structure of the usual system is commonly described as an hourglass,with wholesalers at the constriction point.there are thousands of producers nationwide,a handful of licensed massachusetts wholesalers,and approximately ten thousand licensed retailers in massachusetts.see commonwealth of massachusetts alcoholic beverages control commission,licensing.
the system has had a particularly pronounced effect on wineries access to the massachusetts market.the economic incentives created by the system,in conjunction with the structure of the wine industry,severely limited certain wineries ability to sell their wines in massachusetts.
in,the year was enacted,registered wineries in the united states produced a total of gallons of wine,which includes both grape wine and fruit wine production.almost all of the country wine production and sales come from a small number of wineries.in,the five largest wineries in the produced approximately percent of the country wine.the country thirty largest wineries comprised approximately percent of the market,and each produced between and million gallons per year.the rest of the commercial wineries which produce between one and gallons per for percent of the market share.finally,wineries produced less than one gallon of wine per year and had virtually zero percent of the market share 
the concentration of wine production among the largest producers is driven by another feature of the wine industry there are,broadly speaking,two categories of wine,wines and,boutique wines.the largest wineries produce millions of gallons of wine per year because they have generally specialized in the former,but not to the exclusion of the latter.wineries smaller than the largest producers have tended to specialize in boutique wines,which can be produced with a relatively small quantity of grapes and a much lower initial outlay of resources.at least until the current recession,consumer demand for boutique wines had grown exponentially,fueling a rise in the number of smaller wineries which include many wineries producing more than gallons annually.fed.trade comm n,possible anticompetitive barriers to wine,available at.gov os winereport.pdf hereinafter ftc report.
under massachusetts former system,all wineries could only distribute their wines through licensed massachusetts wholesalers,and percent of the wine sold in massachusetts went through five wholesalers.this gave wholesalers,not wineries,the balance of the bargaining power.wholesalers do not necessarily distribute a winery entire range of wines they often distribute the wines most likely to be profitable to them,which are,wines.wholesalers make profits by selling wines to retailers at a markup.the more a wine sells out at retail,generating more requests for restocking,the more money a wholesaler makes.wholesalers also face fixed costs that do not depend on the price they pay to the winery for the wine they bear the costs of transportation,storage,and handling.for these reasons,wineries producing,wines,whatever the gallonage output of the winery,are less profitable and less likely to attract wholesaler distribution.
the largest wineries,as the major producers of,wines,have been best able to attract wholesalers.only the country fifty to one hundred largest wineries have consistently secured wholesaler representation.for most smaller wineries of whatever gallonage,which produce mostly boutique wines,obtaining wholesaler representation has been difficult,if not impossible.and even if a smaller winery obtained wholesaler representation,wholesalers were likely to distribute only one or two of its wines,limiting massachusetts consumers access to particular wines.
wineries have heralded direct shipping as a supplemental avenue of distribution because of its economic advantages,especially for wineries that do not rank among the fifty to one hundred largest producers.direct shipping lets consumers directly order wines from the winery,with access to their full range of wines,not just those a wholesaler is willing to distribute.direct shipping also avoids added steps in the distribution chain,eliminating wholesaler and retailer price markups.see ftc report at.
before,massachusetts licensing law,on its face allowed only wineries to obtain licenses to combine distribution methods through wholesalers,retailers,and direct shipping to consumers.laws ch.five months after granholm invalidated similar facially discriminatory state laws,was held to be invalid under the commerce clause.stonington vineyards jenkins,slip op.at.
in,the massachusetts legislature enacted over romney veto.section does not distinguish on its face between and wineries eligibility for direct shipping licenses,but instead distinguishes between small or large wineries through the gallon cap.
during floor debates,sponsor summed up as follows w ith the limitations that we are suggesting in the legislation,we are really still giving an inherent advantage indirectly to the local wineries.likewise,the state senator whose district included massachusetts winery explained his qualified support for by stating that the agricultural industry here in massachusetts is really strong and should be preserved.and we do this because we produce these specialty goods,orchards and wineries.the senator had another the winery in question,which primarily produced fruit wine,comes close to the gallon production limit for small wineries and would likely soon exceed it because it a winery that is growing and certainly uses wholesalers in other states.the senator urged modifications to because we should be promoting this kind of industry and not adopting regulations,however inadvertently,that might take away the advantage that the winery would have.the draft of was amended shortly thereafter to exempt fruit wine production from the gallon cap,and that version was enacted 
to repeat,all wineries producing over gallons of of which are located outside apply for a large winery shipment license,which allows them to directly sell and ship wine to consumers,but only if the winery has not contracted with or has not been represented by a wholesaler licensed under section for the preceding months.laws ch,a.to the extent a choice is available at all,under a,large wineries can either choose to remain completely within the system and distribute their wines solely through wholesalers,or they can completely opt out of the system and sell their wines in massachusetts exclusively through direct shipping.they can not do both.wholesaler distribution is also the only way large wineries can distribute wines to retailers,including all massachusetts restaurants and bars.to put it differently,large wineries can not distribute directly to consumers except at the cost of giving up distribution to retailers.by contrast,small wineries can simultaneously use the traditional wholesaler distribution method,direct distribution to retailers,and direct shipping to reach consumers.
the practical effects of the distinctions massachusetts has drawn are significant.in,wineries were large under a definition.they produced between and over million gallons per year and accounted for percent of all wine produced in the united states.the thirty largest large wineries represented percent of the national market,while the other large wineries produced between and gallons per year,averaged slightly less than gallons per year,and made up approximately percent of the wine production market in.
there were small wineries in the united states in,as the term small is defined by b.of these wineries,than a less than one gallon per year and had virtually no market share.the remaining small wineries accounted for percent of the total annual wine production in the united states in 
in,there were wineries in massachusetts,all met b s definition of small,and approximately half of these wineries produced fruit wine in addition to or in lieu of traditional wines.each produced between and gallons per year 
ii.whether discriminates against interstate commerce 
the commerce clause prevents states from creating protectionist barriers to interstate trade.see,lewis bt inv.managers,d.discrimination under the commerce clause means differential treatment of and economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter,as opposed to state laws that regulate evenhandedly with only incidental effects on interstate commerce,or.waste,at.internal quotation marks omitted.plaintiffs bear the initial burden of showing discrimination see cherry hill vineyard llc baldacci,cir citing hughes oklahoma,d.
if plaintiffs meet their burden,then a discriminatory law is virtually per se invalid and will survive only if it advances a legitimate local purpose that can not be adequately served by reasonable alternatives.dep t of revenue davis,d citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.the state bears the burden of showing legitimate local purposes and the lack of alternatives,and discriminatory state laws rarely satisfy this exacting standard see camps,town of harrison,d.
we explain in more detail the arguments being made.plaintiffs argue that massachusetts choice of gallons as the demarcation point between small and large wineries,along with the production exception for fruit wine,has both a discriminatory effect and purpose.the discriminatory effect is because definition of large wineries encompasses the wineries which produce percent of all wine in the united states,all of which are located and all of which are deprived of the benefits of combining distribution methods.all wines produced in massachusetts,on the other hand,are from small wineries that can use multiple distribution methods.plaintiffs also say that section is discriminatory in purpose because the gallonage cap particular features,along with legislators statements and process of enactment,show that true purpose was to ensure that massachusetts wineries obtained advantages over their counterparts.plaintiffs also argue that massachusetts can not meet its burden of justifying because the law neither advances the system nor effectively assists small wineries in ways that available alternatives could not.finally,in the alternative,plaintiffs contend that impermissibly burdens interstate commerce under pike even if it is not discriminatory.
massachusetts counters that is not discriminatory in effect because most small wineries are located.it says this proves that disproportionately benefits,not,wineries,especially since there are far more small b wineries in the country than large a ones.massachusetts argues that is not discriminatory in purpose because its aim is to level the economic playing field for all small wineries irrespective of where they are located,and the district court erroneously looked to comments by individual legislators,lobbyists,and intermediate steps in process of enactment to find discriminatory purpose finally,massachusetts says that poses no undue burden on interstate commerce under pike and any such burden is surpassed by the local benefits of greater competition and consumer choice.
we explain below our reasons for rejecting massachusetts arguments.because we hold that discriminates against interstate commerce,it is unnecessary for us to decide whether would also violate the commerce clause under pike.see c a carbone,town of clarkstown,d.
section is discriminatory in effect 
a state law is discriminatory in effect when,in practice,it affects similarly situated entities in a market by imposing disproportionate burdens on interests and conferring advantages upon interests.or.waste,at.defining discrimination see also motors tracy,d a ny notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities.footnote omitted.
one such form of discrimination is plainly when the effect of a state regulation is to cause local goods to constitute a larger share,and goods with an source to constitute a smaller share,of the total sales in the market.exxon governor of maryland,d.state laws that alter conditions of competition to favor interests over competitors in a market have long been subject to invalidation.see,hunt,at.polar ice cream creamery andrews,d baldwin seelig.see also baldacci,at explaining the doctrine houlton citizens coalition town of houlton,cir same.
plaintiffs must present evidence as to why the law discriminates in practice.see baldacci,at here,the totality of the evidence introduced by plaintiffs demonstrates that preferential treatment of small wineries that produce gallons or less of grape wine is discriminatory.its effect is to significantly alter the terms of competition between and wineries to the detriment of the wineries that produce percent of the country wine.
section confers a clear competitive advantage to small wineries,which include all massachusetts wineries,and creates a comparative disadvantage for large wineries,none of which are in massachusetts.small wineries that obtain a b license can use direct shipping to consumers,retailer distribution,and wholesaler distribution simultaneously.combining these distribution methods allows small wineries to sell their full range of wines at maximum efficiency because they serve complementary markets.small wineries that produce wines can continue distributing those wines through wholesaler relationships.they can obtain new markets for all their wines by distributing their wines directly to retailers,including individual bars,restaurants,and stores.they can also use direct shipping to offer their full range of wines directly to massachusetts consumers,resulting in greater overall sales.
combining these methods also lowers small wineries distribution costs because they can choose which method or combination of methods will be most for a particular wine.as the parties briefs highlight,this produces important synergies.small wineries use of retail distribution increases brand recognition and makes wholesaler distribution more likely.direct shipping can similarly increase consumer demand for a particular wine,increasing the prospects for further retail sales and wholesaler distribution.
not surprisingly,massachusetts wineries have taken advantage of these benefits.of massachusetts wineries have obtained small winery licenses in contrast,only of the small wineries producing more than a gallon per year have done so massachusetts wineries have also benefitted from their access to multiple distribution channels in practice.in,the first year was in effect,massachusetts wineries distributed percent of their annual production through wholesalers and percent through retail outlets,including direct shipping.see an economic snapshot of the massachusetts winery industry.
the wineries that qualified as large under a in do not get these advantages and must instead choose between direct shipping and wholesaler distribution.under a,whether a large winery chooses wholesaler distribution or direct shipping,its choice carries a significant loss of potential profits,since using a single method results in a comparative loss of consumer sales.large wineries also face comparatively greater distribution costs because they can not always distribute a given wine through the most method.and they can not take advantage of the synergies that increase the net amount of demand for wines when multiple distribution methods are used together.these amount to considerable competitive disadvantages in an industry that massachusetts own evidence characterizes as one with indisputably slim profit margins and a highly competitive market.
moreover,contrary to massachusetts assertions,does not level the playing field for all wineries unable to obtain consistent wholesaler distribution under the system.section demarcation line between small and large wineries instead creates an especially acute competitive disadvantage for the wineries that are defined as large under a but which in practice face the same difficulties in distributing most of their wines as the small b wineries.massachusetts own evidence shows that only the largest to wineries can distribute most of their wines through wholesalers under the system.the remaining or so large wineries each produce between and gallons per year of a mix of and boutique wines.in,their percentage of the market share for wine production far exceeded that of b small wineries.
these smaller large wineries lose the most under the regime.unlike the largest of the large wineries,which can distribute the vast majority of their wines through existing wholesale distribution,these smaller large wineries can only distribute a handful of their wines through wholesalers.if they choose direct shipping,however,they are forced to terminate their existing wholesaler relationships,which also means that they lose all access to retailers in massachusetts.since this is a crucial way for a winery to build consumer awareness for the brand in massachusetts,its unavailability means that these wineries are not able to compete on the same footing as b small wineries.importantly,these are also the wineries that would otherwise be most competitive in the market for boutique wines their size affords them otherwise considerable advantages in terms of marketing,volume,transportation,and brand recognition.
the ultimate effect of is to artificially limit the playing field in this market in a way that enables massachusetts wineries to gain market share against their competitors.section b choice of a gallon grape wine production cap helps massachusetts wineries to improve their position in the market.at the same time,a burdens all the larger competitors and impedes their ability to effectively use their natural advantages 
massachusetts argues that there can be no discrimination because the favored small winery group created by b is almost entirely comprised of wineries.massachusetts claims this means that whatever the burden on wineries under a,b does not create an benefit,since massachusetts small wineries are made no better off than their counterparts.without evidence of benefits,massachusetts concludes,the supreme court decision in exxon dictates that we find no discriminatory effect.
massachusetts argument ignores the effect of its statute.section b benefit to eligible small wineries can not be viewed separately from the much greater disadvantages that a imposes on wineries.massachusetts wineries uniquely receive a net competitive gain under,while the law impairs wineries competitive position.it deprives large especially those large wineries that have trouble obtaining wholesale the competitive advantages of specialization and production.these disadvantages exceed the benefits that small wineries receive.
exxon does not support massachusetts argument.exxon held that a law that restricts a market consisting entirely of interests is not discriminatory because there is no local market to benefit.at.exxon is not apposite where,as here,there is an market and the law operates to its competitive benefit.massachusetts can not apply exxon only to large wineries as distinct from small wineries the wine market is a single although differentiated market,and two provisions operate on that market together.
likewise,the fact that b benefits both and some small wineries does not prove that is.we have previously rejected the notion that a favored group must be entirely for a law to have a discriminatory effect on commerce,reasoning that when a law burdened a group whose members were entirely and benefitted a class whose members were largely but not wholly located,it was still impermissibly discriminatory in effect see walgreen rullan,cir.
section is discriminatory in purpose 
we further hold that conferred a competitive advantage upon massachusetts wineries by design.
in alliance of auto.mfrs.gwadosky,cir,we discussed the methodology for determining legislative purpose when a state statute is allegedly motivated by an intent to discriminate against interstate commerce.under that methodology,we look to the statute as a whole,id.at,including statutory text,context,and legislative history,but we also consider whether the statute was closely tailored to achieve the legislative purpose the state asserted id.at.
that discriminates against wineries in its effects strengthens the inference that the statute was discriminatory by design.l ess deference to legislative judgment is due where the local regulation bears disproportionately on residents and businesses.id.at second and third alterations in original quoting kassel consol.freightways,d plurality opinion see also regan,the supreme court and state protectionism making sense of the dormant commerce clause,suggesting that the commerce clause is particularly concerned with deliberate discrimination,and that previous supreme court cases invalidating state statutes involved discriminatory effects in combination with,and as evidence of,discriminatory purpose sullivan gunther,constitutional law ed.
as to statutory context,is a new addition to a provision that covers an array of alcohol licensing rules while generally includes licensing rules for producers that are typical of the system,is one of a number of recently appended subsections that sets out special exceptions to that system for particular entities.see.laws.ch,licenses id.licenses licenses.many of these subsections were enacted for the express purpose of assisting massachusetts domestic industries,including but not limited to,facially discriminatory and unconstitutional predecessor though contains no stated statutory purpose,its placement in a licensing law that grants exceptions to the system for the predominant purpose of benefitting local industry is pertinent evidence of discriminatory intent.based on statements made by various massachusetts legislators,it is also clear that massachusetts intended to benefit its local wine industry,and that it did so in particular ways whose effects on wineries could easily be foreseen.
the gap between massachusetts professed neutrality and practical effects also underscores the conclusion of discriminatory purpose.see hunt,at.observing that the disparity between a law asserted ends and its means was somewhat suspect and evidenced a likely discriminatory purpose.
massachusetts has asserted various purposes behind to facilitate direct shipment,to further the system,to make all small wineries,irrespective of their location,better able to compete,and to thereby provide massachusetts consumers with greater choice.the gallon cap and the fruit wine exception,massachusetts claimed at oral argument,reflected the legislature rational assessment of the kind of wineries that needed special assistance because they were suffering from the limitations of the system.but these general aims stand in stark contrast to specific and highly irregular features.
the wine industry and federal law have developed definitions of small,medium,and large wineries in order to describe the way the industry produces and distributes wines and,in the case of federal law,to offer small wineries regulatory benefits.these definitions do not,of course,bind states to particular regulatory choices.but their lack of correlation to belies massachusetts claim that features reflected an objective choice to remedy the purported competitive disadvantage faced uniquely by wineries producing gallons or less of grape wine.that is particularly true given that this gallonage cap counts wineries as small even if they produce more than gallons of wine when fruit wine production is counted.see kassel,at.questioning the legitimacy of the iowa legislature motives in enacting a statute that banned vehicles longer than feet from using iowa roads,when all other states in the west and midwest had a limit and the iowa statute had a number of significant and irregular exceptions hunt,at.finding a north carolina law discriminatory in effect and,impliedly,in purpose when its requirements prevented washington from using its and labeling system,which had become the industry standard.
according to uncontested evidence in the record,the wine industry considers wineries that produce gallons per year or less small.medium wineries produce between and gallons annually,and large wineries produce more than gallons per year.the industry apparently does not differentiate between wineries that produce fruit as opposed to grape wine relative size is the critical factor.the federal trade commission largely adopted these definitions when it surveyed conditions of competition in the wine industry.see ftc report at.
nor,according to testimony from industry figures,does massachusetts gallon demarcation point between small and large wineries correspond to the ability of the winery to obtain wholesaler representation.to the contrary,this choice prevents,smaller large wineries from competing on equal terms with massachusetts small wineries even though these wineries faced similar difficulties in obtaining wholesaler distribution under the system.
massachusetts claim at oral argument that its definition of small wineries targets those wineries in need of competitive assistance also diverges considerably from the definitions the federal government and other states have developed for this same broad purpose.as we have said,there is no relationship to those wineries who are able or unable to obtain wholesalers.beyond that,as a matter of federal tax policy,wineries producing gallons or less of any type of wine,and not merely wineries that produce less than gallons of grape wine per year,are deemed small wineries in need of competitive assistance in the form of a substantial tax break.see alcohol tobacco tax trade bureau,dep t of the treasury,ttb compliance seminar for bonded wine premises,available at http www.ttb.gov pdf compliance seminar.pdf hereinafter ttb compliance seminar no other state has defined a small wine producer and attached the same consequences to this definition as massachusetts has and no other state counts gallonage by excluding all fruit wine production wine in these other states means wines made from any fruit or other agricultural product.see.ann.ann.stat.ann.ohio ann.section definition of a small winery does not even correspond to the way massachusetts previously classified wineries by size for the purpose of calculating a licensing fee 
section unusual regulatory features do track one thing precisely the unique attributes of massachusetts own wine industry all of massachusetts wineries are eligible for small winery licenses.all fall neatly within the gallon cap,producing between gallons and gallons annually.and the record massachusetts does not legislators were well aware of these figures.
the fact that this gallonage cap excludes wines made from fruits other than grapes,no matter how many gallons a winery produces per year,is particularly probative.in past years,massachusetts largest winery produced more than gallons of wine annually because between half and of its production came from apple wines.the main effect of the fruit wine exception was to guarantee that this winery,like all other massachusetts wineries,could take advantage of b beneficial distribution rules for small wineries.massachusetts has offered no other explanation for the fruit wine exception,and there is no obvious reason why it would serve ostensible purposes.this exception,like similar,facially neutral statutory exemptions apparently motivated by a desire to shield interests,weaken s the presumption in favor of the validity of the general provision,because it undermine s the assumption that the state own political processes will act as a check on local regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce.raymond motor,rice,d.
we conclude that altered the competitive balance to favor massachusetts wineries and disfavor competition by design 
lack of legitimate local purpose and availability of reasonable alternatives 
because plaintiffs have shown that discriminates against interstate commerce,massachusetts bears the heavy burden of showing that the statute is nonetheless constitutional because it serves a legitimate local purpose that can not be attained through reasonable alternatives.dep t of revenue.at.the state can only carry this burden by presenting concrete record evidence,and not sweeping assertion s or mere speculation,to substantiate its claims that the discriminatory aspects of its challenged policy are necessary to achieve its asserted objectives.granholm,at.see also chem.waste,at.massachusetts has not even attempted to do so here because the constitutionality of a state statute is involved,we nonetheless consider the issue.
the record shows that at least one viable alternative existed when was under consideration the model direct shipment bill,which the national conference of state legislatures adopted in.the model bill does not define small or large wineries or regulate access to licenses depending on winery size.as an alternative to,romney proposed a version of the model bill which would have allowed all wineries to ship directly to consumers,sell to retailers,and distribute through wholesalers.but the state legislature rejected this proposal and overrode his veto.
plaintiffs argue that this alternative would have helped small wineries without undercutting the system because it included limitations on the total volume wineries could ship to consumers.whatever the merits of this proposal,massachusetts has never claimed it would be unworkable.under similar circumstances,the supreme court has,as a rule,struck down the discriminatory state law in question.see granholm,at.camps,at.
iii.whether the amendment immunizes facially neutral alcohol statutes from commerce clause scrutiny 
we now consider whether,as massachusetts asserts,the amendment protects from invalidation,notwithstanding the fact that it discriminates against interstate commerce in purpose and effect.
whether the amendment granted states the authority to enact even facially neutral but discriminatory alcohol laws that would otherwise violate the commerce clause was not decided by granholm and the answer is not readily apparent from the text of the amendment.granholm holds the interpretation of this amendment instead turns on historical context.section of the amendment granted the states the authority to regulate liquor only to the extent that they had done so before prohibition under two federal laws the wilson act of and the act of see granholm,at.
the supreme court held in granholm that through these acts,congress gave the states newfound powers to regulate alcohol that came within their borders,even if it had traveled in interstate commerce.the wilson act did this by allowing states to restrict or prohibit the sale of alcohol to the same extent and in the same manner as alcohol that was produced.at.quoting internal quotation marks omitted.the act expanded states regulatory authority by expressly authorizing states to regulate alcohol that traveled in interstate commerce even if it was being shipped solely for consumers personal use.id.at.these acts did not,however,exempt states from the commerce clause existing prohibitions on state laws that discriminated against goods and favored local interests.id.at.
the precise question in granholm was what effect,if any,the amendment has upon facially discriminatory state alcohol laws that would otherwise be subject to invalidation under the commerce clause.at.the question of whether the amendment protects facially neutral laws like was not before the court.
massachusetts now contends that the amendment protects facially neutral laws from invalidation under the commerce clause,even if they discriminate in purpose or effect,because it says such laws are distinguishable from facially discriminatory laws for the purposes of the amendment.in the alternative,massachusetts asserted at oral argument that the amendment should lessen commerce clause scrutiny of such laws to mere rational basis review 
we reject these arguments.based on our analysis of historical sources,we conclude that the wilson and acts did not protect facially neutral state liquor laws from invalidation under the commerce clause if they were discriminatory to hold otherwise,we would have to find that these acts not only recognized the difference between facially discriminatory and facially neutral but discriminatory state laws,but also affirmatively intended to protect the latter and not the former.all evidence points to the contrary.
by the time the wilson act became law in,it was well established that under the commerce clause,facially neutral state statutes that had a discriminatory effect on interests constituted impermissible discrimination,just as facially discriminatory state laws did.
the supreme court had decided two major discriminatory effects commerce clause cases just before the wilson act passed.in robbins taxing dist.of shelby county,the court had invalidated a facially neutral state tax on drummers,individuals who drummed up sales by displaying samples,because,inter alia,the tax disproportionately disadvantaged merchants and manufacturers.id.at.and in minnesota barber,the supreme court had invalidated a minnesota statute that required inspection of all meat before it could be sold within the state.id.at.its reasoning cut broadly although this statute is not avowedly or in its terms directed against the bringing into minnesota of the products of other states,this was the statute necessary effect.id.
in a separate line of cases,the supreme court had also indicated that a state asserted rationale for a statute would be viewed with skepticism if other evidence,including the statute effects,pointed strongly to a discriminatory purpose.i f the state,under the guise of exerting its police powers,should make such exclusion or prohibition applicable solely to articles,of that kind,that may be produced or manufactured in other states,the court stated as early as,the courts would find no difficulty in holding such legislation to be in conflict with the constitution of the united states.guy city of baltimore.see also austin tennessee.suggesting that ostensibly neutral laws that were intentionally applied in a discriminatory manner were invalid in the commerce clause context.
when drafting the wilson and acts,congress was presumably aware that these types of facially neutral but discriminatory state laws were subject to invalidation under the commerce clause.see edelman lynchburg,d see also star steel thomas,d.yet congress made no reference to the notion that the wilson and acts would permit states to enact liquor laws with a discriminatory effect or motive.although congress may authorize the states to engage in regulation that the commerce clause would otherwise forbid,courts can exempt state statutes from the implied limitations of the clause only when the congressional direction to do so has been unmistakably clear.maine taylor,d internal quotation marks omitted.the wilson and acts do evince an unmistakably clear intention to permit states to regulate alcohol which traveled in interstate commerce the same way as they regulated alcohol but the two acts can not be construed to authorize anything more.
supreme court decisions and legal scholarship of the era confirm this interpretation.scott donald,involved a challenge to a state law that gave the state liquor commissioner control over all state sales of alcohol and included two other provisions that explicitly disfavored manufacturers.id.at.the court compared the facts to other commerce clause cases,including various discriminatory effects cases involving goods other than alcohol,implying that alcohol regulation was not a unique category for the purposes of the rule.id.at.the court ultimate holding was that the wilson act was not intended to confer upon any state the power to discriminate injuriously against
