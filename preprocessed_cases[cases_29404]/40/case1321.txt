the municipal association of south carolina masc filed an action in the district court seeking a declaration that south carolina municipalities are entitled to assess municipal business license taxes based on,or measured by,the total flood insurance premiums collected in the particular municipality by insurance companies under an arrangement with the federal emergency management agency fema.the insurance companies moved for summary judgment on grounds of preemption and sovereign immunity,but the district court denied the motions.because we find that the taxes imposed by the south carolina municipalities contravene the principles of sovereign immunity,we reverse the decision of the district court.
a.the parties 
masc is a organization and its membership consists of almost all the municipalities in the state of south carolina.on behalf of of its,masc administers the insurance tax collection program itcp through which it imposes and collects business license taxes from insurance companies that conduct business within the participating municipalities.with one exception,the tax amount for each insurance company is two percent of the gross premiums received by the insurance company in the prior calendar year in a particular municipality 
the four appellants in this consolidated appeal are hartford fire insurance company hartford,nationwide mutual fire insurance,service insurance company,and usaa general indemnity company.appellants are insurance companies that write and sell insurance policies in south carolina.of particular relevance to this appeal,under an arrangement with fema,appellants offer and collect premiums on standard flood insurance policies sfips pursuant to the national flood insurance program the nfip.
b.the nfip purpose and framework 
the nfip was created by the national flood insurance act of,nfia,in part to make federally subsidized flood insurance available in areas,studio frames standard fire ins,cir,and reduce the burden on the nation for unforeseen disaster relief,a e.prior to its enactment,flood insurance was generally unavailable from private insurance companies as those companies were unwilling to underwrite and bear flood risks due to the catastrophic nature of floods.b,reprinted in.to the extent possible,the nfip is designed to pay operating expenses and flood insurance claims with premiums collected on flood insurance policies rather than with tax dollars.studio frames,at quotation marks and citation omitted.
because premiums are subsidized,the nfip is not,and can not accumulate sufficient reserves to cover catastrophic flood losses.id.at.the nfip relies on a statutory line of credit at the treasury to pay claims arising from catastrophic losses.id.nonetheless,the nfip providence has reduced the amount of flood disaster relief needed from the federal government.id.
the nfia provides two alternative avenues for implementing the nfip a privately operated flood insurance program with federal assistance part a or a federally operated program with private insurers assistance part b.see.prior to,the nfip was implemented under part a as a private industry program with federal assistance.flick liberty mut.fire ins,cir.under this implementation,the federal government incorporated a private insurance pool called the national flood insurer association,which marketed,issued,serviced,and handled claims adjustments of flood insurance policies.in re estate of lee,cir.the federal government role was to prescribe the requirements for insurance companies participation in the pool,to compensate insurance companies for policies in which the premiums were set below established rates,and to provide reinsurance to cover flood losses that exceeded the insurance risk assumed by the industry pool.
since,the nfip has been implemented under part b as a federally operated program with private insurers assistance flick,at.under part b,the director of fema is authorized to execute the nfip through the facilities of the federal government,utilizing either 
insurance companies and other insurers,insurance agents and brokers,and insurance adjustment organizations,as fiscal agents of the united states,
such other officers and employees of any executive agency as the administrator and the head of any such agency may from time to time,agree upon,on a reimbursement or other basis,or 
both the alternatives specified in paragraphs and.
a.from to,all federal flood insurance policies under the nfip were issued directly by the federal government.flick,at.in,however,fema promulgated regulations establishing the write your own wyo program,which enabled fema to use participating private insurance companies wyo companies to provide,under their own names as insurers,flood insurance policies sfips to the public.id.approximately percent of flood insurance policies under the nfip are written through the wyo program dep t of homeland security,privacy impact assessment for the national flood insurance programs appeals procedure,http.
c.the wyo arrangement 
in,by promulgated regulations,fema established the standardized terms of the arrangement between fema and wyo companies the arrangement.financial arrangement,codified at pt,app.a see a fema has authority to issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purpose of the nfip.the arrangement is essentially a contract between fema and private insurance companies.see pt,app.fema sets the terms of the arrangement and has the sole authority to amend it.see id.when it amends the terms of the arrangement,however,fema considers comments from private insurance companies and other participants in the nfip.see.july,addressing and amending the arrangement based on comments raised by two wyo companies.
fema codified the policy forms for the sfips and the forms can not be altered,varied,or waived other than by the express written consent of the federal insurance administrator.a,d.fema establishes the terms and conditions of the sfips offered to customers.fema issues written manuals specifying how wyo companies must handle flood insurance premiums,and settle,pay,or defend flood claims.pt,app.
fema sets guidelines for companies that choose to participate in,and to remain in the wyo program.for instance,the arrangement requires that wyo companies must be licensed under the state laws in which they practice.pt,app.a,art.ii d.as is relevant to this appeal,under south carolina law,to be a licensed insurer one must pay all taxes and perform all duties required by law.ann.c.in addition to south carolina license fees and taxes on insurers,see ann,south carolina municipalities may also levy license fees or taxes,see ann.
under the arrangement,when a wyo company collects flood premiums,it is required to remit the premiums,less expenses as explained below,to fema for deposit in the national flood insurance fund in the treasury.pt,app.a,arts.ii e,vii b.because the arrangement forbids comingling of funds,if the wyo company receives premiums in cash or check,it deposits the cash or check into a restricted account it maintains on behalf of the federal government restricted account.see pt,app.a,arts.ii e,iii e.where the customer pays the premium by credit card,however,the payments are made directly to the treasury via a website established by the federal government.wyo companies pay flood insurance claims from monies in the restricted account,or from their operating accounts and then are subsequently reimbursed from the restricted account.to the extent the amount in the restricted account is insufficient to cover the claims,the wyo company draws upon a letter of credit from fema to meet the expenditures.id.arts.ii e,iv a,vii a.
wyo companies are liable for operating,administrative and production expenses 
including any state premium taxes,dividends,agents commissions or any other expense of whatever nature incurred by the company in the performance of its obligations under this arrangement but excluding other taxes or fees,such as surcharges on flood insurance premium and guaranty fund assessments.
id.art.iii a emphasis added.thus,the arrangement permits wyo companies to retain a scheduled amount as reimbursement for these expenses expense allowance.id.art.iii b.though the expense allowance fluctuates yearly,on average it is percent of the wyo company written premiums.see id.once the claims,expense allowance,and any additional reimbursement a wyo company may be entitled to have been deducted,the wyo company must remit any balance in the restricted account in excess of to fema.see pt,app.a,art.vii b appellants br.at.appellants contend that they profit only when their actual administrative expenses in connection with the nfip are less than the expense allowance.
d.the omaha property decision and the fema memorandum 
in,masc filed an action in state court against a wyo company,omaha property and casualty insurance opci,to collect approximately in unpaid municipal taxes and penalties for and.opci removed the action to the district court for the district of south carolina.municipal ass of omaha prop.cas.ins,cv.thereafter,masc filed a motion for partial summary judgment,and opci filed a motion for summary judgment.opci argued that any taxes based upon flood insurance premiums were impermissible taxes on the federal government and were preempted.the district court disagreed and denied opci motion.opci moved for reconsideration,but before a final disposition of the action,the parties settled and the action was dismissed.opci subsequently dropped out of the wyo program in south carolina.
following the district court decision in omaha property,fema issued a memorandum fema memo directing wyo companies not to pay the tax imposed by south carolina municipalities.the fema memo states,premiums collected as payment for coverage under the sfips are federal dollars,and as such,are not subject to state or local taxation.it explains that fema consented to a single exception to this legal principle by agreeing to voluntarily pay state premium taxes on nfip premiums in recognition of the service provided by state insurance departments in overseeing the solvency and conduct of wyo companies,as well as the conduct and qualifications of agents and adjusters who work on behalf of the nfip.the fema memo expounds that in carving out this exception,fema did not invalidate the federal government exemption from any taxes or assessments levied by any other level of government.quoting language from the arrangement,the fema memo concludes that because the wyo companies are fiscal agents of the federal government,they are not liable for or authorized to pay any taxes and assessments levied on federal flood insurance premiums not provided for under the arrangement.
since the fema memo,wyo companies doing business in south carolina have varied in their treatment of the municipal tax some willingly pay the tax,some pay under protest,and others simply refuse to pay the tax.appellants fall in the latter two groups.
district court proceedings 
masc filed this action in the district court seeking a declaration that south carolina municipalities are entitled to impose and collect municipal taxes from appellants.in response,appellants raised several affirmative defenses and then moved to dismiss the declaratory judgment action on grounds that fema was a necessary and indispensable party under federal rule of civil procedure b that could not be joined because of its sovereign immunity.the district court agreed that fema was a necessary party,but held that the court could proceed in good faith without fema,so it denied the motion to dismiss.
subsequently,appellants moved for summary judgment asserting defenses of federal preemption and sovereign immunity.masc also moved for partial summary judgment that the defense of preemption did not apply.the district court agreed with masc,granted masc motion for partial summary judgment and denied appellants motion for summary judgment.thereafter,appellants moved the district court to certify this matter for interlocutory appeal,and the district court granted the certification.we accepted the appeal,and thus,we have jurisdiction pursuant to b.
appellants raise three issues on appeal.first,they argue that fema regulations,the arrangement,and the fema memo instruct them not to pay the municipal tax,and thus,federal law preempts the tax.second,they argue in the alternative,even if federal law did not preempt the tax,in their operation of the wyo program,appellants are fiscal agents of the federal government,and the municipal tax is an impermissible,tax on the federal government and federal property,in violation of federal sovereign immunity.third,appellants contend rule b required the dismissal of these actions for failure to join fema because masc real dispute is with fema,appellants are merely fema fiscal agents,and fema sovereign immunity precludes it from being compelled to join these actions.we resolve this appeal by applying the basic tenets of sovereign immunity.thus,we need not reach the preemption issue and the question of fema indispensability is moot.
we review the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment de novo.okoli city of,cir.issues pertaining to sovereign immunity are questions of law which we review de novo.see wildlife fed limehouse,cir citing franks ross,cir.
it is well established that,pursuant to the supremacy clause of the constitution,the federal government has absolute immunity from state regulation,including taxation.mayo united states.mcculloch maryland,wheat.this immunity from tax applies when the levy falls on the federal government itself,its property,or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the government that the two can not realistically be viewed as separate entities,at least insofar as the activity being taxed is concerned.united states new mexico,d see also van brocklin tennessee.it lies within congressional power to authorize regulation,including taxation,by the state.mayo,at see united states city of detroit,d.in the absence of congressional consent,a state or local tax on the federal government,its property,or its instrumentality is invalid.city of detroit,at.
these tax immunity principles present three questions in this appeal whether the flood insurance premiums collected by wyo companies are federal property wyo companies,in their participation in and operation of the wyo program,are instrumentalities of the federal government and the federal government has consented to the municipal tax.we discuss each issue in turn.
we first consider whether the flood insurance premiums are federal property.we have previously stated,premiums collected on policies written by wyo companies do not belong to those companies.battle seibels bruce ins,cir citing newton capital assurance,cir.instead,the premiums belong to the federal government,and absent the federal government consent,these funds may not be taxed.
masc contends otherwise,and roots its contention in the fact that the premiums pass through the wyo companies.masc argues that the premiums are not federal funds until they reach the treasury.this argument is untenable for several reasons.
first,the nfia states that premiums collected under part b by facilities of the federal government are credits to the national flood insurance fund.a,b,b.the nfia further states that those funds are available for all purposes,including paying claims and applicable operating costs.d.the nfia allows such payments to be made in advance or by way of reimbursement.it is of no moment that wyo companies collect the premiums or that the premiums are held in a restricted account prior to remittance to the treasury.
additionally,the regulations refer to the premiums as federal funds and make no distinction as to the ownership of the premiums based on whether the wyo companies retain or use the funds,or remit them to the federal government.in the recitals section of the arrangement,the contract contemplates that participating private insurance companies act in a fiduciary capacity utilizing federal funds to sell and administer the sfips.pt,app.a,art.i emphasis added.in article ii,the arrangement requires wyo companies to separate federal flood insurance funds from all other company accounts,at a bank or banks of its choosing for the collection,retention and disbursement of federal funds relatin
