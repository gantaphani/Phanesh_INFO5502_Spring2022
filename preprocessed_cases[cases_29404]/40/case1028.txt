maurice duhaney petitions for review of the april,decision by the board of immigration appeals bia,finding duhaney removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony under immigration and nationality act ina section a a iii,a a iii.this order of removal was based on a conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,which duhaney contends the government could have raised as a ground for removal during prior immigration proceedings.having failed to charge him as deportable based on this conviction during the prior proceedings,he argues that the government should have been precluded from doing so in subsequent proceedings.duhaney also argues that the bia committed procedural error and deprived him of the right to present arguments on his own behalf.for the reasons set forth below,we will deny the petition.
duhaney was born in jamaica on november.in,at the age of seven,he was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident and has resided in the united states ever since.on september,a jury convicted duhaney of manslaughter in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,based on the fatal shooting of vincent santiago,the shooting convictions.the jury acquitted duhaney of murder in the second degree and manslaughter in the first degree.duhaney was sentenced to consecutive terms of five to fifteen years for each conviction.while duhaney was awaiting trial for these charges,he was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance with the intent to sell.on october,duhaney pled guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance the controlled substance conviction.he was sentenced to one to three years in prison.based on these three convictions,duhaney remained incarcerated until.
on june,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued an order to show cause the otsc charging duhaney as deportable pursuant to former ina section a,u.a,based on the controlled substance conviction.administrative record.the otsc did not mention the shooting convictions.id.in response to the otsc,duhaney submitted a form requesting a waiver of deportation pursuant to former ina section c in september.in his application for a c waiver,duhaney disclosed all three convictions.
in august,an immigration judge ij held a hearing on duhaney request for a c waiver.the ij asked the ins attorney about the firearms conviction,and the ins attorney stated his belief that the since the otsc was issued before march,the firearms conviction could not be used as a basis for deportability.the ins attorney further noted,i do think we ever charge him,judge,but the possibility exists that it could be charged in the future.i would hope that the service does do that.the ij commented he would leave that for another day,although he expressed real reservations about whether the service could do that,as the issue presented a res judicata question.id.the ij accepted the ins attorney representation that these other convictions did not render him statutorily ineligible for a c waiver.id.in the oral decision granting duhaney request for a waiver,the ij first noted that duhaney had admitted the allegations in the otsc and conceded that he was deportable.the ij discussed both the substance abuse conviction cited in the otsc and the shooting convictions,noting that the manslaughter conviction amounted to a crime involving moral turpitude.citing in re wojtkow,bia.the government elected not to appeal,and these first deportation proceedings were terminated on august.
on march,duhaney pled guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree the conviction.on march,the government issued a notice to appear nta charging that the conviction rendered him removable on two grounds as a conviction for a crime relating to a controlled substance under ina section a b i,a b i and as a conviction of an aggravated felony under ina section a a iii,a a iii,which is defined to include a drug trafficking crime under ina section a b,a b the nta.in october,an ij ordered duhaney removed based on the conviction.in january,the bia affirmed this removal order,making it the final agency determination the removal order or the removal proceedings.
on august,the new york supreme court vacated the conviction and dismissed the indictment with prejudice.thereafter,duhaney filed a pro se motion with the bia to reopen and terminate the removal proceedings the bia received the motion on december.on december,the government also moved to reopen the removal proceedings.the government motion acknowledged that duhaney was no longer removable based on the conviction,but the motion stated the government belief that duhaney may be removable on the basis of other,separate and distinct criminal convictions.the government requested that the bia remand this matter to the immigration court so that it may reopen and terminate the aforementioned removal proceedings and rescind the aforementioned order of removal.id.the government motion also included the following caveat all of the foregoing without prejudice against the initiation of any new removal proceedings,so that may prepare and file a new nta against the respondent.id.
duhaney claims that he did not receive the government motion.throughout this time period,duhaney was in the government custody.on november,the government transferred duhaney from a detention facility in new york to a correctional center in pennsylvania.duhaney motion included a cover letter listing his address as the pennsylvania facility,but the bia filing receipt lists his address as the new york facility.the government served its motion by sending it via first class mail to the new york facility.
on january,the bia granted the parties motions to reopen and remanded the matter to the immigration court for further proceedings.on march,the government filed a form,lodging additional charges of removability against duhaney the form.specifically,the form charged duhaney with removability pursuant to ina section a c,a c,based on his conviction for a firearms offense ina section a a ii,a a ii,based on his convictions for two crimes of moral turpitude and ina section a a iii,a a iii,based on his conviction for an aggravated felony.the form detailed his manslaughter,firearms possession,and sale of a controlled substance convictions reported that his conviction had been vacated and acknowledged that he had been granted a c waiver based on an application that listed all three convictions.
in response,duhaney filed a motion to terminate the removal proceedings.duhaney argued,inter alia,that dhs failed to provide him notice of its motion to reopen,that the bia erred by remanding the case to the ij rather than simply terminating the removal proceedings,and that the government was barred by collateral estoppel and res judicata from charging grounds of removability that it could have charged during the prior proceedings that were closed in and.
on november,the ij denied duhaney motion to terminate.the ij noted that collateral estoppel and res judicata apply generally to immigration proceedings,but that neither doctrine precluded dhs from alleging new grounds for removability in this case.the ij concluded that u nder the ina as it was applied when duhaney was granted a waiver under section c,the former ins could not have charged him with removal as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,because the aggravated felony provisions of the immigration act of did not apply retroactively until the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of was enacted.based on this material intervening change in the governing law,the ij found that neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel would bar dhs prosecution of removal proceedings based on his weapon conviction.the ij also determined that duhaney c waiver applied only to the basis for removability alleged at that time,and not to a basis for conviction of an aggravated did not even exist at the time.
on december,the ij ordered duhaney removed to jamaica based on the three grounds added by the form.duhaney appealed the ij decision,and on april,the bia affirmed the removal order.the bia rejected duhaney arguments that it erred by remanding the case to the ij,that duhaney due process rights were violated by his failure to receive notice of the government motion,and that collateral estoppel and res judicata barred the government from adding charges that it could have charged before.on may,duhaney filed this timely petition for review.
we have jurisdiction over this petition under a.since duhaney was found removable based on his conviction for an aggravated felony,we review only the legal and constitutional issues raised.a c d see caroleo gonzales,cir we have jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review from a final order of the bia.we exercise de novo review over these issues.see caroleo,at citing kamara att y,cir.
as a threshold matter,duhaney argues that the bia erred by remanding his case to the ij rather than simply reopening the proceedings for the sole purpose of terminating the order of removal.he argues that the bia disregarded its own established precedent by remanding the case,and that he was deprived of the right to oppose remand because the government failed to provide proper notice.
duhaney first contends that the bia erred by remanding rather than terminating his case upon the vacatur of his conviction,relying on johnson ashcroft,cir johnson cir.in that case,the court of appeals for the second circuit noted that the bia,as a matter of practice,routinely reopens and terminates proceedings of this kind without remanding for further inquiry before an ij.id.citing in re,bia in re gutnick,bia.the court also noted that,since the government did not intend to introduce any previously unavailable evidence on remand,the board own precedents clearly mandated that the government motion to remand be denied.id.citing wang ashcroft,cir in re coelho,bia.the court concluded that,w hile the board is free to modify its precedents in a reasoned fashion,it acts arbitrarily and unlawfully when it simply ignores established holdings.id.at citing ke zhen zhao dep t of justice,cir johnson ashcroft,cir johnson cir.
we have recognized that an administrative agency acts arbitrarily if it departs from its established precedents without announcing a principled reason for the departure.johnson cir,at citations and quotation marks omitted.we disagree,however,that the bia disregarded established precedent by remanding these proceedings to the ij.we do not view any of the cases cited in johnson cir.as establishing that the bia established precedent is to terminate removal proceedings without remand to the ij.while the bia terminated removal proceedings without first remanding to an ij in both,at,and gutnick,at,these two examples do not prove that this procedure amounts to the bia established precedent.
if anything,the applicable regulations seem to contemplate the procedure that the bia followed in this case.under d iv,the bia generally will not engage in factfinding in the course of deciding appeals.if factfinding is needed in a particular case,the board may remand the proceeding to the immigration judge id.in coelho,the bia discussed the requirements for a motion to remand,explaining that such motions are not expressly addressed by the ina but have become an accepted part of the agency procedure.at.when a motion to remand also requires reopening closed proceedings,the motion must comply with the requirements for a motion to reopen.id.accordingly,remand is generally only appropriate for consideration of new facts or changed circumstances.wang,at.coelho and wang merely recognize that remand is generally inappropriate without new factual circumstances.
in this case,the vacatur of duhaney conviction presented the bia with new facts to consider,allowing it to grant the parties motions to reopen and to remand to the ij to evaluate the impact of these new facts.once the bia had remanded the case to the ij,bia precedent authorized the ij to consider any and all matters that the ij deem ed appropriate in the exercise of his administrative discretion.in re patel,bia.under these circumstances,the bia did not disregard its established precedent by remanding the case in a way that ultimately permitted the government to lodge additional charges of removability against duhaney.accordingly,the bia did not err in ordering a remand.
duhaney also argues that the government failed to provide notice of its motion to reopen,which it sent to a detention facility in new york after he had been transferred to a correctional center in pennsylvania.in particular,he claims that he was deprived of the opportunity to make arguments on his own behalf and that he suffered prejudice as a result,in violation of his right to due process.see fadiga att y,cir where an alien claims a denial of due process because he was prevented from making his case to the bia or the ij,he must show that he was prevented from reasonably presenting his case and that substantial prejudice resulted.quotation marks,citation,and footnote omitted.we disagree with duhaney claim.
both parties filed motions to reopen the proceedings based on the vacatur of duhaney conviction.government motion,duhaney motion.without hearing any additional arguments from either party,the bia granted the relief sought by both parties.granting motion to reopen because t he respondent and the department of homeland security,in separate motions,ask that we reopen proceedings on the grounds that the criminal conviction underlying the respondent removal order has been vacated.again,both parties sought and received identical relief.we reject duhaney argument that he suffered any type of prejudice under these circumstances.accordingly,the bia did not deprive duhaney of his due process rights.
having addressed duhaney argument that the bia committed procedural error,we turn to his substantive challenges to the removal order.his principal claim is that res judicata precluded the government from adding additional charges to the nta based on convictions that it could have used to support charges of removability during prior immigration proceedings.duhaney argues that two separate proceedings should have preclusive effect the original proceedings,based on the otsc,which terminated with the grant of a c waiver and the proceedings,which he argues should have been terminated when his conviction was vacated.since we have determined that the bia did not err by remanding the proceedings in a way that permitted the government to lodge additional charges of removability,only the first proceeding achieved the finality necessary to invoke res judicata we hold that the government was not precluded from alleging new charges of removability following the vacatur of duhaney conviction.
res judicata,also known as claim preclusion,bars a party from initiating a second suit against the same adversary based on the same cause of action as the first suit.see in re mullarkey,cir.a party seeking to invoke res judicata must establish three elements a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit involving the same parties or their privies and a subsequent suit based on the same cause of action.id.quotation marks omitted.the doctrine of res judicata bars not only claims that were brought in a previous action,but also claims that could have been brought.id.
although the doctrine of res judicata is most frequently applied to final judgments issued by courts,we have also endorsed its application to adjudicative determinations by administrative agencies,including certain immigration decisions.the supreme court has instructed that the doctrines of collateral estoppel as to issues and res judicata as to claims should be applied to those determinations of administrative bodies that have attained finality.astoria fed.sav.loan ass solimino.when an administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity and resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate,the courts have not hesitated to apply res judicata to enforce repose.id.quoting united states utah constr.mining.since the common law principles of collateral estoppel and res judicata are well established,courts may imply that congress has legislated with an expectation that the principle will apply except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.id.at quotation marks omitted.
applying this framework,we have held that common law preclusion doctrines apply to adjudicative agency determinations under the ina,as long as application of these doctrines does not frustrate congressional intent or impede the effective functioning of the agency.duvall att y,cir.in duvall,we explained that these preclusion doctrines apply to all proceedings that may be deemed adjudicative,no matter whether the governing entity is a court or an agency.id.at.we further explained that t he adversarial system of dispute resolution established in the ina is plainly adjudicatory in character and susceptible to full application of common law principles of preclusion.id.since r equiring the ins to meet its burden of proof at a single hearing is consistent with the statutory scheme,as interpreted by the administrative agency,and will not frustrate the goals of congress,the lenient presumption in favor of administrative estoppel holds,and the ina will be held to incorporate common law principles of collateral estoppel.id.citing in re federenko,bia and quoting astoria,at.
the parties in this case do not dispute the general proposition that res judicata may be applied to adjudicative proceedings under the ina the question is whether res judicata precluded the government from lodging new charges of removability under these particular circumstances.as previously noted,res judicata only applies to a second proceeding based on the same cause of action as the first.the challenge in this case,as in many res judicata cases,is defining the relevant cause of action.
we have disavowed attempts to create a simple test for determining what constitutes a cause of action for res judicata purposes.lubrizol exxon,cir quotation marks omitted.rather,we look toward the essential similarity of the underlying events giving rise to the various legal claims.id.quoting davis steel supply,cir en banc.our approach reflects the present trend of requiring that a plaintiff present in one suit all the claims for relief that he may have arising out of the same transaction or occurrence.id.quoting united states athlone,cir.under this transactional approach,the focus of the inquiry is whether the acts complained of were the same,whether the material facts alleged in each suit were the same,and whether the witnesses and documentation required to prove such allegations were the same.id.quoting athlone,at.a mere difference in theory is not dispositive.id.
duhaney proposes that the relevant transaction for res judicata purposes in removal proceedings is the alien removability.duhaney br.he contends that w hether the alien is removable on the basis of criminal offenses is essentially a single transaction certainly,the issue of an alien removability on the basis of multiple convictions form a convenient trial unit and conforms to the parties expectations.id.the government proposes that in the removal context,the relevant transaction should be defined as the factual occurrence or conviction upon which a charge of removability is based.att y br.
we conclude that the government approach to defining the relevant cause of action is more faithful to our res judicata precedent and the equitable principles underlying the doctrine,to say nothing of congressional intent.in this case,the government secured a removal order against duhaney based on criminal convictions for which it had not previously charged duhaney as removable.although there are common elements of fact between the two removal proceedings,the critical acts and the necessary documentation were different for the two proceedings.accordingly,we hold that the doctrine of res judicata did not bar the government from lodging additional charges of removability after duhaney conviction was vacated.
the court of appeals for the second circuit has applied a similar transactional approach to defining the relevant cause of action.channer dhs,cir.in channer,the petitioner was convicted of state and federal crimes arising out of two separate incidents a federal charge of carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking crime and state charges of robbery in the first degree and conspiracy to commit robbery.the ins initially charged him as removable based solely on the federal conviction,which it contended amounted to both an aggravated felony and a removable firearms offense under the ina.after an ij had entered an order of removal,however,the petitioner federal conviction was vacated,and,based on the ins motion,his removal was terminated.the ins then initiated new removal proceedings against him,charging him as removable based on his state convictions,which amounted to aggravated felonies under the ina.the petitioner argued that this second proceeding was barred by res judicata,but the bia and the court of appeals for the second circuit held that the second proceeding involved a different cause of action from the first.id.at.the court in channer reasoned that the two proceedings did not originate from the same nucleus of operative fact.the factual predicates produced two distinct convictions based on different charges.id.at.the court continued that w hile the remedy for each claim is for committing an aggravated contrasting evidence required to prove each claim and the different elements of each crime demonstrate that they do not form a convenient trial unit.id.the court rejected channer claim that res judicata should apply because the facts essential to the second suit existed and were known to the complaining party at the time of the first,reasoning that each deportation proceeding stemmed from a separate transaction and each required different proof.id.the court concluded that res judicata did not bar the government from lodging new charges of removability based on a different predicate conviction.
in gonzales,cir,by contrast,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit determined that elementary fairness required the opposite result.id.at.in that case,the government first sought to deport based on a conviction for robbery and a conviction for burglary.the ij found him deportable but granted him relief under former ina c,c,at.the government sought to deport him for a second time in,based on a conviction for petty theft that,due to his prior offenses,amounted to an aggravated felony.id.the ij found removable,but while his petition for review was pending,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that petty theft did not amount to an aggravated felony it therefore remanded bravo petition to the bia.id.a few days later,the government filed new charges of removability against him,alleging that his three prior convictions were crimes of moral turpitude.id.the ij upheld the charges,but the court of appeals granted petition for review,concluding that res judicata barred the government from relitigating removability based on these three prior convictions.id.at.the court held that the government was barred by res judicata from initiating a second deportation case on the basis of a charge that it could have brought in the first case,when,due to a change of law that occurred during the course of the first case,it lost the first case.id.at.the court rejected the government argument that res judicata should be applied flexibly in this context,explaining that the agency own regulations provided an opportunity to add charges during the pendency of immigration proceedings,but not after a proceeding had concluded.id.at emphasis in original.the government had abundant opportunity to add these charges to the prior proceedings,the court determined,and having neglected this opportunity,it could not avoid the application of the general principles of res judicata.id.at.
the court concluded that elementary fairness supported the petitioner res judicata defense,but it did not address whether the second proceedings involved the same cause of action as the first.we are not persuaded that principles of fairness necessarily support application of res judicata in the circumsta
