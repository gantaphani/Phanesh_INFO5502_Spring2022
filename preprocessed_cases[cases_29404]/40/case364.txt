robert urciuoli and frances driscoll,defendants in the district court and now appellants,served respectively as ceo and senior vice president of rhode island roger williams medical center rwmc.its subsidiaries included roger williams hospital a nursing home known as elmhurst extended care facilities and roger williams realty,which an assisted living facility called the village at elmhurst the village.during a legislative battle in which rwmc had an interest,the two executives became acquainted with rhode island state senator john celona.
in rhode island citizen legislature,legislators serve,are modestly paid and ordinarily have other jobs.celona operated a lawnmower business.the lawnmower business ran into trouble,and during or just after the legislative battle affecting rwmc celona approached urciuoli about obtaining employment at rwmc.ultimately,in february,celona signed a contract,disclosed in public filings,that purported to employ him as a consultant to the village.
thereafter celona did engage in some work on behalf of the village,making some referrals and highlighting the facility on his television program.but celona also engaged in certain other activities between his hire in and the termination of the employment in early.these activities,the subject of later criminal proceedings and this appeal,can be divided into three categories.
celona communicated with urciuoli and driscoll about various pieces of legislation defendants allegedly asked celona to try to kill certain bills and otherwise to promote rwmc interests with respect to pending legislative matters 
celona lobbied a number of municipal officials mayors and fire chiefs in order to increase the number of patients brought to roger williams hospital by ambulance service rescue runs and 
celona facilitated meetings at his government office between urciuoli and representatives of two major insurance companies,pressing the parties to resolve longstanding disputes about reimbursements owed to rwmc.
celona did not disclose in any of these instances that he was acting on behalf of rwmc or its hospital.that alleged connection came to light after other,unrelated corruption charges involving celona emerged.
urciuoli,driscoll,peter sangermano the manager of the village and rwmc itself were thereafter indicted in the federal district court in rhode island on counts of conspiracy to commit honest services mail fraud and various counts of such mail fraud.in substance,the government claimed that the executives had devised a scheme beginning in,and ending in,to offer celona a disguised bribe in the form of a sham or largely sham job at one of rwmc subsidiaries in exchange,the government claimed,celona advanced rwmc financial interests by exploiting his public office in the three ways described above.
celona pled guilty to mail fraud based in part on the conduct alleged.rwmc made its own plea bargain.the three remaining individual defendants went to trial.each faced the conspiracy count and one or more mail fraud counts based on the premise of a single fraudulent scheme to deprive rhode island citizens of the honest services of celona individual mail fraud counts designated particular mailings as carrying out the scheme.urciuoli was charged in most of these counts driscoll,who had left rwmc in and had nothing to do with the insurance phase of the case,was charged only in the conspiracy count and one of the substantive counts.
at trial,the prosecution contended that celona employment by the village was a sham.it offered evidence that celona work for the village was minimal given his ample salary per week at the start,and eventually as much as per week that he reported to urciuoli and driscoll rather than to village management that his salary was covered by rwmc rather than the village and that his limited work for the village decreased over the years.celona was,on the prosecution theory,being paid by rwmc for his influence on legislation,his lobbying of the mayors,and his pressuring of the insurance companies.
after deliberating for seven days,the jury found urciuoli guilty on one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud,and on counts of mail fraud,id,driscoll was convicted of a single count of mail fraud,on the theory that she aided and abetted urciuoli.sangermano was acquitted.urciuoli was sentenced to months in jail driscoll to months in jail and in home confinement.we stayed execution of the sentences pending these appeals.
the cloak of office instruction.on appeal,defendants do not dispute that the evidence was adequate to convict them of honest services mail fraud so far as the convictions may have rested on bribing celona to influence legislation but they say that the jury instructions wrongly allowed for conviction based on celona lobbying of mayors and his meetings with insurance companies,conduct that they claim does not constitute a federal crime.
this instruction issue,which we review de novo,united states woodward,cir,cert.denied,d,turns on how broadly the statute should be read as to functions other than the enacting of legislation closely related is the question whether the specific episodes in question the lobbying of mayors and the insurance activities fall within the statute,also a legal issue open to de novo review.united states sawyer,cir sawyer i.defendants did not seek a directed verdict as to these episodes,presumably because the indictment did not assign the disputed conduct to distinct counts but bundled it into a single overall scheme along with the alleged buying of celona influence on legislation.
the federal mail fraud statute,is built upon a single,archaic sentence which,reduced to its essence,makes it unlawful to use the mails in relation to any scheme or artifice to defraud.the statute has undergone repeated periods of rapid expansion and contraction.coffee,modern mail fraud the restoration of the distinction.its application to political misconduct and corruption,as opposed to ordinary private fraud,bank fraud,commercial scams,has been especially fraught 
notably,after the supreme court held the statute inapplicable to cases of political corruption that involve no loss of money or tangible property,mcnally united states,d,congress overturned this construction by enacting section the new provision,passed with scant legislative history,defined the term scheme or artifice to defraud to include a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.see sawyer i,at.prosecutors have sought to sweep much abusive political conduct within this proscription in a number of cases courts have been more guarded.
the central problem is that the concept of honest services is vague and undefined by the statute.so,as one moves beyond core misconduct covered by the statute,taking a bribe for a legislative vote,difficult questions arise in giving coherent content to the phrase through judicial glosses.closely related concerns are assuring fair notice to those governed by the statute,see bouie city of columbia,d,and cabining the serious crime with severe it embrace every kind of legal or ethical abuse remotely connected to the holding of a governmental position.sawyer i,at statute does not encompass every instance of official misconduct that results in the official personal gain see also united states mcneive,cir.
this court has wrestled with the statute in a number of cases.we have held that the obligations it imposes attach not only to formal official action like votes but also the informal exercise of influence on bills by a legislator,united states potter,cir,and that it prohibits short of formal bribes,united states sawyer,nn.cir sawyer ii but our decisions also rejected a claim that the statute was violated merely by unlawful gratuities to a legislator,sawyer i,at,or by an irs employee who accessed confidential computerized tax files for his own amusement and in violation of ordinary confidentiality restrictions,united states czubinski,cir.although one might prefer a more clearly drafted statute,the supreme court has regularly used judicial glosses to clarify and focus language in criminal statutes of even greater complexity and breadth,reves ernst young,d rico.
the issue immediately before us concerns celona acceptance of undisclosed payments for two sets of activities.in the first,he contacted mayors and other local officials urging them to comply with rhode island law governing patient entitlement to be taken by ambulance to the hospital of the patient choice.apparently under rhode island law celona could have done this openly for pay but he did not disclose the private payment,he used official stationery for some of his communications,and those dealing with him knew he was a senator and had little reason to be aware of his private connection to rwmc itself.
in the second,celona played a extent is summoning to meetings officials of blue shield,which was at odds with rwmc on certain payment issues,and in urging them to come to terms.some of the meetings were held on legislative premises,celona was then head of a senate committee responsible for health legislation,and there was evidence that at one point celona told a blue cross lobbyist that unless rwmc is treated fairly,blue cross wo get treated fairly.blue cross was not told that celona was being paid by rwmc.a second insurer,united health,was similarly summoned but it came to terms with rwmc after only one meeting with celona and a follow up contact by him.
urciuoli effectively sought to rule both sets of episodes out of the case by asking the court to instruct the jury as follows that to deprive rhode island citizens of celona honest services the object of the scheme had to be performance of 
his legislative duties,scheduling hearings,assigning bills to the hearing calendar and subsequent executive sessions,advocating bills at executive sessions,guiding and taking other action to advance bills through the committee,and voting on legislation.
this proposed language,read in light of the examples given,comes close to restricting the statute to the enacting of legislation alone.
although working and voting on legislation is the main official activity of a legislator and our earlier decisions refer to it constantly,it is not the only official function as to which honest service was owed by celona as a senator.for example,a committee chair could hire incompetent assistants in exchange for kickbacks or divert public funds entrusted to him.assuming other elements were present,scienter,use of the mails,an honest services offense could be made out in those scenarios.so the proffered instruction was too narrow and was properly not given.united states prigmore,cir.
the related and stronger claim is that,over defense objection,the court instructed the jury that the statute extended not only to formal exercises of official power like voting but also to any actions done under the cloak of office.the cloak of office phrase is not inherently a novel or objectionable way of describing purportedly official action but in this setting it permitted the jury readily to consider as potentially criminal conduct both celona approach of the mayors and his facilitation of the insurance meetings if either set of activities was outside the reach of the statute,then the convictions are suspect.
we conclude for the reasons given below that the ambulance run advocacy with the mayors can not qualify as a deprivation of the honest services owed to the public.unlike most conduct typically the subject of the case law,urging local officials to obey state law is not easily described as a deprivation of honest services,actually or potentially harmful to the citizens of rhode island unobvious harms are,for example,if celona was pressing on mayors a dishonest interpretation of the law or false the government has not made such an argument and the instructions given did not impose such a limitation.
nor was celona advocacy something for which payment would be inherently improper because it biased his judgment in making an official decision on a matter before example,a bribe for a vote or a kickback for hiring an employee.under rhode island law,apparently celona as a legislator could have been openly paid by rwmc to advocate with local officials.there is a state statute that prohibits government officials from accepting outside employment impairing independence of judgment,laws,but this apparently is not taken to restrict legislators from private employment involving contact with courts or agencies.
the government says that a legislator informal duties commonly extend to representing constituents with local officials and engaging in oversight functions and so to this extent should be regarded as official but celona conduct falls in a borderland where analogies can easily be drawn both to public and private conduct and there is no indication that celona invoked any purported oversight authority or threatened to use official powers in support of his advocacy.the government says the mayors can be affected by state legislation,but it did not show by context or threat that celona sought deliberately to exploit this leverage.
certainly his title and possibly improper use of senate letterhead assured him access and attention,sawyer i,at but his position guaranteed that in any event and its invisible force would have existed even if he emphasized that he was present solely as a paid advocate.indeed,even the legitimate work that celona performed on behalf of the village traded in part on the reputation,network and influence that comes with political office.that much is an unavoidable result of rhode island decision to retain a system of government in which legislators hold outside employment without very stringent restrictions.
there is not very much direct precedent but in united states rabbitt,cir,cert.denied,d,the eighth circuit rejected a mail fraud count based on kickbacks paid to a state house speaker for merely recommending to other state officials,over whom the speaker had no authority,an architectural firm for work on state projects.rabbitt was perhaps a close case but the explicit kickback scheme there involved was markedly more abusive than urging local mayors or fire chiefs to comply with state law.in all events,whether or not rabbitt is correct,we think the rescue run lobbying of mayors was not a crime even if the facts are taken most favorably to the government.
by contrast,celona conduct vis a vis the insurers was closely related to his official functions including legislation.in march,celona told driscoll that a proposed bill requiring payment of insurance reimbursements was being held up to see if a private resolution could be managed.when the dispute between rwmc and blue cross over bill payments developed in and,celona had become chair of a senate committee with considerable power over health care legislation,and both blue cross and united were regularly concerned with matters affected by the committee.here,there is evidence that urciuoli and celona sought to exploit this connection to the legislative process.
at urciuoli behest,celona became involved with negotiations between rwmc and the insurers,and he did so confessedly to bring pressure on the latter to settle on terms favorable to rwmc.as already recounted,the government offered evidence that celona in a meeting with urciuoli and a blue cross lobbyist delivered a barely veiled warning of potential legislative trouble to blue cross if it did not settle.when celona later told urciuoli that he had put considerable pressure on the lobbyist,urciuoli replied approvingly that he deserved to be cranked around.
in addition,celona held two negotiating sessions in his state house office,one in and the other in,which included urciuoli and the blue cross ceo.in these meetings celona could be seen as a committee chair hoping to resolve amicably a matter that might otherwise require legislation.the blue cross ceo testified at trial that without a compromise he expected that a political solution would be thrust down our throats simply to save rwmc.urciuoli urges that the government has cobbled together unrelated incidents occurring over a period of several years but the jury could easily view them as a deliberate scheme.
some of the evidence was disputed,including the alleged veiled threat and the extent of celona
