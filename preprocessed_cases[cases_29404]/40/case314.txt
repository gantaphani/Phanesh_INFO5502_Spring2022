residents of three public housing complexes brought a civil rights suit under against the mayor of barceloneta,puerto rico,protesting the precipitous seizures and cruel killings of their pet cats and dogs.the twenty named plaintiff families assert violations of their fourth amendment rights to be free from unreasonable seizures of their effects and their fourteenth amendment procedural and substantive due process rights.
the pets were taken in two successive raids,within ten days of the municipality of barceloneta assuming control of the public housing complexes from the puerto rico public housing administration prpha on october.plaintiffs allege that before that transfer,they had been permitted to have their pets.only a few days before the raids,the residents were told to surrender their pets on pain of being evicted from their homes.they allege that after many of the pets were seized,the pets were killed by slamming them into the sides of vans and by hurling the survivors off a bridge.some plaintiffs eventually found their family pets dead under the bridge.
the mayor,in his personal capacity,moved to dismiss all damages claims against him on grounds of qualified immunity.that motion was denied the mayor has taken an interlocutory appeal.this court denied the mayor motion to stay proceedings in the district court.we are informed that discovery is being completed and that the case is nearly ready for trial.
we affirm the denial of the mayor motion for qualified immunity on the fourth amendment and fourteenth amendment procedural due process claims.applying the supreme court new decision in ashcroft iqbal,d,we reverse the denial of qualified immunity to the mayor as to the plaintiffs fourteenth amendment substantive due process claims and order those claims dismissed.we also revise our prior circuit law on the steps to follow in the qualified immunity analysis in light of superceding supreme court precedent.
on interlocutory appeal from the denial of qualified immunity through a motion to dismiss,we must take all the factual allegations in the complaint as true.iqbal.at.yet we need not accept as true legal conclusions from the complaint or naked assertion s devoid of further factual enhancement.id.at alteration in original quoting bell atl.twombly,d.
the municipality assumed operational control over three public housing complexes in barceloneta from the prpha on october.between october and,the municipality delivered notices to residents of those complexes that it would be enforcing a pet policy,which prohibited the residents from having cats or dogs.the notices threatened eviction for those who did not surrender their pets and included an copy of the pet policy,but not a version.the residents of those complexes are predominantly spanish speakers.plaintiffs allege that few speak,read,or write english.before the municipality took control of the housing complexes,residents had kept pets with the knowledge and consent of the housing complexes administrators,and there was no enforced prohibition on the ownership of a cat or dog.
on october,without any further notice to the residents,uniformed municipal employees and workers from animal control solutions,acs,a private contractor hired by the municipality,arrived at the three public housing complexes and violently captured numerous pet cats and dogs.they went and demanded that the residents give up their pets or face eviction.many people complied.some residents who were not home at the time had their pets taken from inside their enclosed patios and laundry areas.municipal employees and acs workers also captured several pets that were in the common areas of the housing project,even taking pets away from children.the mayor and other high ranking municipal officials were present that day at least at one of the housing complexes while the animals were seized.
once the pets were captured,municipal employees and acs workers injected some of the animals with an unknown substance.they also slammed the animals against the side of a van,causing some witnesses to believe that their pets had been killed in their presence.those animals surviving the initial trauma were then thrown to their deaths off a bridge,known as el paseo de indio the indian walk.some residents eventually found their pets dead underneath the bridge.
similar raids occurred two days later at each of the three housing complexes,also resulting in the cruel killings of the residents animals.there is no claim that the defendant mayor was present at these raids.the residents protested.on october,the municipality resigned its position as the administrator of the public housing complexes in barceloneta.
on october,the residents sued the mayor and other municipal officials under,claiming violations of their rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments,as well as under other federal and state laws that are not involved in this appeal.the complaint sought,inter alia,punitive damages and compensatory damages of at least for the value of each pet and for the harm inflicted on each plaintiff,as well as injunctive and declaratory relief.
on april,the mayor moved to dismiss all the damage claims against him,asserting qualified immunity.on july,the district court issued an opinion and order denying the mayor qualified immunity on the plaintiffs fourth and fourteenth amendment claims this interlocutory appeal from the district court denial of qualified immunity followed.
appellate jurisdiction over denials of qualified immunity 
an order rejecting a public official qualified immunity defense is immediately appealable as a final judgment within the meaning of to the extent that it turns on an issue of law.iqbal.at t his court has been careful to say that a district court order rejecting qualified immunity at the stage of a proceeding is a final decision within the meaning of.behrens pelletier,d bergeron cabral,cir.that is,when the district court assumes a set of facts favorable to the plaintiff and decides as a matter of law that those facts do not form a satisfactory basis for a finding of qualified immunity,an interlocutory appeal is available under the collateral order doctrine.bergeron,at.
here,we have jurisdiction to consider the mayor legal argument that the plaintiffs have not stated cognizable constitutional violations,accepting the facts alleged in the complaint as true.we also have jurisdiction to decide whether the constitutional rights that the mayor allegedly violated were clearly established at the time.but we do not at this stage in the litigation have jurisdiction to decide whether any constitutional violations actually occurred or to resolve any factual disputes necessary to make that determination.
assessing qualified immunity at the motion to dismiss stage requires that we evaluate the sufficiency of the plaintiffs pleadings.indeed,because whether a particular complaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of law can not be decided in isolation from the facts pleaded,iqbal,at,we must scrutinize the plaintiffs complaint to determine whether it states a plausible entitlement to relief.
two underlying principles guide our assessment of the adequacy of the plaintiffs pleadings.first,the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,supported by mere conclusory statements,do not suffice.id.at citing twombly,at.such conclusory statements are not entitled to the assumption of truth.id.
second,only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.id.citing twombly,at.this second principle recognizes that the court assessment of the pleadings is,requiring the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.id.w here the facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct,the complaint has it has not show n that the pleader is entitled to relief.id.second alteration in original quoting.a.
b.the qualified immunity doctrine 
the qualified immunity doctrine provides defendant public officials an immunity from suit and not a mere defense to liability.mitchell forsyth,d.for this reason,immunity is to be resolved at the earliest possible stage in litigation.hunter bryant,d.in some cases,the doctrine ensures that insubstantial claims against government officials will be resolved before discovery.anderson creighton,d.indeed,t he basic thrust of the qualified immunity doctrine is to free officials from the concerns of litigation,including avoidance of disruptive discovery.iqbal,at quoting siegert gilley,d kennedy,concurring in judgment.
qualified immunity a analysis 
the supreme court most recent rulings on qualified immunity provide clarification on several points and require some revision of the nomenclature and steps this circuit has previously used.
in pearson callahan,d,the court reiterated that the qualified immunity inquiry is a test.a court must decide whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right and if so,whether the right was clearly established at the time of the defendant alleged violation.id.at.the supreme court has often described the analysis as a test.see,id.at scott harris,d brosseau haugen,d per curiam chavez martinez,d saucier katz,d,overruled in part by pearson,d.
it is clear from the supreme court description of the second,clearly established step of the qualified immunity analysis that the second step,in turn,has two aspects.one aspect of the analysis focuses on the clarity of the law at the time of the alleged civil rights violation.to overcome qualified immunity,t he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson,at.the other aspect focuses more concretely on the facts of the particular case and whether a reasonable defendant would have understood that his conduct violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights.indeed,i t is important to emphasize that this inquiry must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.brosseau,at.quoting saucier,at.cognizant of both the contours of the allegedly infringed right and the particular facts of the case,t he relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at.quoting saucier,at.internal quotation marks omitted.that is,the salient question is whether the state of the law at the time of the alleged violation gave the defendant fair warning that his particular conduct was unconstitutional.see hope pelzer,d.
in administering the court test,this circuit has tended to list separately the two of the clearly established prong along with the first prong and,as a result,has articulated the qualified immunity test as a test.see,bergeron,at estate of bennett wainwright,cir parker gerrish,cir philip cronin,cir.while the substance of our test has been faithful to the substance of the court test,we owe fidelity to the court articulation of the test as well.and so we now adopt the court test and abandon our previous usage of a analysis.
this we can do without invoking an en banc court given the intervention of the supreme court decision in pearson.see wallace reno,cir when a panel of this circuit has decided an issue,another panel will ordinarily not revisit that issue but,of course,this limitation does not apply where an intervening decision of the supreme court overturns or undermines our earlier decision.
it is permissible to avoid the first step of the qualified immunity analysis 
pearson also held that while it is frequently appropriate for courts to answer each step in turn,it is not mandatory that courts follow the analysis sequentially.courts have discretion to decide whether,on the facts of a particular case,it is worthwhile to address first whether the facts alleged make out a violation of a constitutional right.
as pearson explained,the primary motivation behind saucier sequential rule was to promote the development of constitutional precedent.at.of course,there may be instances where a discussion of why the relevant facts do not violate clearly established law make s it apparent that in fact the relevant facts do not make out a constitutional violation at all,id.at,making it worthwhile to address the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis.
but in some cases,discussion of the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis will result in a substantial expenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult questions that have no effect on the outcome of the case.id.this expenditure of resources by the courts and the parties is difficult to justify in cases where the constitutional questions presented are heavily,minimizing their precedential value.id.at.
further,the utility of bypassing the first prong is particularly apparent w hen qualified immunity is asserted at the pleading stage because the precise factual basis for the plaintiff claim or claims may be hard to identify.id.indeed,as this circuit has held,and pearson recognized,where the answer to the first prong of the immunity question may depend on the further development of the facts,it may be wise to avoid the first step.see id.citing buchanan maine,cir.the mayor here has chosen not to wait,but to press the fourth amendment and fourteenth amendment issues at the pleadings stage,and then to appeal,in part,the denial of qualified immunity on the pleadings.
application of qualified immunity analysis to the fourth amendment claim 
the mayor argues that the complaint fails to state a cognizable constitutional claim under the fourth amendment because that amendment does not provide protection to individuals in their ownership of household pets under these circumstances.the first part of the mayor argument is essentially that taking plaintiffs assertions in the complaint as true,the complaint still fails to state a fourth amendment claim.
an individual interest in his pet cat or dog does fall within the fourth amendment prohibition of unreasonable seizures,though we have not addressed the question before.as the fourth circuit decision in altman city of high point,cir,establishes,privately owned pet dogs do qualify as property,such that pets are effects under the seizure clause of the fourth amendment id.at.we rely on and do not repeat judge luttig scholarly analysis that dogs are effects for purposes of being secure from unreasonable seizure under the fourth amendment.
the killing of a person pet dog or cat by the government without the person consent is also a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment.three other circuits had announced this conclusion well before the violations alleged here.see brown muhlenberg,cir fuller vines,cir,overruled on other grounds by robinson solano county,cir lesher reed,cir.since then,the seventh circuit has also held that the killing of a companion dog is a fourth amendment seizure.see viilo eyre,cir.no circuit court has held otherwise.
we reject the mayor argument that this law was not clearly established because this court had not earlier addressed the questions of effects and seizure.against the widespread acceptance of these points in the federal circuit courts,the mayor argument fails.these are principles of law,and the law was sufficiently recognized by courts to be clearly established.see wilson layne,d holding that a constitutional right is clearly established if a consensus of persuasive authority exists such that a reasonable officer could not have believed that his actions were lawful bergeron,at.
the mayor underlying argument as to the fourth amendment qualified immunity issue is that,as a matter of law,a court should now hold that a reasonable official in the mayor position would not have thought he was violating the plaintiffs fourth amendment rights,under the second aspect of the clearly established second prong.he reasons that there is a diminished expectation of privacy in pet ownership,and that diminished interest routinely must give way to public safety and health concerns.the mayor argues that the plaintiffs privacy interest in thei
