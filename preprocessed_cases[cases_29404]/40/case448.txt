bisbal is a member of the popular democratic party,or pdp,and is apparently a fairly prominent and one.his brother was a municipal assemblyman from up through the time of the trial in this case.at trial,pérez,another pdp member and the president of the mayagüez municipal assembly,was able to recount which candidates bisbal had supported in numerous elections going back to.
bisbal met pérez at a political event in.bisbal went to work for the city of mayagüez in in the municipal housing department.his position was a transitory one,but his contract was renewed through.in august,pérez,who was the nominating authority for the assembly,nominated bisbal to work for the municipal assembly as office administrator.up to that time,the job had been performed by another person,maría eugenia soto nieto,a permanent employee,but bisbal joined her.bisbal duties included ordering supplies,working on accounting and budgeting,drafting ordinances and resolutions,recording assembly proceedings,serving the assembly members coffee,and delivering notices of the meetings.he earned a salary of per month,which eventually was raised to.bisbal first two employment contracts with the assembly were for a year each,and his third contract was for six months.at the end of,he received a notice that his appointment would terminate at the end of,but nevertheless,he received a renewal at the beginning of.beginning in,his renewals came in or increments.bisbal stated that the change to shorter appointments in was part of a pattern in which basically,they just started to withdraw their trust on me and to sort of move me out of the way and sort of leave me out on the fringes of the municipal assembly.
bisbal testified that the reason his job changed in was that the others in the assembly office became caught up in a campaign for the november,pdp primary.bisbal testified that the mayagüez municipal assembly virtually became the campaign headquarters for charlie hernández,a candidate for representative,and that all those working for the assembly quit doing their official duties and devoted themselves to campaign activities.all,that is,except bisbal,who supported ferdinand lugo,hernández rival.bisbal was the lone lugo supporter in the office.bisbal testified that in this environment,he had nothing to do at work except some small routine things.he felt completely cast aside.significantly,pérez supported hernández.
two weeks after the primary,on november,bisbal received notice that his contract would not be renewed after december.pérez made the decision not to renew the contract and he signed the notice of termination.pérez testified that bisbal was the only employee at the municipal assembly whom pérez knew to be supporting lugo,and bisbal was the only employee who lost his job at this time.bisbal testified that he made a large number of efforts to go in and talk to pérez,but he was never allowed in to see him.the city had budgeted for bisbal position through june.pérez testified,from to i made a lot of movement to get bisbal another position in the municipal government of mayagüez.after the termination of his contract in i did make anymore.
bisbal sued the city,its mayor,and pérez in his official and individual capacities,alleging violation of his first amendment rights under.specifically,he alleged that he had been harassed in the workplace and that his employment had been terminated because of his political allegiance to miguel rodríguez,the opponent of the mayor in the primary 
the defendants moved for summary judgment.the honorable juan held that there were issues of fact precluding judgment in favor of the city and pérez,but that bisbal had produced no evidence that the mayor was involved in any way with the alleged harassment or termination of employment accordingly,judge dismissed the claim against the mayor.
the case against the city and pérez was tried to a jury before the honorable robert ward.the jury returned a verdict against the city and pérez on both the harassment and termination claims it awarded compensatory damages of for of the employment contract and for harassment.it further awarded punitive damages of against pérez in his individual capacity 
the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative,for remittitur or partial new trial,but attacked only the harassment award and the punitive damages,not the award based on termination of employment.before he could rule on the motion,judge ward died.judge ruled the motion in judge ward stead.judge denied the motion for judgment as a matter of law and the motion for new trial,holding that there was sufficient evidence of political persecution and harassment and of deliberate indifference to bisbal constitutional rights.however,he reduced the harassment compensatory damages award from to and the punitive damages from to.
bisbal did not object in the district court to the reduction of the damages,but instead immediately took this appeal,contending that the district court erred in reducing the damage awards.the city,arguing that there was not sufficient evidence to establish that the motivation for depriving bisbal of his duties in november was political retaliation or that the deprivation was the result of a city policy or custom.pérez also,arguing that there was not sufficient evidence to support the award of punitive damages against him.the defendants do not appeal the verdict against them for termination of bisbal employment.
we will take up the first,because the go to the propriety of any award,whereas bisbal appeal concerns the size of award.if the defendants win their,there will be no need to consider bisbal appeal.
the city contends that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law since there was no evidence of political harassment of bisbal in the workplace in november and no evidence to establish municipal liability for harassment.we review de novo the district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.borges colón,cir.in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict,we ask whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,a rational jury could have found in favor of the party that prevailed.gillespie sears,roebuck,cir.
in order to show that he suffered cognizable political harassment by a government employer,bisbal had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was subjected to an unreasonably inferior work environment.ortíz garcía toledo fernández,cir.bisbal must further show by a preponderance of the evidence that his political affiliation was a substantial factor in causing the environment to become inferior.id.the city could still avoid liability by proving that it would have acted the same way regardless of bisbal political affiliation.id.
the standard in this circuit for the degree of mistreatment that is cognizable in a political discrimination case was set by,cir en banc,which held that an employee must prove by clear and convincing evidence that his or her job had been rendered unreasonably inferior to the norm for that position and that the change was of a magnitude that would cause reasonably hardy individuals to compromise their political beliefs and associations in favor of the prevailing party.shortly after was decided,the supreme court decided rutan republican party of illinois,d,which suggested in a footnote that even trivial acts of political discrimination by a government employer would give rise to a constitutional claim.id.at.although we have adverted to uncertainty in how these two standards fit together,we have continued to apply the standard.otero commonwealth of puerto rico indus.com n,cir velazco,cir see,cir.
bisbal evidence is that,whereas he was busy at work before the primary,once the primary campaign started,he had nothing to do at work before that,i always had a lot of work to do,and once the primary started,i was completely cast aside.after the start of the primary campaign,his work day consisted of sitting at his desk,punching his time card in,punching out and doing some small routine things.
the city does not dispute that depriving an employee of all or almost all his work for an indefinite period can be sufficient to establish an unreasonably inferior work environment.see,at utterly depriving an employee of work indefinitely might make out a claim rodríguez,cir holding that such facts were more than a scintilla of evidence,but reserving the question of whether they established unreasonably inferior conditions pierluisi,cir denial of benefits and assignments sufficient to show adverse action.therefore,we will assume that the evidence established an unreasonably inferior work environment.
the city contends that bisbal did not prove that anyone intentionally deprived him of duties instead,the city contends that the evidence showed that once the primary campaign began,the municipal assembly office simply quit doing official work,as all the employees but bisbal were caught up in the political campaign.where the plaintiff is prominent in the opposition to the prevailing faction in a political atmosphere,and is known to the defendant to be so,a jury can infer from these facts plus timing that adverse action is politically motivated.see guillermo rodríguez,cir this circumstantial evidence that the appellant was a conspicuous target could alone create an issue of fact on discriminatory animus.cordero,cir atmosphere,conspicuous target,and reassignment of tasks to members of opponent party aponte,cir.there was evidence that bisbal was actively supporting lugo,that he was to some degree prominent,and that bisbal was the only person in his office that did support lugo.counsel for the city conceded at trial that bisbal may have been a conspicuous target for discrimination.the municipal assembly office definitely had a political atmosphere in november.the timing of the deterioration in bisbal working conditions coincided with the beginning of the primary campaign.this was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to determine that bisbal was deprived of duties to retaliate against his political affiliation.
the city contends that bisbal did not show that the city or pérez were responsible for the harassment.bisbal did not attempt to prove that the harassment was the result of an official policy.bisbal contends that pérez acted as policymaker for the city and that pérez took away his duties in the month leading up to the primary.the city does not dispute that pérez was a policymaker.however,scrutiny of bisbal citations to the record does not reveal any active involvement of pérez in the harassment.bisbal testimony at trial did not identify who was responsible for depriving him of his duties.at first he said,t hey just started to withdraw their trust on me and to sort of move me out of the way and sort of leave me out on the fringes of the municipal assembly.bisbal never said who they were.bisbal later said,each and every one of the people who were working there,except for me,were backing up charlie hernández candidacy bisbal did not testify that pérez witnessed the harassment or that bisbal informed pérez of it.thus,the jury could not find that pérez actively instigated the harassment during the work day.
even in the absence of a positive decision by the municipality or its policymakers,a municipality may be liable under where a custom or practice is so and widespread that the policymaking officials of the municipality can be said to have either actual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the practice.silva worden,cir quoting bordanaro mcleod,cir.the custom or practice must also be the cause and moving force behind the deprivation of constitutional rights.id.the testimony indicates that bisbal was virtually without duties for approximately a month,while the entire assembly office operated as a de facto campaign headquarters.bisbal testified 
roberto pérez colón,who was supporting charlie hernández and all assembly members were all favoring charlie candidacy,and the atmosphere that you could breathe at the municipal assembly was something quite incredible.it was campaigns for charlie all the time,phone calls for charlie,activities for charlie.basically,that was all that was going on at the municipal assembly in mayagüez.
the scope,duration,and openness of this transformation of a government office into a partisan campaign headquarters would allow a jury to have found that pérez,the president of the municipal assembly and a conceded policymaker,had to have known what was happening,yet did nothing to stop it,and that this transformation caused bisbal to be deprived of his duties.we therefore determine that bisbal made a submissible case of municipal liability for the harassment.
pérez in his individual capacity contends that there was insufficient evidence to support an award of punitive damages against him.he specifically does not seek review of the amount of punitive damages,since he contends that no damages at all should have been awarded.the special verdict form did not specify whether the punitive damages were awarded for the termination or for the harassment.
pérez does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the compensatory award on either the termination or harassment theory.the evidence showed that pérez was directly involved in the termination.the evidence did not show pérez direct involvement in the harassment.
under a bsent participation in the challenged conduct,a supervisor can be held liable only if the behavior of his subordinates results in a constitutional violation and the supervisor action or inaction was affirmatively linked to the behavior in the sense that it could be characterized as supervisory encouragement,condonation or acquiescence or gross negligence of the supervisor amounting to deliberate indifference.deliberate indifference will be found only if it would be manifest to any reasonable official that his conduct was very likely to violate an individual constitutional rights.the affirmative link requirement contemplates proof that the supervisor conduct led inexorably to the constitutional violation.
hegarty somerset county,cir internal citations,quotation marks and punctuation denoting alterations omitted.we have already determined that the scope,duration,and openness of the transformation of the municipal assembly offices into a campaign headquarters was sufficient to allow a jury to infer knowledge by pérez of such conditions and failure to correct them,and that this transformation caused the violation of bisbal rights.
we review de novo the district court ruling as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support an award of punitive damages.iacobucci boulter,cir.a jury may be permitted to award punitive damages in a action when the defendant conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent,or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.smith wade,d.the requirement of reckless indifference means that the defendant must act in the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law.borges colón,cir quoting kolstad am.dental ass n,d.
