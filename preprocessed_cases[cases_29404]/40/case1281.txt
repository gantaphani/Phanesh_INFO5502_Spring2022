maryland allows any voter to vote via absentee ballot.a voter may obtain a blank hardcopy absentee ballot by mail,fax,or by downloading and printing one from a website.the hardcopy ballot must be marked by hand,signed,and returned via mail or to the voter local election board.
the national federation of the blind and individual disabled maryland voters sued state election officials under title ii of the americans with disabilities act ada and section of the rehabilitation act.plaintiffs allege that marking a hardcopy ballot by hand without assistance is impossible for voters with various disabilities,and that they have therefore been denied meaningful access to absentee voting.after a bench trial,the district court found that maryland program,as then structured,did not comport with ada and rehabilitation act requirements.the district court further found that plaintiffs proposed use of an online ballot marking tool that would enable disabled voters to mark their ballots a reasonable modification that did not fundamentally alter maryland absentee voting program.defendant election officials now appeal all these aspects of the district court decision.for the reasons below,we affirm.
elections in the state of maryland are overseen by the state board of elections board,law to westlaw current through the regular session of the general assembly.the board is comprised of five members.law a.the board appoints a state administrator of elections who is designated as the chief state election official and tasked with administering maryland election apparatus.id.
maryland provides its voters with a number of different means to vote.maryland has nearly polling places at which a voter may cast a ballot on election day.the overwhelming majority of these polling places are accessible to physically disabled voters and are staffed with election judges trained in serving voters with disabilities.the polling place voting machines have a number of accessibility features designed to assist disabled voters in casting their ballots.maryland voting machines allow voters to magnify the font of the ballot,to alter the color contrast,and to position the interface screen such that voters can sit down while casting their ballots.the voting machines can also be programed for nonvisual access by means of an audio ballot when using the audio features a voter receives a headset and numeric keypad to navigate the ballot choices.voters who desire assistance in marking their ballots may be assisted by an individual of their choosing or by an election judge in the presence of an election judge of another political party.the voting machines are not compatible with some common personal accessibility devices such as refreshable braille displays.
maryland also allows voters to vote in person for an period before election day at early voting polling stations.all of these early voting polling places are physically accessible.
finally,any maryland voter may vote by absentee ballot.a voter can obtain a ballot by mail,fax,or electronically by downloading a ballot from a website.a voter who electronically downloads an absentee ballot must print out the ballot in hardcopy,mark their choices by hand,and then sign and return the hardcopy ballot to their local board of elections.an absentee voter may designate an agent to pick up and deliver a ballot.absentee voters may also have an individual of their choice assist them in hand marking the ballot.
historically,as noted,an absentee voter who obtained an absentee ballot electronically needed to print out the blank ballot and mark their choices by hand on the printed hardcopy ballot.for several years,maryland has been developing a piece of software referred to as an online ballot marking tool.the tool can be used by absentee voters who choose to obtain their absentee ballots electronically the tool enables voters to mark their choices electronically and then print out a completed ballot when the ballot is printed,the voter selections appear on a number of pages followed by a separate signature page.the voter must still sign the signature page and return the entire hardcopy ballot to the local board of elections.only printed and signed ballots received by a local board of elections are counted in determining the result of an election.
maryland board developed the online ballot marking tool over a number of years,including with the participation of plaintiff national federation of the blind.the board has solicited feedback and implemented a number of usability and accessibility enhancements for disabled voters.the tool is not compatible with all computer browsers or operating systems,but does function properly with a variety of reasonably products.importantly for individuals with certain disabilities,the ability to use the tool on their own computers may enable them to use the personal assistive devices that they ordinarily use to interface with the computer,such as a refreshable braille display,to mark their ballot choices.
an early,version of the online ballot marking tool was available to absentee voters during maryland primary elections.following the primary elections,a question arose as to whether the tool needed to be officially certified pursuant to maryland election law section,which requires certification of any voting system prior to use.the maryland attorney general provided an opinion that the tool did not meet the statutory definition of a voting system and did not require certification.see certification of voting systems does not apply to absentee ballot marking wizard,op.att y.however,apparently due to lingering concerns over the status of the online ballot marking tool,the board only made the tool available to certain overseas and military absentee voters for the general election.use of the tool in the primary and general elections was apparently uneventful.
the maryland general assembly subsequently clarified the status of the tool.in,the general assembly passed the improving access to voting act.laws ch,which,among other things,explicitly required the board to certify any online ballot marking tool prior to use by voters.see id.codified at law.certification requires a supermajority at least four of the five members of the board must vote in favor of certification.see law c.
the board continued to make improvements to the version of the tool that had been used in the election cycle.in particular,the board implemented certain changes to make the tool more accessible to voters with disabilities.additionally,in accordance with the improving access to voting act,the board hired an independent consultant,unatek unatek,to perform security testing on the tool.unatek produced a report in december concluding that use of the tool was secure.
in february,the board met and discussed the online ballot marking tool.the board reviewed the december unatek report and interviewed the report author.some board members continued to express concerns about the security of the tool,and the board did not hold a certification vote.
the board subsequently hired a second independent consultant,mainstay enterprises,mainstay,to audit the unatek security report.the mainstay audit concluded that unatek security assessment had followed industry best practices.the board also received and reviewed public comments and had board staff obtain information on the use of similar ballot marking tools in other states.
the certification issue was again discussed at the board april meeting.at the meeting,mainstay briefed the board on the results of its audit.some board members continued to express concerns about certification and the board did not take a certification vote.
on may,plaintiffs sued linda lamone,maryland state administrator of elections,and the five board members,all in their official capacities.at the heart of plaintiffs suit are claims that maryland absentee voting process violates the ada and the rehabilitation act.plaintiffs sought both a declaratory judgment to that effect as well as an injunction requiring state election officials to make the online ballot marking tool available for use starting with the general election the district court subsequently scheduled a bench trial to begin on august.the schedule would provide defendants with sufficient time to implement the tool before the general election in the event that plaintiffs prevailed.
while the suit was pending,the board held a meeting on july,with one board member absent.the four board members in attendance voted to to certify the online ballot marking tool.the vote did not satisfy the statutory supermajority requirement and the tool was not certified.
the district court held a bench trial beginning on august,the district court heard testimony on the difficulties disabled voters have experienced while voting the board development of the online ballot marking tool and the board deliberation over certification the accessibility of the tool for disabled voters and the security risks posed by the tool.
the district court found that the evidence demonstrated specific difficulties that some disabled voters have experienced while voting,and that under the current absentee ballot voting program,individuals with disabilities such as those of the plaintiffs can not vote privately and independently.the district court credited the results of a university of baltimore usability study that concluded the tool was highly accessible for disabled voters,though the district court acknowledged that two individuals testified that they had difficulty accessing and using the tool during a public demonstration period.the district court found the tool compatible with reasonably computer and screen access software,designed in accordance with the web content accessibility guidelines,and compatible with refreshable braille displays.id.the district court did find that there were still challenges to private and independent voting by absentee ballot for disabled voters even when using the tool,including that disabled voters may need assistance in signing their ballots before submission.id.however,the testimony at trial also indicated that,because the signature sheet prints on a separate page,the risk of disclosure of a disabled voter selections was minimalized and,in any event,was significantly less than that afforded under the current paper absentee ballot system.
with respect to the security risks posed by the online ballot marking tool,the district court credited expert testimony that the tool exhibited software independence,meaning a change to the voting software used for an election can not cause an undetectable change to the outcome of an election and that there were no additional risks that did not exist in other methods already available to maryland voters.the district court found that the tool was not without some security risks including that malware could enable a third party to observe a voter selections and that a voter selections could be captured if a third party infiltrated the board server during the time a voter selections the printable ballot were being transmitted.additionally,t here was no evidence at trial that the online ballot marking tool had been tested against intentional attempts to infiltrate or hack into the board server or the tool.
the district court further found that it is clear that most voters may mark their absentee ballots without assistance and that plaintiffs should be afforded the same opportunity,but the state current voting program does not allow for it.based on the facts found at trial,the district court concluded that plaintiffs had established that they had been denied meaningful access to absentee voting in maryland in violation of title ii of the ada and section of the rehabilitation act.the district court entered a declaratory judgment for plaintiffs to this effect.the district court further concluded that plaintiffs proposed remedy,access to the online ballot marking tool,was a reasonable modification that did not fundamentally alter maryland voting program.consistent with these conclusions,the district court entered a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from violating plaintiffs rights under the ada and the rehabilitation act and requiring defendants to make the online ballot marking tool available to plaintiffs for the general election.this appeal followed.

defendants appeal principally focuses on the district court three core legal conclusions that plaintiffs have been denied meaningful access to absentee voting in violation of the ada and the rehabilitation act that the online ballot marking tool constitutes a reasonable remedial modification and that requiring defendants to allow use of the tool does not fundamentally alter maryland voting program.we address each of these issues in turn.
title ii of the ada provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.to make out a violation of title ii,plaintiffs must show they have a disability they are otherwise qualified to receive the benefits of a public service,program,or activity and they were denied the benefits of such service,program,or activity,or otherwise discriminated against,on the basis of their disability.constantine rectors visitors of george mason,cir.
only the third of these plaintiffs were denied the benefits of a public service,program,or activity on the basis of their at issue here much of the dispute revolves around the proper way to define the scope of the relevant public service or program at issue.plaintiffs argue that the appropriate analytic scope is maryland absentee voting program.defendants urge analysis of maryland voting program in its entirety,encompassing the various voting to maryland voters.defendants argue that even if absentee voting is not fully accessible,the full accessibility of maryland polling places provides disabled voters with meaningful access to voting.as explained below,we conclude that defendants proposed focus is overbroad and would undermine the purpose of the ada and its implementing regulations.
defendants argument for holistic consideration of maryland voting program is in some immediate tension with the text of the ada.title ii states that a disabled individual may not be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.defendants proposed focus on voting in its entirety effectively reads out much of this language,suggesting that title ii prohibits only complete exclusion from participation in public programs.however,title ii is disjunctive.by its own terms it is not limited only to public programs it applies to services,programs,or activities.id.emphasis added.title ii does not only prohibit exclusion from participation in a public program it also separately prohibits den ying the benefits of that program.id and in addition to those prohibitions,title ii separately generally prohibits discrimination by any public entity.id.although the bare language of title ii does not definitively resolve the question of appropriate scope,it does suggest to us that some granularity in analytic focus is necessary.
the supreme court has cautioned against defining the scope of a public benefit so as to avoid questions of discriminatory effects.in alexander choate,d,a rehabilitation act case,a unanimous court counseled that in assessing whether a disabled individual had been provided with meaningful access to a benefit,t he benefit itself,of course,can not be defined in a way that effectively denies otherwise qualified handicapped individuals the meaningful access to which they are entitled.see also id.at citing with approval the government statement that a ntidiscrimination legislation can obviously be emptied of meaning if every discriminatory policy is collapsed into one definition of what is the relevant benefit.the logic of alexander further suggests that we should proceed cautiously to avoid defining a public program so generally that we overlook real difficulties in accessing government services.
also significant for our analysis of the proper scope of review here is the fact that maryland allows any voter to vote by absentee ballot.law.absentee ballots are not provided only to a limited set of voters with a demonstrated need to vote absentee they are instead provided to the entire maryland electorate at the option of each individual voter.on the whole,then,we think it is far more natural to view absentee than the entire voting the appropriate object of scrutiny for compliance with the ada and the rehabilitation act.
defendants remaining arguments against this straightforward conclusion are unpersuasive.defendants cite an regulation,a,which they assert requires a reviewing court to view maryland voting program in its entirety.however,the cited regulation expressly pertains to existing facilities.see id.on its face,this regulation simply provides that a public entity does not have to make each of its facilities accessible as long as individuals with disabilities have access to that entity offered public services.this regulation is targeted principally at physical accessibility and allows a public entity to provide accessibility alternatives that would not require architectural modifications of existing facilities.accord constantine,at discussing a and explaining that structural changes in existing physical facilities are probably the most expensive enterprise in providing accessibility.
other regulations,however,are applicable here and conflict with defendants proposed focus on the entirety of maryland voting program.as one example,general prohibitions against discrimination directly implements the general antidiscrimination mandate of title ii.subsection b of the regulation requires public entities to make certain reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability this regulation clearly contemplates a focus on accessibility at a more granular level than entire government level of policies,practices,and procedures.id 
defendants also cite to three district court decisions from other circuits that they argue stand for the proposition that all aspects of a state voting program must be viewed together when analyzing an ada claim.br.of appellants.it is not clear to us that the cited cases in fact support defendants proposition in any event,we find them unpersuasive.further,later decisions in some of those districts and decisions by the courts of appeals sitting above them,flatly reject the very argument defendants advance here.see,united spinal ass bd.of elections in new york,d,it is abundantly clear that defendants are obligated to provide a level of access to their voting program beyond the simple assurance that voters with disabilities are able to cast a ballot in some way,shape,or form.disabled in action bd.of elections in new york,cir t o assume the benefit is merely the opportunity to vote at some time and in some way would render meaningless the mandate that public entities may not afford persons with disabilities services that are not equal to that afforded others.quotation omitted.
having determined that maryland absentee voting program is the appropriate subject of our ada analysis,we must determine whether absentee voting is accessible to disabled individuals as required by statute and implementing regulations.as the supreme court has explained 
congress enacted the ada in to remedy widespread discrimination against disabled individuals.in studying the need for such legislation,congress found that historically,society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,and,despite some improvements,such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.

congress has explicitly directed the attorney general to promulgate regulations implementing title ii mandate.pursuant to this directive,the department of justice doj promulgated a number of regulations,including.that regulation provides 
a public entity,in providing any aid,benefit,or service,may not a fford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid,benefit,or service that is not equal to that afforded others or p rovide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid,benefit,or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result.
b ii iii we have recognized that t he department regulations are the agency interpretation of the statute,and they are therefore given controlling weight unless they conflict with other departmental regulations or the ada itself.seremeth,at citing stinson united states,d,and chevron,nat.res.def.council,d.
we have little trouble concluding from the record before us that maryland absentee voting program does not provide disabled individuals an opportunity to participate equal to that afforded others.see b ii.the district court found that it is clear that most voters may mark their absentee ballots without assistance.this finding is not clearly erroneous.the district court further found that maryland current absentee voting program does not allow disabled individuals such as plaintiffs to mark their ballots without assistance.id.this finding is also not clearly erroneous.this sharp disparity makes obvious that defendants have provided an aid,benefit,or service to disabled individuals that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result,to gain the same benefit,or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others.see b iii.the ada requires more.
defendants do not seriously challenge the district court factual findings concerning plaintiffs current inability to vote without assistance.instead,defendants argue that plaintiffs have not been denied meaningful access to absentee voting because disabled individuals such as plaintiffs have no right to vote without assistance.see br.of appellants.this argument simply misapprehends the nature of plaintiffs claims.
this case does not turn on whether there is a standalone right to vote privately and independently without assistance.plaintiffs argument is that defendants have provided such a benefit to voters while denying that same benefit to plaintiffs on the basis of their disability.this is precisely the sort of harm the ada seeks to prevent,disabled in action,at although plaintiffs were ultimately able to cast their vote with the fortuitous assistance of others,the purpose of the rehabilitation act is to empower individuals with disabilities to maximize employment,economic,independence,and inclusion and integration into society the right to vote should not be contingent on the happenstance that others are available to help.emphasis by circuit quoting b cal.council of the blind cty.of alameda,d,r equiring blind and visually impaired individuals to vote with the assistance of a third party,if they are to vote at all,at best provides these individuals with an inferior voting experience not equal to that afforded others.quoting b ii.
voting is a quintessential public activity.in enacting the ada,congress explicitly found that individuals with disabilities have been relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society,based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such
