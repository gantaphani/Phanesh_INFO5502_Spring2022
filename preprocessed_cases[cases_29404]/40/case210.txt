this case involves constitutional challenges to a maine statute enacted to reduce health care costs and protect prescribers data privacy.in maine and elsewhere,each time a prescription from a physician or other licensed prescriber is given to a pharmacy,the pharmacy obtains a number of facts that identify the prescriber.data put together from multiple transactions involving the same prescriber reveal certain patterns and preferences,including her prescribing history,her choice of particular drugs versus their generic equivalents,and the likelihood she will adopt new drugs.
plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of.ann.tit,which allows prescribers licensed in maine to choose not to make this identifying information available for use in marketing prescription drugs to them.section does not directly prohibit any marketing practices.rather,it prohibits certain entities from licensing,using,selling,transferring,or exchanging this information for a marketing purpose if the prescriber has opted to protect the confidentiality of her prescribing data.ann.tit.
plaintiffs,companies that collect vast amounts of identifying data about individual prescribers and aggregate the data into reports and databases for use when marketing pharmaceutical products,are covered in the text of the law,as are others.see id.a i.immediately after section enactment in,and before its enforcement,plaintiffs sued maine attorney general in the federal district court of maine under,claiming that section restrictions on the licensing,use,sale,transfer,or exchange of maine prescribers identifying data for a marketing purpose are unconstitutional limitations on protected speech under the first amendment that these restrictions are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad under the first and fourteenth amendments and that the law also regulates transactions outside of maine in violation of the dormant commerce clause.on december,the district court granted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction and prohibited maine from enforcing section on the basis of plaintiffs first amendment claims.see ims health rowe,d,
this case comes to us in an unusual posture.maine is not the only state to have restricted plaintiffs use of data,and this is not the first time plaintiffs have made these constitutional claims.on november,after the district court granted plaintiffs a preliminary injunction in this case,this court upheld a similar,but not identical,new hampshire statute against plaintiffs constitutional challenges,a ruling that binds this panel.see ims health ayotte,cir,cert.denied.in the meantime,the district court injunction has remained in effect during this appeal,and maine has never implemented section.
we reject all of plaintiffs constitutional challenges to section.plaintiffs first amendment challenges fail for the reasons stated in ayotte the statute regulates conduct,not speech,and even if it regulates commercial speech,that regulation satisfies constitutional standards.they also fail for reasons not present in ayotte.the maine statute constitutionally protects maine prescribers choice to opt in to confidentiality protection to avoid being subjected to unwanted solicitations based on their identifying data.we also reject the argument that the statute is void for vagueness.
plaintiffs argument that section is unconstitutional under the dormant commerce clause if applied to plaintiffs use or sale of maine prescribers identifying data also fails.we interpret the maine statute using maine principles of statutory construction and hold that section regulates prescription drug information intermediaries use or sale of maine prescribers data.we hold that this interpretation does not raise constitutional concerns under the dormant commerce clause,which might necessitate a narrower reading of the statute under the doctrine of constitutional avoidance.
the supreme court current dormant commerce clause jurisprudence does not leave maine powerless to protect maine prescribers who have sought to prevent the use of their identifying data in transactions that also cause substantial harms,including increased health care costs.the statute constitutionally reaches plaintiffs transactions as a necessary incident of maine strong interest in protecting maine prescribers from unwanted solicitations,a policy that maine also rationally believes will lower its health care costs.nor,we hold,would section regulation of prescription drug information intermediaries use or sale of maine prescribers identifying data raise constitutional concerns as a disproportionate burden on interstate commerce under pike bruce church.
factual background 
the relevant facts are undisputed 
data is used for many purposes,but this case concerns restrictions on only one of those uses pharmaceutical manufacturers use of the data to send their pharmaceutical sales representatives to personally market particular drugs to particular prescribers,a practice known as detailing.section defines detailing as contact with a prescriber or employees or agents of a prescriber for the purpose of increasing or reinforcing the prescribing of a certain drug by the prescriber.ann.tit.
detailing is a massive and expensive undertaking for pharmaceutical manufacturers,which spend billions of dollars a year to have some pharmaceutical sales representatives make weekly or monthly visits to prescribers nationwide.stephanie saul,doctors object as drug makers learn who prescribing what,times,may,at.each pharmaceutical manufacturer detailers market particular pharmaceutical products in particular regions.a single prescriber is visited by an average of detailers a week an average of fourteen detailers a week call on a single specialist.
data is a valuable tool in a detailer arsenal of sales techniques.with it,pharmaceutical manufacturers can pinpoint the prescribing habits of individual prescribers in a region and target prescribers who might be persuaded to switch brands or prescribe more of a detailer brand of products see saul,supra,at.
during their visits to prescribers,detailers distribute upwards of million worth of free product samples per year,along with branded promotional materials and pamphlets about the different conditions their particular products can be used to treat.detailers use data to do these things more effectively every sales pitch can be tailored to what the detailer knows of the prescriber based on her prescribing history.the central objective is to get prescribers to adopt the pharmaceutical product the detailer is marketing and to build brand loyalty.this goal is not only explicit it is how detailers earn bonuses.see saul,supra,at.
some prescribers,in maine and elsewhere,welcome these interactions.detailers,they say,provide them with studies relevant to their practices,useful free samples,and targeted data about how widely certain new drugs have been prescribed by others.they find that detailers provide helpful comparisons of competing drugs used to treat the same conditions and information about new drugs or more effective alternatives to the prescriptions they currently prescribe.these prescribers say they are immune to detailers influence and see no conflict of interest.
significantly,though,other prescribers have strenuously objected that detailing intrudes into their prescribing decisions.detailers,these prescribers insist,should not be able to use their prescribing histories to target them for unwelcome marketing calls.an article by a senior vice president of the american medical association ama and an executive of plaintiff ims health noted that physicians complain bitterly about detailers who wave data in their faces and challenge them with their own prescribing histories when they fail to prescribe more of the product the detailer has been advertising.musacchio hunkler,more than a game of,pharmaceutical executive,may.the head of california state medical association has reported that prescribers have been outraged that people came into their office and talked to them about how many times they prescribed a particular drug.saul,supra,at.aggregated survey data confirms that physicians have a predominantly negative view of detailing.see manchanda honka,the effects and role of marketing in the pharmaceutical industry an integrative review,yale health pol y ethics.
many maine prescribers have openly objected to detailing.a survey by the maine medical association in revealed that a majority of maine physicians did not want pharmaceutical manufacturers to be able to use their individual prescribing histories for marketing purposes.one maine prescriber explained that she felt that it intrudes upon my privacy and my work life for drug companies to buy my information,without my permission,for marketing purposes.she has ask ed to be removed from mailing lists and telephone call lists and would like to have the similar option of not allowing my professional information to be sold to drug companies for marketing purposes.
detailers use of data,however,is only the final step in a series of transactions that begin with the acquisition and aggregation of massive amounts of individual prescribers identifying data.pharmaceutical manufacturers lack direct access to data.that fact has fueled an enormously profitable,multilayered market for acquiring,aggregating,packaging,and selling these data primarily for detailing.plaintiffs are the middlemen of this market.
when filling prescriptions,individual pharmacies accumulate data about the prescriptions individual prescribers have made,usually for insurance reimbursement.pharmacies that are part of national chains normally transfer these data to the chain central data warehouse.each pharmacy,and even each pharmacy chain,is only one piece of a bigger picture individual prescribers,or their patients,may make prescriptions at many different pharmacy locations.
this is where plaintiffs come in.plaintiff companies are prescription drug information intermediaries that mine specialized data.they contract with numerous pharmacies and,to a lesser degree,insurance companies and other carriers,to buy their raw data.under those contracts,the pharmacy computer software collects data it sends to plaintiffs.the software encrypts data so that plaintiffs can not identify individual patients by name,but it captures information directly identifying prescribers by name and address and shows details about the particular drugs prescribed.
plaintiffs receive and aggregate data from these various sources and then compile reports and databases.they assemble a complete picture of individual prescribers prescribing histories by prescriber names with publicly available databases,including the ama database of medical doctors specialties.see saul,supra,at.plaintiffs admit that most of their reports and databases are pharmaceutical manufacturers to instruct detailers where to focus their efforts,identify which prescribers to target,and assess detailers effectiveness 
plaintiffs then license or sell these specialized databases and reports to pharmaceutical manufacturers,a lucrative business that yielded revenues of billion for plaintiff ims health alone in id.plaintiffs products are the building blocks of the reports pharmaceutical manufacturers generate for individual detailers,who use them to target prescribers in their assigned areas.
ii.the maine law 
to date,maine appears to be one of only three states that have limited detailers access to prescribers identifying data.see.ann.tit.ann.f.stat.ann.tit,d.like its counterparts in new hampshire and vermont,the maine law,section,does so indirectly in relevant part,it states that a carrier,pharmacy or prescription drug information intermediary,as defined in the statute,may not license,use,sell,transfer or exchange for value,for any marketing purpose,prescription drug information that identifies a prescriber who has filed for confidentiality protection.ann.tit.maine law regulates the different layers of the market for information,but it does not prohibit detailing,nor does it purport to prohibit speech by detailers to prescribers.
unlike similar laws in new hampshire and vermont,the central feature of the maine law is to limit detailers access to an individual prescriber identifying data only if the prescriber has affirmatively opted for this protection see id.
a prescriber is a person who is licensed,registered or otherwise authorized in the appropriate jurisdiction to prescribe and administer drugs in the course of professional practice.ann.tit.as other sections of make clear,the appropriate jurisdiction means prescribers licensed and located in maine the provision is designed to protect only prescribers in the health care system of this state.id.only these maine prescribers can opt in,and even prescribers identifying data can be used for any purpose other than detailing.see id.
maine enacted section to achieve three stated compelling state interests to improve the public health,to limit annual increases in the cost of health care and to protect the privacy of prescribers in the health care system of this state.id.the maine legislature found that p atients and prescribers have requested that the legislature provide a mechanism for protecting the confidentiality of identifying prescription drug information from use for marketing purposes.id.b.across the nation,the legislature further found,data companies purchase for marketing purposes computerized prescription drug records from pharmacies and insurers that identify prescribers,and they sell these records to prescription drug manufacturers that use personally identifying prescriber information to attempt to influence prescribers to prescribe higher priced drugs,resulting in higher health care costs.id.c.restricting the use of prescriber identifying information,the maine legislature found,will act to decrease drug detailing that targets the prescriber,thus increasing decisions to prescribe lower priced drugs and decisions made on the basis of medical and scientific knowledge and driving down the cost of health care.id.d.
section operates as follows.in its first step,maine prescribers who object to being targeted by pharmaceutical detailers may register for confidentiality protection see.ann.tit.maine prescribers can opt in for confidentiality protection in application materials with the relevant maine licensing board.id.a.those materials must inform maine prescribers that prescription drug information that identifies the prescriber is used for marketing purposes by carriers,pharmacies and prescription drug information intermediaries and must give prescribers the option of protecting the confidentiality of their identifying information through one of three methods id.a.when a prescriber opts in,the relevant maine licensing board must place the individual name on a list that is submitted every month to the maine health data organization,an independent state executive agency id.a.
when patients of an maine prescriber fill their prescriptions,the pharmacy still collects the prescriber identifying data and may transfer it to a central data center.the law does not,by its terms,affect this transaction.
section does regulate transactions between those pharmacies or pharmacy data centers and prescription drug information intermediaries like plaintiffs.section prohibits pharmacies from selling,transferring,or licensing maine prescribers identifying data for a marketing purpose,unless the prescriber revokes the protection.see id,a.
once plaintiffs obtain data from pharmacies,plaintiffs generate certain databases and reports designed to facilitate detailing.if plaintiffs include maine prescribers identifying data in these products,they have used the data for a marketing purpose,in violation of section.see id.section also prohibits plaintiffs from selling or licensing to pharmaceutical manufacturers only the portion of these databases and reports containing maine prescribers identifying data.see id.
once pharmaceutical manufacturers obtain these databases and reports,they generate individualized reports for detailers,who then use individual prescribers data to target prescribers in maine.section does not explicitly limit detailers use of data,but the earlier stages of regulation are meant to prevent this information from getting to detailers for use in marketing.
a violation of section prohibitions is a violation of the maine unfair trade practices act,id,and,under that act,the maine attorney general can enjoin the practice and levy civil penalties of per violation.ann.tit,the law is not subject to criminal enforcement.
section was to go into effect on january,id,but because plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction before then,maine has been prevented from enforcing it.see rowe,d at.as of september,notwithstanding the injunction,maine prescribers have opted in for confidentiality protection.
iii.first amendment 
we reject plaintiffs first amendment challenge to the maine law.plaintiffs claims fail for the same reasons we rejected their nearly identical first amendment challenge to new hampshire similar statute in ayotte.plaintiffs arguments here fail for another,independent reason.maine has set up an scheme for prescribers licensed in maine.even assuming arguendo that the maine law restricts protected commercial speech and not conduct,we hold that it directly advances the substantial purpose of protecting prescribers from having their identifying data used in unwanted solicitations by detailers,and thus maine interests in lowering health care costs.
in ayotte,this circuit held that new hampshire restrictions on plaintiffs licensing,use,sale,transfer or exchange of all new hampshire prescribers identifying data regulate conduct,not speech,and thus the first amendment does not protect plaintiffs conduct.at.ayotte alternately held that even if the new hampshire law regulates speech,plaintiffs are at best engaged in commercial speech and the law survives intermediate scrutiny under central hudson gas electric public service commission.id.at.ayotte also held that reducing health care costs is a substantial government interest the court did not reach new hampshire two other asserted interests,protecting citizens health and protecting the confidentiality of patients and prescribers identifying data.id.at.the new hampshire law directly advances health care cost reduction given record evidence showing that detailing increases prescription drug costs,that detailers effectiveness is bound up with their use of individual prescribers histories,and that reducing detailers access to prescribers data would make prescribers less responsive to detailers efforts to market costly drugs.id.at.finally,ayotte found that new hampshire law is no more restrictive than necessary to advance the state interest in containing costs,though its prohibitions extend to all new hampshire prescribers identifying data.id.at.
maine law,which was modeled in part on new hampshire,regulates the same kind of conduct for the same three purposes reducing health care costs in maine,protecting maine patients health,and protecting maine patients and prescribers identifying data from unwanted uses in maine.me.stat.ann.tit.indeed,section differs from the new hampshire law only in ways that weaken plaintiffs first amendment and other challenges.unlike new hampshire law,the maine law only prohibits plaintiffs from licensing,using,selling,transferring or exchanging data identifying prescribers licensed in maine who have for confidentiality protection.see id.unlike new hampshire legislature,the maine legislature included specific findings that limiting detailers use of maine prescribers identifying data would reduce health care costs,ensure maine prescribers decisions were based on unbiased medical and scientific evidence,and protect maine prescribers from unwanted detailing visits.compare id,with.ann.maine also introduced evidence into the record to show how section advances maine three asserted interests.
plaintiffs concede that ayotte forecloses their first amendment challenge and that the district court injunction,which was granted based on their first amendment claims before ayotte was decided,can not be affirmed on those grounds.plaintiffs nonetheless reiterate shorthand versions of the same arguments this court rejected in ayotte that their use,sale,and licensing of information is speech,not conduct,and that it is protected speech warranting strict scrutiny,not merely commercial speech their alternate claim,that the maine law can not survive intermediate scrutiny as commercial speech because maine has not introduced any evidence that the law will actually reduce health care costs,is contradicted by ayotte reasoning,and the record in this case supports ayotte conclusion.see at.there is no basis for considering these arguments anew.
we reject plaintiffs contention that united states stevens,undermines ayotte holding.stevens held that speech in the form of video depictions of animal fighting is not categorically unprotected by the first amendment,see id.by contrast,ayotte initial holding was that the new hampshire law primarily regulated conduct,not speech.at.ayotte did suggest that any speech regulated was of such minimal value that it likely fell outside of first amendment protections.id.at.that suggestion,though,was in service of ayotte holding that the new hampshire statute regulated conduct,not speech,an argument not at issue in stevens.further,ayotte alternate holding was that the new hampshire law would be upheld even if it regulated protected speech.id.at.
we reject plaintiffs first amendment challenge to the maine law for a further reason particular to the maine statute and independent of ayotte.even if the maine law regulates protected speech,section directly serves maine substantial interest in vindicating maine prescribers rights to avoid unwanted targeting by detailers in maine on the basis of their individual prescribing histories.
this purpose is not solely about protecting prescribers expectation that their identifying data will remain categorically private.see rowe,at.prescribers also have a privacy interest in avoiding unwanted solicitations from detailers who have used their individual prescribing data to identify and target them.maine stated interest,in turn,is in shielding those prescribers who object to this invasive use of their identifying information and who have opted in to a system of protection the state provides.ann.tit,b,b.like laws implementing do not call lists,maine advances this interest by allowing its prescribers to join a list to stop their data from being licensed,used,sold,transferred or exchanged for this unwelcome purpose.
if section regulates protected speech at all,it regulates commercial speech,which the supreme court has defined to include expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.central hudson,at.this circuit and others continue to apply this definition.see ayotte,at see also united states philip morris usa,bellsouth,farris,cir procter gamble amway,cir.
plaintiffs purported regulated speech consists of data contained in databases and reports that plaintiffs have designed to facilitate detailing.this is economically motivated content tailored to a commercial use,namely,to help pharmaceutical manufacturers better market prescription drugs to particular prescribers.bolger youngs drug prods,suggesting that use for an advertising purpose and the speaker economic motivations are relevant indicia of commercial speech.plaintiffs collections of data,if speech at all,would be commercial speech their purpose is to facilitate the marketing of services to individual customers.fcc,cir 
under the central hudson framework,commercial speech is protected if it is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity.at.that is not at issue here.still,protected commercial speech can be restricted if the asserted governmental interest is substantial,the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted,and the restriction is not more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.id.at see also ayotte,at.
assuming the statute regulates protected commercial speech,maine meets the test for restricting that speech.maine has a substantial interest in protecting its prescribers from unwanted solicitations by detailers in maine based on their prescribing histories.the unwilling listener interest in avoiding unwanted communication,the supreme court has held,has been repeatedly identified in our cases,and it is an aspect of the broader right to be let alone that one of our wisest justices characterized as the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.hill colorado,quoting olmstead united states,brandeis,dissenting.
maine has a substantial interest in vindicating this right by allowing prescribers to avoid being subjected to unwelcome advertisements and solicitations.the supreme court has recognized this interest in the context of do not mail lists see rowan post office dep t,holding that a federal do not mail list served the very basic right to be free from sights,sounds,and tangible matter we do not want see also ftc mainstream mktg,cir recognizing the government substantial interest in protecting individual privacy through the federal do not call list.it undoubtedly extends to protecting maine prescribers who do not want their data used to facilitate unwanted solicitations.see trans union ftc,recognizing the government substantial interest in protecting the privacy of consumer credit information by preventing its use in targeted marketing lists 
section advances this interest directly.both the record evidence and common sense show that the harms maine recites are real and that the law will in fact alleviate them to a material degree.ayotte,at quoting edenfield fane.time and again,the record establishes,maine prescribers have not merely complained about being subjected to detailing they have identified detailers use of their personal prescribing histories as a singularly objectionable practice.maine legislature found that many prescribers had demanded legislative action to protect their identifying data from this unwanted use.b.section does not,and need not,directly or categorically prohibit detailing to address this harm.rather,maine provides exactly the protections that maine prescribers have requested and allows prescribers to choose whether to invoke them.
maine confidentiality mechanism is also a less restrictive means of vindicating prescribers interests in not having their information used in detailing.see ayotte,at.targeted prohibitions are by definition less restrictive than a categorical ban.see united states playboy entm group,see also mainstream mktg,ftc,cir.mechanisms like the do not call list are narrowly tailored by nature they restrict only calls that are targeted at unwilling recipients.mainstream mktg,at see also fraternal ord.of police stenehjem,cir fed of the blind ftc,cir bland fessler,cir.mechanisms also avoid concerns about state paternalism in the first amendment context.they regulate speech if speech at all only when private individuals choose not to be subject to certain kinds of communications,not simply because the state has identified particular communications as harmful.bland,at.
plaintiffs cursorily assert that maine could have regulated detailers free samples to prescribers,educated doctors,or implemented formulary controls as alternatives to section.ayotte rejected these alternatives as ineffective ways to advance a state interest in health care costs.at.these alternatives do virtually nothing to advance maine interest in protecting maine prescribers identifying data from use in detailing our analysis also disposes of plaintiffs assertion that section violates the fourteenth amendment as an economic constraint unrelated to legitimate state interests.
iv.vagueness 
plaintiffs also argue that section prohibition on the use,transfer,licensing,sale,or exchange of data for any marketing purpose is unconstitutionally vague.plaintiffs brief claims that they simply sell the information to pharmaceutical manufacturers,and they have no intent to market or advertise pharmaceutical products to prescribers themselves.plaintiffs assert that the law is unconstitutionally vague because they can not know whether any marketing purpose refers to their motivation in selling or licensing the information or to pharmaceutical manufacturers ultimate purpose in obtaining the data.
even if there were possible ambiguity in section terms,the law is still not void for vagueness.statutory ambiguity is a regular byproduct of legislative drafting,but the vagueness doctrine invalidates only statutes whose terms are so uncertain that persons of average intelligence would have no choice but to guess at their meaning and modes of application.united states,cir quoting united states councilman,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted see also ridley.bay transp,cir.whatever ambiguity lurks in the phrase any marketing purpose,the law lengthy definition of the term marketing,see supra note,surely provides enough of a benchmark to satisfy due process.
further,this purported ambiguity does not exist on the facts plaintiffs,at minimum,intend for their databases and reports to facilitate detailing.plaintiffs portray themselves as unwitting middlemen that sell information to their clients with no knowledge or control of its ultimate use.plaintiffs depositions and statements at oral argument reveal instead that they are well aware that the primary and intended use of their reports and databases is in detailing.
dormant commerce clause 
plaintiffs final constitutional challenge is that section,as it is applied to the transactions in which they engage out of the state and are shown by the record evidence,violates the dormant commerce clause because plaintiffs obtained an injunction before section went into effect,however,the state has not promulgated regulations under this section,there is no state decisional law,and the law has never been applied plaintiffs assert that they are prescription drug information intermediaries as defined in section,and maine does not dispute this.milavetz,gallop milavetz,united states.
plaintiffs challenge presents questions of whether section would be interpreted under maine law to apply to plaintiffs use or sale of maine prescribers identifying data,including whether the rule of constitutional avoidance requires the statute to be interpreted not to apply to plaintiffs transactions as a matter of law,we hold that the statute applies to plaintiffs use or sale of maine prescribers identifying data and that the statute does so constitutionally.we also reject plaintiffs claim at oral argument that we should leave the district court injunction in place and remand this claim for further proceedings.
plaintiffs interpret section to apply to their transactions based on their construction of its text.they claim that the regulation violates the extraterritoriality branch of the dormant commerce clause,which they say prohibits direct regulation of interstate commerce that occurs wholly outside a state borders.in the alternative,plaintiffs assert,this regulation violates the pike balancing test because it does nothing to advance interests and imposes a heavy burden on interstate activity.
we reject plaintiffs arguments.we interpret section scope by applying the rules of statutory construction that the state highest court would follow.ayotte,at see also adar smith,cir.we hold,based on the text and legislative backdrop of section and maine canons of statutory construction,that section regulates plaintiffs use or sale of maine prescribers identifying data.
we further hold that this interpretation of the statute does not raise constitutional concerns under the dormant commerce clause.the supreme court current dormant commerce clause jurisprudence is concerned with preventing economic protectionism and inconsistent regulation,not with enforcing geographical limits on states exercise of their police power that necessarily regulate commerce.even under the extraterritoriality branch of the dormant commerce clause,the supreme court has not barred states from regulating any commercial transactions beyond their borders that involve their own citizens and create harms.nor does the maine law create constitutional concerns under the pike balancing test.plaintiffs have not shown any disproportionate burden on interstate commerce,and the law creates substantial benefits for those maine prescribers who have affirmatively asked maine to protect their identifying data and for maine in its efforts to lower health care costs.
section text and setting 
the text of the statute shows section was intended to apply to plaintiffs use or sale of maine prescribers identifying data.the statutory text shows that section was designed to address a significant problem occurring in maine,whose solution has some implications.the law is concerned only with prescribers in the health care system of maine.ann.tit,not prescribers anywhere in the united states,and specifically those prescribers who have opted in to maine mechanism for protecting the confidentiality of identifying prescription drug information from use for marketing purposes,id.b.the statute further recognizes that these marketing uses occur a cross the nation when data companies purchase for marketing purposes computerized prescription drug records from pharmacies and insurers that identify prescribers.id.c.the statutory text also identifies specific harms arising from these of prescribers privacy,increased health care costs,and harms to public occurring in maine.see.
section context confirms that the maine legislature intended to reach plaintiffs conduct because of its substantial connections to maine and because it causes harms exclusively in maine.section targets a series of underlying transactions that cause these harms,which start and end in maine,even if all the transactions covered in order to effectuate the statute purposes do not occur in maine.maine prescribers prescriptions are primarily,if not exclusively,filled at maine pharmacies.data from those maine pharmacies are ultimately transferred to prescription drug information intermediaries like plaintiffs through contractual arrangements.plaintiffs subsequent use and sale of maine prescribers identifying data to generate databases and reports may occur outside maine,but those activities are bound up with pharmaceutical manufacturers ultimate use of the information in detailing that targets maine prescribers in maine.
the law also takes effect only if maine prescribers affirmatively indicate that they want maine to protect the confidentiality of their identifying information.see id.every intermediate step is limited to transactions involving these prescribers identifying data.see id.the law ultimate effect is to prevent detailers with maine routes from targeting maine prescribers with their own prescribing histories.id.
presumption against extraterritoriality 
our interpretation of section also comports with maine canons of statutory construction.maine,like other states,generally presumes its statutes do not apply extraterritorially in the absence of contrary indications of legislative intent.see holbrook libby,me see also d statutes.that presumption is overcome here the maine legislature plainly intended section to regulate plaintiffs use or sale of maine prescribers identifying data 
maine presumption against extraterritoriality reflects inherent limitations on the scope of states sovereign regulatory powers.see stavis ipswich clam green,me.this presumption is not a per se rule because those state powers are not mechanically limited to conduct occurring within a state physical borders.as one learned commentator has noted,i n practice,states exert regulatory control over each other all the time a state geographic territory does not mark the outer limit of its legitimate regulatory concern.metzger,congress,article iv,and interstate relations,harv.indeed,an entire body of conflict of laws cases apply state laws to extraterritorial conduct.see florey,state courts,state territory,state power reflections on the extraterritoriality principle in choice of law and legislation,notre dame.
maine,like other states,has construed its laws to apply to extraterritorial conduct with a substantial impact in or connection to maine residents or licensees.see,state hayes,me upholding the extraterritorial enforcement of maine lobster laws to vessels registered in maine dissell trans world airlines,me applying maine worker compensation statute to require an airline to further compensate a flight attendant stationed and injured out of state but residing in maine because of sufficient contacts with maine section application to plaintiffs is within maine sovereign authority.
constitutional avoidance and the dormant commerce clause 
finally,we reject the argument that section application to prescription drug information intermediaries use or sale of maine prescribers identifying data would raise constitutional concerns under the dormant commerce clause under maine and federal law,we must avoid an unconstitutional construction of a statute if a reasonable interpretation of the statute would satisfy constitutional requirements.anderson town of durham,me quoting bagley raymond sch.dep t,me internal quotation marks omitted.there is no need for constitutional avoidance here.
we begin with the supreme court current dormant commerce clause jurisprudence,which provides no foundation for plaintiffs contention that maine regulation of their use or sale of maine prescribers data would raise constitutional concerns.the dormant commerce clause sets two complementary boundaries for states regulatory powers over commerce.on one hand,states can not interfere with congress constitutional authority over interstate commerce by enacting laws that seriously impede interstate commerce,even when congress has not acted.see dep t of revenue davis,on the other hand,states retain authority under their general police powers to regulate matters of legitimate local concern,even though interstate commerce may be affected.maine taylor,quoting lewis bt inv.managers,internal quotation marks omitted.further,in fields traditionally subject to state regulation,federal courts should be particularly hesitant to interfere with states efforts under the guise of the commerce clause.united haulers ass n,solid waste mgmt,alterations in original.
as to the first of these boundaries,the dormant commerce clause is driven by concern about economic is,regulatory measures designed to benefit economic interests by burdening competitors.davis,at quoting new energy of limbach.similar concerns about hidden protectionism and excessive barriers to interstate trade arise when states enact laws likely to subject entities engaged in interstate commerce to incompatible regulatory regimes,see cts dynamics of,pac.ex rel.sullivan,or laws with minimal benefits and a disproportionate impact on interstate commerce,see pike,at.
these concerns are central to the way the supreme court has framed the dormant commerce clause in its recent opinions.the maine law implicates none of them.maine regulation of prescription drug information intermediaries use or sale of maine prescribers data does not discriminate against entities in favor of competitors,nor do plaintiffs so argue.maine law does not risk imposing regulatory obligations inconsistent with those of other states.no other states have erected competing regulations,much less opposing regulations requiring the transfer of maine prescribers data this is simply not an example of a state engaged in economic protectionism.davis,at 
maine interests,on the other hand,are precisely the kind of traditional state concerns that the supreme court has identified as falling outside the reach of the dormant commerce clause.see davis,at united haulers,at.states are vested with the responsibility of protecting the health,safety,and welfare of their citizens.united haulers,at.to serve those interests,states exercise the kind of local autonomy essential to federalism.the essence of our federal system is that within the realm of authority left open to them under the constitution,the states must be equally free to engage in any activity that their citizens choose for the common weal.davis,at quoting garcia san antonio metro.transit,internal quotation marks omitted.
maine has a uniquely strong interest in protecting maine prescribers who have invoked maine regulatory authority through the scheme.cts,at.maine has done so because these commercial transactions also harm the public health and increase maine health care costs.in advancing these interests,maine has regulated in a traditional area of state concern without undercutting other states regulatory schemes or encroaching on their interests.maine choice must be respected.
the maine statute falls outside the central concerns of the court dormant commerce clause jurisprudence for another reason.maine has not shifted the costs of regulation to other states whose voters can not affect its legislative choices,nor does the maine law hand local businesses a victory they could not obtain through the political process.united haulers,at.maine political processes produced this statute,and maine voters can,if they disagree,reverse this policy.
plaintiffs ignore these foundational principles indeed,plaintiffs ignore virtually every supreme court dormant commerce clause case after.instead,plaintiffs say section application to their conduct would violate an infrequently applied strand of the dormant commerce clause loosely labeled extraterritoriality its central premise is that a statute that directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a state exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting state authority and is invalid regardless of whether the statute extraterritorial reach was intended by the legislature.healy beer,emphasis added see also alliance of auto mfrs.gwadowsky,cir.plaintiffs further suggest that this doctrine applies not to the maine law as applied to prescription drug information intermediaries but to their atomized transactions only.plaintiffs make no attempt to square these principles with the court current dormant commerce clause jurisprudence or to explain how these principles fit with its central concerns.in any event,this doctrine is inapplicable.
whatever the present scope of the extraterritoriality doctrine,it clearly does not require per se invalidation of all extraterritorial applications contained within state statutes regulating commerce section does not regulate wholly extraterritorial commercial transactions.its regulation of plaintiffs use or sale of maine prescribers data affects only maine prescribers and regulates transactions that impact maine,with incidental effects elsewhere.it is instead one of an infinite variety of cases in which regulation of local matters may also operate as a regulation of commerce,requiring appraisal and accommodation of the competing demands of the state and national interests involved.pac,at 
the supreme court has applied the extraterritoriality doctrine sparingly,and in ways that only reinforce the conclusion that maine can regulate plaintiffs use and sale of maine prescribers identifying data.the court has only struck down two related types of statutes on extraterritoriality grounds.the first are statutes that force regulated entities to certify that the price they charge for a good is no higher than the price they charge out of state.see healy,at,at baldwin,at.the second are statutes that force an merchant to seek regulatory approval in one state before undertaking a transaction in another.healy,at see also edgar mite,at,plurality opinion.even these statutes are not invariably struck down.see cts,at upholding a statute regulating takeovers of corporations with a strong nexus by limiting the acquisition of control shares.
the maine law is easily distinguishable from the invalidated statutes.those state section raised independent concerns about protectionism under established strands of the dormant commerce clause moreover,unlike the maine law,none of the invalidated statutes dealt with harms caused exclusively inside the regulating state.nor were the invalidated statutes limited to regulating transactions with a significant inherent connection to the regulating state,and involving its own professional licensees.those differences,and not the mere fact that those statutes directly regulated transactions,explain why the supreme court deemed those statutes wholly extraterritorial 
plaintiffs attempt to analogize the maine law to these cases fails.the supreme court has previously distinguished and upheld a state statute that regulated commercial transactions with a clear nexus and impact.see cts,at other circuits have upheld similar laws on this basis.see,quik payday,stork,cir union.pub.serv.comm n,cir baltimore gas heintz,cir am.booksellers found.dean,cir.that reasoning,not the broad rule plaintiffs try to derive from healy and its antecedents,governs here under these circumstances,we hold that section regulation of plaintiffs conduct does not raise constitutional concerns under the extraterritoriality branch of the dormant commerce clause.
finally,we reject plaintiffs alternate contention that section would raise constitutional concerns under pike if applied to plaintiffs transactions plaintiffs did not make this argument to the district court their brief on appeal cursorily asserts that the law has no benefits and only costs.that is waiver.see.museum of contemporary art found.büchel,cir.this claim is also meritless.state laws frequently survive this pike scrutiny,davis,at,and section is no exception.to date,maine prescribers out of maine total prescribers have opted in to maine confidentiality protections.section regulation of plaintiffs transactions would confer clear benefits by enabling those prescribers to avoid unwanted targeting in maine.
nothing suggests that the costs to interstate commerce would be disproportionate in relation to these benefits.the loss of several hundred data points in maine,out of some total maine prescribers and million prescribers nationwide,is unlikely to seriously impact the marketability of plaintiffs products.nor have plaintiffs shown that the costs of complying with section protections meaningfully burden interstate commerce.there is no obvious reason why the maine health data organization list of maine prescribers to avoid using or selling this data would prove particularly costly or difficult,let alone enough to warrant invalidation of a state law.we also heed the cautionary note the court sounded in davis federal courts have less institutional competence than states in measuring the costs and benefits of particular state regulatory schemes.see at.
the judgment of the district court is reversed,and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice.costs are awarded to the defendant.
concurring opinion follows 
lipez,circuit judge,concurring in the judgment.the maine statute at issue here,like the new hampshire law we considered in ims health ayotte,cir,is a creative effort to meet escalating concerns about the high cost of prescription drugs and the way they are marketed.other states have passed or considered similar legislation.see,ims health sorrell,d,addressing a vermont statute ims health rowe,d,noting initiatives in other states michael heesters,comment,an assault on the business of pharmaceutical data mining.bus,same.the two statutes that we have reviewed,along with vermont,are aimed at restricting the messages that may be presented by pharmaceutical detailers to prescribers.because these provisions have the purpose and effect of regulating the content of speech,their compatibility with the first amendment is a challenging issue that inevitably will be considered by the supreme court.
the statutes specifically seek to prevent pharmaceutical detailers from using the prescribing histories of individual health care professionals in their marketing approach to prescribers.in the view of the states,these individualized sales pitches result in the of,drugs,thereby needlessly increasing public expenditures on prescription drugs and,at times,harming patient health in an effort to minimize the first amendment implications of their goal,maine and new hampshire attempted to cut off access to the prescribing information at its source.hence,the statutes prohibit the sale,transfer or other dissemination of information among pharmacies and other entities for marketing purposes,but impose no direct limitation on the drug companies or sales people who do the actual marketing the states insist that the laws thus regulate conduct,not protected speech.
as i explained in ayotte,it begs reality to characterize these laws as regulations of conduct.maine statute,like new hampshire,must be judged for what it restriction on protected speech subject to the demands of the first amendment.that view has been validated by the supreme court recent decision in united states stevens.see infra section ii.however,as construed by the state,maine law also has a substantial ripple effect beyond maine borders that requires review under the dormant commerce clause.by shifting the statute focus away from the activity considered detailers interactions with prescribers in the earlier sales of the data,the legislature in practical effect targeted transactions that occur primarily outside the state.
i agree with the majority that this reach is not fatal.i write separately,however,to highlight the unusual relationship between the first amendment and commerce clause issues.indeed,after examining the law impact on interstate commerce,i conclude that the first amendment is the appropriate battleground for constitutional analysis as these cases move through the courts.
i.the first clause dance 
as a reflection of the analytic difficulties posed by new hampshire and maine laws on the use,sale and other dissemination of data,their provisions are baffling even to their proponents.new hampshire attorney general asserted in ayotte that the law should be construed to govern only transactions,see at,an interpretation that renders the statute largely irrelevant because the transfers of data the statute purports to restrict occur almost entirely.maine,by contrast,concedes that its similarly worded provision reaches activity.at oral argument,however,when pressed about the statute reach,the state counsel asserted that section would cover the pharmaceutical detailers use in maine of the though the law appears to have been designed precisely to avoid directly restricting the detailers speech to prescribers.
counsel noted,for example,that use in maine is what the statute is directed at and that would be proscribed regardless of whether or not an transaction before that was subject to the act.counsel also stated that,i f the assumption is that the transaction between ims or one of the other plaintiffs and the drug companies occur s totally outside the state,then what the statute covers is the subsequent use in maine by the detailer.that explanation is at odds with my previous understanding of the state construction of the statute,which explicitly applies to a carrier,pharmacy or prescription drug information intermediary pdii not to pharmaceutical companies and their employees.that explanation is also at odds with the district court reading of the law.see rowe,d at the law does not make illegal a drug company use of prescriber information for marketing purposes the law forbids the pdiis from selling data for marketing,but it does not prohibit the pharmaceutical companies from using the data for marketing.
although the plaintiffs also state in their brief that drug companies fall within the statute definition of a pdii,that construction departs from plain language and ordinary usage.it may be,as plaintiffs counsel explained at oral argument,that a drug manufacturer could be treated as a pdii when it transacts directly with pharmacies or other sources of prescription data.as a general matter,however,drug companies are not pdiis,and classifying them as such when they are not acting in that capacity is not a defensible reading of the statute.thus,my assumption throughout is that the statute does not directly regulate drug manufacturers and their employees,including detailers,unless the drug manufacturer acts as its own pdii.
the confusion over how the statutes operate arises from the states attempts to achieve indirectly its ultimate the content of the detailers messages.by restricting the dissemination of data rather than the detailers messages themselves,the states hoped their laws would be evaluated as restrictions on conduct rather than speech.the first amendment consequences of regulating the content of speech do not disappear,however,simply because the regulation operates indirectly.see infra.in this instance,the indirection has only made the constitutional inquiry more complex.
in particular,the states approach magnified the commerce clause implications of the legislation because the targeted transfers of data for marketing purposes occur primarily outside of both new hampshire and maine.evidently feeling caught in a constitutional bind,the new hampshire attorney general construed her state statute to govern only stripping the law of any impact.although maine has rejected such a narrow construction,it is still scrambling to define the reach of its legislation.
in my view,the states should have confronted directly the first amendment challenges of what they sought to do.their indirect approach has not avoided first amendment scrutiny,yet they have generated the commerce clause complications that we must address here.those complications might have been avoided with more straightforward laws addressing the states concerns about pharmaceutical detailing.
ii.the first amendment 
i recognize that the majority decision in ayotte is binding precedent for the proposition that the statute at issue here,like the statute in ayotte,regulates conduct,not speech.see united states rodríguez,cir as a general rule,newly constituted panels in a circuit are bound by prior panel decisions closely on point.i must,however,my strong disagreement with the ayotte majority conclusion that statutes such as those of new hampshire and maine regulate conduct,rather than constitutionally protected speech.the purpose of both laws is to restrict,in the states view,communicated by pharmaceutical detailers to prescribing health care professionals.the state of maine admits that restricting such speech is precisely its objective.sorrell,d at plainly,the whole point of vermont statute is to control detailers commercial message to prescribers.the laws achieve this purpose by regulating the transfer of factual information.it can not reasonably be argued that these laws,with this ultimate purpose,do not constitute restrictions on speech.see ayotte,at lipez,concurring and dissenting citing cases sorrell,d at the mere fact that vermont similar provision regulates protected speech indirectly does not sweep it from the first amendment purview.laurence tribe,legal backgrounder,the fatal first amendment flaw in prescription restraint statutes,washington,available at http noting that the supreme court has recognized that obstructing access to the informational building blocks of speech is every bit as pernicious an abuse of governmental power over the free flow of information and ideas as is restricting the resulting speech itself.
in reaching its conclusion in ayotte that laws such as these are outside the ambit of the first amendment,at,the majority equated transfers of information with the limited categories of speech,such as obscenity and fighting words,that lie outside the compass of the free speech clause by virtue of longstanding tradition.id.at.in making that comparison,the majority repeatedly discounted the value of the expression that it acknowledged the new hampshire statute might regulate,describing such putative speech as items of nugatory informational value and of scant societal value.id.at.
however,in a recent decision considering a challenge to a law criminalizing depictions of animal cruelty,the supreme court firmly rejected the notion that the first amendment guarantee of free speech extend s only to categories of speech that survive an ad hoc balancing of relative social costs and benefits.stevens.at.the court explained that the exclusion of categories of speech from the protection of the first amendment has occurred only in special case s.id.at id.at listing the few limited areas where the first amendment has permitted restrictions upon the content of speech quotation marks and citation omitted.although observing that other categories of speech may yet be identified as unprotected based on historical practice,the court stated that its prior decisions can not be taken as establishing a freewheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the first amendment.id.at.
these cases involve the right to disseminate truthful classic form of protectible speech activity,even when done for a the right to use that information in crafting a marketing message.stevens confirms that such speech may not be excluded from first amendment protection on the basis that it is not worth it.at,and labeling speech as conduct does not make that exclusion any more permissible.
hence,while ayotte governs the first amendment analysis in this case,i adhere to my view that what is at stake is protectible speech,not conduct.the relevant first amendment question is thus whether maine,like new hampshire,has adequately justified the limited restraint on commercial speech imposed by its statute.here,as in ayotte,i conclude that the state has done so.
maine asserts three compelling state interests in support of section to improve public health,to limit annual increases in the cost of health care and to protect the privacy of patients and prescribers in the state health care system.ann.tit.although i agree that these interests are substantial in theory,i doubt that the record supports the state contention that the challenged statute in fact advances all of them.i am particularly skeptical of the privacy interest.
the maine law neither prohibits the practice of pharmaceutical detailing nor prevents the widespread use of any prescriber prescribing histories.see rowe,d at the attorney general expert prescriber witnesses acknowledged that insurance companies,governmental agencies,quality assurance committees,utilization reviewers,and others have the right and responsibility to assess their prescribing patterns.id.at t he new law does not prevent the pharmacies from transferring exactly the same information to the pdiis,so long as the information is not ultimately used for marketing.detailers may continue to devise marketing strategies based on the prescribing patterns of prescribers who do not choose to bar the marketing use of their information,meaning that the meeting with a prescriber who has invoked the law protection may include references to the histories of colleagues within the same town or even the same practice.see id.at.
given the wide,permissible dissemination of the prescribing information,and the continued allowance of targeted detailing,prescriber privacy does not appear to be meaningfully advanced by this statute.accord rowe,d at the law only marginally advances the governmental interest in prescriber privacy.i therefore disagree with the majority analysis of the state interest in preventing its prescribers from being subjected to unwanted solicitations by detailers in maine on the basis of their prescribing histories.the statute does not protect a right to be let alone it merely protects prescribers who consent to interactions with detailers from exposure to one type of message.the prescribers may have particular distaste for sales pitches based on their own prescribing histories,but that or not properly labeled an issue of privacy seems inadequate to justify a restriction on truthful speech of public concern.see rowe,d at prescribers prescribing patterns are a matter of public concern.
in any event,the state brief gives short shrift to both the privacy and public health interests,and i find it unnecessary to closely examine the record on those two interests because the state substantial interest in reducing health care costs in maine is sufficient to justify the statute within the commercial speech framework.ayotte,sorrell,d at finding that vermont statute advances the state interests in both cost containment and protecting public health.relying on evidence similar to that introduced in ayotte,the state argues that detailing is significantly more successful when detailers use data,and that reduced access to physicians prescribing histories will reduce the likelihood that prescribers in maine will prescribe unnecessary and more expensive drugs.i will not rehearse in detail the nature of the evidence presented on this issue at the maine legislative hearings or before the district court.it suffices to say that the record establishes a plausible relationship between targeted detailing and higher drug prices,ayotte,at,and that the attorney general has thus sufficiently demonstrated that the state interest in would be furthered to a material degree by the limitation on speech it seeks to achieve through section,id.at.
to satisfy the first amendment,the statute also must meet the narrow tailoring prong of the central hudson inquiry.see central hudson gas pub.serv.comm n.without the benefit of our decision in ayotte,the district court concluded that the maine law substantially fails the narrow tailoring requirement.rowe,d at.that judgment is wrong largely for the same reasons that it was wrong in ayotte.
in concluding that the law is more extensive than necessary to serve the state interest in decreasing the influence of drug company representatives,the district court emphasized that the state did not address the concern that detailers inappropriately influenc e maine prescribers by showering them with gifts in implicit exchange for prescriptions.id.it also pointed out that prescribers are t rained as professionals to perform a sophisticated and critical public health function.id.at.it stated that these trained professionals have access to a broad range of sources to evaluate whether to prescribe a drug for a particular patient.id.therefore,the law unnecessarily protects them from being influenced by their own practice patterns.id.specifically on the cost issue,the district court observed that some branded drugs end up being more cost effective to the system as a whole than their generic or branded counterparts.id.at.in that sense,the court stated,the maine law fails to discriminate between beneficial detailing and harmful detailing.id.quotation marks and citation omitted.the court thus concluded that ban ning truthful information about prescribers prescription patterns is to overreach and restrict more speech than is necessary to address the problem of harmful detailing.id.
the district court narrow tailoring assessment does not adequately take into account the premise from which it must proceed,that the state has shown that restricting the use of data advances at least one of its asserted the spiraling cost of prescription drugs.the court seems to assume that the alternatives it describes will be just as effective in advancing that goal.
as i have explained,the state evidence in both ayotte and here supports the view that,despite the expertise of medical professionals,detailers are able to influence prescribing decisions.i also explained in ayotte why the state could properly conclude that alternative methods for achieving its objective that would not burden speech,including restricting courtesy samples and other gifts,were not equivalent.as i noted there,t he samples and gifts are merely a preparatory step in the marketing process while they may increase the prescribers susceptibility to the sales pitch,the state reasonably concluded that it is the sales pitch itself that has the most troubling effect on the prescribers drug is most urgently in need of regulation.at 
the fact that detailing at times has beneficial effects does not undermine the state conclusion that,on balance,its harms outweigh its where the state reasonably could find that the benefits of the messages about prescription drugs that are disseminated by detailers are largely achievable in other ways.at see also rowe,d at.notably,the state restriction on speech is significantly more restrained than other marketing or advertising bans that have been considered by the supreme court.see ayotte,at citing cases involving more comprehensive restrictions.as i described in ayotte,the private setting of the targeted messages also is relevant to the narrow tailoring inquiry 
this case differs from those in which the court has rejected advertising bans that restrict the exchange of ideas in the commercial marketplace.the act neither protects the public from information about drugs nor prevents truthful advocacy by pharmaceutical representatives.instead,it prevents sales representatives from crafting personal marketing messages on the basis of data that credible evidence indicates has been used to unduly influence prescribing choices.the supreme court on multiple occasions has reviewed regulation of such direct solicitations,upholding restrictions where the context raised concerns about the impact of the marketing on the recipient.
indeed,the narrow tailoring element of the central hudson test is arguably more easily satisfied here than in ayotte because the statute bars the marketing use of prescribing histories only for prescribers who affirmatively choose not to have their data used for marketing the impact on protected speech.although the state objective would have modest success,at best,if few maine prescribers choose to restrict the use of their prescribing data,the restriction on protected speech also would be modest in that situation.i see no constitutional barrier to the state judgment that restricting the use of data in the detailing messages of only some of its prescribers would be beneficial 
in sum,the considerations i addressed in ayotte to evaluate whether the extent of the restriction on protected speech is in reasonable proportion to the interest served,at quoting edenfield fane,apply here as well t he inadequacy of alternatives to satisfy the state interests,the context of private communications,and the limited impact on the message sought to be disseminated.at.my review of these factors leads me to the same conclusion the state has established a reasonable fit between its abridgement of speech and its goal.id.at quotation marks and citation omitted see also sorell,d at finding the vermont statute to be in reasonable proportion to the state interests.
hence,like new hampshire,maine has met its burden to justify the limited restraint on commercial speech imposed by section.
iii.the commerce clause 
this case confirms the view i expressed in ayotte that the plaintiffs commerce clause challenge raised a serious issue that should not have been addressed in that case on the basis of the limited record and the parties cursory briefing.maine distances itself from the nonsensical construction of the new hampshire statute that was advanced by the new hampshire attorney general and accepted by the ayotte majority admitting that its statute inevitably reaches out of state to regulate sales of data about prescriptions written in maine.indeed,the activity restricted by the maine statute,logically construed,occurs almost entirely beyond the state borders 
a.the activities regulated by the statute 
understanding the sequence of events implicated by section is crucial to understanding the statute legal status.to begin with the end,the statute is designed to prevent pharmaceutical detailers working in maine from using information about the prescribing habits of maine prescribers to present targeted,and therefore more persuasive,sales pitches to those prescribers.the statute does not,however,regulate the detailers interactions with the prescribers.instead,the state seeks to achieve its objective indirectly by,in effect,placing a red flag on information about prescriptions written by maine prescribers who opt into the statute protection.the information may not be used,sold or transferred for any marketing purpose by pharmacies,insurers and other entities that acquire it in the course of their business 
in practical effect,that prohibition rarely limits any commercial transactions in maine.this is so because local maine pharmacies routinely transfer their prescription information electronically to their headquarters although the red flag is attached to the information when those transfers are made,the statutory prohibition does not affect this first movement of the data because it is not for any marketing purpose.most data leaves the state in this permissible manner.the data is next transferred from the pharmacy headquarters to the data mining plaintiffs in this also are located outside of maine the red flag imposes a significant restriction on those transactions.although data miners use prescription information for other reasons,including to generate reports for government and other nonprofit recipients,the most lucrative aspect of their business is to aggregate the information into reports that can be sold to pharmaceutical companies for use in marketing 
hence,the pharmacies and data miners,although not themselves using the data to market drugs,presumably must impose a contractual obligation on their customers not to use the information for that purpose in order to fulfill their obligations under section.see rowe,d at t he pdiis are assigned the responsibility to limit the pharmaceutical companies use of the prescriber data.how the state would enforce the statute if a pharmaceutical manufacturer does not abide by such a contract with a data miner is unclear.perhaps the data miners would be deemed liable for failing to enforce the obligation unless they took action against the offending drug company such action might include a refusal to continue selling the information to the company 
whatever the specific mechanism for enforcement of the statute prohibition,the statute objective is to prevent the use of any data obtained by the drug companies in sales pitches by the detailers in maine who are the statute real target as my description of the process reveals,however,achieving that objective involves raising the red flag in transactions that almost all occur beyond maine borders.nearly all of the transfers between the information pharmacies and data the information data miners and pharmaceutical made out of state.so too are any contractual promises by the recipients to abide by the statute limitation.
the plaintiffs complain that this significant extraterritorial effect is impermissible under the dormant commerce clause.the state,however,maintains that the statute has only a spillover effect beyond its borders,and it argues that the law applies only to entities either located in maine or having nexus with maine,those sufficiently connected to the state to meet the requirements for personal jurisdiction.the state asserts that it is irrelevant that the main computers of the large retail pharmacy chains are located outside maine because maine is the source of the restricted information,and the electronic prescription data is initially entered into computers.the state further emphasizes that the prescriptions are written by prescribers licensed by maine and filled almost exclusively by pharmacies,giving maine a substantial interest in governing the dissemination and use of the prescription data.
the difficulty of evaluating the parties competing depictions of section begins with the choice of an appropriate framework for analysis.
identifying the correct analytical approach 
the supreme court has articulated various protocol s for dormant commerce clause analysis,dep t of revenue of davis,none of which seems fully apt here.this is plainly not an instance of discriminatory purpose or treatment in which the statute should be deemed per se invalid because it favors over interests.see,alliance of auto.mfrs.gwadowsky,cir noting that the core purpose of the dormant commerce clause is to prevent states and their political subdivisions from promulgating protectionist policies quotation marks and citation omitted.the law imposes the same burden on every competitor,and entities would gain no advantage by relocating to maine 
plaintiffs,unsurprisingly,have relied primarily on the extraterritoriality doctrine,and the proposition that a statute may be deemed per se invalid if it directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a state.healy beer,see also wine spirits retailers,rhode island wine spirits ii,cir pharm.research mfrs.of am.concannon phrma,cir,aff sub nom.pharm.research mfrs.of am.walsh.such laws may subject activities to more than one state regulations,leading to the possibility of conflicting obligations.see,healy,at cts dynamics of,peter felmly,comment,beyond the reach of states the dormant commerce clause,extraterritorial state regulation,and the concerns of federalism,me,observing that the extraterritoriality principle ensures that a state will not overstep its bounds and unreasonably trample upon the authority of another sovereign.plaintiffs also invoke the pike balancing test,which is applied to laws that regulate evenhandedly and have only incidental effects on interstate commerce.see pike bruce church,see also united haulers ass n,solid waste mgmt,
neither of these latter alternatives is a good fit for the present circumstances.the per se extraterritoriality analysis may appear literally applicable,given that the statute red flag has a direct impact almost exclusively on commerce.yet,as i observed in ayotte,whether extraterritoriality is impermissible in every instance,or whether it transgresses the dormant commerce clause only when the challenged statute is discriminatory or protectionist in nature,appears to be a relevant consideration.at citing felmly,supra,at.the maine law does not by its terms impose restraints on businesses,and the imbalance between and effect is a matter of happenstance not design.the statute does not seek to achieve conformity between and commerce additionally,there is no risk of conflict with other states regimes.no other state has a stake in the use of data in maine or any obvious interest in the use of maine prescriber information in their own locales.
indeed,it is arguable that,despite the statute impact on commercial transactions that occur almost entirely out of state,the commerce it controls is not wholly outside maine boundaries.healy,at.the subject matter of the law is data that both originates in maine and is intended for marketing use in maine.maine aim is to regulate on a matter of public welfare only within maine.midwest title loans,mills,cir invalidating indiana statute that sought to protect indiana residents from predatory lending practices by businesses located in other states.on the other hand,it is difficult to characterize the statute effect on commerce as incidental when its prohibition in fact has its primary impact outside the state.see,healy,at the critical inquiry is whether the practical effect of the regulation is to control conduct beyond the boundaries of the state.
the various labels ordinarily are invoked because they are associated with different levels of scrutiny.we have observed that a statute that regulates evenhandedly engenders a lower level of scrutiny,wine and spirits ii,at quotation marks and citation omitted,while a statute is per se invalid if it regulates commerce wholly outside the state borders,id.at.identifying the appropriate label should not distract us,however,or bog us down at the threshold of analysis.despite the different protocols for dormant commerce clause inquiry,the supreme court has observed that there is no clear line separating the various types of state regulation and that the same critical consideration applies to each category the overall effect of the statute on both local and interstate activity.distillers new york state liquor,referring to regulations that are virtually per se invalid under the commerce clause,and the category subject to the pike bruce church balancing approach see also healy,at noting the same critical consideration in determining whether the extraterritorial reach of a statute violates the commerce clause am.booksellers found.dean,cir.
this dual concern is an inevitable byproduct of our system of federalism.the court has often remarked in its dormant commerce clause cases that states retain authority under their general police powers to regulate matters of legitimate local concern,even though interstate commerce may be affected.maine taylor,quotation marks and citation omitted see also,davis,at garcia san antonio metro.transit.hence,in reviewing a statute challenged under the dormant commerce clause,we are always guided by the constitution special concern both with the maintenance of a national economic union unfettered by limitations on interstate commerce and with the autonomy of the individual states within their respective spheres.healy,at footnote omitted.
indeed,even the rigorous form of review applicable to discriminatory legislation allows exemption for a statute that furthers a legitimate local objective that can not be served by reasonable means.wine and spirits ii,at.local needs also must qualify the rule of per se invalidity for statutes that regulate extraterritorially.see felmy,supra,at id.at observing that o ne may infer from language in cts,at,that where a state has a significant interest in regulating a particular aspect of interstate commerce,it may do so,regardless of the extraterritorial effect of the legislation,if the regulation also affects a substantial number of residents.
i thus see the most relevant and appropriate question as simply whether maine interests are sufficiently weighty to justify any burdens its law imposes on interstate commerce.whatever the label and however we describe the level of scrutiny,the outcome here is the same.
assessing the local interest and the burden on interstate commerce 
as discussed in section ii above,i agree that the state has a substantial interest in reducing the cost of prescription drugs for its residents and that the state could reasonably conclude that section advances that interest by regulating the dissemination of information revealing the prescribing histories of maine licensed health care providers.ayotte,at.the statute importance to the state is no different in the context of a commerce clause inquiry than in the first amendment setting.
the other side of the balance is not the same,however.the conclusion that the statute is narrowly tailored under the central hudson test for commercial speech,see at,does not tell us whether the provision impermissibly burdens interstate commerce.as i have described,the statute does in fact regulate specific activities that occur mostly out of state.the impact on the plaintiffs is not merely spillover from a prohibition directed at others they are among the categories of directly by the statute.
moreover,the statute impact on pdiis is potentially enormous.sales of data are the of the medical data mining business,producing billion in revenue for plaintiff ims health alone in.although only three states have thus far enacted laws designed to limit detailers access to prescribers identifying information,they are at the front of a wave of similar legislation.see rowe,d at noting testimony that seventeen to twenty other states were considering similar laws heesters,supra,at stating that numerous other states have bills that similarly restrict the sale of prescription drug data that are currently pending in legislative committees.
hence,a conclusion that section comports with the dormant commerce clause could eventually lead to elimination of any market for data,which the plaintiffs have argued would jeopardize the viability of their businesses.see ayotte,at plaintiffs theorize that the pharmaceutical companies would be unwilling to pay substantial sums for information they can not use in marketing,eliminating the data miners biggest cutting off the commercial funding that subsidizes the research and other uses of the data.plaintiff ims asserts that it will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for it to adjust its systems to comply with the statute restrictions plaintiff source healthcare estimated that it would spend employee hours to comply with maine and vermont laws.
the possible effects on the profits of the individual manufacturers is not,however,the concern of the dormant commerce clause.phrma,at.our court previously has observed that the commerce clause protects the interstate market,not particular interstate firms,from prohibitive or burdensome regulations.pharm.care mgmt.ass rowe,cir quoting exxon of,see also phrma,at t he fact that a law may have devastating economic consequences on a particular interstate firm is not sufficient to rise to a commerce clause burden.quotation marks and citations omitted.even if the statute meant the demise of the industry as a outcome i doubt,see infra note from that result would relate to the wisdom of the statute,not to its burden on commerce.exxon,at.the point is perhaps more easily understood in a different context.if,for example,every state decided to ban the use of firecrackers because of the risk of injury,the dormant commerce clause would not trump the legislative safety concerns and insulate the fireworks industry from extinction.
neither national uniformity nor any of the other traditional concerns underlying the dormant commerce clause are implicated here.the law does not erect barriers against interstate trade,lewis bt.inv.managers,and its target is not interstate commerce as such.rather,the transactions governed by the statute are restricted only because they are subsidiary steps in the regulation of activity indeed,the law effect on individual businesses would be no different if every pdii were based in maine.nor does maine decision to restrict the use of certain data make similar legislation more or less appropriate or necessary in other states.there is nothing in maine statute that affects other states choices about whether,or how,to regulate data within their own borders.as the supreme court observed in exxon,t he evil that appellants perceive in this litigation is not that the several states will enact differing regulations,but rather that they will all conclude that similar provisions are warranted.at.however,i n the absence of a relevant congressional declaration of policy,or a showing of a specific discrimination against,or burdening of,interstate commerce,we can not conclude that the states are without power to regulate in this area.id.at.
nor do i see a way in which maine could have promoted its interest with a lesser impact on interstate activities,minnesota clover leaf creamery,quoting pike,at a factor that is considered in pike balancing.see,u i sanitation columbus,cir.if maine had regulated only barring detailers working in maine from using the prescribers data in their sales impact on data miners would be the same.in such a regime,the data miners would not be prohibited from selling the data for marketing purposes,but the pharmaceutical companies would have no reason to buy it 
in sum,i conclude that section survives dormant commerce clause scrutiny even though in practical effect it regulates activity that occurs primarily beyond maine borders.the burden on interstate commerce the reduction in the value of a particular type of business is not the kind of burden that raises constitutional concerns.to the extent that burden is relevant to the commerce clause analysis,it is easily outweighed by the state substantial interest in bringing the cost of prescription health care expenses in control.pharm.care mgmt.ass n,at describing a law aimed at reduc ing the costs of,and increas ing the public access to,prescription drugs as designed to deal with one of the serious problems of our time.
i therefore agree that the judgment of the district court should be reversed.
iv.the focus of future litigation 
this case has allowed us to put to rest the commerce clause challenge that was not properly teed up in ayotte.in addition,in the period between our reviews of new hampshire and maine similar statutes,stevens has reinforced my view that laws regulating the messages of pharmaceutical detailers restrict protectible speech,not conduct.thus,as more of these cases evolve across the country,the legal argument and factual development should be framed by the supreme court commercial speech doctrine under the first amendment.
that doctrine is the subject of ongoing debate among commentators and in the courts,including within the supreme court.much of the ferment focuses on the narrow tailoring prong of the central hudson inquiry and how close the fit must be in any commercial speech case between the state interest and the challenged restriction on speech.see greater new orleans broad.ass n,united states,recognizing the advocacy among judges,scholars and others for a more straightforward and stringent test for assessing the validity of government restrictions on commercial speech see also thompson states med,breyer,dissenting chastising the majority for applying the commercial speech doctrine too strictly in finding that a statute prohibiting the advertising of compounded drugs was not narrowly tailored ayotte,at discussing the debate on central hudson continuing viability elizabeth spring,note,sales versus safety the loss of balance in the commercial speech standard in thompson western states medical center,davis,t he court is now applying the central hudson test in a manner approaching strict scrutiny review.
in addition,there is a claim by some that these particular laws should not be assessed as regulations of commercial speech,with the lesser scrutiny that attends such measures,but rather as regulations of truthful speech on matters of profound public importance.tribe,supra see also rowe,d at describing as a thorny question whether maine regulation should be given intermediate or strict scrutiny and raising the possibility that the speech here is not purely commercial speech and is subject to strict scrutiny because it is a matter of public concern tribe,supra even if the prescription restraint laws were subject to the more forgiving standard applicable to regulations of purely commercial speech,however,they would still be unconstitutional because they violate the core principle that the government may not restrict even commercial communication merely to block the dissemination of truth.although in ayotte i found no merit in the argument that new hampshire statute should be analyzed as a restriction on speech subject to strict scrutiny,see ayotte,at accord sorrell,d at the contrary view has worthy proponents and undoubtedly deserves close consideration.
yet another source of difficulty is the quality of the record a state legislature must amass to prove that a statute advances its interest and extends no more broadly than necessary to achieve its objectives.i concluded in ayotte that the district court had held the attorney general to an overly demanding standard of proof.here,too,the court underestimated the strength of the state showing.as i explained in ayotte,a state legislature investigation can not reasonably be expected to match the exhaustive investigation congress conducts in connection with complex federal legislation.see at referring to the tens of thousands of pages of materials acquired during three years of congressional hearings on provisions of the cable television consumer protection and competition act of.
although the extent of the required proof may differ,the question in both federal and state contexts is the same whether the government is able to support its restriction on speech by adduc ing either empirical support or at least sound reasoning on behalf of its measure.id.at quoting turner broad,fcc.a further complexity,however,is whether the general principle of legislative deference should operate the same way in both settings,despite differences in the scope of the underlying record.id.in turner broadcasting,the supreme court observed that congress findings were entitled to deference in part because the institution is far better equipped than the judiciary to amass and evaluate the vast amounts of data bearing upon legislative questions.turner broad,fcc,quotation marks and citation omitted.
the district court in this case puzzled over the appropriate level of deference for the legislature findings,noting the subtle distinction between judicial deference and judicial respect to a legislature in a first amendment case.d at.it noted the ayotte trial court conclusion that the legislature predictive judgments were entitled to respect,but not deference,because there was nothing in the record to support a conclusion that the legislature had established expertise in the regulation of data.id.quoting ims health ayotte,d,yet the court also cited the supreme court statement in turner broadcasting that the obligation to exercise independent judgment when first amendment rights are implicated is not a license to reweigh the evidence de novo,or to replace legislative factual predictions with our own.id.at.indeed,the supreme court has permitted litigants to justify speech restrictions by reference to studies and anecdotes pertaining to different locales altogether,or even,in a case applying strict scrutiny,to justify restrictions based solely on history,consensus,and simple common sense.florida bar went for it,citations omitted.
the legislative records in new hampshire and maine were necessarily limited.given the novelty of their statutes,neither state could offer empirical data showing the extent of the influence of information on physicians or proving the impact of their provisions.at.both states,however,adduced evidence of the impact of detailing generally and presented anecdotal evidence strongly indicating that sales pitches based on specific prescribing patterns have a particularly persuasive impact on drug choice.id.at rowe,d at.new hampshire offered expert evidence in defense of its view that alternative strategies,less burdensome on speech,would not suffice.ayotte,at.at this point in time,such evidence was sufficient in each case to establish a factual basis justifying the initiative.id.at.equivalent evidence may not be enough to support the adoption of similar legislation in other states,however,if more extensive quantifiable data becomes available.ayotte,at i t will be important going forward for the state to try to measure the effect of its initiative,and it is possible that this ongoing assessment will indicate that the measure is not as effective as the state had hoped.
without a doubt,the states must have flexibility to experiment with measures that will help them address the serious problem of spiraling drug costs.at the same time,the restriction of speech based on its content is a serious constitutional matter.the tension between those principles in laws such as those enacted in new hampshire,maine and vermont presents a challenge to the supreme court commercial speech jurisprudence that warrants the court attention and guidance.
