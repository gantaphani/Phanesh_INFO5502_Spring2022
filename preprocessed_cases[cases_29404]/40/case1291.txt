robert reynolds is homeless and supports himself by soliciting donations in henrico county,virginia.reynolds brought an action raising first amendment challenges to a henrico county ordinance that prohibits solicitation within county roadways.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the county,and reynolds appeals.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
prior to,henrico county had an ordinance that prohibited those standing in county roadways,which the ordinance defined to include the medians,from distributing handbills,soliciting contributions,or selling merchandise to car drivers or passengers.roadway solicitors got around the ordinance by soliciting funds while sitting in the medians.
police chief douglas middleton,the named defendant,urged the henrico county board of supervisors to consider amending the ordinance to prohibit all roadway solicitation while standing or sitting.at a public hearing on the issue,middleton stated that the number of people soliciting while sitting in medians had increased i n the past few years and particularly the current year,and that this increase had led to an increased number of complaints from citizens.middleton explained that he believed soliciting from the median was dangerous to the solicitors and to drivers and that prohibiting would make the roads safer.middleton stated that as chief of police i can not ignore the increasingly present danger that the current activities are creating,and i would rather proceed to avoid a tragedy,and i am responding to that in a proactive manner as opposed to being reactive.
middleton did not consult or other experts before seeking the changes to the ordinance,but based his proposal on his opinion that it is unsafe to solicit in the highway,an opinion that he based on his personal observations,the credible reports of other officers and citizens,and his experience as a officer for over years.middleton did not give any specific examples of accidents or other problems caused by in his deposition testimony or in his statements at the public hearing.
the county attorney office prepared a report addressing solicitation on county highways.the report stated that there had been an increased presence of roadway solicitors in county highways,especially in the medians of numerous intersections in the west end of the county,and that n umerous complaints have been received from county citizens over the past several months.according to the report,police received calls for service concerning panhandling in and received such calls in the first months of.there is no other empirical evidence in the record of actual problems caused by panhandling or soliciting from medians.
the board of supervisors agreed with middleton and voted to amend the ordinance.the amended version of the ordinance the amended ordinance provides as follows 
distributing handbills,soliciting contributions or selling merchandise or services in highway.
a it shall be unlawful for any person while in the highway to 
distribute handbills,leaflets,bulletins,literature,advertisements or similar material to the drivers of motor vehicles or passengers therein on highways located within the county.
solicit contributions of any nature from the drivers of motor vehicles or passengers therein on highways located within the county.
sell or attempt to sell merchandise or services to the drivers of motor vehicles or passengers therein on highways located within in the county.
b for purposes of this section,the term highway means the entire width of a road or street that is improved,designed,or ordinarily used for vehicular travel and the shoulder,the median,and the area between the travel lane and the back of the curb.
given the definition of highway,the amended ordinance prohibits a homeless person from sitting or standing in a median with a sign asking for donations or offering to work in exchange for food,but it permits,for example,campaign workers with signs urging drivers to vote for their candidate to gather in the medians.solicitation and other activities prohibited on the highways and medians remain permissible on county sidewalks,which are not included in the definition of highway.
acting pro se,reynolds brought this action challenging the amended ordinance on first amendment grounds.reynolds and the county for summary judgment.the district court denied reynolds motion and granted the county.the court recognized that streets and medians are traditional public forums,but the court nonetheless upheld the amended ordinance as a and narrowly tailored time,place,and manner restriction on speech.this appeal followed.
there is no question that panhandling and solicitation of charitable contributions are protected speech.see clatterbuck city of charlottesville,cir.there is likewise no question that public streets and medians qualify as traditional public forum s.id.at see warren fairfax,cir en banc median strips,like sidewalks,are integral parts of the public thoroughfares that constitute the traditional public fora.
the government power to regulate speech in a traditional public forum is limited,though not foreclosed.clatterbuck,at.time,place,and manner regulations of speech in traditional public forums are subject to intermediate scrutiny that is,the restrictions must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.see ross early,cir,cert.denied,d.a regulation is narrowly tailored if it does not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government legitimate interests.mccullen coakley,d internal quotation marks omitted.to be valid,the regulation need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of serving the government interests.but the government still may not regulate expression in such a manner that a substantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
reynolds,now represented by counsel,challenges the district court decision upholding the amended ordinance.reynolds argues that the county bears the burden of proof and that the county evidence was insufficient to establish that the amended ordinance is narrowly tailored or that it leaves open ample alternative channels of communication 
we begin with the burden of proof.w here a plaintiff claims suppression of speech under the first amendment,the plaintiff bears the initial burden of proving that speech was restricted by the governmental action in question.lim city of long beach,cir see american legion post city of durham,cir threshold determination triggering application of first amendment scrutiny is whether challenged regulation burdens speech.after the plaintiff makes his initial showing,the burden then falls on the government to prove the constitutionality of the speech restriction.see mccullen.at to meet the requirement of narrow tailoring,the government must demonstrate that the speech restriction meets the relevant requirements.emphasis added see also edenfield fane,d it is well established that the party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
here,reynolds made the necessary threshold showing.as discussed,solicitation of charitable contributions is speech,and reynolds alleged in his verified complaint that the amended ordinance inhibits his ability to collect donations by requiring him to move to locations where it is more difficult for drivers to make contributions see williams griffin,cir verified complaint is the equivalent of an opposing affidavit for summary judgment purposes,when the allegations contained therein are based on personal knowledge.the county was therefore obligated to prove that the amended ordinance is narrowly tailored to further a significant government interest and that it leaves open ample alternative channels of communication.
the more difficult issue and the issue on which this appeal turns is determining precisely what the county must present in order to carry its burden of proof.the county contends that intermediate scrutiny does not always require an evidentiary showing,brief of respondent at,and that it is entitled to rely on common sense and logic,as well case law and the experience of other jurisdictions,when defending the amended ordinance.
the county formulation certainly finds support in our precedent.we have not required an evidentiary record to uphold a speech regulation that is materially indistinguishable from one that has been found constitutional by this court or the supreme court.see wag more dogs,llc cozart,cir c onsistent with over thirty years of case law from the supreme court and our court,the county defendant has established that the sign ordinance passes constitutional muster under the rubric of intermediate scrutiny.it need not reinvent the wheel by coming forward with voluminous evidence justifying a regulation of the type that has been upheld several times over.likewise,we generally have not required the government to present evidence to show the existence of a significant governmental interest common sense and the holdings of prior cases have been found sufficient to establish,for example,that the government has a significant interest in public safety.see ross,at american legion post,at united states chapman,cir recognizing that common sense and case law can establish the existence of governmental interest in second amendment case subject to intermediate scrutiny.
as to the other requirements,our cases have not been entirely clear about what the government must present in order to carry its burden.for example,we have held that intermediate scrutiny requires the government to produce evidence that a challenged regulation materially advances an important or substantial interest by redressing past harms or preventing future ones.giovani carandola,bason,cir emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.we have explained that although the government need not present a panoply of empirical evidence in order to satisfy this standard,it must nonetheless make some evidentiary showing that the recited harms are real,not merely conjectural,and that the challenged regulation alleviates these harms in a direct and material way.ross,at emphasis added citations,internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.while these cases seem to insist on evidence,we have in some cases nonetheless relied on things other than objective evidence when determining that speech restrictions advanced the government asserted interest.see,ross,at relying on appeals to common sense and logic internal quotation marks omitted educational media at,swecker,cir relying on history,consensus,and common sense.
in our view,however,the supreme court recent decision in mccullen coakley clarifies what is necessary to carry the government burden of proof under intermediate scrutiny.mccullen involved a first amendment challenge to a massachusetts statute that prohibited standing on a public way or sidewalk within feet of an entrance or driveway of an abortion clinic.mccullen.at.after a bench trial on stipulated facts,the district court upheld the statute,and the first circuit affirmed.the supreme court applied intermediate scrutiny the same standard we apply in this case and reversed.
as to whether the statute furthered a significant governmental interest,the court referred to prior case law recognizing the legitimacy of the government interests in public safety and the unobstructed use of roadways and sidewalks and then stated,without reference to any evidence presented at trial,that t he buffer zones clearly serve these interests.id.at.the court nonetheless held that the statute was not narrowly tailored because it burdened substantially more speech than necessary to serve those interests.in rejecting the commonwealth arguments,the court repeatedly grounded its conclusions on the absence of evidence supporting the commonwealth arguments.see id.at respondents point us to no evidence that individuals regularly gather at other clinics,or at other times in boston,in sufficiently large groups to obstruct access.id.rejecting state argument that enforcing existing laws would not prevent the safety and congestion problems addressed by the statute because the commonwealth did not identify a single prosecution brought under those laws within at least the last years and therefore has not shown that it seriously undertook to address the problem with less intrusive tools readily available to it id.at given the vital first amendment interests at stake,it is not enough for massachusetts simply to say that other approaches have not worked.
we draw several lessons from the court decision in mccullen.first,the court discussion of whether the statute furthered an important governmental interest confirms that the existence of a governmental interest may be established by reference to case law.see id.at.second,the court flat declaration that t he buffer zones clearly serve these interests,indicates that objective evidence is not always required to show that a speech restriction furthers the government interests finally,the court rejection of the commonwealth arguments makes it clear that intermediate scrutiny does indeed require the government to present actual evidence supporting its assertion that a speech restriction does not burden substantially more speech than necessary argument unsupported by the evidence will not suffice to carry the government burden.with these principles in mind,we turn now to reynolds substantive challenges to the amended ordinance.
reynolds argues the county failed to prove that the amended ordinance is narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.
the county contends that the solicitation activities that the amended ordinance prohibits can obstruct traffic and are dangerous to drivers and solicitors alike,and that the amended ordinance furthers the county interests in safety and unobstructed use of its highways.reynolds does not dispute that the county asserted interests are legitimate and substantial.see mccullen.at recognizing the legitimacy of the government interests in ensuring public safety and order and promoting the free flow of traffic on streets internal quotation marks omitted brown town of cary,cir it is beyond dispute that the town stated interests in promoting aesthetics and traffic safety are substantial.instead,reynolds contends that the county evidence was insufficient to establish that the prohibited by the amended ordinance is dangerous or that the amended ordinance actually furthers the county asserted interests.we disagree.
under intermediate scrutiny,the county is required to demonstrate that the amended ordinance materially advances an important or substantial interest by redressing past harms or preventing future ones.ross,at internal quotation marks omitted.chief middleton testified about the increasing number of people soliciting contributions from intersections,many of which are very busy,and he described potential dangers associated with that activity,see j.noting that roadway solicitors might misjudge the traffic and step out in front of a car and that an inattentive driver might run up onto the curb.even without evidence of injuries or accidents involving roadway solicitors,we believe the county evidence,particularly when it is considered along with a healthy dose of common sense,is sufficient to establish that roadway solicitation is generally dangerous.see ross,at explaining that the government is entitled to advance its interests by arguments based on appeals to common sense and logic internal quotation marks omitted.
and once we accept that roadway solicitation is dangerous,then it is apparent that the amended ordinance furthers the county safety interests.indeed,we believe it is as obvious that the amended ordinance furthers the county safety interests as it was obvious that the statute in mccullen furthered massachusetts safety interests,as both move pedestrians out of roadways and away from traffic.while the record in this case does not establish how many people solicit from the roadways or how many use the roadways for purposes permitted by the amended ordinance,it does establis
