this case involves claims for political discrimination and speech retaliation in violation of the first amendment.plaintiff teresita worked as a transitory government employee in puerto rico.toward the end of her term of employment,she applied for,and was denied,a permanent position.she subsequently filed suit under the civil rights act of,alleging that defendant maría,who was responsible for the hiring decision,violated the first amendment by considering her political affiliation and protected speech activity in the hiring decision.after a trial,the jury returned a verdict for on both theories,awarding her in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.
now challenges both the imposition of liability and the amount of damages.considering the arguments that has made,and disregarding others that might have been made but were not,we affirm the judgment as to the speech retaliation claim and compensatory damages,reverse as to the political discrimination claim,vacate the punitive damages award,and remand to the district court for a new trial on punitive damages unless consents to a reduction of her award from to.
we draw the facts from the trial record,reciting them in the light most favorable to the verdict.marcano rivera turabo medical ctr,cir.
the basic factual outline is not in dispute.plaintiff teresita former employer,the puerto rico tourism company the tourism company or the company,is a public corporation of the commonwealth of puerto rico.laws ann.tit.began work as a transitory employee within the company tourism transportation division on june.by contract,her term of employment was set to last for six months.defendant maría was the company director of tourism transportation at the time.
the tourism transportation division was a new addition to the tourism company when began work.in,the legislative assembly of puerto rico assigned the company responsibility for r egulating,investigating,overseeing,intervening and imposing sanctions to those juridical persons or entities engaged in rendering tourist ground transportation services in the commonwealth of puerto rico.laws ann.tit.the tourism transportation division was created to perform those new duties.began working in march of as the only employee within the new division.because she had only three months to bring the new division to full operational capacity,she initially hired many employees on a transitory basis.she explained that transitory appointments have a birth date and an ending and are exempt from the ordinary public notice and competitive entrance requirements for civil service positions.
was one such transitory employee.she left her former job to work for six months as a tourism transportation officer within the overseeing division of the tourism transportation division she claims that she was promised that she would be hired on a permanent basis at the end of her transitory appointment.the tourism transportation officers worked in the operational arm of the tourism transportation division,which was known as the overseeing division.their duty stations were primarily at ports and airports.worked at luis muñoz marín international airport,where her basic responsibilities were to inspect luxury vehicles and taxis for compliance with commonwealth safety regulations to check those vehicles documentation to orient tourists regarding ground transportation services to handle complaints and to submit daily reports on the work she performed.several layers of management separated from,and the two women had little contact with one another.described the overseeing division as the most delicate area under her supervision because of the constant interaction between her employees and the tourists,drivers,and airport personnel.
by all accounts,was a conscientious employee who vigorously enforced the safety regulations within her purview.her supervisors reviews were consistently glowing.the luxury vehicle and taxi drivers received her efforts with less enthusiasm,however.on several occasions,drivers became angry with for performing inspections in what they perceived to be an overly aggressive manner.the luxury vehicle drivers,in particular,were not accustomed to close scrutiny,and they pressured the tourism company to rein in and the other tourism transportation officers.
in december of,two supervisors instructed the tourism transportation officers to hold your horses and stop issuing citations to luxury vehicles that were not in compliance with the safety regulations.the officers understood the instruction to have come from.complained to william,a shift supervisor,that she was uncomfortable with the new policy because she thought it reflected a lack of respect for the work she and her were performing,and because the lax enforcement would put the tourist,who is the person that is paying for service,his life was at risk.she made similar complaints to two other employees cesar ramos,a shift supervisor,and julia palacios,an attorney.
around the same time,and a number of her transitory applied for permanent positions as tourism transportation officers.there was testimony that all the transitory employees expected to be appointed to permanent positions as long as their performance was satisfactory.however,on january,one day after the transitory appointments expired,was told that she would not be appointed to a permanent position and should turn in her identification to the human resources office.later testified that she decided not to recommend for a permanent position because 
there were so many complaints that had been received in the way that she performed the interventions,that we really could afford the luxury,the clientele that we deal with in transportation,i always say that it is like a minefield.well,in this case that would happen could certainly,as we puerto ricans say,could set off the beehive.so i did need personnel that would add more of a did need more personnel to add more situations to the ones that they already had.
the following year,commenced an action in the district of puerto rico under,naming and others as defendants alleged that chose not to appoint her to a permanent position because of her political views and in retaliation for complaining about the hold your horses instruction,all in violation of the first amendment.after a trial,the jury returned a verdict for on both claims.the jury awarded for lost income and benefits for pain and suffering,and in punitive damages.the district court denied motions for judgment as a matter of law and her motion for a new trial remittitur.this appeal followed.
we review the district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.eye and ear infirmary qlt phototherapeutics,cir.a rule motion is properly granted when the facts and inferences viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the movant that a reasonable jury could not have returned the verdict.id.quoting borges colón,cir.
as framed in the district court instructions and the verdict form,the question before the jury was whether decision not to hire to a permanent position was motivated by impermissible considerations.the jury found that two such considerations entered into the hiring decision.first,it found that discriminated against based on political beliefs or ideas.second,it found that retaliated against because of speech activity.
each of these findings implicates a distinct line of first amendment cases.under the first line of cases,government officials are forbidden from taking adverse action against public employees on the basis of political affiliation or belief,unless political loyalty is an appropriate requirement of the position in question.see welch ciampa,cir.the second line of cases call s for a different,though related,inquiry when a public employee speech,rather than her political affiliation or belief,is at issue.truck,city of northlake.the basic rule in such cases is that government officials may not take adverse action against a public employee for speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern unless there is an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.curran cousins,cir quoting garcetti ceballos.
political discrimination 
the essence of political discrimination claim is that she was not hired for a permanent position because she was an insufficiently zealous supporter of the popular democratic party pdp,as evidenced by her refusal to buy or sell pdp event tickets and her failure to secure an endorsement from a pdp politician the jury agreed,finding that her political beliefs or ideas were a substantial or motivating factor in hiring decision.attacks that finding on appeal,arguing that the evidence does not support the jury conclusion.having carefully reviewed the trial record,we agree with.
several former employees testified that the tourism transportation division was highly politicized,especially during the period between october and the general election in november.nearly every employee within the tourism transportation division,including and,was affiliated with the pdp.according to william,a shift supervisor,it was widely acknowledged that political backing from a pdp member of the legislative assembly was an important factor in tourism transportation division appointments.additional testimony revealed that certain employees within the tourism transportation division pressured their to participate in,or purchase tickets to,pdp events.
although there was no evidence that personally pressured her employees,there was testimony that much of the political activity took place in close physical proximity to office,that spoke about political activities and fund raising activities on at least one occasion,and that some of the political activity within the tourism transportation division benefitted brother,a local senator.the jury could reasonably have inferred from this evidence that was aware of,tacitly approved of,and perhaps even encouraged the partisan political activity within her department.
nevertheless,a politically charged atmosphere,without more,provide s no basis for a reasonable inference that defendant employment decisions about plaintiff were tainted by her disregard of plaintiff first amendment rights.larou ridlon,cir quoting,cir.even when it is clear that the defendant has a political agenda or harbors political biases,it remains the plaintiff burden to produce evidence of a causal connection between those biases and the challenged employment action.such evidence can be direct or circumstantial,and it can come in a wide variety of forms.mesnick,cir noting in age discrimination and retaliation case that sources of circumstantial evidence of retaliation include,but are not limited to,evidence of differential treatment in the workplace,statistical evidence showing disparate treatment,temporal proximity of an employee protected activity to an employer adverse action,and comments by the employer which intimate a retaliatory mindset internal citations omitted.whatever form the evidence takes,however,it must be sufficiently probative to support a finding that the plaintiff protected activity or status was a substantial or motivating factor in the employment decision,that is,that the protected activity or status was an impetus for,or moved the employer towards,the employment decision.segarra,cir.
failed to adduce sufficient evidence of this sort.most importantly,there was no evidence that was aware of refusal to buy and sell raffle tickets and to attend pdp events.the two women rarely encountered one another,and they never had any private conversations,let alone discussions or interactions.in addition,nothing suggests that political beliefs were so widely known that she would have been a conspicuous target for discriminatory action.aponte,cir.in the absence of proof that knew of unwillingness to participate in pdp political activity,it is difficult to see how that unwillingness could have been a substantial or motivating factor in hiring decision.see carrasquillo puerto rico ex rel.justice dep t,cir i f jiménez did not know carrasquillo political views,they could not have been a substantial factor motivating any adverse employment action.
the numerical evidence does not buttress position.of the transitory employees who applied for permanent positions,twelve were not hired yet never attempted to show that those who were hired were more politically active than those who were not hired.cordero,cir plaintiff presented evidence that a reorganization resulted in seven demotions,with no evidence that any npp member was either demoted or discharged.although comparative evidence is not necessary,it can be helpful in a case like this where there is little else to suggest that the plaintiff was,or was likely to be,targeted for her political views.
contends that stated reason for not hiring she was too aggressive with the taxi and limousine pretextual.there is no evidence of pretext,however.by all accounts,was not hired because her conscientious job performance upset the limousine drivers,who were not accustomed to close scrutiny.in this regard,she is partly a victim of her own success on the speech retaliation claim.she presented strong evidence that chose not to hire her because she enforced the safety regulations too vigorously and because she complained about the efforts to rein her in.the strength of that evidence highlights the absence of any evidence that her political orientation was an additional factor motivating hiring decision.
the most favorable testimony from perspective came from eileen ramos,the head of human resources at the tourism company,who flatly stated that took political considerations into account in her hiring decisions 
q now,there has been testimony here today that cancel did not at any time take political considerations to make a recommendation for a position.what do you have to say about that 
court in relation to a career position,correct 
q in relation to the career positions at the tourism transportation division for the tourism transportation officer position.
a i would say that not true.
a well,because the career positions that were posted for tourist transportation officer and other positions in that office,well,the human resources office did have any participation in the selection of those candidates.
well,in the hiring,meaning in the job announcement,et cetera,yes,we did have participation.but in the selection process,that was done in the division of tourist transportation office,in that department.they made a panel,interviewing panel to interview the people,but we did have any participation in the selection.
although this evidence gives us pause,we conclude that it falls short of providing a sufficient evidentiary basis for a jury finding in favor.ramos concluded that politics must have been taken into account because the human resources department had been improperly excluded from the hiring process.but that impression was conclusory and speculative.by her own admission,ramos had no personal knowledge of the process.thus,her opinion is too thin a reed on which to rest the entire jury verdict.without more,we can not say that it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that political beliefs were a substantial or motivating factor in decision not to hire her we therefore reverse the judgment as to political discrimination claim.
retaliation for speech 
in addition to political discrimination,the jury found that refused to hire because she had vocally resisted efforts to stop the safety inspections of luxury vehicles.official reprisal for protected speech offends the constitution because it threatens to inhibit exercise of the protected right,and the law is settled that as a general matter the first amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions for speaking out.hartman moore,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the general rule holds true in the public employment context the government is largely forbidden from taking adverse action against its employees in retaliation for their protected speech.see rankin mcpherson.
however,in recognition of the government interest in running an effective workplace,the protection that public employees enjoy against reprisals is qualified.retaliatory employment actions do not violate the first amendment if the speech in question was made pursuant to the employee official duties,garcetti ceballos,or the speech did not touch on a matter of public concern,connick myers,or the interest of the government as an employer in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs outweighs the interest of the employee in commenting upon matters of public concern,pickering board of education.invokes on appeal the first of these exceptions,relating to speech made pursuant to the employee official duties 
in garcetti ceballos,the supreme court held that the first amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employee expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities.at.the relevant inquiry under garcetti thus has two basic components what are the employee official responsibilities and was the speech at issue made pursuant to those responsibilities both of which are highly.see foley town of randolph,cir emphasizing that the context of the plaintiff speech was critical to the analysis and that the holding was limited to the particular facts of this case.moreover,in identifying the employee job responsibilities,the proper inquiry is practical rather than formal,focusing on the duties an employee actually is expected to perform.garcetti,at.
focuses her argument on the daily incident reports in which recorded her interventions with taxis and luxury vehicles.she contends that those reports are not protected by the first amendment because created and submitted them pursuant to her duties as a tourism transportation officer.that is undoubtedly correct,as herself acknowledged at trial.but as has repeatedly made her testimony,in her opening statement and closing argument at trial,in her opposition to the rule b motion,and in her brief on incident reports are not the basis for her retaliation claim.rather,her claim is that retaliated against her for complaining about her superiors interference with the performance of her job duties.the relevant question is whether those complaints were made pursuant to her official responsibilities.
that is not an easy question to answer.on the one hand,complaints were not made pursuant to her job duties in the most literal sense.her responsibilities as a tourism transportation officer were limited to inspecting vehicles,conducting safety interventions,reporting regulatory violations and interventions,and assisting passengers.the record contains no hint that her superiors at the tourism company expected her to raise broad policy and safety concerns in carrying out her official duties.indeed,expressed frustration at tendency to venture beyond her narrow responsibilities.
garcetti can be read to suggest that unofficial communications that are not part of what the plaintiff was employed to do,like complaints,fall outside the scope of its rule.at.the supreme court was deliberate in its choice of words.it referred thirteen times to speech made pursuant to an employee job duties,most notably in its statements of the question presented and the holding.id.at.elsewhere,it described the relevant class of speech in similar terms the court did not expressly indicate that it meant to sweep more broadly and include,for example,all speech that relates to,contributes to,or incidentally facilitates the performance of official functions.
on the other hand,some of the considerations identified in garcetti,such as the importance of affording government employers sufficient discretion to manage their operations,id.at,may suggest a wider scope.several courts of appeals,focusing on those cues,have construed the decision to cover all speech made during the course of performing an official duty that reasonably contributes to or facilitates the employee performance of an official duty.twin peaks charter,cir see also williams dallas indep.sch,cir per curiam activities undertaken in the course of performing one job are activities pursuant to official duties.on that view,complaints like might be unprotected,since they could be said to facilitate job performance by removing or attempting to remove an obstacle.the circuit has explicitly embraced such a view.see winder erste,w e have consistently held that a public employee speaks without first amendment protection when he reports conduct that interferes with his job responsibilities,even if the report is made outside his chain of command.
in short,there are strong arguments that the pursuant to official duties doctrine of garcetti does not apply to complaints to her superiors,but there are also strong arguments to the contrary.has addressed none of this complexity,focusing only on the daily incident reports filed by despite ample notice of the basis for speech retaliation claim.even after again clarified her position in her brief to this court,declined to file a reply brief.we will not do a party work for her.consequently,we will not address arguments on appeal that might have made,but did not make,about the application of garcetti to complaints see de castro,cir a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly or else forever hold its peace.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.because has not contested the sufficiency of the evidence,or made any other argument attacking the speech retaliation claim,the judgment is affirmed as to that claim.
final argument is that the damages award is excessive and should have been reduced by the district court t he measure of damages in section actions is a matter of federal common law.aquino,cir citing carey piphus,and sullivan little hunting park.although punitive damages awards are subject to constitutional limits as well,see,state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,has not argued that the award in this case exceeds those limits.we therefore limit our review to whether the award is excessive as a matter of federal common law.see hardeman city of albuquerque,cir applying common law standard because constitutional argument had been forfeited.under the traditional common law standard,a district court will not disturb the jury compensatory or punitive damages award unless the award is grossly excessive,inordinate,shocking to the conscience of the court,or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.wagenmann adams,cir quoting segal gilbert color,cir see also sheldon nahmod,civil rights civil liberties litigation,ed.we,in turn,review the district court denial of remittitur for abuse of discretion.see mcdonough city of quincy,cir citing gasperini ctr.for humanities.
compensatory damages 
the jury awarded for loss of earnings,salaries,and benefits and for emotional pain and suffering.with respect to the lost earnings,the following facts were either stipulated to or supported by the evidence at trial earned per month as a tourism transportation officer she left the tourism company in january of she earned approximately per month in a secretarial position from march of until october of she earned less than in she earned no income in and she paid approximately per year in medical expenses that would otherwise have been covered by her government benefits plan.she also testified that,as of the trial date in,she remained unable to find steady work.on those facts alone,lost approximately in income and benefits in the three years after her departure from the tourism company.
presented no evidence to suggest that these figures are inflated or that unreasonably failed to mitigate her damages.even factoring in taxes,accounting for the likelihood that would eventually find steady employment,and discounting the estimated stream of future income to its present value,jones laughlin steel pfeifer,we conclude that the jury award for lost earnings was reasonable.see segal,at even in cases which involve only economic loss,review must proceed with great deference for the jury assessment the jury is free to select the highest figures for which there is adequate evidentiary support.quoting kolb goldring,cir.
the award for pain and suffering is likewise reasonable.we have recognized that converting feelings such as pain,suffering,and ment
