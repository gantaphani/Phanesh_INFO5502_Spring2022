background 
joe stacy assaults michael walter children 
michael walter lived with his wife susan and their ten children in westfall township.joe stacy also lived in westfall township with his wife agnes.michael walter knew joe stacy through the westfall township planning board,but did not know that stacy was a convicted felon who had served six years in prison for manslaughter and had later been prosecuted for another incident.in august of,and walter took a weekend trip out of state,leaving three of their young daughters in the care of the stacys.when the walters returned,their daughters told walter that they had been sexually assaulted by joe stacy.
the walters called the police.police chief mitchell,who was a member of the pike county child abuse task force,met with and walter at their home on august.mitchell told the walters about stacy criminal record,and the walters decided to press criminal charges for the sexual assault.the parties dispute whether or not mitchell promised police protection to the walters on august,and whether the walters decision to press charges was based in part on a promise of protection.but in either event,once the walters had decided to proceed with criminal charges,mitchell and assistant district attorney desarro interviewed the walters daughters,and the police obtained an arrest warrant for stacy and a search warrant for stacy home.
soon thereafter,mitchell and desarro met again with the walters to discuss a plan for arresting stacy.at base,the plan was for michael walter to lure stacy over to the walters house,where mitchell would then arrest him.but the parties dispute the motivation for this plan,the exact details of the plan,and who had notice of which details when.
the walters allege in their amended complaint that the plan was formulated by mitchell,desarro,jacobs,and pike county detective william tracy todd,and that the plan called not only for michael walter to lure stacy away from stacy own house where the police were afraid stacy would be able to start a gun battle with arresting officers,but also for walter to extract a confession from stacy before he was arrested so that stacy could be prosecuted on the basis of the confession,sparing the walters daughters from having to testify against stacy.the walters allege that mitchell directed michael walter to invite stacy to the walters home 
in contrast,mitchell claims that he did not foist a plan on the walters rather,michael walter spontaneously volunteered to lure stacy over,and mitchell agreed but did not intend to use walter to extract a confession from stacy.desarro,for his part,claims that although he approved of having walter invite stacy to the walters house,he did not know about or approve of using walter to extract a confession from stacy.and jacobs claims that he did not know about the plan at all until after the fact.
michael walter participates in joe stacy arrest 
the parties essentially agree about how the arrest actually proceeded.on august,stacy drove to the walters house,where he was met by mitchell and michael walter.mitchell talked to stacy for some time,and then stacy sought to speak to walter.mitchell asked walter if he would speak to stacy,and walter agreed.mitchell then left stacy alone with walter for a few minutes,and stacy made incriminating statements to walter about the sexual assault.when mitchell returned,stacy made incriminating statements to mitchell,who administered miranda warnings and placed stacy under arrest.stacy protested that walter did not want stacy arrested,and asked mitchell to check.mitchell then asked walter,in earshot of stacy,whether walter really wanted mitchell to arrest stacy.walter confirmed that he did,and mitchell placed stacy into custody.
the police then executed their search warrant for stacy home,finding a huge cache of weapons and ammunition,and the police stacy and charged him with illegal possession of firearms.a few days later,on august,michael walter wrote to district justice charles lieberman to request that stacy be remanded pending trial instead of released on bail.walter letter explained that he felt that stacy was a risk to my family and the community and that there was no guarantee of protection for my wife and ten children while i am at work.but the judge released stacy on bail,on the conditions that stacy stay away from the walters,seek psychiatric help,and refrain from possessing firearms.
stacy stalks mitchell and murders walter 
stacy trial for sexual assault of walter daughters was scheduled for july of.the walters allege that,as the trial approached,stacy behavior became increasingly menacing and threatening towards mitchell,jacobs,and walter.for example,in january of,michael walter received a prank call which he attributed to stacy.susan walter also saw a man she thought looked like stacy riding a bicycle on her street.neither incident was ever confirmed to be attributable to stacy,however.
in april of,stacy made a motion to suppress his august,confession,arguing that it resulted from a plan to secure a confession through deception,which stacy called a trap designed by officer mitchell and walter.outside of court,stacy called mitchell repeatedly and in june of asked a local agent for mitchell home address.mitchell told the agent to tell stacy that mitchell could be found at mitchell office at a certain time every day,and on july,mitchell observed stacy sitting in a car outside mitchell office at the given time.mitchell arranged with desarro and jacobs for police protection the next day in order to catch stacy stalking him,and the walters allege that jacobs also arranged for protection for himself,including at his private law practice.but stacy did not reappear on july.mitchell and desarro sought to revoke stacy bail,citing stacy appearance at mitchell office the previous day,but the judge found that there were no grounds to have stacy remanded.
the next day,july,mitchell took leave from his job and left the vicinity of pike county.the walters allege that mitchell was instructed to leave for his own protection,but mitchell testified that he already had a vacation scheduled for that time and left work less than a day ahead of schedule.meanwhile,jacobs and desarro discussed whether or not to tell the walters about stacy behavior toward mitchell,and decided against it.desarro testified that if stacy was going to do something that was improper one way or another,it was going to be toward detective mitchell,and we had no reason to believe against anyone else,at least in my mind.desarro also testified that he asked the state police to increase their patrol of the walters street on the weekend before stacy trial,but the walters contend that there is no evidence corroborating that testimony.
on friday,july,the last weekday before stacy trial was scheduled to begin,stacy drove to walter place of employment at the port jervis auto mall in port jervis,new york,outside the jurisdiction of the westfall township police and pike county district attorney office.according to walter coworker,stacy entered the auto dealership and waited for a few minutes while walter worked with a customer.when walter was done with the customer,stacy shot walter in the groin and head,killing him.stacy had written in a note to his wife,dated two days before the shooting,that he hope d to get done what i believe is the best to has to pay for setting me up 
d.the walters file suit 
on september,after stacy pleaded guilty to murdering michael walter and was sentenced under a plea agreement,the walters filed a complaint against mitchell,desarro,jacobs,todd,westfall township,the westfall township police department,pike county,and the pike county district attorney office,alleging violations of due process under,and wrongful death and survival claims under pennsylvania state law.the walters filed an amended complaint on october,and the defendants filed motions to dismiss between october and december of.
on august,the district court dismissed the walters claims for wrongful death and survival,their claim for punitive damages against westfall township and pike county,and their due process claim against the westfall township police department.the district court also held that desarro and jacobs were entitled to absolute immunity for their decisions regarding the of stacy or revocation of his bail,but were not entitled to absolute immunity for their acts pertaining to the investigation of stacy,and that the pike county district attorney office was not subject to liability under for its prosecutorial acts.
on july,the defendants made various motions for summary judgment on the walters remaining claims.on august,while those motions were still under submission,mitchell died.the district court ruled on the summary judgment motions on november.walter pike county,d walter.specifically,the district court granted summary judgment to westfall township,pike county,and the pike county district attorney office on all outstanding claims,on the basis of municipal immunity,id.at granted summary judgment to mitchell,desarro,and jacobs on the walters procedural due process claim,id.at denied summary judgment to mitchell,desarro,and jacobs on the merits of walters substantive due process claim,id.at denied mitchell motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity,id.at denied desarro and jacobs motion for summary judgment on the basis of absolute immunity,id.at and granted and denied desarro and jacobs motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity,holding that desarro and jacobs were entitled to qualified immunity as to their failure to warn the walter family of the threat posed by joseph stacy in the period leading up to the murder of michael walter,but were not entitled to qualified immunity as to their involvement in the elicitation of the confession from joseph stacy on august.id.at.
e.the parties appeal 
on december,desarro and jacobs filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court denial of their motions for summary judgment on the basis of qualified and absolute immunity.on december,in light of mitchell death,the district court granted a motion to substitute mitchell in her representative capacity as the executrix of the estate of timothy mitchell,and that same day mitchell estate filed a timely notice of appeal from the denial of mitchell motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.on december,the walters moved in the district court for entry of partial final judgment pursuant to.b,or in the alternative for certification of the district court summary judgment order for interlocutory appeal under b,so that they could appeal the district court ruling that desarro and jacobs were entitled to qualified immunity as to their failure to warn the walters.
on january,the district court denied the walters motion for partial final judgment,but certified its november,summary judgment order for interlocutory appeal,writing that the issue of whether district attorney defendants douglas jacobs and bruce desarro are entitled to qualified immunity as to a their participation in the elicitation of a confession from joseph stacy on august,and b their failure to warn michael walter of the threat posed by stacy in the period leading up to walter murder involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion,and an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.walter pike county et,d.we granted the walters petition for interlocutory appeal on march,and the walters filed a timely notice of appeal the next day.shortly thereafter,we ordered that the three appeals be consolidated.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
because all three of these consolidated appeals come to us before the district court has entered a final judgment in the case,we will begin with the issue of appellate jurisdiction.
the defendants appeals 
mitchell,desarro and jacobs appeal from the denial of summary judgment.the supreme court has explained that appeal gives us a power of review,not one of intervention,and as long as a matter remains open,unfinished or inconclusive,there may be no intrusion by appeal.cohen beneficial indus.loan.however,the court has also identified a small class of decisions that,although short of final judgment on a claim or cause of action,finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.id.
decisions denying absolute or qualified as the decisions appealed here by mitchell,desarro,and fall within this small class,because their appellate consideration can not be deferred until final judgment.t he essence of absolute immunity is its possessor entitlement not to have to answer for his conduct in a civil damages action.mitchell forsyth,d.qualified immunity is also an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation,but is conditioned on the resolution of the essentially legal question whether the conduct of which the plaintiff complains violated clearly established law.id.at.when either immunity is asserted in a district court,it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial,and the district court denial of immunity is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.id.therefore a district court denial of a claim of absolute or qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,is an appealable final decision within the meaning of notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.id.at.light haws,cir.
the supreme court has clarified that the scope of our review is limited,because the collateral order doctrine does not permit an appeal from an order denying a motion for summary judgment if the issue raised is whether or not the evidence in the pretrial record is sufficient to show a genuine issue of fact for trial.ziccardi city of,cir quoting johnson jones,d.therefore we lack jurisdiction to consider whether the district court correctly identified the set of facts that the summary judgment record is sufficient to prove but we possess jurisdiction to review whether the set of facts identified by the district court supports a claim beyond the bounds of the immunity at the case of qualified immunity,whether that set of facts is sufficient to establish a violation of a clearly established constitutional right.id.if there are minor gaps in the district court factual recitation,we can determine what facts the district court,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,likely assumed.rivas city of passaic,cir quoting johnson,at.and while our review here is somewhat analogous to the context of a b motion,where we would not evaluate the underlying evidence to support the plaintiff claims,atkinson taylor,cir,we still apply the standard for summary judgment,and will construe the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.rivas,at ambro,concurring in part.
the walters appeal 
the walters appeal from the district court partial grant of summary judgment regarding qualified immunity,which by itself is not a final decision within the meaning of.see,coleman parkman,cir the collateral order doctrine does not apply when a party complains that the district court should not have granted summary judgment based on qualified immunity.however,we have jurisdiction over the walters appeal as certified by the district court and accepted by us under b.the scope of our review of the walters appeal is not limited directly by the johnson line of cases.see yamaha motor calhoun,d in appeals certified under section b,the courts of appeals may exercise jurisdiction over any question that is included within the order that contains the controlling question of law identified by the district court.but because the walters appeal from the grant of summary judgment against them,our standard of review is essentially the same as it is for the appeals of mitchell,desarro and will construe the facts in the light most favorable to the walters,and will determine whether,on those facts,desarro and jacobs are entitled to qualified immunity.see,egolf witmer,cir appeal from grant of summary judgment based on qualified immunity we will accept the facts as determined by the district court,construing them in a light most favorable to the party that is claiming a constitutional violation.
qualified immunity 
we now turn to the applicability of qualified immunity,an issue raised in all three appeals.qualified immunity,as the supreme court has explained,is the principle that government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.to determine whether this type of immunity applies,we engage in a inquiry.first,we must ask whether the conduct alleged by the plaintiff violated a clearly established principle of constitutional or statutory law.if so,then we go on to ask whether the unlawfulness of the action would have been apparent to an objectively reasonable official.showers spangler,cir internal citation omitted see also rouse plantier,cir inquiry whether the plaintiffs alleged a violation of their constitutional rights whether the right alleged to have been violated was clearly established in the existing law at the time of the violation and whether a reasonable official knew or should have known that the alleged action violated the plaintiffs rights.
whether this inquiry is couched in two or three stages,the first or threshold question is this taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the official conduct violated a constitutional right saucier katz,d.here,the walters allege that mitchell,desarro,and jacobs deprived michael walter of his right to substantive due process under the fourteenth amendment to the constitution.the district court held that the facts,taken in the light most favorable to the walters,support this claim under the theory of danger.we disagree with the district court,and on this basis we will hold that qualified immunity is applicable here as to all defendants and events at issue.
the danger by a number of circuit courts of appeal but not yet formally recognized by the supreme an exception to the rule that the due process clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid,even where such aid may be necessary to secure life,liberty,or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual.deshaney winnebago county dep t of soc,d.in other words,even where a plaintiff suffers harm at the hands of a actor,the government may be liable because the government has a constitutional duty to protect a person against injuries inflicted by a when it affirmatively places the person in a position of danger the person would not otherwise have faced.kamara ag of the united states,cir.in our circuit,there are four essential elements of a meritorious danger claim 
the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct 
a state actor acted with a degree of culpability that shocks the conscience 
a relationship between the state and the plaintiff existed such that the plaintiff was a foreseeable victim of the defendant acts,or a member of a discrete class of persons subjected to the potential harm brought about by the state actions,as opposed to a member of the public in general and 
a state actor affirmatively used his or her authority in a way that created a danger to the citizen or that rendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger than had the state not acted at all.
bright westmoreland county,cir,cert.denied,d.
the district court held that genuine issues of material fact exist as to each of these four elements,and that therefore the walters meet the threshold question in the qualified immunity analysis.walter,d at.we agree that the third element is a participant in stacy arrest,michael walter was in a discrete class of persons more likely to be targeted by stacy than was a member of the public in general.and we may assume without deciding that the first element,foreseeability of the harm,is met as well.but we conclude that the district court erred in holding the second and fourth elements of the danger test satisfied in this case.in particular,we hold that no reasonably jury could find that mitchell,desarro,and jacobs acted with culpability in planning and effecting stacy arrest and confession,and we hold that the failure to warn the walters in about stacy behavior can not be deemed an affirmative use of authority sufficient to predicate liability.
stacy arrest does not shock the conscience 
as the district court recognized,t he exact degree of wrongfulness necessary to reach the level depends upon the circumstances of a particular case,miller city of,cir,and depends in particular on the extent to which a state actor is required to act under pressure.sanford stiles,cir.in a hyperpressurized environment,an intent to cause harm is usually required,while in cases where deliberation is possible and officials have the time to make unhurried judgments,deliberate indifference is sufficient.id.at.in the middle ground,or circumstances involving something less urgent than a decision but more urgent than an unhurried judgment,there is a standard that requires gross negligence and state actor must consciously disregard a great risk of serious harm.id.at internal citation omitted.
here,the district court held that the culpability standard should apply to the circumstances of stacy arrest at the walters house in,because mitchell was forced to make a decision whether to allow stacy to talk to walter and potentially gain a confession or alternatively be forced to break up a,or disallow
