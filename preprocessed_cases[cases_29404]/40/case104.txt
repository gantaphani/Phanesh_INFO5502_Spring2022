appellant shane moffat commenced this action under the freedom of information act foia,seeking information from the federal bureau of investigation fbi that he believes will exonerate him from his conviction for first degree murder.the government produced certain heavily redacted documents in response to the complaint,and asserted various exemptions to disclosure of the documents full contents.the district court subsequently granted the government motion for summary judgment,finding that moffat had received all of the relief to which he was entitled.the court also awarded moffat attorneys fees,after significantly reducing both the number of hours that were compensable and the requested hourly rate of moffat counsel.
moffat appeals the district court grant of summary judgment,contending that the government invocation of the foia exemptions is evidence that it did not respond to his request in good faith.he requests vacatur and remand of the district court order so that,among other things,he can take discovery concerning his claims.he also appeals the fee award,challenging the district court calculation of his hourly rate.we affirm.
factual background 
in,moffat was tried for murder in the commonwealth of massachusetts.during his criminal proceedings,the hampden county district attorney office gave him a document that purports to be an fbi report dated december.although the record is silent as to how this document came into the district attorney possession,moffat alleges that it came from the attorney office for the district of connecticut this document includes notes from an interview conducted by federal law enforcement officials with an individual named desmond wolfe,as a result of a proffer agreement between wolfe and the government.although the document given to moffat contains substantial redactions,portions of the report reveal the names of the agents and government prosecutors who were present at the interview during the interview,wolfe recounted a conversation he had with a man named screw regarding a murder that occurred in springfield.screw told wolfe that on the day of the murder,he and another individual named shane,presumably referring to moffat,licked a man down and now he died.the murder victim owed shane money and screw witnessed shane commit the murder.
moffat was convicted of murder in october and sentenced to life imprisonment.his conviction was based in part on the theory that he was alone at the crime scene when the murder took place.he alleges that the individual named screw mentioned in the fbi report is an alias for a man named everol bartlet,who actually committed the crime.since the fbi report places bartlet at the murder scene,moffat asserts that it undermines the prosecution theory of the case.
on november,moffat submitted foia requests to the fbi at its main office in washington,dc,believing that the agency possessed information that may exonerate him.these requests sought,inter alia,a copy of the fbi report discussed above,all records that mention or refer to moffat,and any documents that refer to moffat in connection with the investigation and prosecution of desmond wolfe.he later filed similar requests with four fbi field offices after his request to the main office was unproductive.
the fbi conducted initial searches but did not uncover any responsive information the main office and four field offices denied moffat requests.moffat filed administrative appeals of those decisions,to no avail.
procedural history 
moffat initiated this action in december,appending his copy of the fbi report to his complaint as well as the history of his communication with the fbi.as a result of the litigation,the fbi conducted searches for files directly pertaining to the subjects of moffat requests,as well as searches for any documents that included mere mentions of or passing references to the subjects in question.the government labels the former type of searches main file searches,and the latter searches.these searches located pages of responsive documents.the fbi states that its initial responses to moffat requests had not produced these documents because,due to resource constraints,it solely conducts main file searches in response to administrative requests.only when a complaint is filed does the government initiate a check.this check evidently uncovered the documents in question.
on march,the fbi provided moffat with of the pages,most of which were heavily redacted,and withheld the remaining four pages as duplicates.among the responsive documents were portions of the december,fbi report.the fbi version of the report contains more redactions than moffat version,and blacks out the names of the fbi agents who conducted the investigation,wolfe name,as well as most of the factual details discussed above.the fbi invoked exemptions,c,and d to justify these redactions,relying on privacy concerns and the need to protect confidential sources.
after producing these documents,the government moved for summary judgment,asserting that it had conducted an adequate search of its records and had produced all information responsive to moffat various foia requests.the government also contended that it was justified in asserting the claimed exemptions.moffat responded by challenging the adequacy of the government search methods.additionally,he noted that he already had a version of the fbi report in his possession,and that the agency could not continue to withhold information that had already been revealed.he contended that the government ongoing assertion of the exemptions reflects their bad faith in the entire process.
in a lengthy and thoughtful memorandum opinion and order,the district court granted the government motion,agreeing that the fbi search was adequate and that it had properly claimed the exemptions asserted the district court noted,however,that the foia litigation had resulted in the production of certain documents and that moffat had therefore been successful in obtaining some relief.as a result,the district court suggested that he may be entitled to attorneys fees under a as a party that had substantially prevailed against the government.the court directed the parties to brief moffat entitlement to fees.moffat filed the requested brief,contending that he was entitled to fees under foia,and seeking in fees at an hourly rate of.although the district court agreed that moffat was entitled to fees,it reduced the award to.there were two components to this reduction.the court first lowered the hours compensable by a substantial margin.with respect to the hourly rate of moffat counsel,the court noted that he was appointed by the massachusetts committee for public counsel services cpcs to represent moffat in his criminal proceedings,of which the foia litigation was a part.observing that the cpcs reimbursement rate was per hour,the court calculated his fee award using that rate.
moffat timely appealed the district court entry of summary judgment,as well as the fee award.
moffat foia claims 
our review of the district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.see soto padr√≥ pub.bldgs,cir.we view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,and may uphold the district court order only if there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see candelario del moral ubs fin.servs.of,cir.
moffat asks that we vacate the district court entry of summary judgment and permit him to take any necessary discovery,which would presumably uncover more information responsive to his foia requests.to that end,he raises two separate,but related,arguments.the first challenges the government invocations of certain privacy and exemptions to justify its redaction of the fbi report.moffat also contends that the government responded to his foia requests in bad faith,thereby suggesting that it continues to withhold information to which he is entitled.we address each argument in turn.
the exemptions 
foia serves to expose the operations of federal agencies to the light of public scrutiny.dep t of the air force rose,citation omitted quotation marks omitted.the statute embodies a broad policy in favor of disclosure,reflecting the notion that promot ing an informed citizenry is vital to democracy.carpenter dep t of justice,cir.nevertheless,there are nine categories of exemptions,which permit the government to withhold documents that are otherwise responsive to the request.see b maynard,at.the nine exemptions are to be construed narrowly,with all doubts resolved in favor of disclosure.carpenter,at.
we exercise de novo review over the district court determination that withheld materials are exempt from disclosure.see id.at.the agency bears the burden of demonstrating the applicability of the claimed exemption.see state of maine dep t of interior,cir.
as noted,the only document at issue in this appeal is the fbi report.the government claimed three exemptions as to this report,namely exemptions,c,and d.see b,c,d.the district court discussed only exemptions c and d,and we follow suit 
exemption c 
exemption c permits the government to withhold information compiled for law enforcement purposes when the release of that information could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.id.b c.the exemption guards the privacy interests of a broad range of individuals,including government agents,personnel,confidential sources,and investigatory targets.maynard,at.the exemption also protects a broad notion of personal privacy,including an individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.carpenter,at.this notion of privacy encompass es the individual control of information concerning his or her person,and when,how,and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.id.quoting dep t of justice reporters comm.for freedom of the press.
the exemption requires a court to balance these privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure.maynard,at citing reporters,at.this public interest must be guided by foia basic purpose,which is to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny.reporters,at.this purpose is not fostered by disclosure of information about private citizens that is accumulated in various government files but that reveals little or nothing about an agency own conduct.id.at.
in invoking c as to the fbi report,the agency sought to protect the privacy interests of a number of individuals,including third party informants,fbi personnel,and people merely mentioned in the course of the interview.the gravamen of moffat argument is that the privacy interests the government seeks to protect have been substantially reduced or even eradicated by his possession of a version of the fbi report.as a result,the diminished privacy interest is now strongly outweighed by the public interest in disclosure.
this line of reasoning fails for two reasons.first,we have previously stated that prior revelations of exempt information do not destroy an individual privacy interest.see carpenter,at that information has been released to the public domain,especially where the release is limited,has little bearing on the privacy interest.indeed,in modern society there is little information that has not been released to another.citations omitted see also rugiero dep t of justice,cir stating that no diminution of privacy interests occurs despite the fact that the identifying information is already publicly available weisberg dep t of justice,holding that prior disclosure of information to congressional committee did not undermine the privacy interests of these individuals in avoiding harassment and annoyance that could result should the fbi confirm the presence of their names in the relevant documents.the privacy interests the government seeks to uphold remain as strong now as they were before 
on the other side of the balance,moffat has not identified a public interest powerful enough to outweigh the substantial privacy interests at stake.the public interest foia seeks to uphold is the right of citizens to understand and obtain information about the workings of their own government.maynard,at.in carpenter,we explained that the innocence or guilt of a particular defendant tells the court nothing about matters of substantive law enforcement policy that are properly the subject of public concern.at quoting neely fbi,cir.but this is not to say that information requested by a criminal defendant may never implicate the public interest.for example,t o the extent that any of the requested material would reveal how the government responded to informants and others who offer information,or shed light on possible government misconduct,foia purposes may be served.id.
here,moffat only discernible interest in the requested information is to challenge his murder conviction,and he has failed to connect his deeply personal stake in this information to a larger governmental function.while his reply brief states in conclusory fashion that the requested information will reveal a method of federal law enforcement that is not readily apparent,this assertion is nothing more than speculation.he articulates no reason why the names and identifying information of specific individuals would shed any light on the conduct of the government.to the extent that he implies the existence of some form of government misconduct,the supreme court has said that where the public interest being asserted is to show that responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties,the requester must establish more than a bare suspicion in order to obtain disclosure.archives records admin.favish.rather,the plaintiff must make a meaningful evidentiary showing that the public interest would be served by disclosure.id.at.moffat unsupported assertion does not suffice 
consequently,moffat has failed to demonstrate that the privacy interests the fbi seeks to protect have waned in strength as a result of the release of a version of the fbi report,or that there is a significant public interest in the requested information.because this balance clearly favors the government,we conclude that exemption c was properly invoked.
exemption d 
exemption d permits the withholding of information collected for law enforcement purposes when such information could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source.b d.the statute also protects any information furnished by a confidential source if that information was collected in the course of a criminal investigation.id.unlike under c,if the government demonstrates that the information requested was given under an assurance of confidentiality,d does not require a further showing that privacy interests outweigh any public interest in disclosure.new eng.apple council,at.thus,exemption d provides greater protection to a narrower class of persons than does c.id 
moffat contends once again that any interest in protecting confidential sources or information evaporated when the hampden county district attorney office provided him with a version of the fbi report and that the government was required to justify its continuing withholding in light of the prior revelation.this waiver contention founders on our opinion in irons,cir en banc.in that case,plaintiffs initiated a foia suit demanding files concerning certain fbi informants who testified at the trials of alleged communist leaders in the.id.at.the government invoked exemption d in response,and plaintiffs argued that the confidential sources had waived the fbi right to invoke exemption d by testifying in open court concerning the protected information.id.at.
after an exhaustive examination of the statutory text,foia legislative history,and assorted policy considerations,we declined to read a waiver provision into exemption d straightforward language.the statute authorizes the withholding of any information furnished by a confidential source in the context of an ongoing criminal investigation.id.at quoting b d.neither this language,nor any other relevant language,we concluded,says anything about waiver.id.as a consequence,we held that plaintiffs are not entitled to information furnished to the fbi by confidential sources,beyond what has been actually disclosed in the source prior public testimony.id.at.this holding makes clear that exemption d shield does not necessarily disappear when some fraction of the information requested has come to light.the government therefore retained the right to invoke exemption d as to the fbi report,notwithstanding the entry into the public domain of some portions of the report.
irons reserved the question of whether d continues to apply to the specific information that has already been publicly disclosed.see id.at w e are not considering the fbi refusal to make available information restating what the sources in fact revealed at the trials.although moffat case superficially implicates similar facts,given that some of the information the government seeks to shield has already entered the public domain,we need not address whether d admits of a limited exception regarding information.even if this possible exception to d applied,the most moffat could obtain would be a copy of the fbi report that contains the exact same redactions as the version he already possesses.irons makes crystal clear that this is the most he is even potentially entitled to,and that the government may properly withhold any information not already revealed.see id.at.but that is not the nature of moffat claim.his goal is to obtain information other than what he already has,and nowhere does he suggest that his claims would be satisfied if the fbi simply produced a copy of the fbi report that contains the same withholdings as the one in his possession.indeed,such an endeavor would serve no discernible purpose in this case.because moffat does not argue that the government should have provided him with a carbon copy of his version of the fbi report,we do not address his entitlement to such a document 
for these reasons,the government validly asserted exemption d as to all the information redacted from the fbi report.
moffat repeatedly asserts that the government redaction of the fbi report is indicative of its bad faith handling of his foia requests and its withholding of other responsive documents.although not always clear in their articulation,moffat accusations of bad faith are a challenge to the adequacy of the agency search in response to his requests.under foia,adequacy is determined not by whether relevant documents might exist,but whether the agency search was reasonably calculated to discover the requested documents.maynard,cir quoting safecard.the adequacy of an agency search for documents under the foia is judged by a standard of reasonableness and depends upon the facts of each case.id.adequacy is generally determined not by the fruits of the search,but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search.iturralde comptroller of currency.
the government bears the initial burden of showing that it conducted an adequate search.as part of meeting this burden,it may provide an affidavit describing the search it conducted in response to the plaintiff request.id.at.i f an agency demonstrates that it has conducted a reasonably thorough search,the foia requester can rebut the agency affidavit only by showing that the agency search was not made in good faith.maynard,at emphasis added see also oglesby dep t of the army,stating that agency has duty to make a good faith effort to conduct a search for the requested records if the plaintiff demonstrates that the agency acted with a lack of good faith in conducting the search,summary judgment must be denied see maynard,at.
here,moffat argues that his primary evidence of the fbi bad faith is the government continuing assertion of exemptions relating to the fbi report,despite the previous revelation of some of its contents.he purports to use the fbi treatment of the report as evidence of its bad faith handling of his foia requests generally,and as an indication that the agency continues to hide documents from him.
as an initial matter,we question whether an agency incorrect invocation of foia exemptions can ever serve as evidence of bad faith.we are certain,however,that even if the agency claimed an exemption in error,that fact alone does not establish that the government response lacked good faith,or that the search was inadequate.the adequacy of a search focuses on the reasonableness of the agency response,not whether that response was legally correct in every particular.see church of scientology int l dep t of justice,cir.
regardless of whether the exemptions inquiry and the adequacy inquiry can ever overlap,we have already explained that in this case,exemptions c and d were appropriately applied to the fbi report.consequently,there is no basis to conclude that the government redactions were unjustified or improper here.put another way,appellant prime example of bad faith on the part of the government amounts to nothing more than proper application of the law.rugiero,at.
in his reply brief,moffat belatedly discusses a wholly separate category of evidence in support of his bad faith argument.specifically,moffat takes issue with the fbi treatment of his foia request at the administrative level and its refusal to conduct a search until after his complaint was filed.although moffat discussed this category of evidence during the summary judgment proceedings in the district court,his failure to do so in his opening brief on appeal waives any argument based upon the agency initial handling of his foia requests.see,am.specialty ins.lapalme,cir there are few principles more securely settled in this court than the principle which holds that,absent exceptional circumstances,an appellant can not raise an argument for the first time in a reply brief.
even if this contention was not waived,it has no basis in the record.in response to moffat vague allegations of unfair treatment,the government has come forward with uncontroverted evidence that moffat foia requests were handled pursuant to general fbi procedure.there is no evidence or even suggestion that the government inappropriately refused to conduct a search at the administrative level,or that the government search was otherwise conducted in bad faith.
for all these reasons,moffat has failed to raise a triable issue as to the government treatment of his foia request.
b.the district court fee award 
under foia,a court may assess against the united states reasonable attorney fees in any case in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.a e i.although the district court concluded that moffat had substantially prevailed in this litigation,the court declined to assess fees at the hourly rate his counsel sought and instead approved a rate of per hour.moffat has no dispute with the district court reduction of the hours compensable,but contends on appeal that the district court employed an inappropriate measure of his attorney hourly rate.
we review the district court rate calculation for abuse of discretion.see hutchinson ex rel.julien patrick,cir.the reasonableness of a fee award is a quintessential exercise of the district court judgment.accordingly,an appellate court is far more likely to defer to the trial court in reviewing fee computations than in many other situations.id.quoting lipsett blanco,cir.
reasonable hourly rates will vary depending on the nature of the work,the locality in which it is performed,the qualifications of the lawyers,and other criteria.united states v.one star class sloop sailboat,cir.the party seeking fees bears the burden of establishing the prevailing hourly rate in the community for the performance of similar legal services by comparably credentialled sic counsel.hutchinson,at.moffat counsel submitted an affidavit stating in cursory fashion that his typical hourly rate was,without offering any indication that his years in practice,his credentials,or his experience supported such a figure.the affidavit also tells us nothing about counsel experience with foia litigation.these threadbare assertions are wholly insufficient to warrant his claimed hourly rate 
moffat further asserts that the district court erred in linking its hourly rate calculation to the per hour rate used to compensate cpcs attorneys for their criminal defense work.but in light of moffat failure to proffer any evidence in support of his hourly rate,we can not say the court abused its discretion in basing the fee award on the value that cpcs had placed on attorneys representing indigent defendants.andrade jamestown hous,cir t he court is entitled to rely upon its own knowledge of attorney fees in its surrounding area in arriving at a reasonable hourly rate.
in conclusion,there was no abuse of discretion in the district court calculation of the fee award in this case.
for the reasons stated,we affirm both the district court entry of summary judgment and the fee award.
