laurie wood,a city of norfolk virginia sheriff deputy,was seriously injured during a training session on a navy base when she jumped from a training structure onto a set of mats,landing in a gap between them.she commenced this action against the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca,alleging that navy officers negligently allowed the structure,particularly the mats placed adjacent to it,to remain in a dangerous condition and failed to warn her of the dangerous gap between the mats.the district court granted the government motion to dismiss,concluding that the challenged navy conduct fell within the ftca discretionary function exception and therefore that congress had not waived sovereign immunity for wood claim.
on appeal,wood contends that her complaint alleged a straightforward negligence claim under virginia law,for which the united states waived sovereign immunity in the ftca.specifically,she argues that the navy conduct was not discretionary in nature so as to be excluded from the waiver of sovereign immunity because it was not the sort of conduct that the discretionary function exception was intended to protect.
because we conclude that the navy decisions regarding the maintenance of its military bases for use by civilian law enforcement involved policy judgments that congress sought to shield from tort liability under the ftca,we affirm.
wood was injured while using a piece of training equipment located within the naval support activity hampton roads,northwest annex northwest annex,a restricted access military base of some acres in chesapeake,virginia.the northwest annex,which was owned and operated by the navy,was managed by two navy instrumentalities the marine corps security force training company and the navy center for security forces.
by statute,the department of defense is authorized to make military facilities such as the northwest annex available to state and local civilian law enforcement officers for training purposes,and to train civilian officers to use those facilities,id,so long as the civilian training does not adversely affect the military preparedness of the united states,id.a department of defense directive and several military orders set forth policies regarding the use of military facilities by civilian law enforcement generally,and standard operating procedures set forth procedures governing law enforcement use of the northwest annex specifically.
before any civilian law enforcement agency may use northwest annex facilities for training,one of its officers must qualify under a marine corps training program as a range safety officer.during that training,the civilian officer is provided with excerpts of the standard operating procedures,which outline the officer duties as a range safety officer.the officer is instructed on how to schedule the facilities,coach his fellow officers on the range,respond to accidents,and perform other basic duties.the officer is also shown a slideshow that admonishes all range safety officers to remember the range safety officer is solely responsible for the safety and the proper conduct of the training at the navy facility.once a civilian officer qualifies as a range safety officer,he may schedule use of the northwest annex for his law enforcement agency by submitting a request form that specifies the facilities and equipment being requested.this form must then be approved by a navy or marine corps official,depending on which branch is responsible for the requested facility.
sergeant brad ward of the city of norfolk sheriff office qualified as a range safety officer in,and in february,he requested use of two facilities at the northwest annex munro village,an outdoor tactical training facility designed to resemble a city block,and the simunition house.sergeant ward request form did not include a request for use of the ship mockup,although the form also listed that facility as available.his request was approved by an officer of the marine corps,which managed munro village.
the ship mockup,which is managed by the navy and on which wood was injured,is located near munro village and is within the same general area.that equipment,which the navy referred to as the ship in a box or the,was a prismatic,structure designed to resemble a foreign merchant ship.the navy used the equipment to simulate by having soldiers clad in armor and strapped into safety harnesses climb a ladder onto the third deck.several mats were placed beneath the ladder both to recreate the difficulty of beginning a climb from an inflatable boat and to provide additional fall protection if a soldier harness were to fail.
on april,wood and other officers,who shared responsibility for training the sheriff office deputies,arrived at the northwest annex in preparation for the training exercises.as wood and the other sheriff office instructors walked through the munro village training facility,they discussed using the to create a scenario for trainees to practice exiting a building at an elevated height.they contemplated that the trainees would jump from the onto the mats below from the second story,a height of some feet.one instructor,seeking to demonstrate the exercise,climbed up onto the first story and jumped out onto the mats without incident.wood then climbed onto the second story and jumped off.when she landed,however,two of the mats separated,and she fell through the gap onto the ground.the fall caused a burst fracture of her twelfth thoratic vertebra,rendering her a paraplegic.
after wood administrative claim for damages was denied by the navy,she commenced this action under the ftca against the united states.she alleged that the united states negligently maintained the in a dangerous condition by failing to secure a top pad to the mats to prevent them from separating failing adequately to inspect the condition of the and its mats and failing to warn her,as a lawful invitee,of the dangerous condition created by the possibility of mat separation.the government filed a motion to dismiss wood complaint,contending that the navy challenged conduct consisting of decisions regarding its training facilities when used by civilian law enforcement agencies fell within the ftca discretionary function exception and that therefore the united states could not be sued.the district court agreed and entered an order dismissing wood complaint for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
after the court entered its order of dismissal,wood filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment under federal rule of civil procedure e,claiming that the district court dismissal of her complaint without allowing for discovery contravened our decision in kerns united states,cir.the district court,however,found that kerns was inapplicable because jurisdictional facts regarding the applicability of the discretionary function exception were not inextricably intertwined with the merits of plaintiff claim.accordingly,it denied wood motion.
from the district court may,order dismissing her complaint and its august,order denying her motion to alter or amend the judgment,wood filed this appeal.
n o action lies against the united states unless the legislature has authorized it.dalehite united states.
in the ftca,congress waived sovereign immunity for claims brought against the united states based on the negligence or wrongful acts or omissions of its employees committed within the scope of employment,accepting liability in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual would have under like circumstances.b.this waiver,however,is circumscribed by numerous exceptions,including an exception for claims based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.id.a emphasis added.because waivers of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed,the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating jurisdiction and showing that none of the ftca exceptions apply.see welch united states,cir.
in this case,the government challenged the district court jurisdiction based on the discretionary function exception set forth in a,and therefore wood had the burden of demonstrating that that exception did not apply.to carry her burden,she alleged that the united states creation and maintenance of an unsafe condition at the and its failure to warn her of the condition were not discretionary in nature and therefore were not excepted as discretionary acts from the government waiver of sovereign immunity.
acting on the government motion,the district court dismissed wood complaint,concluding that wood did not carry her burden.in reaching its conclusion,the district court read wood complaint to challenge the government conduct in the military maintenance decisions regarding the as an unauthorized military facility,as opposed to a military facility that has been approved for civilian use.it concluded that 
the government maintenance of the when it has not been approved for civilian use falls under the discretionary function exception because it implicates financial and staffing considerations.equipment and facility maintenance considerations,as well as calculations balancing the benefit of increased safety measures and increased costs,objectively fall into the category of decisions that are susceptible to policy analysis.
on appeal,wood contends that her claim for premises liability is a garden variety negligence claim that involves the failure to make premises safe for invitees or to give them warning of a known danger.she asserts that congress did not intend for these run of the mill acts to be shielded by the discretionary function exception.she adds that the government focus on the training facility purposes and the navy mission in maintaining the premises is merely a distraction.she also argues that its focus is too broad and general and,moreover,that the district court description of her use of the as unauthorized is not supported by her allegations,which must be accepted at this stage in the proceedings.
the government contends,on the other hand,that wood characterization of the conduct at issue is too narrow,collapsing the discretionary function inquiry into the question of negligence on the merits.the government asserts that wood complaint actually challenges government decisions regarding the maintenance and inspection of,or the issuance of warnings relating to,military training facilities used by civilian law enforcement.such decisions,it argues,are within the discretionary function exception for which the government has not waived immunity in the ftca.
the determination of whether the discretionary function exception applies requires application of a analysis.first,a court must determine whether the conduct in question involves an element of judgment or choice.berkovitz ex rel.berkovitz united states.when a statute,regulation,or policy prescribes the employee conduct,the conduct can not be discretionary and thus is unprotected by the discretionary function exception.see also united states gaubert,seaside farm,united states,wl,at cir.second,when the challenged conduct is the product of judgment or choice,the court must still determine whether the decision made was based on considerations of public policy.berkovitz,at.this second step of the analysis is designed to prohibit courts from second guessing decisions grounded in social,economic,and political policy through the medium of an action in tort.gaubert,at quoting united states empresa de viacao aerea rio grandense varig airlines.and in this same vein,when established government policy,as expressed or implied by statute,regulation,or agency guidelines,allows a government agent to exercise discretion,it must be presumed that the agent acts are grounded in policy when exercising that discretion.id.at emphasis added.in short,the discretionary function exception is driven by separation of powers concerns,shielding decisions of a government entity made within the scope of any regulatory policy expressed in statute,regulation,or policy guidance,even when made negligently.
the analysis of whether the discretionary function exception applies does not depend on whether the government employee had subjective knowledge of his discretion or subjectively intended to exercise it the analysis must focus objectively on the nature of the actions taken and on whether they are susceptible to policy analysis.gaubert,at see also seaside farm,wl,at baum united states,cir.
the analysis also does not depend on whether the conduct was that of a agency official making policy or a employee implementing policy.see dalehite,at.rather,the analysis must focus solely on whether the government conduct involved choice implicating policy.gaubert,at.indeed,relying on a distinction between actions and policymaking or planning functions would be inappropriate in light of the principle that d iscretionary conduct is not confined to policy or planning level.it is the nature of the conduct,rather than the status of the actor,that governs whether the discretionary function exception applies in a given case.id.at alteration omitted quoting varig airlines,at.
thus,in baum united states,cir,we ordered dismissal of a suit alleging,in relevant part,that the national park service negligently failed to replace a deteriorating guardrail system that broke when the plaintiffs car struck it.at.we concluded that,just as a statute gave the park service discretion to construct the bridge without fear that courts would its design choices,the ftca shielded the agency decision of how and when to replace a major element of that substantial public facility.id.at see also bowman united states,cir.holding,on similar facts,that w hether the decision grew out of a lack of financial resources,a desire to preserve the natural beauty of the vista,a judgment that the hazard was insufficient to warrant a guardrail,or a combination of all three,it is obvious that the decision was the result of a policy judgment.
therefore,taking the facts alleged by wood in this case as defining the challenged government actions,see gaubert,at,and applying the analysis to them,we must determine,on an objective basis,whether the challenged government conduct involved decisions based on considerations of public policy.
wood alleges,in essence,that pursuant to a request made by the norfolk sheriff office,the navy authorized that office to conduct training exercises on the navy base in april.she alleges that the navy was negligent in failing to maintain in a safe configuration the mats on which she was injured,by failing to inspect the mats for the dangerous condition,and by failing to warn invitees,such as wood,about the dangerous condition.in short,she makes a premises liability claim as an invitee to a navy military base,and we must decide therefore whether these actions that she challenges are protected by the discretionary function exception.
applying the analysis to this conduct,we determine first whether the government conduct involved an element of choice,which in turn requires the determination of whether any federal statute,regulation,or policy prescribed the conduct.see berkovitz,at.on this aspect of the analysis,the parties apparently agree that there was no mandate contained in any statute,regulation,or policy regarding the maintenance,inspection,and warning with regard to either the mats or the.in responding to the government motion to dismiss,wood conceded that she was unable to find any such statute,regulation,or military policy,and she does not argue otherwise on appeal.in addition,the government presented affidavits from a navy captain,a marine corps colonel,and the range manager at northwest annex,stating that there is no policy directly governing such maintenance,inspection,and warning procedures when the facilities are used by a civilian law enforcement agency.further,the marine corps order governing range safety does not require the military to take any specific safety precautions with respect to facilities that are to be used by civilians.instead,it requires only that civilian agencies,who may use military ranges at the discretion of the installation commander,must comply with the provisions of this.see range safety,army reg,mco c.and th
