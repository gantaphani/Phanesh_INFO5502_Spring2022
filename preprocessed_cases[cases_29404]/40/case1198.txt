commercial truckers who cross the many bridges that connect new jersey and pennsylvania have turned to the federal courts in this action to complain that the tolls being charged on certain of those bridges are excessive.the truckers seek to invoke federal jurisdiction under,a provision that calls for bridge tolls to be just and reasonable.we must decide at the threshold whether the truckers have a private right of action under to maintain this suit.after reviewing the language of as well as the factors in cort ash,d,the district court held that the truckers have neither an express nor an implied right of action,and it dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction.
appellants collectively,the truckers are a trucking company roadway express and three trade associations american trucking associations,the pennsylvania motor truck association and the new jersey motor truck association that represent the interests of the thousands of interstate truckers who regularly cross the toll bridges at issue.appellee is the delaware river joint toll bridge commission the commission,which currently operates twenty bridges between new jersey and pennsylvania over the delaware river.eighteen of those bridges accommodate vehicular traffic,with seven of the eighteen being toll bridges for which the commission sets the rates for passage the commission was created through a compact between new jersey and pennsylvania with the consent of the united states congress its is governed by ten commissioners,five of whom are appointed by the pennsylvania governor and five by the new jersey governor with the consent of the new jersey state senate.the new jersey commissioners serve a term while the pennsylvania commissioners serve at their governor pleasure.all commissioners serve without compensation.no action of the commission is binding unless a majority of the pennsylvania commissioners and a majority of the new jersey commissioners vote in favor of it.
in december,the truckers filed this action seeking a declaration that the commission newly adopted toll took effect in november and were increased further in january not just and reasonable.the truckers premised their claim upon,which provides 
tolls for passage or transit over any bridge constructed under the authority of the act of march,stat,commonly known as the bridge act of,the general bridge act of,and the international bridge act of shall be just and reasonable.
the facts concerning the commission toll increases are largely undisputed.in december,after three public hearings and a public meeting,the commission adopted a new toll structure to fund its operations.among other things,the commission planned to use increased toll revenue to fund a,million program,with an allocation of the funds to bridge protection,preservation,management,and enhancement.the new toll rates were also adopted in response to the terrorist attacks of september.the commission was advised by its insurers that it could no longer obtain coverage for losses caused by acts of terrorism.the commission thus planned to use a portion of the revenue from its new toll structure to create a to million fund to cover losses from acts of terrorism.
the first phase of the new toll structure took effect on november,when the commission increased its truck rate from an average rate of cents per axle to per axle.as a result,tolls for a truck,the most common commercial vehicle,went from an average of about to.app.at.in the second phase of the increase,truck tolls were to rise to per axle effective january.
just prior to the increase,the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of new jersey pledged to provide the commission with financial assistance in the event of a terrorist attack.this pledge prompted the commission to eliminate its planned fund and to adopt,in september,a new toll structure as part of a revised financial plan.under the new plan,truck tolls were increased in january to per axle for trucks with more than two axles,which marked a reduction from the planned increase to per axle.the toll remains in place at present 
the truckers contend that given the elimination of the need for the fund,the commission did not reduce truck tolls or its revenue commensurately,and thus the per axle toll is not just and reasonable within the meaning of.in particular,the truckers cite two new expenditures that were added as part of the revised september financial plan.first,the commission added million for potential capital outlays,which the truckers describe as a mere subset of various projects originally contained in a plan that the commission earlier failed to adopt for economic and community development initiatives.second,the commission september financial plan established a minimum targeted cash reserve that was to be the greater of million or of its outstanding principal indebtedness.a bond indenture requires the commission to maintain a minimum cash reserve equal to of its annual operating budget,whereas the million cash reserve sought by the commission would be slightly over of its operating budget,and slightly over of its outstanding bonds in.according to the parties,the commission minimum targeted cash balance at the end of was approximately million,and was projected to be about million in,in addition to an approximately million reserve.
the commission contends that maintaining the million minimum cash reserve is necessary to preserve the credit rating of its bonds and as a precaution should a catastrophic event render any of its bridges inoperable.the thrust of the truckers argument is that the increased tolls are not just and reasonable because they are designed mainly to build an unnecessarily large cash reserve.
after the parties conducted discovery,the commission moved for summary judgment on the merits.the district court denied the motion,finding that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the toll rate is just and reasonable within the meaning of.just prior to trial,the commission filed what it called a motion in limine,arguing for the first time that the truckers have no private right of action under.the district court deferred a ruling on the issue,and the matter proceeded to a bench trial on the merits.the district court conducted a oral argument at which the parties were afforded an opportunity to address whether the truckers have a private right of action.the district court suggested at that time that if it were to find a right of action,it would be inclined to conclude that the toll increases were not just and reasonable in view of the large cash reserve that the commission sought to establish.
thereafter,the district court issued an order dismissing the truckers complaint for want of jurisdiction.the district court declined to reach the merits because it found that neither the language of nor its legislative history revealed evidence of a congressional desire to afford the truckers a right to file suit in federal court to challenge the toll rates adopted by local officials.the truckers timely filed this appeal.we have appellate jurisdiction under.whether a statute creates a private right of action is a question of law subject to plenary review.in re corestates trust fee,cir.
a mootness 
the commission first raises a mootness argument.it contends that the truckers expert witness conceded before the district court that the proper per axle truck toll should be approximately in.because the toll is,the commission argues that the truckers challenge to the toll is now moot.the truckers respond that their position has always been and continues to be that the current toll rate of per axle is not just and reasonable as long as the commission has an unrestricted cash reserve that is not just and reasonable.reply br.at.the truckers explain that they seek to have the toll rate revert to per axle until the allegedly unreasonable cash reserve million at the time of trial is spent down to a reasonable level.id.at.although they acknowledge that their expert conceded it might be necessary to charge per axle in,the truckers explain that this concession was plainly contingent upon the commission adopting a proposed capital improvement plan that called for an acceleration in its spending.
if developments occur during the course of adjudication that eliminate a plaintiff personal stake in the outcome of a suit or prevent a court from being able to grant the requested relief,the case must be dismissed as moot.blanciak allegheny ludlum,cir citations omitted.here,there is no evidence that the commission has spent down its cash reserve to any degree,much less to a degree that the truckers concede is reasonable.in addition,it is clear that the truckers have never conceded that a toll is reasonable absent a corresponding diminution in the commission cash reserve.at the oral argument,the truckers counsel fully expressed their position with regard to the remedy sought 
a ll we asking is that the district court reinstate the toll and tell the commission that before it can raise tolls in the future it needs to spend down the reserves to a reasonable level.once it done that,it would be free to do whatever it needs,i mean it would be free to do a reasonable toll based on its needs at the time.and again,i think if we do like it at that point,it incumbent upon us to file another lawsuit.
the commission seeks support for its mootness argument in county of morris nationalist movement,cir.in morris,a declaratory judgment action was instituted to resolve constitutional questions regarding an imminent july parade.id.at.the district court held an expedited hearing and issued a decision to guide the parties conduct during that event.id.this court dismissed the appeal as moot given that the parade was over and any dispute that might arise in connection with future july activities could be resolved through a new lawsuit and the development of a new record based on the changed circumstances.id.here,in contrast,the toll rates and cash reserve have not changed in such a way as to prevent a court from affording the truckers the relief they seek,which,as we understand it,is either a reversion to the per axle toll,or a toll accompanied by a sufficient reduction in the cash reserve.on this record,the appeal is not moot.
b do the truckers have a private right of action under 
the first step in a private right of action inquiry is to look at the text of the statute itself to determine whether congress has explicitly provided a right to file suit.see three rivers ctr.for indep.living housing auth.of pittsburgh,cir a court must look to the text of the statute to see if it states,by its terms,that a private party may bring suit to enforce it.here,the truckers concede,as they must,that is devoid of explicit language.indeed,is notable mainly for its brevity,and it contains no language that might suggest a congressional desire to allow a private suit to enforce the just and reasonable provision.see molinari triborough bridge tunnel,observing that does not explicitly create private right of action.section silence is perhaps unsurprising,as m any statutes do not contain provisions addressing whether private parties may maintain a right of action.three rivers,at.
in the absence of an explicit congressional mandate,a court must next look to congress intent in enacting a statute to determine whether it would be appropriate to infer a right of action for the party seeking to enforce it.see id.to this end,the supreme court has set forth four criteria to guide a court in assessing whether a private right of action can be inferred 
first,is the plaintiff one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted,that is,does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff second,is there any indication of legislative intent,explicit or implicit,either to create such a remedy or to deny one third,is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff fourth,is the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law,in an area basically the concern of the states,so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law

congress intent in enacting a statute is always the focal point in determining whether courts should infer a private right of action from the statute.three rivers,at quoting thompson thompson,d.the cort ash test serves to guide a court review in discerning that intent.three rivers,at citations omitted.significantly,we have held that the first two factors of the test are critical,and i f they do not point toward a private right,the remaining two factors can not by themselves be a basis for implying a right of action.am.cape fear,cir quoting touche ross redington,d brennan,concurring.this emphasis on the first two factors has severely weakened the view that a cause of action will be implied if existing statutory remedies are inadequate to fulfill the purpose of the statute.id.at.
are the truckers one of the class for whose especial benefit was enacted 
the district court determined that the truckers a t first blush seem to satisfy the first cort ash factor with respect to the benefit conferred by.app.at.the court concluded,however,that is simply of a general proscriptive character without a clear and unmistakable focus on the benefitted class.app.at.the truckers argue that the district court erred in its analysis because was enacted to benefit anyone who uses the toll bridges subject to terms.the commission responds that commercial truckers and the organizations representing their interests are neither expressly nor even impliedly the subject of an especial benefit under.
in considering whether creates a federal right in favor of the truckers,we must follow the instructions of the supreme court that we look to the language of the statute itself.cannon of chicago,d.the question is not simply who would benefit from the act,but whether congress intended to confer federal rights upon those beneficiaries.california sierra club,d.in other words,the statutory text must be phrased in terms of the persons benefitted.gonzaga doe,d quoting cannon,at.
as we stated above,the language of gives no express indication of a desire to create a right of action to enforce the just and reasonable standard,nor is there any mention of a remedy for.moreover,there is no suggestion in the language as to whom congress intended to benefit by enacting the statute,much less any indication that congress wished to confer federal rights upon any beneficiary in particular.the statute simply directs that toll authorities charge just and reasonable rates.
there can be little doubt that the public at large benefits from a requirement that interstate bridge tolls remain just and reasonable,and that benefit certainly extends to truckers who haul goods in interstate commerce.the supreme court,however,has been especially reluctant to imply causes of action under statutes that create duties on the part of persons for the benefit of the public at large.cannon,at.see also cape fear,at explaining that when a statute imposes a duty without an unmistakable focus on the benefitted class,the courts are reluctant to infer a remedy.the duty that places upon toll officials has no focus on any particular class of beneficiaries whose welfare congress intended to further.sierra club,at.we thus agree with the district court that the first cort ash factor weighs against the finding of a private right of action under.
is there any indication of legislative intent,explicit or implicit,either to create such a remedy or to deny one 
legislative history 
our consideration of the second cort ash factor leads us to legislative history,which we will review in some detail before returning to the truckers arguments on appeal 
many,if not all,of the commission toll bridges were apparently constructed in accordance with the bridge act of.see act of march,chap,stat.codified as amended at.under that act,congress granted the secretary of war and the chief of engineers authority to regulate the construction of bridges over the navigable waters of the united states.id.section of the bridge act of further provided that i f tolls shall be charged for the transit over any bridge constructed under the provisions of this act such tolls shall be reasonable and just.id.in addition,provided the secretary of war with authority at any time,and from time to time,to prescribe the reasonable rates of toll for such transit over such bridge,and the rates so prescribed shall be the legal rates and shall be the rates demanded and received for such transit.id.consequently,tolls for bridges governed by the bridge act of were originally set at the federal level,not by local authorities such as the commission.
in,congress passed additional legislation providing that tolls over any bridge crossing the navigable waters of the united states shall be just and reasonable,although this new legislation was not applicable to,inter alia,bridges subject to the provisions of the bridge act of,which,as noted,provided for tolls to be set at the federal level.see act of,stat,repealed by surface transportation and uniform relocation assistance act of,d,stat,the act.the act authorized the secretary of war,either upon complaint or upon his own initiative,to conduct an inquiry into whether any toll charged by local authorities violated the just and reasonable provision of the act.id.if a toll violated the act,the secretary could prescribe the reasonable toll to be charged.id.the act further provided for judicial review of any order of the secretary by the filing of a petition for review in either the district of columbia court of appeals or the court of appeals for the circuit in which the bridge in question was wholly or partly located.id.
congress thereafter passed the general bridge act of,which granted congressional consent for the construction of bridges over navigable waters upon approval of the construction by local and federal authorities.see legislative reorganization act of,tit.v,stat,codified as amended at.like the bridge act of,of the general bridge act of provided that tolls over such bridges shall be reasonable and just,and that the secretary of war may prescribe the reasonable rates of toll for such transit over such bridge,and the rates so prescribed shall be the legal rates and shall be the rates demanded and received for such transit.id,repealed by e,stat.at.
in,congress transferred the federal power over tolls from the secretary of the army as successor to the secretary of war to the secretary of transportation.department of transportation act,g,stat,repealed by h,stat.at.in,congress directed the secretary of transportation to prepare a full and complete investigation for the purpose of determining what action can and should be taken to assure just and reasonable tolls nationwide.highway act of,a,stat.congress also directed the secretary to promulgate regulations establishing guidelines governing any increase in tolls for use of any bridge constructed pursuant to either the general bridge act of or the general bridge act of.id.b.
the secretary of transportation thereafter delegated to the federal highway administrator the authority to determine whether tolls are reasonable and just and to prescribe the reasonable rates of toll to be charged.federal regulations were adopted setting forth a process for the filing of an administrative complaint to challenge the reasonableness of tolls.see.under the regulations,the federal highway administrator,or a designated administrative law judge,was authorized to consider a complaint from any person aggrieved by a toll increase on an interstate bridge.a see also molinari.at.the federal highway administrator could conduct an investigation and,if appropriate,hold a formal hearing.after issuance of a final administrative decision,the complaining party could challenge the agency determination either in federal district court pursuant to the administrative procedures act or in the united states court of appeals for the circuit in which any portion of the bridge was located.see molinari.at.
at the beginning of the congress,two original bills proposing to deregulate tolls on interstate bridges were introduced.the first of these bills,introduced on january,included a just and reasonable provision.see the highway act of,cong.rec.the second bill,introduced on january,proposed eliminating federal oversight through the deletion of,inter alia,that portion of of the bridge act of that allowed the secretary of transportation to review whether tolls were just and reasonable.see essential highway reauthorization amendments of,cong.rec.although did not include a just and reasonable provision,its legislative history helps to clarify the purpose behind the deregulation of tolls.specifically,the analysis accompanying provided 
this section amends various federal statutes to eliminate the authority of the federal highway administrator to regulate the rate of tolls on bridges by determining the reasonableness of those tolls.states and toll authorities would be given greater flexibility in operating toll facilities.federal oversight of the reasonableness of tolls has proven to be administratively burdensome,legally unproductive,and has interjected the federal government in the role of a mediator in disputes which could more appropriately be settled at the state and local level.

upon return of the legislation to the house,representative molinari of new york asked representative hammerschmidt of arkansas and representative howard of new jersey to address the meaning of the just and reasonable provision representative molinari stated 
subsequent to the house passing the conference report on,a number of questions have been raised as to whether section,or the statement of managers accompanying section,changes in any way the just and reasonable standard as it has been applied under existing laws and existing authorities.
representative howard replied that 
neither section nor the statement of managers changes the standard to be applied in determining whether a toll increase is just and reasonable.the only thing that we have changed is the forum for making the determination.toll increases will no longer be subject to review by the department of transportation instead the decision will be left to the courts in the event of a challenge.
cong.rec.representative hammerschmidt concurred,stating that w e have not changed the just and reasonable standard in any way.id.
