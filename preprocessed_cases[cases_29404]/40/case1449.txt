ifeanyi iko iko,an inmate in a maryland state correctional facility,died after being forcibly removed from his cell and transferred to another cell by a team of seven correctional officers appellants,or the officers.iko estate and family plaintiffs filed this survival and wrongful death action against the officers pursuant to.the officers moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.the district court granted the motion in part,finding the officers entitled to qualified immunity from suit for certain of their actions but not for others.
the officers filed this interlocutory appeal,asserting that they are entitled to qualified immunity from the entire action.plaintiffs have moved to dismiss the appeal,arguing that this court has no jurisdiction to consider it because it improperly calls for revisiting whether there remains a genuine dispute of material fact.we find that the officers appeal,though attempting to certain factual disagreements,also presents legal questions regarding whether the officers are entitled to qualified immunity as to certain claims when the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs.we therefore dismiss the appeal in part,and affirm the district court denial of qualified immunity in part,because plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to show that the officers violated certain of iko clearly established eighth amendment rights.
c ourts are required to view the facts and draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment motion.in qualified immunity cases,this usually means adopting the plaintiff version of the facts.scott harris,d internal quotations,alterations,and citations omitted.at the same time,w hen opposing parties tell two different stories,one of which is blatantly contradicted by the record,so that no reasonable jury could believe it,a court should not adopt that version of the facts for purposes of ruling on a motion for summary judgment.id.at.in particular,where,as here,the record contains an unchallenged videotape capturing the events in question,we must only credit the plaintiff version of the facts to the extent it is not contradicted by the videotape.see id 
iko was a inmate at western correctional institution wci,a large state prison in cumberland,maryland.iko had been involved in a number of violent prison incidents dating to,including assaults on correctional officers and other inmates.some of these incidents involved spitting or biting.iko had also exhibited intermittent problems,with periods of socially appropriate behavior punctuated by violent outbursts and other reclusive,uncooperative behavior.
the events leading to iko death began on april,when iko was involved in a violent altercation with his cellmate.correctional officers broke up the fight by administering pepper spray to the inmates iko was taken for medical attention and moved to an isolation cell.
appellant lieutenant james shreve,the manager of iko housing unit,attempted to initiate conversation with iko several times after the fight,but had difficulty communicating with him.iko responded to shreve entreaties by just kind of star ing at him or by sp eaking to him in a language that shreve did understand.because shreve generally found iko to be a very intelligent person to talk to who can speak english,he became concerned about this behavior and requested that someone from the prison psychology department visit iko.id.
over the next two days,three different members of the prison staff visited iko in his temporary cell.though iko was communicative during some of those visits,his erratic behavior continued.on april,prison psychologist janet hendershot recommended that iko be transferred to a cell in the special observation housing soh unit,where he would receive more frequent observation and medical attention.the transfer was scheduled for later that day.
just prior to the scheduled transfer,hendershot encouraged iko to cuff up by inserting his wrists through a slot in the cell door,so that he would not have to be transferred by force.when iko did not respond,the chief of security and the prison warden authorized his transfer to an soh cell by force.
to effectuate the transfer,prison authorities utilized a procedure called a cell extraction.a team of seven correctional officers the extraction team was assembled,led by shreve.each member of the team was assigned a role.for example,one officer was responsible for restraining the inmate left leg and one his right.the team members wore protective vests,gas masks,gloves,and hard knee and elbow caps.standing prison procedures authorized the extraction team to use force if and to the extent necessary to secure compliance.the cell extraction was videotaped pursuant to state policy 
the general sequence of the events of the transfer is undisputed,and comports with the depiction in the videotape.immediately prior to the cell extraction,iko lay passively on the floor of his cell.shreve told iko that he could avoid the use of force if he came to the door to be handcuffed.when iko did not move,shreve deployed a pepper spray fogger for several seconds through the door slot.shreve then shut the slot door.when iko did not come to the door,shreve deployed another short burst of pepper spray.as he was doing so,iko came to the door with his wrists and hands in front of him and his palms face down,and inserted them through the slot where the pepper spray was being deployed.several officers then began shouting that iko should instead turn around and place his hands behind his back and through the slot.when iko did not do so,shreve administered another burst of pepper spray,and iko again lay down on the floor of his cell.shreve and another officer each released a final burst of pepper spray and prepared to enter the cell.plaintiffs expert estimates that pepper spray was dispersed into iko cell for approximately nine to fourteen seconds in total.it is undisputed that at no point during the spraying did iko respond violently or in a confrontational manner.
iko was lying still on the floor when the extraction team entered his cell.they secured iko arms in metal handcuffs behind his back and his legs in shackles,and placed a spit mask over his head 
the extraction team lifted iko from the floor and,pursuant to standard procedure,walked him to a nearby medical room to be examined by a nurse.the nurse explained to iko that she was there to offer medical treatment,but he did not respond,instead hanging his head as the officers propped him up.the nurse can be heard on the videotape commenting that iko did not appear to be reacting to the pepper spray.after about a minute in the medical room,iko suddenly collapsed forward.the officers caught him and directed him into a nearby wheelchair for transportation to the soh cell.at no point did the nurse provide any medical treatment to iko or even come into physical contact with him.nor did the officers at any point remove iko spit mask or decontaminate him or his clothing,which was saturated with pepper spray.the officers then wheeled iko to the soh cell via an outdoor path,carrying iko legs in front of the wheelchair to keep them from dragging on the ground.
upon his arrival at the soh cell,iko was placed face down on the floor.the officers dispatched someone to locate nylon flex cuffs to replace iko metal handcuffs.while the officers waited for the flex cuffs to arrive,they continued to restrain iko by kneeling and otherwise exerting downward pressure on various parts of his body,including his head,neck,shoulders,stomach,waist and legs.the videotape confirms,for example,that at least one officer was kneeling,in hard knee caps,on iko back and shoulders throughout this process.after several minutes of constant pressure,the flex cuffs arrived.the officers exchanged the handcuffs and exited the cell,leaving iko face down,arms restrained behind his back,and spit mask still on.after he left the cell,shreve offered that iko could come to the slot to have his cuffs removed,but iko did not respond.the officers left.
hendershot instructed the soh staff to monitor iko every fifteen minutes.at least one soh staff member observed through the cell door that iko was still breathing upon his arrival to the soh unit.soh staff soon became concerned,however,that iko was not moving from his position on the cell floor.after initially being denied permission by prison officials to enter the cell because of iko alleged dangerousness,soh staff finally obtained authorization to enter,finding iko dead.a state medical examiner later concluded that iko died of asphyxia the asphyxia was caused by chemical irritation of the airways by pepper spray,facial mask placement,compressional and positional mechanisms.
as a result of iko death,plaintiffs sued the officers in the united states district court for the district of maryland pursuant to,claiming that the officers violated iko eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.plaintiffs also alleged a number of maryland state constitutional and tort claims.the officers moved for summary judgment,asserting,inter alia,qualified immunity from the federal claims.the district court granted the motion in part,but denied it as to three portions of plaintiffs action the claim that shreve used excessive force in deploying a large quantity of pepper spray the excessive pepper spray claim the claim that the officers used excessive force in applying pressure to iko in the soh cell while waiting for the flex cuffs to arrive the excessive pressure claim and the claim that the officers showed deliberate indifference to iko medical needs after he was doused in pepper spray the medical needs claim 
the district court held that,for each of these claims,plaintiffs had alleged facts that,if proven true,would subject the officers to liability for violating iko eighth amendment rights 
the officers timely filed this interlocutory appeal,challenging the district court partial denial of their motion for summary judgment.plaintiffs moved to dismiss the appeal,arguing that this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain it under johnson jones,d.we address plaintiffs jurisdictional challenge first,as we must.see bender williamsport area sch,d e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction.internal quotations omitted.
the doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for violations of constitutional rights that were not clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.harlow fitzgerald,d.qualified immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability and like an absolute immunity,it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.mitchell forsyth,d.thus,though interlocutory appeals are generally disallowed,a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,is immediately appealable notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment,under the doctrine.id.at.emphasis added see also behrens pelletier,d johnson jones,at.winfield bass,cir en banc.
plaintiffs argue that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal because none of the questions presented on appeal turns on an issue of law related to qualified immunity.see id.at.instead,plaintiffs contend,the officers would have us revisit the district court assessment of whether genuine issues of material fact make summary judgment inappropriate.since johnson jones prevents such an inquiry,see at,plaintiffs conclude that we lack jurisdiction over the officers entire appeal.
plaintiffs are correct that we lack jurisdiction to the evidence in the record to determine whether material factual disputes preclude summary disposition.see,at.a defendant,entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense,may not appeal a district court summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.see also buonocore harris,cir.that does not mean,however,that there may not remain purely legal questions relating to qualified immunity that can and should be resolved at this stage in the litigation.see johnson jones,at.pointing out that,had the district court determined that beating respondent violated clearly established law,petitioners could have sought review of that determination.this court,sitting en banc,summarized the distinction 
w e possess jurisdiction to consider an appeal from a decision of a district court rejecting a government official claim of entitlement to qualified immunity to the extent that the official maintains that the official conduct did not violate clearly established law.alternatively,to the extent that the appealing official seeks to argue the insufficiency of the evidence to raise a genuine issue of material example,that the evidence presented was insufficient to support a conclusion that the official engaged in the particular conduct do not possess jurisdiction to consider the claim and,therefore,may not do so absent some independent jurisdictional base.in other words,we possess no jurisdiction over a claim that a plaintiff has not presented enough evidence to prove that the plaintiff version of the facts actually occurred,but we have jurisdiction over a claim that there was no violation of clearly established law accepting the facts as the district court viewed them.
winfield,cir internal citations omitted.
as winfield makes plain,our first task on appeal is to separate the district court legal conclusions regarding entitlement to qualified immunity,over which we have jurisdiction,from its determinations regarding factual disputes,over which we do not.the task is complicated by the fact that nearly every decision of a district court denying a governmental official request for summary judgment based upon qualified immunity will encompass both a factual and a legal determination that the facts are sufficiently controverted to warrant a trial and that the legal right purportedly violated was clearly established.id.at emphasis added.we must therefore carefully consider the order entered by the district court to assess the basis for its decision.id.citing johnson jones,at.if summary judgment was denied as to a particular claim solely because there is a genuine issue of material fact,that claim is not immediately appealable and we lack jurisdiction to consider it.if instead summary judgment was denied as to a particular claim because the officers were found,on the facts viewed most favorably to plaintiffs,to have violated iko clearly established constitutional rights,that claim is properly before us.
once the district court decision has been so parsed,we must also examine the parties appellate arguments to ensure that we only consider those legal questions formally raised on appeal.see id.at it is to the application of these jurisdictional principles to this appeal that we now turn.
we must assess,for each of the three claims presented on excessive pepper spray claim,the excessive pressure claim,and the medical needs the district court decided the claim based on qualified immunity,and if so,whether the officers challenge that legal determination on appeal.
we begin with the district court analysis regarding the excessive pepper spray claim.the court found that a number of genuine issues of fact remained unresolved,including whether iko complied with the officers orders during the extraction.see iko galley,slip op.at.this finding is precisely the type of factual determination over which we lack jurisdiction at this stage in the litigation.see johnson jones,at.
the district court also held,however,that t he existing case law gave shreve fair warning that multiple applications of pepper spray against a passive inmate who made at least some attempt at compliance,received no subsequent decontamination,and was forced to wear a spit mask,was unlawful,and that shreve was therefore not entitled to qualified immunity for his use of pepper spray.iko galley,slip op.at emphasis added.this determination is plainly legal in nature,and immediately appealable under the doctrine.see mitchell,at.
our jurisdictional analysis does not end there,however,as we must assure ourselves that the officers raised the appropriate legal question on appeal,and did not merely focus on rehashing the factual dispute below.we agree with plaintiffs that the officers appellate argument on this claim asks us to revisit a number of factual disputes.as explained in their briefs and extensively at oral argument,however,the officers also argue that the right to be free from an excessive deployment of force by pepper spray was not clearly question of law that does not require us to revisit any factual disputes.we possess jurisdiction over such a legal determination.see johnson jones,at.
having parsed the district court findings and conclusions regarding the excessive pepper spray claim and scrutinized the officers arguments made on appeal,we find a legal question that is ripe for our review.the pure issue of law is whether,accepting the facts as the district court viewed them,winfield,at,and as supported by the videotape,see scott.at,shreve continued use of pepper spray against iko violated his clearly established constitutional right to be free from excessive force.
with respect to the medical needs claim,the district court order likewise comprises appealable conclusions of law and determinations regarding facts.for example,the court found that plaintiffs have set forth sufficient proof to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the extraction team consciously disregarded a known risk of harm to iko by failing to insist that he be examined.iko galley,slip op.at.as before,we have no jurisdiction to determine whether plaintiffs have indeed come forward with sufficient facts to avoid summary judgment.see johnson jones,at.the district court,however,also went on to hold that,in light of its reading of existing case law,the officers are not entitled to qualified immunity under these circumstances.iko galley,slip op.at emphasis added.again,on appeal,the officers argue about the contours of their legal duty to address iko medical needs and whether existing case law clearly established that he be treated,on the facts accepted by the district court.there is,therefore,a legal question appropriate for our review at this time whether the officers failure to secure medical care for iko after he was doused in pepper spray and collapsed in the medical room violated iko clearly established right to have his medical needs addressed.
finally,with respect to the excessive pressure claim,plaintiffs insist that the district court failed to consider the officers qualified immunity defense at all,instead basing its finding solely on the existence of factual disputes regarding the level of force necessary to restrain iko in the soh cell.because the district court so limited its analysis on this claim,plaintiffs contend,there is no related legal question for the officers to appeal at this time.we agree.
the district court did not construe the officers filings as raising the defense of qualified immunity with respect to this aspect of plaintiffs claims.see iko galley,slip op.at.it cabined its analysis,therefore,to a direct review,without the overlay of doctrine,of whether a factual dispute made summary judgment inappropriate.the court noted that,on the one hand,the officers may have restrained iko in a good faith effort to maintain control while flex cuffs were located to replace his metal handcuffs.id.at.on the other hand,the court pointed out,it was not clear why the flex cuffs were not more readily available,and why such force was required when iko was not resisting and had been passive throughout the transfer.id.the officers alleged that iko had a history of performing feats of great strength in resisting restraints,and that their use of pressure was commensurate with the officers need for security.id.at.the district court concluded that it is not possible to determine as a matter of law whether the officers inflicted unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering.id.at internal quotations omitted.given the conflicting inferences from the record,the court denied summary judgment as to this aspect of plaintiffs claims.id.at.
we find that the district court analysis can only be viewed as a determination that factual disputes persisted,rendering summary judgment inappropriate.the officers protestations that the district court misread their filings,and that they had raised a qualified immunity defense to this claim,even if accurate,do not change the fact that we may only review those legal issues decided by the district court and subsequently argued on appeal.see winfield,at.because the district court denied,by virtue of conflicting factual inferences,summary judgment on the claim that the application of pressure to iko constituted excessive force,there is no legal issue on appeal on which we could base jurisdiction.therefore,this aspect of the officers appeal must be dismissed.
in sum,we are left with two legal questions,one regarding the excessive pepper spray claim and the other regarding the medical needs claim.it is to these two legal questions that we now turn.
we review de novo the district court partial denial of the officers motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.see johnson caudill,cir.
under the doctrine of qualified immunity,government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow,at.a court first determines whether any right was violated,and,if so,whether that right was clearly established.see miller prince george county,cir.
officials actions violate a clearly established constitutional right only if,in the light of preexisting law,the unlawfulness of the actions is apparent.anderson creighton,d.we do not require of such officials the legal knowledge culled by the collective hindsight of skilled lawyers and learned judges,but instead only the legal knowledge of an objectively reasonable official in similar circumstances at the time of the challenged conduct.johnson caudill,at quoting jackson long,cir.officials are not liable for bad guesses in gray areas they are liable for transgressing bright lines.maciariello sumner,cir.in the end,the lodestar for whether a right was clearly established is whether the law gave the officials fair warning that their conduct was unconstitutional.ridpath bd.of governors marshall,cir quoting hope pelzer,d.
here,plaintiffs argue that the officers violated iko clearly established eighth amendment rights to be free from excessive force and to receive adequate medical care,and are thus not entitled to qualified immunity on their claims.the eighth amendment prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments.const.amend.viii.in the prison context,it protects inmates from inhumane treatment and conditions while imprisoned.williams benjamin,cir.an inmate eighth amendment claim involves a subjective component and an objective component.specifically,eighth amendment analysis necessitates inquiry as to whether the prison official acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind subjective component and whether the deprivation suffered or injury inflicted on the inmate was sufficiently serious objective component.id.these requirements spring from the text of the amendment itself absent intentionality,a condition imposed on an inmate can not properly be called punishment,and absent severity,such punishment can not be called cruel and unusual.see wilson seiter,d.the specific showings necessary to prove each component,however,var y according to the nature of the alleged constitutional violation.hudson mcmillian,d.we therefore flesh out the components further in the context of each of the two eighth amendment violations before us.
first,plaintiffs claim that the amount of pepper spray used during the extraction constituted excessive force.the district court denied shreve claim of qualified immunity on this claim,finding that shreve violated iko clearly established right to be free from excessive force.we agree.
an injury is sufficiently serious for purposes of the objective component of an eighth amendment excessive force claim as long as it rises above the level of de minimus harm.hudson,at.rejecting the argument that minor injuries are not actionable 
shreve argues that iko did not suffer at all from the pepper spray.he contends that pepper spray is a gas which is widely available and that iko showed no symptoms of distress or pain.appellants br.at.the state own medical examiner,however,suggested that the pepper spray may have contributed to iko asphyxia and death.the district court,recognizing these conflicting accounts,found that issues of material fact remained regarding whether and to what extent the pepper spray contributed to iko death.of course,we can only resolve the legal question here whether,in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,iko injury from the use of such quantity of pepper spray rose above the level of de minimus harm.accepting as we must that plaintiffs might be able to prove that iko death resulted from the excessive use of pepper spray,we easily conclude that plaintiffs satisfy the objective component of their excessive force claim at this stage in the litigation.
plaintiffs must also show that shreve acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind the subjective component.wilson,at.the state of mind required in excessive force claims is wantonness in the infliction of pain.whitley albers,d.put differently,the core judicial inquiry regarding the subjective component of an excessive force claim is whether force was applied in a effort to maintain or restore discipline,or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.hudson,at.
the supreme court has set forth four factors to assist courts in assessing whether an officer has acted with wantonness the need for the application of force the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used the extent of any reasonably perceived threat that the application of force was intended to quell and any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.whitley,at.internal quotations omitted applying these factors in a prison riot case see hudson,at.extending the whitley standard to all allegations of excessive force.we now consider those factors in light of the circumstances before us.
with respect to the first criterion,there is no question that some dispersal of pepper spray was warranted in carrying out the cell extraction.the maryland division of corrections directive governing the use of force,dcd the use of force directive,permits the use of pepper spray in a cell extraction to incapacitate the inmate prior to committing staff to the procedure.plaintiffs concede that pepper spray is a commonly used method of incapacitating inmates for this purpose.shreve can therefore demonstrate that there was a need for the application of force because iko did not initially comply with orders to cuff up.
we next consider the relationship between the need for force and the amount of force that was used.shreve testified that he was trained to use pepper spray until the inmate complied with orders.this contention can not help shreve on appeal,however,because the district court found that a genuine issue of material fact remained regarding whether iko offering of his hands through the door slot constituted compliance with the order to cuff up or not.as evident in the videotape and as found by the district court,iko remained docile and passive throughout the cell extraction,and proffered his hands through the door,albeit in front of rather than behind him.in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,then,shreve deployed several additional bursts of pepper spray even after iko attempted to comply with orders.moreover,the use of force directive governing the extraction unequivocally states that o nly the minimal amount of chemical agents necessary shall be used in a given situation.emphasis in original.under the second whitley factor,these facts tend to show that the amount of force used was disproportionate to the need for force.
likewise,the threat reasonably perceived by shreve must have decreased as the spraying continued.despite shreve characterization of iko as recalcitrant,appellants br.at,iko never reacted violently or otherwise became confrontational.indeed,shreve final burst of pepper spray was deployed after iko had lain down on the floor of his cell.the third factor therefore also favors plaintiffs.
finally,far from trying to ameliorate the effects of the pepper spray,shreve and the extraction team never changed iko clothing,never removed the spit mask covering his nose and mouth,and never secured him any medical treatment for the exposure.as discussed more fully below,this failure to provide medical treatment directly contradicted the use of force directive,which states that m edical treatment shall be given to all persons exposed to chemical agents.the fourth efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful favors plaintiffs as well.
all told,these factors combine to provide an inference that shreve wantonly inflicted pain upon iko by deploying an excessive amount of pepper spray.as a matter of law,then,the facts viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs support a finding that shreve violated iko constitutional right to be free from excessive force.
shreve can still enjoy qualified immunity from suit if he can show that this constitutional right was not clearly established at the time of iko death.the district court found that the right here was clearly established.we agree.
we held over a decade ago that i t is generally recognized that it is a violation of the eighth amendment for prison officials to use mace,tear gas or other chemical agents in quantities greater than necessary or for the sole purpose of infliction of pain.williams,at internal quotations omitted emphasis added.notwithstanding this clear pronouncement,shreve attempts to distinguish williams on the grounds that it involved the use of mace,not pepper spray.williams use of or other chemical agents,plainly reaches the use of pepper spray,and evinces the principle that c learly established includes not only already specifically adjudicated rights,but those manifestly included within more general applications of the core constitutional principle invoked.pritchett alford,cir.because shreve had fair warning that his conduct was unconstitutional,ridpath,at,we hold that iko right to be free from excessive use of pepper spray was clearly established,preventing an award of qualified immunity to shreve on the facts before us 
next,we turn to plaintiffs claim that the officers demonstrated deliberate indifference to iko medical needs when they failed to provide him with medical treatment after he was pepper sprayed.the district court denied the officers qualified immunity on this claim,noting that the officers training and existing case law at the time required decontamination after the use of such an irritant.we agree.
claims that prison officials failed to provide adequate medical care to an inmate,like excessive force claims,sound in the eighth amendment.williams,at.again,there is a subjective and an objective component to showing a violation of the right.the plaintiff must demonstrate that the officers acted with deliberate indifference subjective to the inmate serious medical needs objective.estelle gamble,d.
beginning with the objective component,a serious medical need is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor attention.henderson sheahan,cir internal quotations omitted.the officers argue that iko did not appear fazed by the pepper spray,and therefore iko did not have a serious medical need at the time he was in the medical room.this argument fails for two reasons.first,the state own medical examiner credited the pepper spray as contributing to iko death of asphyxia.it seems axiomatic that an inmate who dies in this way must have suffered some serious medical need that caused his death.second,even a lay person would infer from iko medical room collapse that he was in need of medical attention.we conclude that iko suffered from an objectively serious medical need after the.
plaintiffs must also show the subjecti
