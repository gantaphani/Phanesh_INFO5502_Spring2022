lyle beauchamp and warren shepherd relators filed a complaint alleging that academi training center,academi knowingly submitted false claims to the united states under the false claims act fca,in connection with a government contract to provide security services in iraq and afghanistan.citing the fca bar,which generally prohibits fca suits based on allegations that have already entered the public domain,e,the district court dismissed the complaint.the primary question presented on appeal is whether the district court correctly applied e when the sole public disclosure it found preclusive,a magazine article,was published more than a year after relators first pled the alleged fraud.for the reasons that follow,we find the publicdisclosure bar inapplicable in this case.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
to place the controversy before us in context,we start with the relevant statutory framework.enacted during the civil war to prevent fraud by military contractors,the fca imposes civil liability on persons who knowingly submit false claims for goods and services to the united states.see also ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn,discussing the statute history.to encourage the disclosure of fraud that might otherwise escape detection,the fca permits private individuals,denominated as relators,to file qui actions on behalf of the government and collect a bounty from any recovery.see b.the relator must file his or her complaint under seal and notify the government,who can either intervene or allow the relator to proceed alone.id.
although designed to incentivize whistleblowers,the fca also seeks to prevent parasitic lawsuits based on previously disclosed fraud.see ex rel.wilson graham cty.soil water conservation,cir.to balance these conflicting goals,congress has set careful limits on qui tam suits.pertinent here is the bar,which disqualifies private suits based on fraud already disclosed in particular settings such as hearings,government reports,or news reports unless the relator meets the definition of an original source under the fca.e.
two versions of the bar are relevant to this appeal given the timeframe of the alleged underlying fraud.in,when the alleged scheme began,the statutory limitation read as follows 
no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
e a.we interpreted this version of the bar as a jurisdictional limitation the bar,if applicable,divest s the district court of jurisdiction over the action.ex rel.may purdue pharma,cir.
congress amended the fca,effective march,and revised several parts of the bar.see id.at,the provision provides 
the court shall dismiss an action or claim under this section,unless opposed by the government,if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed 
i in a federal criminal,civil,or administrative hearing in which the government or its agent is a party 
ii in a congressional,government accountability office,or other federal report,hearing,audit,or investigation or 
iii from the news media,
unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
we have described the amendments as significantly chang ing the scope of the bar.may,at.among other things,the revised statute deleted the language previously contained in e and replaced it with a generic,phrase,making it clear that the bar is no longer a provision.id.at,the bar is a grounds for dismissal effectively,an affirmative defense rather than a jurisdictional bar.see ex rel.osheroff humana,cir we conclude that the amended e creates grounds for dismissal for failure to state a claim rather than for lack of jurisdiction.
the amended statute also changed the required connection between the plaintiff claims and the public disclosure.under the prior version,a qui tam action was barred only if it was based upon a qualifying public disclosure,a standard we interpreted to mean that the plaintiff must have actually derived his knowledge of the fraud from the public disclosure.ex rel.siller becton dickinson,cir,superseded on other grounds as recognized in may,at.as amended,however,the publicdisclosure bar no longer requires actual knowledge of the public disclosure,but instead applies if substantially the same allegations or transactions were publicly disclosed.may,at 
against this backdrop,we now turn to the case before us.
in,the department of state hired academi to provide security services for officials and embassy workers stationed across the middle east.the agreement required academi personnel to maintain a certain degree of proficiency with several firearms and called for academi to submit marksmanship scores to the state department on a regular basis.specifically,each security contractor was required to periodically qualify at a set level of proficiency with i the glock pistol,ii the colt rifle,iii the remington shotgun,iv the machine gun,and v the machine gun.
relators,both former security contractors with academi,filed their complaint in the eastern district of virginia in april.in the initial complaint,relators alleged that academi submitted false reports and bills to the state department for contractors employed in positions in which they did not actually work and also defrauded the state department by requesting payment for unissued equipment.the initial complaint was filed under seal,with notification to the government as required by the fca.see b.
shortly thereafter,on may,relators filed their complaint.relevant here,relators added new allegations of a separate fraudulent scheme that,from april through april,academi routinely failed to qualify its contractors on two of the required weapons the m and machine guns and fabricated scorecards showing proficiency with these firearms for submission to the state department.as a result,the complaint alleged that academi fraudulently billed the state department for security services performed by contractors who had not been tested for,much less achieved,the requisite marksmanship scores hereinafter,the weapons qualification scheme.relators provided specific dates of the alleged weapons qualification scheme and maintained that they,personally,were never certified with these weapons during their deployments.
while relators complaint remained pending,two former firearm instructors with academi,robert winston and allan wheeler,contacted relators counsel with additional information about the weapons qualification scheme.eventually,winston and wheeler filed a separate lawsuit against academi the winston complaint,alleging they were wrongfully terminated from their employment with academi for reporting the weapons qualification scheme up the chain of command.see winston academi training,ecf.july.the winston complaint detailed the state department contract,the weapons qualification testing requirements,and academi failure to conduct proper marksmanship testing.id.notably,however,the winston complaint was not filed as a qui tam action,so its allegations were not under seal and were thus available to the public from the date of its filing.
the winston complaint generated media attention,and on july,an online news publication,published a story about the case.see spencer ackerman,mercenaries sue blackwater over fake gun tests,wired july,am.the article described the winston plaintiffs allegations of retaliation and the weapons qualification scheme,specifically explaining how academi falsif ied dozens of marksmanship tests for its security contractors.id.the article also mentioned by name the relators pending qui tam suit.
ultimately,the government declined to intervene in relators case and it was unsealed.relators then filed a complaint on november,which became the operative pleading.in addition to inserting tam claims that are not relevant on appeal,the complaint expanded the allegations as to the weapons qualification scheme by adding a number of paragraphs from the winston complaint that further detailed the state department contract and academi alleged failure to meet its weapons testing requirements.
academi moved to dismiss relators qui tam claims under the and bars,as well as for failing to meet the pleading requirements of federal rule of civil procedure b.see harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir explaining that suits brought under the fca sound in fraud,and thus are subject to federal rule of civil procedure b,which requires that claimants plead fraud with particularity.
the district court granted academi motion.specifically,the court rejected the weapons qualification scheme under the bar using the post amended version of the fca,the court first determined that the article was a public disclosure as that term is defined in the statute.ex rel.beauchamp academi training,d.with that prerequisite established,the court then turned to the timing of the article disclosure,noting it must precede relators suit in order to function as a bar.id.because relators had amended their complaint several times,the issue became which was the proper pleading for purposes of the statutory timing benchmark.citing rockwell international united states,d,the district court determined that only the most recent complaint was relevant to this analysis.see beauchamp,d at the public disclosure bar inquiry applies to the allegations in the original complaint as amended,and thus courts look to the amended complaint to determine jurisdiction.observing that relators last pleading the complaint postdated the article,the court concluded that the article was a qualifying public disclosure so the bar applied.id.
the court then considered whether relators were nonetheless protected under the original source exception.the court found this exception inapplicable because relators failed to disclose academi fraud to the government in accordance with the statute.id.at.
in light of those determinations,the district court declined to address academi rule b arguments.see id.at.this appeal followed,and we have jurisdiction under.
relators appeal is limited to the weapons qualification scheme and the district court application of the bar.they first argue that the district court erred when it found the article was a qualifying public disclosure relators contend this story could not have triggered the bar because it was published after the complaint initially alleged the weapons qualification scheme.on this point,they specifically dispute the district court conclusion that rockwell requir ed it to consider only the most recent complaint to determine when relators alleged academi scheme for purposes of e a.opening br.alternatively,relators argue that,even if the district court was correct regarding the article,the bar does not apply here because relators suit falls under the original source exception 
the bar aims to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits in which a relator,instead of plowing new ground,attempts to by merely reiterating previously disclosed fraudulent acts.graham cty.soil water conservation dist.ex rel.wilson,d.in line with this objective,the bar applies only when information exposing the fraud has already entered the public domain prior to the relator suit.id.at explaining that parasitic lawsuits arise when those who learn of the fraud through public channels seek remuneration although they contributed nothing to the exposure of the fraud.hence,courts considering whether the bar applies must resolve,among other things,when the public disclosure occurred in relation to the relator claims.ex rel.gear emergency med.assocs.of,cir the first issue,then,is whether the information on which the complaint is based was already publicly disclosed when the relator filed his complaint.
the parties agree that the article is a public disclosure as that term is statutorily defined under either the pre or version of the fca see malhotra steinberg,cir t he existence of a public disclosure is a threshold condition for application of the bar.we also agree.thus,if the article came later than the applicable part of relators claims,the bar has no application here.
it is undisputed that relators initially pled the weapons qualification scheme in their complaint more than a year before the story.following that article,however,relators filed a complaint that this fraud and added further detail about it gleaned from the article.academi argued,and the district court agreed,that under the supreme court decision in rockwell,relators last pleading was the appropriate statutory timing benchmark when applying the bar.see beauchamp,d at.and because relators complaint postdated the article,the district court found that story to be a qualifying public disclosure that triggered the bar.id.in substance,the district court concluded that the timing of relators claims for bar purposes was set by the filing date of their most recent complaint instead of when the relevant claims were first alleged.
in adopting the view that only the most recent pleading should control the bar timing,academi and the district court misapprehend the factual and legal basis of the supreme court decision in rockwell.
in rockwell,a nuclear weapons plant attempted to dispose of hazardous waste by combining it with concrete in solid blocks called pondcrete.at.the rockwell relator,a plant engineer,reviewed the plans and stated before the procedure was undertaken that it would fail because of flaws in the piping system.id.the plant later discovered that many of the blocks did in fact leak.id.when this environmental violation came to light,the relator filed suit alleging that faulty piping was to blame and the plant claims for payment to the government were therefore fraudulent under the fca.id.at.during discovery,however,the relator abandoned the allegations,instead claiming for the first time a new theory of fraud liability that the leak was the result of an improper waste mixture.id.at.the case proceeded to trial,and the relator prevailed on his new theory.
the defendant subsequently moved to set aside the verdict under the bar,asserting that the relevant fraudulent scheme the last filed claim had been publically disclosed.id.at.the relator conceded that his successful claim was based on a qualifying public disclosure,but he argued that he nevertheless qualified as an original source.id.at.the bar at issue in rockwell defined original source as an individual with direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations of the fca action are based.id.
the rockwell relator,however,did not contend that he had direct and independent information as an original source for his successful theory.instead,he argued that he was an original source for fca purposes based on his insider knowledge about the,but abandoned,claim.thus,the relator argued to the supreme court that it should focus on the allegations in the first complaint to determine his original source status.id.at.
the supreme court found the rockwell relator argument without merit,holding that the original source provision did not speak in terms of allegations in the original complaint,but of the relator allegations simpliciter.id.simply put,the fca inquiry went to the relevant claim before the court there,the claim,and evaluating that claim required review of the pleading that first raised it.
the supreme court thus held that the original source question required consideration of at a minimum the allegations in the original complaint as amended.id.accordingly,even though the relator may have been an original source as to the claims asserted in the original complaint,the court found those allegations irrelevant because the relator had abandoned them in favor of a wholly different fraud theory.id.at declining to determine jurisdiction on the basis of whether the relator is an original source of information underlying allegations
