opinion of the court 
in,after a scandal involving the licensing of billboards on new jersey property,new jersey took steps to revamp its billboard program.thereafter,two of the companies that had licenses to display those billboards filed suit against the new jersey transit corporation nj transit,the lessor,and all vision llc all vision,its managing agent.the suit was initiated by cbs outdoor,which held licenses for billboards.this suit was dismissed by the district court.cbs outdoor filed a brief appealing the district court order dismissing its claim but subsequently advised this court that it had settled with defendants.the remaining plaintiff,carol media llc,whose suit was also dismissed,and who has licenses for billboards,did not file a brief on appeal but advised this court it would rely on portions of cbs brief.it has not settled,and thus its appeal from the district court dismissal of its claim that nj transit violated the takings clause is before us.see cbs outdoor new jersey transit,wl.
the premise of carole media appeal is that the defendants took without a valid public purpose certain of carole media property rights arising from its operation of billboards on nj transit land.
background 
nj transit is a public corporation organized by the state of new jersey in order to establish and provide public transportation services.see stat.ann.nj transit is statutorily authorized to lease its property,stat.ann.o,including specifically to lease or otherwise contract for advertising in or on the equipment or facilities of the corporation,stat.ann.s.accordingly,nj transit through a managing agent has long issued licenses to private parties that allow such parties to use nj transit land for the erection and maintenance of billboards and other forms of outdoor advertisement.
carole media obtained two licenses in to operate one billboard in wayne,new jersey and another in bridgewater and a third license in again in wayne.although the licenses expressly provide for a renewable term of one year and termination upon notice,carole media alleges,as summarized by the district court,that the general industry practice is for railroads not to terminate a license with an outdoor advertising company that is performing its obligations under the license,unless the railroad needs to use the land for development or is going to sell the land.cbs outdoor,wl,at.further,carole media alleges that,in reliance upon this industry practice,it has invested in excess of million in the licensing,permitting,and development of its three billboard sites on nj transit property.indeed,carole media contends that,prior to the new billboard program,its property rights in these billboards were valued in excess of million.
carole media identifies several property interests allegedly protected by the takings clause arising out of its operation of billboards on nj transit land.first,carole media contends that the licenses issued by nj transit constitute property.second,pursuant to the new jersey roadside sign control and outdoor advertising act outdoor advertising act,stat.ann,billboard operators must obtain a license and permit from the new jersey department of transportation nj dot in order to erect,use or maintain any sign for outdoor advertising.stat.ann.carole media contends that the nj dot permits it obtained for its billboards on nj transit land also constitute property.further,carole media contends that its rights to operate billboards in wayne and bridgewater today constitute very valuable property rights because recent amendments to the outdoor advertising act not applicable at the time of its permit applications provide that nj dot can not issue a permit without the applicant first obtaining local approval,and these municipalities would not approve new billboards in those locations.complaint at.finally,carole media alleges that it possesses property rights in the physical billboard structures themselves.
the series of events leading to nj transit alleged taking of the above property rights began with a scandal that carole media refers to as billboardgate.billboardgate involved allegations that two top aides to the governor of new jersey used political clout to arrange for permits to build billboards in locations that would be highly lucrative,even though some of the locations were governed by ordinances prohibiting all outdoor advertising.cbs outdoor,wl,at.in response,james mcgreevey created the billboard policy and procedure task force task force,which reviewed new jersey existing policies for the sale,lease,development,construction and siting of billboards.the task force ultimately made numerous recommendations,including a proposal that state entities adopt competitive bidding for the lease of all billboard sites on public property.
shortly after the task force issued its recommendations,nj transit solicited bids by those seeking to act as nj transit billboard managing agent.the district court stated that the contract was eventually awarded to all vision in because the company,in light of its proposed monetization program discussed below,was the bidder most responsive to nj transit desire to maximize income,foster innovative strategies,and execute the task force recommendations.cbs outdoor,wl,at.
subsequently,the new jersey legislature amended the outdoor advertising act and related statutes in response to the task force recommendations the amendments.the amendments provide that a state entity shall not enter into any contract or agreement for the sale,lease or license of real property owned or controlled by it with any person for the purpose of displaying any advertisement without publicly advertising for bids.stat.ann.however,the amendments allowed state entities to renew existing licenses without public bidding for up to five years.id.
in addition to requiring public bidding for billboard sites on land,the amendments also imposed new requirements on the nj dot permitting process.specifically,nj dot may not issue a permit for a new billboard unless a public hearing has been held and,where the permit applicant is a private entity,all relevant approvals required by the municipality in which the billboard will be located have been received by the private entity seeking the permit.stat.ann.b.finally,the amendments imposed a cap on the aggregate square footage of outdoor advertising permissible on various state entities property,including nj transit.stat.ann.
consistent with the amendments,nj transit renewed carole media existing licenses in and.in september,however,nj transit and all vision began to implement what the district court referred to as the monetization program or the program.under this program,nj transit through all vision intended to terminate all existing licenses and competitively bid twenty to year license agreements at all of its billboard locations.further,the monetization program sought to monetize the licenses and accelerate receipt by all vision and nj transit of a large portion of the license price by requiring a substantial payment equal to a percentage of all future revenues that the bidder expects to earn over the life of the license,in addition to yearly rent payments subject to a minimum guarantee.cbs outdoor,wl,at.
carole media alleges that nj transit and all vision requested that carole media transfer all of its rights to its three billboards and permits to nj transit in order to facilitate the monetization program.complaint at.carole media further alleges that new jersey transit and all vision have threatened to destroy carole media property rights by forcing it to remove its billboards within days unless it accedes to their demand that carole media transfer its permits,license and billboards to new jersey transit in exchange for a paltry payment that is far less than the fair market value.id.
although all vision informed carole media in march that all three of the latter nj transit licenses would be terminated as of august,these licenses have remained in effect on a basis.
procedural history 
carole media filed this suit in september,asserting claims pursuant to based on the takings and due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments as well as claims based on various state law tort and breach of contract theories.it sought declaratory and injunctive relief enjoining all vision and nj transit from terminating its licenses or,in the alternative,just compensation for the alleged taking.
as most relevant to this appeal,carole media alleged that nj transit implementation of the monetization program constituted a taking of carole media property interests in its billboards without a valid public purpose.according to carole media,the monetization program as implemented merely replac es one relationship with an incumbent billboard operator with another relationship with a new incumbent solely to benefit a private party,all vision through the payment of disproportionate management fees on the large,payments bidders will be required to make under the program.complaint at.thus,carole media contends that the taking is for a private,rather than public,purpose.moreover,carole media alleges that the program can not be justified under the amendment public bidding requirements because the program contradicts the purpose of the amendments,which sought to impose greater regulatory control over the licensing of billboards on public land,precisely in order to prevent state agencies from entering into special arrangements with specific parties that enable those parties to capture a disproportionate value from those billboards.complaint at.
after carole media case was consolidated with that of the original plaintiff,cbs outdoor,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the complaints pursuant to rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure.as most relevant here,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs takings claims as unripe under williamson county reg l planning comm hamilton bank of johnson city,d.in the course of reaching this conclusion,the district court also rejected carole media claim that the alleged taking lacked a public purpose.before we reach the latter issue,we must first determine whether the supreme court decision in williamson county requires a plaintiff to seek just compensation through state law procedures before a federal court may hear a claim alleging that a taking lacks a valid public purpose.this court has not previously addressed this issue 
discussiona.ripeness 
in williamson county,the plaintiff,a land developer who had purchased a large tract,brought suit in federal court pursuant to against the county planning commission and its members,alleging that the application of various new zoning laws to the plaintiff property amounted to a taking of that property without just compensation.at.the jury awarded substantial damages and the claim eventually reached the supreme court.the court assumed without deciding that the plaintiff stated a claim under the just compensation clause,but held that such a claim was not ripe for adjudication in the federal courts because the plaintiff had not yet obtained a final decision regarding the application of the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations to its property,nor utilized the procedures the state provides for obtaining just compensation.id.at.
first,the supreme court explained that the question whether a taking has occurred simply can not be evaluated until the relevant state actor has arrived at a final,definitive position on the issue.id.at.noting that the plaintiff had failed to seek any variances from the zoning regulations to which it objected,the court stated that until the relevant state actor determines that no variances will be granted,it is impossible for the jury to find,on this record,whether the plaintiff will be unable to derive economic benefit from the land.id.the court distinguished the line of cases requiring exhaustion of state administrative remedies,noting that the issue presented in the case before it was that the government entity charged with implementing the regulation had not reached a final decision on how the regulations would be applied to plaintiff property.id.at.second,the court noted that the just compensation clause does not proscribe the taking of property it proscribes taking without just compensation.id.at.thus,if a state provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation,the property owner can not claim a violation of the just compensation clause until it has used the procedure and been denied just compensation.id.at.
neither of these bases for williamson county holding apply to carole media public use clause claim.carole media claim is based on the supreme court repeated state ment that one person property may not be taken for the benefit of another private person without a justifying public purpose,even though compensation be paid.hawaii hous.auth.midkiff,d quoting thompson consol.gas.thus,unlike the just compensation clause claim at issue in williamson county,a public use clause claim is ripe before the plaintiff seeks just compensation through state procedures because such proceedings do not supply the appropriate remedy.montgomery carter county,cir.a plaintiff that proves that a government entity has taken its property for a private,not a public,use is entitled to an injunction against the unconstitutional taking,not simply compensation.moreover,forcing the plaintiff to pursue state remedial procedures would be an exhaustion requirement,a requirement that williamson county explicitly does not impose.id.citing williamson county,at.finally,there is no doubt that carole media has received a final decision from nj transit in light of the latter termination of carole media licenses.
we thus conclude that williamson county rejection of that plaintiff claim for lack of ripeness does not apply to carole media public use clause claim.the clear majority of our sister courts of appeals to address the issue have reached the same conclusion.see rumber district of columbia,t he ripeness requirements of williamson county do not apply to public use claims under the fifth amendment.montgomery,at same mckenzie city of white hall,cir same armendariz penman,cir en banc same samaad city of dallas,cir same.but see forseth village of sussex,cir holding that claim that taking was for private purpose was not ripe because plaintiffs failed to utilize their state law remedies such as an appeal of the relevant state actors decisions.
the district court recognized this substantial authority that williamson county does not apply to claims under the public use clause.nonetheless,the district court held that carole media claim was not ripe because carole media failed to alleged sufficient facts that,if true,would demonstrate a violation of that clause.however,the issue of whether carole media public use clause claim was ripe is distinct from the issue of whether carole media alleged sufficient facts on the merits to survive a motion to dismiss under rule b county concrete town of roxbury,cir holding that just compensation clause claim at issue was ripe under williamson county but express ing no view on the merits of the just compensation takings claim.because we agree with the majority of courts of appeals that have held that williamson county does not apply to claims under the public use clause,we conclude that the district court erred by dismissing carole media public use clause claim as unripe.
public purpose 
although the district court ultimately held that carole media takings claims were unripe,it also concluded that the alleged taking was supported by valid public purposes,specifically nj transit implementation of the amendment public bidding requirements and its effort to maximize income through innovative approaches to billboard management.carole media contends that this conclusion was erroneous because,in its view,a state entity desire to increase revenue can not constitute a valid public purpose and in any case,the alleged taking was actually intended solely to benefit a private party,all vision 
there can be no dispute that nj transit would no doubt be forbidden from taking carole media property for the purpose of conferring a private benefit on a particular private party.kelo city of new london,d.see also midkiff,at.a purely private taking could not w
