opinion of the court 
one of the essential principles inherent in a judicial system is the requirement to adhere to legal decisions pronounced by the highest court in the case of the federal courts,that is the supreme court of the united states.those decisions are supported by sound reasoning,and lower federal courts generally have no difficulty in applying the precedent.occasionally,however,the factual situation in which the principle is tested is heartrending,tempting the judge to seek a way to circumvent the principle.this is one such case 
we borrow this background section almost verbatim from the text of the unreported opinion of the district court judge berle schiller because it is accurate and requires no elaboration.
tiffany bennett had five daughters alexus born january,iyonnah born october,aliyaha born october,priscilla born january,and porchia born july.in december,iyonnah suffered brain injuries from being shaken while in the care of a babysitter.an investigation by the philadelphia department of human services dhs concluded that tiffany bennett and oliver bynum,the father of iyonnah and alexus,were perpetrators by omission,and therefore iyonnah was permanently placed with an adoptive family.tiffany bennett and oliver bynum,subsequently separated.
alexus and aliyaha 
in,dhs determined that tiffany bennett,a substance abuser who did not provide her children with necessary medical attention,posed a risk of serious harm to her children.tiffany bennett compounded this risk by actively avoiding contact with dhs.on may,dhs petitioned the family court to rule alexus and aliyaha dependent children because tiffany bennett was not cooperating with dhs in implementing a plan for their care.on june,the family court deferred adjudication of dependency but ordered dhs supervision of alexus and aliyaha.in december,the family court learned alexus was living in north carolina with her father and ordered dhs to assess her situation.the north carolina department of social services visited alexus in her new home and provided dhs with a positive report.the family court then discharged alexus dependency petition on february.
in july,aliyaha was temporarily committed to dhs and placed in foster care for two days because tiffany bennett was expelled from the shelter where they had been living.the family court returned aliyaha to her mother and ordered tiffany bennett to enter another shelter,undergo a mental health evaluation,and cooperate with dhs.tiffany bennett and aliyaha lived at the salvation army shelter from august until may.during that stay,priscilla was born on january.
c.the bennetts leave the shelter 
on may,tiffany bennett left the salvation army shelter with priscilla and aliyaha.two days later,dhs social worker yolanda grant learned of tiffany bennett unauthorized departure from the shelter.on june,grant checked the department of public administration dpa computer records and discovered that tiffany bennett dpa benefits were still being sent to the salvation army shelter.in an effort to locate tiffany bennett,grant spoke with a dpa representative who confirmed that bennett benefits would be terminated on june,and that if tiffany bennett contacted dpa for benefit reinstatement she would be told she must first contact dhs.however,when tiffany bennett sought benefit reinstatement,dpa allowed her to reinstate her benefits without contacting dhs.grant made several other efforts to locate tiffany bennett,including contacting priscilla pediatrician visiting a former address at west master street speaking with adiam debesai,a social worker who had worked with tiffany bennett at the salvation army shelter and who had spoken with tiffany bennett mother,dale geiger and trying to contact dale geiger and alexus father by telephone.
on september,dhs petitioned family court to discharge dhs supervision and the dependency petition for aliyaha.at the hearing,the child advocate objected based on concern for aliyaha safety.judge james murray lynn refused to terminate dhs involvement and stated,i do want this case just sitting on a desk somewhere.i want to see work done.i want people to continue to look i want dhs to vigilantly look for the baby aliyaha.when they get the baby,i want them to take the baby.
by early,alexus and her father had returned to philadelphia,where alexus attended public school.she lived with her paternal grandfather for a period of time,before returning to her mother control in march,tiffany bennett directed alexus school not to permit contact between alexus and her grandfather.
bennett case reassigned discharged 
in november,the bennett dhs case was reassigned to social worker iris dejesus.on the case assignment sheet,social work supervisor patricia wilson wrote,if you can not locate family by request an early listing for discharge of this case,again,as floater sw social worker did.if you do locate family,lynn made an order to take aliyaha into dhs custody dejesus did not try to locate the bennetts until late march of.on march,dejesus sent search letters to the department of public welfare and to the office of services to the homeless and adults.on april,dejesus checked dpa computer records and learned that tiffany bennett was receiving dpa benefits at a grandsback street address in philadelphia.that same day,dejesus visited the grandsback street address,but the house appeared abandoned.
on april,dhs again petitioned family court to discharge dhs supervision and aliyaha dependency petition because the family is unable to be located.the child advocate did not object,and dhs supervision and the dependency petition were discharged by agreement.
in late,tiffany bennett and her daughters began living periodically with dale geiger.porchia was born on july.the bennett sisters were exposed to unsuitable,unstable living conditions and to unfit care givers.for example,jayson chambers,a convicted child sex offender,was a babysitter for the bennett sisters.beginning in the fall of,tiffany bennett paid jerry chambers,who suffered from a schizoaffective bipolar type disorder and a history of drug and alcohol abuse,fifty to eighty dollars per week to look after her children.with rare visits from their mother,the four bennett sisters lived with jerry chambers and his girlfriend,candace geiger,who was tiffany bennett younger sister.
through its telephone hotline,dhs received a report at on august,that jerry chambers beat the bennett sisters the hotline report was classified as a general protective services report,which applies to allegations of neglect,and a dhs social worker was required to respond within hours.during the morning of august,dhs social worker joe maiden was assigned to investigate the hotline report.maiden reported that he visited the bennett sisters home twice on august,leaving a note at the first visit,and once on august,but he never got a response at the door.the facts surrounding maiden response to the hotline report are disputed,but the parties agree that maiden did not respond as he reported in his case progress notes.
on august,at approximately,emergency personnel rushed a brutally beaten porchia to a hospital,where she was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.alexus described the events leading to porchia death as follows.
