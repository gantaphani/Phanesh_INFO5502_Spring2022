zhan gao petitions for review of a final decision by the board of immigration appeals bia denying her applications for withholding of removal and asylum.the bia determined through adjudication that she was ineligible for these forms of relief because her conviction for unlawful export of military technology was a particularly serious crime,even though it was not classified as an aggravated felony.
in her petition for review,gao makes two principal arguments.for purposes of withholding of removal,she argues that only aggravated felonies can qualify as particularly serious crimes.for purposes of asylum,she contends that a felony can qualify as a particularly serious crime only if the attorney general first designates it as such through regulation.
after careful consideration,we reject both arguments.we defer to the bia reasoned view that an offense need not be an aggravated felony to qualify as a particularly serious crime for purposes of withholding.furthermore,we conclude that the bia may determine that a felony is a particularly serious crime for purposes of asylum through the process of adjudication.we likewise reject gao additional arguments and deny her petition.
zhan gao was born in the people republic of china.she entered the united states in on a student visa and became a lawful permanent resident in.sometime thereafter,she began exporting controlled technology without a license to what the bia described as entities in china that focused on military research.between october and january,for example,she exported eighty microprocessors designed for use in military aircraft and missiles at a total sales price of.she and her husband did not,however,report any of this income in their federal tax return.
on january,gao travelled to china with her husband and oldest child on a family visit.shortly before she was scheduled to return to the united states,she was detained by chinese authorities and separated from her husband and child.the authorities held her in solitary confinement,interrogated her for long hours,and accused her of taking internal documents out of china.on july,she was convicted of spying on behalf of taiwan and sentenced to ten years in prison.due at least in part to criticism from the united states,china released gao on medical parole on july,and she returned to the united states.
after returning,gao gained attention by speaking and publishing articles about her treatment in china.but around the same time,she resumed her business of exporting technology to china.she did so without obtaining or even inquiring about the proper licenses.between november and january,she made seven shipments,one of which was unlawful.
unbeknownst to her at that time,the federal government had been investigating her exporting activities since the fall of.the investigation culminated on february,when government agents executed a search warrant at her residence and discovered several items which are illegal to export without a license.
following the search,gao began cooperating with the government in an effort to obtain a lighter sentence.on november,she pled guilty to one count of unlawful export of commerce control list items in violation of and b and to one count of tax fraud in violation of.based on her cooperation,the district court granted her a downward departure and sentenced her to seven months of imprisonment,eight months of community confinement,and three years of supervised release.it also ordered her to pay an assessment of,a fine of,forfeiture of,and taxes,interest,and penalties of.
following gao release from prison,the department of homeland security dhs detained her and initiated removal proceedings.it charged that gao was inadmissible and thus removable on two independent grounds her convictions for unlawful export and tax fraud were crime s involving moral turpitude under a a i i and the attorney general had reasonable grounds to believe that she sought to enter the united states to engage solely,principally,or incidentally in an activity to violate or evade any law prohibiting the export from the united states of goods,technology,or sensitive information under a a i ii.
the immigration judge ruled that gao convictions for tax fraud and unlawful export were crimes involving moral turpitude,rendering her removable under section a a i i.but he found that she was not removable under section a a i ii because a reasonable person would not expect her to engage in future unlawful activity.
turning to the question of relief,the immigration judge found that gao was entitled to asylum,withholding of removal,and deferral of removal under the convention against torture cat.he rejected dhs contention that she was ineligible for asylum and withholding because her conviction for unlawful export was a particularly serious crime under b a ii and b b ii.while acknowledging that gao crime created a risk of future harm,he concluded that it was not particularly serious because it did not involve a direct link to violent crime or directly affect the health of individuals in the united states.
dhs appealed,arguing among other things that gao was removable under section a a i ii and that her conviction was a particularly serious crime.the bia found no error on the first point,but it reversed on the second.while acknowledging that gao crime of unlawful export was not an aggravated felony,the bia reasoned that its national security implications rendered it a particularly serious crime.it was impossible,the bia explained,to quantify the number of lives gao potentially imperiled by exporting military technology that is still presumably extant.accordingly,it held that gao was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.it did,however,uphold the immigration judge conclusion that she was eligible for protection under the cat.
both parties filed motions to reconsider,and the bia issued a second decision.this time,it reversed the immigration judge ruling that gao was not removable under section a a i ii,finding he applied the wrong standard of proof.but the bia reaffirmed its previous conclusion that gao offense was a particularly serious crime,even though it was not an aggravated felony.
gao filed a pro se petition for review of the bia decision,and this court subsequently appointed counsel to represent her.in this appeal,we note that gao removability under section a a i i for crimes involving moral turpitude and her eligibility for protection under the cat are not before us.instead,gao challenges the bia decisions that she is ineligible for withholding of removal and asylum and that she is removable under section a a i ii as an alien who seeks to enter the united states to violate its export laws.
we first turn to gao eligibility for withholding of removal and asylum.because the statutes governing these forms of relief differ somewhat,we address them separately.
we begin by setting out the relevant statutory provisions governing withholding of removal.under the immigration and nationality act ina,an alien facing deportation is ineligible for withholding of removal if the attorney general decides,among other things,that the alien,having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime,is a danger to the community of the united states.b b ii.for purposes of this provision 
an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony or felonies for which the alien has been sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of at least years shall be considered to have committed a particularly serious crime.the previous sentence shall not preclude the attorney general from determining that,notwithstanding the length of sentence imposed,an alien has been convicted of a particularly serious crime.
b b.the ina defines aggravated felony at a.the parties agree that gao unlawful export offense falls outside that definition.
gao urges us to read this paragraph to imply that only aggravated felonies can qualify as particularly serious crimes.she notes that the first sentence creates a per se rule that aggravated felonies accompanied by prison terms of at least five years are particularly serious.she then contends that the second sentence modifies the one
