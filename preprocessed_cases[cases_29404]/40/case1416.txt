sherif philips instituted two civil actions challenging the suspension of his practice privileges at pitt county memorial hospital the hospital.in addition to supplemental state law claims,he alleged violations of based upon putative infringements of his fourteenth amendment due process rights surrounding the proceedings that resulted in his suspension.he contends that pitt county memorial hospital,pcmhi,a nonprofit corporation,is a state actor.
the defendants moved to dismiss both actions.they contended principally that philips could not show they acted under color of state law.the district court agreed and philips appeals.we affirm.
from until june,pitt county owned all of the property representing the hospital,which it apparently leased to pcmhi,a formed in under the general nonprofit incorporation laws of north carolina.on june,at a time when pcmhi was operating the hospital under a long term lease from pitt county dated december,pitt county and pcmhi entered into an agreement to change status of pitt county memorial hospital agreement.ja.
the agreement was designed to change the status of pitt county memorial hospital from a public hospital to a private not for profit hospital pursuant to the municipal hospital act,north carolina general statutes act.id.accompanying the change over was the filing by pcmhi with the north carolina secretary of state on september,of restated articles of incorporation restated articles,submitted for the purpose,in part,of reflecting pcmhi reorganization from an agency of pitt county to a private corporation.
the change was accomplished by the sale of the hospital to pcmhi,at a price of million spread over two years.the agreement includes further terms indicative of some measure of retained control by pitt county over its former agency,pcmhi 
pcmhi must make annual payments to pitt county in lieu of taxes ja and it must continue annually to contribute toward reimbursing pitt county for medicaid payments,with annual increases to account for inflation.
pcmhi can not sell or encumber the hospital real property without pitt county prior written approval and pcmhi permitted indebtedness is limited as set forth in an attachment to the agreement.
if the hospital is sold or merged,with pitt county required consent,all net proceeds go to pitt county.
pitt county approval is required for any annual asset disposition exceeding a stated benchmark.
pcmhi is prohibited from allowing a substantial portion of the hospital system to be managed by an entity not controlled by pcmhi.
pcmhi must continue an existing school nurse program for the pitt county board of education.
pcmhi must continue to serve as the primary teaching hospital of east carolina university school of medicine and maintain the affiliation agreement between the medical school,pitt county and pcmhi.
pcmhi is to comply with the north carolina open meetings law and the commissioners of pitt county are to receive notice of,and access to,all meetings of the pcmhi board of trustees,including closed sessions.
pcmhi is governed by a board of trustees,with pitt county appointing members,and the remaining members appointed by the board of governors of the university of north carolina.these two governmental entities can remove their respective appointees only for cause.id.
noteworthy are the agreement automatic reversionary provisions under which all hospital assets,real and personal,revert to pitt county if pcmhi fails in any of the following respects 
fails to make payments to pitt county in accordance with the agreement 
fails to maintain a level of indigent care consistent with historical practice and expenditures 
loses its accreditation 
dissolves without a successor nonprofit corporation approved by pitt county.
the contemplated reversion would divest pcmhi of all ownership rights in the real and personal property of which the hospital is composed it is noted that reverter is one of the required provisions for a nonprofit corporation receiving ownership from a municipality of a hospital facility under north carolina municipal hospital act 
in dismissing these actions,the district court observed 
t he agreement expresses an intent to create a private hospital and does not provide pitt county officials with control of the administration of hospital services or personnel procedures.pitt county officials are not involved in pcmh operation and plaintiff has not alleged that pitt county officials,or any government actors,were involved in the suspension of his hospital privileges.

the district court relied significantly upon our decision in modaber culpeper memorial hospital,cir,which provides that 
a state becomes responsible for a private party act if the private party acts in an exclusively state capacity,for the state direct benefit,or at the state specific behest.it acts in an exclusively state capacity when it exercises powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the state,for the state direct benefit when it shares the rewards and responsibilities of a private venture with the state,and at the state specific behest when it does a particular act which the state has directed or encouraged.

title is a federal statutory remedy available to those deprived of rights secured to them by the constitution and,in a more sharply limited way,the statutory laws of the united states.section provides pertinently as follows 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress 
one alleging a violation of section must prove that the charged state actor deprived plaintiff of a right secured by the constitution and laws of the united states,and that the deprivation was performed under color of the referenced sources of state law found in the statute.adickes kress,d mentavlos anderson,cir.
the statutory prerequisite is synonymous with the more familiar the analysis for each is identical.see lugar edmondson oil,d stating i t is clear that in a action brought against a state official,the statutory requirement of action under color of state law and the state action requirement of the fourteenth amendment are identical.united states price,d dowe total action against poverty in roanoke valley,cir moore williamsburg reg l,cir the same analysis applies to whether an action was taken under color of state law as required by and whether the action was state action.haavistola cmty.fire,cir.
it has been observed that merely private conduct,no matter how discriminatory or wrongful,fails to qualify as state action.see mentavlos,at quoting american mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d quoting blum yaretsky,d.this is so,in part,to preserve an area of individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law and avoid ing impos ition up on the state,its agencies or officials,responsibility for conduct for which they can not fairly be blamed.edmonson leesville concrete,d quoting lugar,at.in sum,private activity will generally not be deemed state action unless the state has so dominated such activity as to convert it to state action mere approval of or acquiescence in the initiatives of a private party is insufficient.wahi,at quoting debauche trani,cir.
nevertheless,there are infrequently arising circumstances under which the actions of an ostensibly private party will be deemed to satisfy the requirement.we recently summarized when that sort of attribution was appropriate,with a concomitant observation of why it was the exception rather than the rule 
under th e or doctrine,we insist as a prerequisite to liability that the conduct allegedly causing the deprivation of a federal right be fairly attributable to the state.by doing so,we maintain the bill of rights as a shield that protects private citizens from the excesses of government,rather than a sword that they may use to impose liability upon one another.

commentators and appellate courts,including our own,have attempted to categorize situations that justify the label see,moore,at noting a private entity action can constitute state action if there is a sufficiently close nexus between the state and the challenged action of the regulated entity that the action of the latter may fairly be treated as that of the state itself,but state involvement without state responsibility can not establish this nexus emphasis added citation omitted debauche,at observing,based upon burton wilmington parking authority,d,that a symbiotic relationship may establish state action where profits earned by a private restaurant practicing discrimination not only contribute d to,but also were indispensable elements in,the financial success of a governmental agency leasing space to the restaurant emphasis added andrews fed.home loan bank of atlanta,cir quoting jackson metro.edison,d noting the public function theory recognizes the existence of narrow circumstances where state action arises from the exercise by a private entity of powers traditionally exclusively reserved to the state emphasis added see also,ivan bodensteiner and rosalie berger levinson,state and local government civil rights liability footnotes omitted.
in the end,however,there is no specific formula for determining whether state action is present what is fairly attributable to the state is a matter of normative judgment,and the criteria lack rigid simplicity.holly,at quoting,in part,brentwood,at.
philips appears to rely upon the close nexus analysis in asserting the presence of state action.see,ap ant br.at philips complaint pleaded a sufficiently close nexus between the government and decision to suspend his privileges.id.in evaluating the sufficiency of philips complaint,the district court was required to determine whether philips pleaded a sufficiently close nexus between the state and pcmh id.at.labels aside,however,the thrust of philips argument is,essentially,that inasmuch as the board of trustees was appointed exclusively by state actors,and the board terminated his privileges,the board should be deemed a state actor.
in moore,a physician instituted an action against williamsburg regional hospital wrh,a private hospital,and its agents for suspending his staff privileges.as noted in moore 
previously,the hospital was williamsburg county memorial hospital and was organized as a tax exempt regional health services district under et.it became a private hospital on october,when the assets of williamsburg county memorial hospital public service district were transferred to defendant corporation wrh in accordance with south carolina law.see.
id.at footnote omitted 
the physician asserted satisfaction of the state action requirement based upon the fact that the hospital board of directors that terminated him was composed of individuals nominated by the county delegates to the state legislature and ratified by the governor,with two county representatives serving as nonvoting members of the board,and because wrh receives state and county funds and funds through medicaid and the south carolina state plan under title xix of the social security act as a public hospital.
despite the appointment process,the court,in an opinion authored by judge wilkinson,concluded more was necessary for state action 
plaintiff contends that this case is distinguishable from modaber because government funding is not the only factor that establishes a nexus between wrh action and the state.here,in addition,the board of directors is nominated by the county delegates to the state legislature and approved by the governor,and two government officials the county supervisor and a county representative serve as members of the board.
these additional facts,however,do not make the state responsible for wrh privileging decisions.the governor involvement with the board ends after he approves the members,and plaintiff has not presented any evidence that the governor has used his authority to influence privileging decisions.the county representatives may attend the board meetings,but they do not have voting rights and were not present for the consideration of plaintiff suspension.in fact,the members of the board who voted were three local bankers and a school principal.therefore,it can not be said that the governor or the county representatives were responsible for wrh decision to uphold plaintiff suspension.as in freilich upper chesapeake health,cir,the state plays no role whatsoever in the actual decision as to whether or not to terminate or reappoint any particular physician.at therefore,wrh suspension of plaintiff privileges is not state action.
moore,at citation omitted see also,patrick floyd med,cir crowder conlan,cir 
although pitt county and another state actor exercise exclusive authority to appoint members of the board,philips complaints nowhere allege that the appointing governmental entities played any role in the specific decision to terminate his privileges.moreover,once appointed,a member of the board is protected from undue influence by the appointing authority in that a board member may only be removed for cause,which,as earlier noted,is defined and limited.
pitt county did retain a measure of control over a number of matters at pcmhi.that control is largely embodied in the reverter provision which helps assure that pcmhi meets pitt county objectives of care for the indigent,payment to the county of specified monetary obligations,and the continuation of the hospital.pcmhi,however,remains free to manage the hospital and run the entirety of its operations.
indeed,there is no allegation of pitt county involvement in the decisions that led to philip alleged deprivations.the decision in moore suggests no basis for an exception here to the general rule that the governmental entity must play a role in the specific decision that led to the deprivations complained of by an aggrieved person.see,pariser christian health care,cir here,pariser complaint identified no nexus between the various forms of government involvement with the hospital that it catalogued and the hospital decision to suspend pariser privileges,and therefore its allegations,even when taken to be true,did not establish state action.
philips makes passing reference to labels,besides close nexus,appearing in state action jurisprudence,such as entwine ment,intertwine ment,and joint participation.see,app ant br.at.regardless of the category referenced,brentwood teaches that the totality of the circumstances in this setting is determina
