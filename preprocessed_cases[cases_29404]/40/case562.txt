this appeal requires us to decide whether the national security council nsc is an agency subject to the retention and disclosure requirements of the freedom of information act foia,stat.codified as amended at.the united states district court for the eastern district of new york eric vitaliano,judge concluded that it was not and,on august,entered judgment dismissing this foia action to compel the production of certain nsc minutes and records,particularly those related to targeted drone strikes.see main legal servs.sec.council,d.
on de novo review,see phillips city of new york,cir,we construe the agency provision of the foia,f,the function provisions of the nsc statute,a,and the current presidential directive organizing the national security council system nsc system,see barack obama,presidential policy ppd,at,available at did,among other available legal sources,and we conclude that the nsc is not an agency subject to the foia.because we further construe the foia agency requirement to relate to the court remedial power rather than to its jurisdiction,we conclude that the district court properly granted dismissal for failure to state a claim,see.b,rather than for lack of jurisdiction,see.b.finally,we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in granting dismissal without discovery.we,therefore,affirm the challenged judgment.
background 
a.the foia disclosure requirement 
the foia,which took effect in july,establishes record retention and disclosure requirements for federal agencies.see.of particular relevance here is the requirement that agencies promptly make available to any person,upon request,such reasonably described records as are not already publicly available and not subject to specific exemptions.id.a a see id.b identifying exemptions.a person who thinks that an agency has improperly withheld records subject to foia disclosure may seek an order of production from a district court,which will review the matter de novo,placing the burden on the agency to defend its decisions.see id.a b.where,as here,there is a dispute as to whether the requested entity is an agency,the burden on that preliminary legal question rests with the party seeking production.see armstrong exec.office of the president,
b.the national security council 
in the national security act of,stat,codified as amended at,congress created a national security council council and assigned it t he function to advise the president with respect to the integration of domestic,foreign,and military policies relating to the national security so as to enable the military services and the other departments and agencies of the government to cooperate more effectively in matters involving the national security,a the statute denominates the president as the presiding officer of the council,on which serve certain statutorily identified officials,including the vice president and the secretaries of state,defense,and energy,as well as other persons appointed by the president.see id 
main street foia request to the nsc 
on november,plaintiff main street legal services,main street,a law firm within the city university of new york school of law,compl,submitted a foia request to the nsc seeking production of a ll records related to the killing and attempted killing by drone strike of citizens and foreign nationals,and a ll national security council meeting minutes taken in the year,the nsc denied the request by letter dated december,stating that a s an organization in the executive office of the president that advises and assists the president,the national security council is not subject to the freedom of information act.id.at.
main street disagreed and,on february,it commenced this foia action in the eastern district of new york,invoking.a b to seek a judicial order compelling the nsc to produce the requested records.the nsc moved to dismiss the complaint both for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that it was not an agency subject to the foia,f see.b,b.
the district court agreed that the nsc was not an agency and dismissed the case on the merits.on august,it entered the judgment in favor of the nsc from which main street now appeals.see main legal servs.sec.council,d at.
ii.discussion 
a.the foia definition of agency 
as the parties acknowledge,the foia applies only to federal agencies.prior to,the foia did not itself define agency but,rather,relied on the administrative procedure act,which defines agency as each authority of the government of the united states,whether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency,subject to certain exceptions not applicable here.in,congress amended the foia to clarify that the definition of agency,as applied to the foia,includes any executive department,military department,government corporation,government controlled corporation,or other establishment in the executive branch of the government including the executive office of the president,or any independent regulatory agency.foia amendments of,e,stat,codified as amended at f emphasis added.main street argues that the highlighted foia language is unambiguous and,therefore,dispositive of the single issue on this appeal the nsc is an establishment in the executive branch of the government within the executive office of the president and,therefore,an agency subject to the foia.
generally,if the intent of congress is clear and unambiguously expressed by the statutory language at issue,that would be the end of our analysis.zuni pub.sch.dist.dep t of,d see united states colasuonno,cir.the supreme court,however,has not strictly applied this rule in construing the language of the foia.rather,in kissinger reporters committee for freedom of the press,d,the court looked to the foia legislative history in concluding that notes made by the president national security advisor were not agency records subject to the foia.the history referenced in kissinger indicates that congress did not intend for the president immediate personal staff or units in the executive office of the president whose sole function is to advise and assist the president to be included within the term agency under the foia.id.at quoting,reprinted in subcomm.on gov t info indiv.rights of the comm.on gov t operations,freedom of information act and amendments of,source book legislative history,texts,and other documents foia source book,joint comm.print,available at.thus,to decide this appeal,we must look beyond the text of f and consider whether the nsc is a unit within the executive office of the president whose sole function is to advise and assist the chief executive 
the soucie test for determining a foia agency 
in making such a function determination,we are mindful that congress derived the standard quoted in kissinger from soucie david.see,reprinted in foia source book at with respect to the meaning of the term executive office of the president the conferees intend the result reached in soucie david.citation omitted see also armstrong exec.office of the president,at recognizing congress intent to codify soucie in amendments agency definition meyer bush,same.soucie construed the administrative procedure act definition of agency,referencing government authority,to reach executive branch units that have substantial independent authority in the exercise of specific functions,at citing,but not to reach units whose sole function is to advise and assist the president,id.at.soucie applied these two prongs of analysis to the office of science and technology,a unit within the executive office of the president,and concluded that it was an agency subject to the foia because,in addition to advising and assisting the president,the office had inherited program evaluation functions from the national science foundation that congress had imposed as a delegation of some of its own broad power of inquiry.id.it was based on the latter independent authority,derived from a source other than the president,that the office was held to be an agency.see id.
thus,although the supreme court in kissinger quoted only the sole function prong of the soucie analysis,we understand it to have recognized congress intent to codify the entirety of the soucie test for entities within the executive office of the president.we therefore consider both the sole function and substantial independent authority prongs of soucie analysis in deciding whether the nsc is an agency subject to the foia.
c.the circuit experience with soucie analysis 
before ourselves applying soucie analysis to the nsc,we acknowledge the considerable experience of the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in applying this analysis to various units within the executive office of the president.since soucie,that court has twice held such units to be agencies.see pacific legal found.council on envtl.quality,council on environmental quality sierra club andrus,office of management and budget,rev on other grounds sub nom.andrus sierra club,d.once,in the absence of any dispute on the point,that court appears to have assumed a unit agency status,while nevertheless holding the requested document exempt from foia disclosure.see center for int l envtl.law office of trade representative,office of trade representative.in five other cases,however,the circuit has held units within the executive office of the the nsc not to be agencies.see citizens for responsibility ethics in washington office of,office of administration armstrong exec.office of the president,nsc sweetland walters,executive residence meyer bush,task force on regulatory relief rushforth council of econ.advisers,council of economic advisers.
in certain of these cases,including the one in which it concluded that the nsc was not an agency,the circuit has conducted soucie analysis by reference to three factors how close operationally the unit at issue is to the president,whether the unit has a structure,and the nature of its delegat ed authority.meyer bush,at armstrong exec.office of the president,at.thus,as to the nsc,the circuit recognized its structure to tilt in favor of agency status,but concluded that this was outweighed by its close operational proximity to the president and by its lack of authority to do more than advise and assist the president in making or implementing his policies.see armstrong exec.office of the president,at.
main street criticizes this approach for giving insufficient attention to the sole function prong of soucie.see appellant br.we need not here decide when,if at all,this trio of factors might be useful to soucie analysis with the benefit of the circuit experience applying soucie to units within the executive office of the president,but without being controlled by its analysis or by alternatives proposed in other circuit opinions,we proceed to our own consideration of whether the nsc either the council specifically or the nsc system generally is an agency subject to the foia.
d.the council is not an agency subject to the foia 
the council sole statutory function is to advise and assist the president 
to determine the function of a statutorily created entity such as the national security council,a court properly begins with the authorizing legislation.see citizens for responsibility ethics in washington office of,at beginning analysis with entity charter documents.in creating the council,congress stated as follows 
the function of the council shall be to advise the president with respect to the integration of domestic,foreign,and military policies relating to the national security so as to enable the military services and the other departments and agencies of the government to cooperate more effectively in matters involving the national security.
a emphasis added.such use of the definite article to describe the function of the council in the legislation first subsection makes clear that the sole function statutorily conferred on the council is advisory to,and not independent of,the president.see rumsfeld padilla,d stating that statutory use of definite article indicates that there is generally only one of referenced noun.this is only reinforced by the fact that the president is the presiding member of the council.see a.council members may head government departments with independent authority in their respective spheres.indeed,it is precisely for that reason that their advice is sought with respect to the integration of diverse policies relating to national security,to secure cooperat ion in more effectively exercising their respective departments authority in matters involving the national security.id.but when serving as the council itself,their sole function is advisory to the president.nothing in the legislation confers functions on the council as a body,much less any authority independent of the president 
this contrasts with congress treatment of other units within the executive office of the president,such as the office of science and technology and the office of the trade representative.soucie recognized the former as an agency b y virtue of its independent function of evaluating federal programs,which reflected congress statutory delegat ion of some of its own broad power of inquiry to that entity.soucie david,at emphasis added.as for the office of the trade representative,which did not dispute its agency status in arguing for a foia exemption in center for international environmental law office of trade representative,congress statutorily granted it independent authority to enforce trade agreements in c.
the statute additional functions subsection confers no authority on the council independent of the president 
nor can a grant of independent authority be located in the next,additional functions,subsection of the national security act,which imposes duties on the council,i n addition to performing such other functions as the president may direct.b.to explain,we reproduce the full text of the subsection in the margin,highlighting it so as to show three parts the opening clause underscored implicitly recognizes the president authority to assign additional functions to the council the other functions clause.the enumerated part regular typeface identifies two functions that congress requires the council to perform in any event the enumerated functions provisions.between these two parts is a third italicized specifying the purpose for which the council is to perform its additional functions more effectively coordinating the policies and functions of the departments and agencies of the government relating to the national security the purpose phrase.
this structure confirms that the council is more appropriately viewed as a forum attended by actors exercising independent authority within their respective spheres,not an actor itself,much less one exercising authority independent of the president.the enumerated functions provisions make it the council duty to assess,appraise,and consider certain security matters,but only subject to the direction of the president and in order to make recommendations to the president in connection therewith.recommendations do not manifest an exercise of independent authority.rather,they are advice to the person with authority to act on them here,the president.thus,b a dditional functions are best understood simply to particularize the overall advisory function of a.
the purpose phrase of b further supports this conclusion.its coordination objective more effectively coordinating the policies and functions of government entities relating to the national security echoes the integration and cooperation goals of a advisory function.indeed,coordination is a term long associated with the nsc and with the integration objectives of the national security act,referenced supra note.see national security act of,tit.i,stat.at entitling portion of national security act creating nsc coordination for national security,at stating that nsc would meet urgent need for a continuous program of close coordination between our domestic,foreign,and military policies,at stating that nsc is intended to meet need for closer and continuous coordination on a high level within the government of our domestic,foreign,and military policy,at stating that nsc shall be president principal means for coordinating executive departments and agencies in the development and implementation of national security policy.thus,coordination within the council involves no exercise of authority independent of the president,or even of the agencies whose heads are council members.certainly,there is no mechanism for a majority of the council in the absence of a presidential directive to compel member action within the departments they head.rather,coordination within the council is the means by which the president can secure both the collective national security recommendations of department heads and their cooperation in integrating his policies across various parts of government.the former function is solely to advise,the latter solely to assist 
with this understanding,we conclude that where a statutory subsection identifying t he function of the council as advising the president,a,is followed by a subsection particularizing duties to coordinate that advice,language signaling that the specified duties are not exclusive,but in addition to such other functions as the president may direct,can not reasonably be construed as a congressional delegation of independent authority to the council.as the supreme court has observed,congress does not hide elephants in mouseholes.whitman am.trucking ass ns,d.thus,when we consider b other functions clause in context,see generally utility air regulatory grp.epa,d referencing fundamental construction canon that statutory language be read in context,with view to place in overall statutory scheme internal quotation marks omitted,we construe it to mean that for the purpose of more effectively coordinating the policies and functions of government entities relating to the national security,the president may direct the national security council to provide him with particular advice and assistance beyond that specifically identified in that statutory subsection.
in sum,we conclude that the sole statutory authority conferred on the council is to advise and assist the president,both in general,as stated in a,and for the specific purpose of effectively coordinating that advice and assistance as provided in b because the council lacks any authority independent of the president,it is not an agency subject to the foia.see soucie david,at looking to statutory functions to determine agency status.
references to the nsc as an agency provide no assistance here,having occurred when the nsc was statutorily authorized to direct the cia,which authority has now been withdrawn 
in urging otherwise,main street highlights certain references to the nsc as an agency.first,it cites the house report on the foia amendments,see,reprinted in foia source book,which included the nsc on a list of entities expected to come within the proposed reference to establishment in the executive office of the president.second,it observes that,in kissinger reporters committee for freedom of the press,the supreme court cited this house report as support for an assumption that the nsc was an agency subject to the foia.see at.third,it points to a opinion from the department of justice office of legal counsel olc concluding that the nsc is an agency subject to the foia.see freedom of information act sec.councilagency status under foia,op.none of these references will bear the weight assigned to them by main street.
the house report was supplanted by the conference report,which made no attempt to identify entities within the executive office of the president that were or were not subject to the foia.see generally slayton am.express,cir noting that conference report is generally the most reliable evidence in legislative history of congressional intent because it represents the final statement of the terms agreed to by both houses internal quotation marks omitted.rather,the conference report cites soucie david in expressing the conferees intent not to reach the president immediate personal staff or those units of the executive office whose sole function is to advise or assist the president.see,reprinted in foia source book.as noted supra at,it is this conference report on which the supreme court relied in construing f reach by reference to the soucie standard in kissinger.
kissinger assumption that the nsc was an agency was made only arguendo in concluding,nonetheless,that the plaintiffs in that case had failed properly to make a foia request for any nsc records.see kissinger reporters comm.for freedom of the press,at.such an assumption is not even dictum and,thus,hardly resolves this appeal.
as for the olc opinion,it was withdrawn in,supplanted by the conclusion that the nsc was not an agency subject to the foia.see memorandum from walter dellinger,acting ass t att y,office of legal counsel,to alan kreczko,spec.ass t to the president and legal adviser,sec.council.
the change in olc positions is attributable,at least in part,to a fact that undermines main street reliance on all three cited references.see id.at.at the time of these references,the nsc was statutorily authorized to direct the central intelligence agency cia.see national security act of a,d,stat.at creating cia under nsc and setting forth cia duties under the direction of the national security council.that authority,however,has now been withdrawn.see intelligence organization act of,tit.vii,stat,removing language that cia was under nsc see also national security reform act of,tit.i,stat,removing remaining nsc authority over cia.in short,the cited references to the nsc as an agency were made at a time when the nsc oversaw the cia,which is itself an agency subject to the foia.see cia sims,d applying foia to cia center for constitutional rights cia,cir same.those references say nothing about whether the it exists as an agency under the soucie standard.accordingly,they do not assist,much less dictate,resolution of this appeal.
we,therefore,adhere to our conclusion,reached by applying soucie analysis to the text of the national security act,that the council is not an agency subject to the foia because its sole statutory function is to advise and assist the president 
e.the nsc system is not an agency subject to the foia 
we now consider whether,even if the council itself is not an agency subject to the foia,a different conclusion might apply to the nsc system.parts of the nsc system are created by statute,specifically,the nsc staff,the board for low intensity conflict,and the committees on foreign intelligence and transnational threats.see c,g i parts are created by presidential directive.see.we address the two separately but,in the end,reach a single conclusion the nsc system is not an agency subject to the foia 
the nsc system is not statutorily granted any authority independent of the president 
in considering what statutory authority congress conferred on staff,boards,and committees of the nsc system,we are ever mindful that atop this system sits the council,which,for reasons just discussed,we conclude has been granted no statutory authority independent of the president but,rather,has been assigned only the function of advising and assisting the president.this gives rise to a strong presumption that congress intended to confer no more authority on the nsc system than it conferred on the council at its head.the relevant statutory text,which we now discuss,warrants no different conclusion.
the national security act provides for the nsc to have a staff to perform such duties as may be prescribed by the council in connection with the performance of its functions.c.as we have already explained,the council functions are solely advisory it is granted no authority independent of the president.thus,it can hardly confer on its staff more authority than it has itself.any duties the nsc assigns to its staff in connection with the performance of its functions,therefore,must also be deemed only to advise,or to assist in advising or assisting.
in this respect,we emphasize that the relevant soucie inquiry is not whether an entity enjoys a measure of discretion,or independence,in how it provides advice or assistance.that is true to some degree of most advisers and assistants.rather,soucie asks whether an entity does more than render advice or assistance to the it exercises authority independent of the president,particularly with respect to individuals or other parts of government.nothing in c admits a conclusion that the nsc staff exercises any such independent authority.
b.the board for low intensity conflict 
in,congress amended the national security act to provide for the president establish ment within the nsc system of a board to be known as the board for low intensity conflict.res.of,f,stat,codified at g.the principal,and sole statutorily identified,function of this board is to coordinate the policies of the united states for low intensity conflict.g.
we have already explained that coordination within the nsc is a means for securing national security policy recommendations to the president advice and consistent implementation of the president policy decisions assistance across government departments.such coordination does not contemplate the nsc exercise of authority independent of the president.see supra at.thus,because coordination is the sole function statutorily assigned to the board for low intensity conflict,and because the statute gives the board no authority to dictate to persons or departments,we conclude that the board is not an agency subject to the foia.
c.the committee on foreign intelligence 
in,congress added a committee on foreign intelligence to the nsc system.see intelligence renewal and reform act of,tit.viii,stat,codified as amended at h.this committee is composed of the president national security advisor,who serves as chair,the director of national intelligence,the secretaries of state and defense,and such other members as the president may designate.see h.its sole statutory function is to assist the nsc and,thereby,the president,by undertaking certain activities,set forth fully in the margin.id.h 
as is apparent from the listed activities,the committee assists the nsc by reporting and recommending on,as well as coordinating,the nation intelligence gathering efforts as required to address national security interests specified by the president.id.insofar as the committee is also charged with establishing priorities including funding priorities among intelligence programs,and policies relating to the roles of various elements of the intelligence community and the targets of intelligence activities,see,such provisions might suggest independent authority if read in isolation.but statutory text is not properly construed in isolation it must be read in context.see utility air regulatory grp.epa.at.the context in which the committee on foreign intelligence takes any of the actions listed in h is established by its singular statutory function to assist the council an entity whose sole statutory function,as we have already concluded,is to advise and assist the president.where congress thus grants only advisory and assistance functions to entities within a hierarchical system headed by the president,we identify no legislative intent to confer authority independent of the president on that system.rather,we conclude that the committee on foreign intelligence,like the council,provides a forum for specified persons to identify national security needs,priorities,and policies in order to transmit their recommendations upward for further action,and to provide guidance downward so that diverse departments each acting pursuant to the authority of its own head can effectively coordinate implementation of the president policies.
our reading of the text not to confer independent authority on the committee is further supported by legislative history.see,at.stating intent for committee on foreign intelligence to provide better guidance to the intelligence community,at stating intent to provide guidance for the conduct of intelligence activities.
in sum,because the sole function of the committee on foreign intelligence is to assist the council,and thereby,the president,and because it provides only guidance,not directives,to other parts of government,we conclude that it exercises no independent authority and,therefore,is not an agency subject to the foia.
d.the committee on transnational threats 
at the same time that congress added the committee on foreign intelligence to the nsc system,it also added the committee on transnational threats.see intelligence renewal and reform act of,stat.at codified as amended at i.that committee consists of the president national security advisor,who serves as chair,as well as the director of national intelligence,the secretaries of state and defense,the attorney general,and such other members as the president may designate.see i.its single statutory function is to coordinate and direct the activities of the united states government relating to combatting transnational threats.id.i.
we have already explained why coordination within the nsc system does not contemplate the exercise of any authority independent of the president.see supra at.as for the word direct,while it can imply an exercise of authority,it does not always.direct can mean to manage or guide by advice,helpful information,instruction,random house webster unabridged dictionary ed see also webster third new international dictionary defining direct to mean,inter alia,to assist by giving advice,instruction,and supervision the oxford english dictionary ed defining direct to mean,inter alia,t o regulate the course of to guide,conduct,lead to guide with advice,to advise.here,the statutory text,context,and legislative history support construing the word to have such an advisory meaning 
section i lists actions that the committee on transnational threats shall undertake in carrying out its function.these include identifying transnational threats,developing strategies to combat those threats,monitoring the implementation of those strategies,assisting in the resolution of policy differences among agencies,developing policies to improve data sharing,and developing guidelines to improve coordination.see id.such activitiesidentifying problems,developing best practices,monitoring implementationare precisely those expected of an advisory body.nowhere does the statute confer on the committee any authority itself to act on identified problems,to enforce policies or guidelines,or otherwise to dictate action to any persons or entities.to the contrary,by placing this committee within a system of fora,atop which sits a council whose sole function is to advise and assist the president,congress signaled its intent that the committee on transnational threats also function advisorily rather than exercise independent authority.
the relevant conference report supports this conclusion,stating that the committee on transnational threats was created to provide guidance on issues raised by the intersection of law enforcement and intelligence,at.that view was echoed by senator arlen specter r,the senate majority floor manager for the legislation,who stated that the committee purpose was to provide better policy guidance for departments and agencies involv ed in fighting international terrorism and crime.cong.rec.
no different conclusion is warranted because the president and the department of justice objected to the creation of the committee on transnational threats.their concern was separation of powers,congress intrusion on the president prerogative to decide which officials within the executive branch would advise on his policies relating to transnational issues.nothing in their objections suggests that the committee was being granted authority independent of the president.see statement on signing the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year,pub.papers,stating with respect to creation of committee on transnational threats that congress efforts to dictate the president policy process unduly intrude upon executive prerogatives and responsibilities see also,at noting justice department view that law enforcement activities should not be directed on the basis of considerations unrelated to the enforcement of law.
in sum,relevant statutory provisions provide for the various parts of the nsc system to perform functions that advise and assist the council and the president.they confer no authority independent of the president so as to make the nsc system an agency subject to the foia.
the president has not granted the nsc system any independent authority 
presidential delegations of authority 
each president organizes the nsc system as he thinks will best assist him in carrying out his national security responsibilities.see,at to assist me in carrying out my responsibilities in the area of national security,i hereby direct that the national security council system be organized as follows.main street maintains that the president has done so in a way that allows the nsc system to exercise national security authority independent of him,thereby making it an agency subject to the foia.we are not persuaded.
at the outset,we observe that a due regard for separation of powers signals judicial caution in assessing a claim that the nation chief executive has so conveyed his authority to another person or entity that it can now be exercised independent of him.this is not to suggest that the president can never delegate executive authority.but the president alone decides the extent and conditions of any delegation.moreover,he can revoke a delegation whenever he changes his mind or overrule any exercise with which he disagrees.for these reasons,we are skeptical as to whether a president can ever be said to have delegated his own authority in a way that renders it truly independent of him.see meyer bush,at noting even dissent doubt that president would ever delegate true independent authority to his cabinet,and reaching same conclusion with respect to task force composed in part of certain cabinet officials.
this contrasts with statutory grants of authority to executive departments or agencies,which flow from a source independent from the president.thus,congress can confer authority beyond the president own.in such circumstances,the president may still give directions to executive agencies,and he can usually fire a recalcitrant agency head.but he can not take away the agency statutory authority or exercise it himself.see free enter.fund pub.accounting oversight,d recognizing that congress may vest appointment power in agencies rather than president myers united states.acknowledging that president may not always overrule or revise subordinate action.statutory grants therefore easily allow an entity within the executive branch to be deemed an authority of the government of the united states that exercises power independent of the president.soucie david,at quoting.but presidential delegations of authority may not warrant that conclusion.they may simply make the entity an extension of the president,a vehicle for assisting him in exercising his authority when he can not do so in person.see id.at stating that entity that is part of the president staff could not be separate agency.
we need not here decide when,if ever,a presidential rather than statutory grant of authority might allow an executive entity to exercise power independent of the president so as to render it an agency subject to the foia.we decide only that no such agency conclusion is warranted here with respect to the nsc system.
ppd clearly expresses the president intent to organize the nsc system to assist him in exercising his authority 
in assessing a claim that the president has so conveyed his authority as to allow it to be exercised independent of him,separation of powers further counsels a respectful measure of deference to the president own statements of intent in taking the action at issue.the first words of the president policy directive organizing the nsc system clearly express his intent to assist me in carrying out my responsibilities in the area of national security,i hereby direct that the national security council system be organized as follows,at emphasis added.the highlighted language makes plain that the president organized the nsc system only to secure assistance for himself in carrying out his responsibilities.nothing in the directive indicates any intent to transfer presidential authority so that it can be exercised independent of the president.in this regard,we reiterate a point made earlier the relevant soucie inquiry is not whether a unit within the executive office of the president can exercise some discretion in providing the president with advice and assistance.it is whether advice and assistance to the president is the unit sole function,or whether it is empowered to exercise authority independent of the president.when we apply soucie analysis to,we easily conclude from its plain language that it establishes assistance to the president as the sole function of the nsc system and conveys no authority to act independent of the president either with respect to private persons or other government entities.
ppd grants non statutory committees no authority independent of the president 
despite plain statement of presidential intent only to secure assistance from the nsc system,main street argues that the president has therein organized nsc committees so that they do exercise authority independent of him.for the reasons that follow,does not support that conclusion.
the principals committee 
the principals committee referenced in has operated since as the senior interagency forum for consideration of policy issues affecting national security,at emphasis added obviously,it assists the president in carrying out his national security responsibilities to have heads of various executive departments meet together and jointly consider issues affecting national security.the coordination objective at the core of the nsc authorizing legislation contemplates both channeling jointly considered policy recommendations up to the council,and thereby to the president,and channeling the president policy decisions down for consistent implementation across departments.see supra at.
the fact that the principals committee may reach conclusions and decisions does not manifest an exercise of independent authority by the committee.see appellant br.quoting,at.there may be a conclusion that a national security policy needs to be formulated or clarified and a decision to refer it to the council and,thereby,to the president himself.that circumstance manifests advice and assistance to the president,not the exercise of authority independent of him or there may be a conclusion to coordinate agencies implementation of a particular presidential policy and a decision about how to achieve that.in that circumstance,however,the principals committee does not itself exercise independent authority.rather,it serves as a forum for members to coordinate the action authority of their individual agencies in furthering presidential policies.such a coordinating forum assists the president but exercises no authority independent of either him or the forum members.
the deputies committee 
the deputies committee,as its name suggests,consists of persons serving as deputies to the ranking officials serving on the principals committee.see,at.it thus occupies the rung below the principals committee in the nsc hierarchy.the deputies committee help s ensure that issues being brought before the principals committee or the nsc have been properly analyzed and prepared for decision.id.at.this is plainly a function intended to assist the principals committee and the council,which in turn advises and assists the president.see generally cutler,supra note,at discussing importance of having items presented for council deliberation on basis of carefully staffed and carefully written documents.it bespeaks no exercise of authority independent of the president.
the deputies committee also schedules p eriodic reviews of the administration major foreign policy initiatives to ensure that they are being implemented in a timely and effective manner,and to consider whether existing policy directives should be revamped or rescinded,at.such a process also serves only to assist the president in implementing his policies it does not constitute authority independent of the president.
the deputies committee is responsible for crisis management,reporting to the national security council.id.at.the qualifying obligation to report to the council,over which the president himself presides,makes plain that the committee management responsibility involves no exercise of authority independent of the president,but only the assistance needed for the president to respond to crises.
finally,the deputies committee review s and monitor s the work of the nsc interagency process,a task that includes setting up interagency policy committees to review policies and develop options in respective areas.id.at.that this task only assists the president and exercises no authority independent of him is evident from the responsibilities of the interagency policy committees.
the interagency policy committees 
the interagency policy committees are the main fora for interagency coordination of national security policy.id.at.as such,they provide policy analysis for consideration by the more senior committees of the nsc system and ensure timely responses to decisions made by the president.id.they also review and coordinate the implementation of presidential decisions in their policy areas.id.in short,the interagency policy committees only task is to provide assistance within an nsc system that functions solely to advise and assist the president the committees exercise no authority independent of the president.
in urging otherwise,main street contends that a justice department investigation shows that,with respect to policy for detention issues,authority independent of the president was exercised successively at each of three nsc committee levels the interagency policy committee,the deputies committee,and the principals committee.appellant br.in fact,the report cited for this assertion does not support it.see dep t of justice,office of,a review of the fbi involvement in and observations of detainee interrogations in guantanamo bay,afghanistan,and iraq,available at.
the report states that discussions on various detention matters,including processes for sorting detainees and later for the repatriation or release of detainees,took place in a policy coordinating committee.id.at.such discussions are necessary to the coordination task assigned interagency policy committees by the president.they are not an exercise of authority independent of the president.the cited report further states that detainee issues not resolved by an interagency policy committee were raised to the deputies committee and,if not resolved there,to the principals committee.id.at.this does not demonstrate each committee exercise of authority independent of the president.rather,it shows that where agency representatives in each committee could agree on how to coordinate detainee issues consistent with the president policy,they did so,but where they encountered disagreements that they could not reconcile,they raised the issue to the next higher committee level.it is hardly surprising that department heads serving on the principals committee,many of whom also served on the national security council,were better able than their subordinates to reconcile certain disagreements to ensure their departments coordinated compliance with the president policies.nor is there any reason to think that if the principals committee could not do so,it would not have raised the matter to the council for presidential decision.
in sum,we identify nothing in the president organization of the nsc system that allows any part thereof to exercise authority independent of the president.rather,organizes the nsc system to establish a hierarchy of interagency fora for providing the president with information and recommendations on national security issues from across the executive branch,as well as for coordinating implementation of the president policies across government departments.thus,we conclude that the nsc system,like the council,has a single function to advise and assist the president.because it exercises no independent authority,it is not an agency subject to the foia.
executive orders grant the nsc system no authority independent of the president 
the various executive orders cited by main street also fail to support its argument that the nsc system exercises authority independent of the president.
one cited order provides for coordination,guidance,and dispute resolution in the area of emergency communications policy through the interagency process provided in.see exec.order.we have already concluded that coordination and guidance within the nsc system assist the president in implementing his policies they do not constitute an exercise of independent authority.the same conclusion obtains with respect to dispute resolution through the ppd interagency process.as we have explained,that process establishes a hierarchy of interagency fora for full discussion across government departments of national security issues and coordinated implementation by departments of the president policies.but the resolution of disputes in this process appears to be consensual,thus narrowing the matters requiring council and,ultimately,presidential attention.nowhere does the order authorize any part of the nsc system on its own to dictate a resolution to any objecting government department.
another cited order provides for nsc review of both past covert operations and new proposed operations for the purpose of providing support to the president and submitting to the president a policy recommendation.exec.order.this is entirely consistent with the nsc statutory advisory function,and indicates no exercise of authority independent of the president.
similarly,executive orders providing for the nsc to formulate or give policy direction for security programs affecting multiple agencies,or to approve or review such programs directives or actions,do not reach beyond the nsc advisory coordinating function.see exec.order a,providing for nsc,along with other bodies,to serve as the integrated policymaking forum for consideration and formulation of national defense resource preparedness policy and to make recommendations to president on use of statutory authority exec.order a b,providing for nsc to give overall policy direction on national industrial security program,to approve directives of that program,and to resolve interagency disputes.because the nsc is statutorily charged with advising the president as to the integration of policies requiring cooperation among diverse agencies,see a b,we will not assume that executive orders providing for nsc involvement in programs requiring such coordinated policies grant the nsc authority independent of the president who presides over it.
finally,we identify no grant of independent authority in the executive order creating a steering committee,chaired by senior representatives of the nsc staff and the office of management and budget,to establish and review goals for interagency sharing and safeguarding of classified information.exec.order.the order does not contemplate that the steering committee will pronounce policies,or even set priorities or standards.rather,it directs the steering committee to coordinat e interagency development and implementation of such matters.id.emphasis added.such coordination is at the core of the assistance provided to the president by the nsc.it involves no exercise of authority independent of the president or even independent of the agencies endeavoring to coordinate their own efforts.see supra at.this is evident from the fact that,when coordination can not be achieved in the steering committee,the executive order provides for referral to the nsc deputies committee in accordance with.see exec.order h,at.the deputies committee exercises no independent authority,see supra at rather,it provides yet another forum for still higher ranking officials to resolve coordination challenges.moreover,when the steering committee identifies a need for an overarching policy beyond interagency coordination,the executive order does not authorize the committee to promulgate that policy itself.rather,it directs the steering committee to recommend promulgation to agencies outside the nsc system authorized to do so,specifically,the office of management and budget or the information security oversight office of the national archives and records administration.see exec.order e,at.
accordingly,we reject main street argument that the cited executive orders confer on the council or nsc system any authority that can be exercised independent of the president.
nsc regulations do not demonstrate its current exercise of authority independent of the president 
main street further argues that the nsc agency status can be inferred from its promulgation of regulations.see pacific legal found.council on envtl.quality,at citing council on environmental quality promulgation of regulations in holding it agency subject to foia.the cited regulations,however,were all promulgated more than two decades ago and under circumstances that will not admit an inference that the nsc presently exercises any authority independent of the president.
the cited telecommunications regulations,c,g,f,g,were promulgated pursuant to executive order,giving nsc responsibility over development of telecommunications policy for emergency situations.in,however,those sections of executive order relating to the nsc were revoked and superseded by executive order b,which left the nsc with a largely advisory role in the telecommunications system,see id,at.even that was withdrawn when executive order was revoked by executive order b.in sum,at present,the nsc plays no role in the telecommunications system other than to provide a process for interagency coordination consistent with its overall,and sole,advisory function.see id,at.
as for regulations promulgated to comply with the privacy act,pt,and an executive order mandating declassification review,pt.see also privacy act exec.order,declassification order,these were issued at times when olc deemed the nsc an agency.since olc withdrawal of that opinion,see supra at,the nsc has issued no further regulations 
main street nevertheless submits that because certain of these privacy act and declassification regulations remain in effect,the nsc continues to exercise independent authority and,therefore,is an agency.we are not persuaded.the extant regulations only outline procedures the nsc will employ in responding to record requests or in classifying or declassifying documents processed by its staff they impose no duties or restrictions on private persons or government entities,as is usually the case with an exercise of government authority.
accordingly,we conclude that the nsc past promulgation of regulations can not support a conclusion that it currently exercises any authority independent of the president or performs any function but to advise and assist the president.
reported nsc system actions 
main street submits that reports of nsc system actions demonstrate that it does not function only to advise and assist the president but,rather,exercises authority independent of him.we are reluctant to locate the authority indicative of agency status in action unsupported by an identified legal grant from congress or the president.we do not pursue that point,however,because the actions cited by main street are insufficient to demonstrate agency status in any event 
main street submits that security advisor john brennan responses to senate questions about the selection of drone targets demonstrate that the nsc system exercises authority independent of the president.in fact,the record is to the contrary.asked who within the administration makes the final determination to launch a drone strike against an american citizen target,brennan replied that t he process of deciding to take such an extraordinary action would involve legal review by the department of justice,as well as a discussion among the departments and agencies across our national security team,including the relevant national security council principals and the president.john brennan,responses to posthearing questions emphasis added,available at.far from demonstrating authority exercised independent of the president,the described process manifests the very function of advising the president in connection with the exercise of his authority,as envisioned by congress in establishing the nsc and by the president in organizing the nsc system 
in a letter submitted before oral argument,see fed.j,main street also cites the partially declassified page summary to a classified page senate intelligence committee report on the use of enhanced interrogation techniques under the administration of president george bush.from this mass of material,main street highlights a single statement,attributed to cia records,that in july,the nsc principals committee agreed that the cia was authorized and directed to utilize enhanced interrogation techniques on detainee janat gul.appellant fed.j letter,at emphasis omitted quoting select comm.on intelligence,committee study of the central intelligence agency detention and interrogation program executive summary executive summary,available at.main street submits that this was a formal authorization that the principals committee granted independently of the president because the president does not sit on that committee,and because the president was not even briefed on enhanced interrogation techniques until april.id.the quoted statement from the cia report is too slender a reed to support main street contention.
first,insofar as main street argument depends on presidential ignorance,the only cited support for this premise is the summary observation that cia records indicate that the first cia briefing for the president on the cia enhanced interrogation techniques occurred on april.executive summary.but as the summary elsewhere states,the cia had earlier and repeatedly briefed a host of presidential advisors on the matter,including the vice president,several cabinet members,the president national security advisor,white house counsel,and various white house staffers.see id.at.precedent does not permit an assumption that all these officials kept the president in the dark about cia interrogation,much less that they did so for four years while the principals committee exercised independent authority in this area.see united states armstrong,d holding that in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary,courts presume that government officials have properly discharged their official duties see generally ashcroft iqbal,d holding that inference of proscribed intent not plausible where there is more likely explanation for challenged conduct.
further,and more important,the quoted cia report is insufficient plausibly to allege the nsc exercise of authority independent of the president.the report asserts that the principals committee agreed that the cia was authorized and directed to utilize enhanced interrogation.but authorized and directed by whom we have already explained how presidents have organized the nsc system,including the principals committee,not to exercise independent authority,but to advise them in providing for national security and to assist in ensuring coordinated implementation of presidential policies across government departments.thus,we will not readily assume that any part of the nsc system has overreached its function.see united states armstrong,at.specifically,we will not assume that when any part of the nsc system concludes that a department is authorized and directed to take action that it is the nsc itself that is authorizing and directing the action rather than simply communicating that the proposed action is authorized and directed by presidential policies.
that caution is reinforced here by the executive summary report that it was the president national security advisor who initially approved the interrogation at issue,before proposing that the cia present the matter to the principals committee for additional guidance.executive summary.the committee,in turn,directed the justice department to provide the cia with a legal opinion,which the attorney general did,acting on his own authority as the nation chief law enforcement officer.see id.at reporting attorney general opinion that nine of proposed interrogation techniques comported with constitution and treaty obligations.these circumstances,where initial approval is conveyed by a presidential advisor not held to exercise authority independent of the chief executive,see kissinger reporters comm.for freedom of the press,at,and
