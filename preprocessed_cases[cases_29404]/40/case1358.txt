the primary question presented in this appeal is whether the district court erred in holding that the contents of a particular letter from defense counsel to counsel for the plaintiffs,as clarified by a letter from defense counsel thirteen days later,rendered moot the plaintiffs claims for unpaid overtime wages in a collective action under the fair labor standards act flsa,such that a live case or controversy no longer existed with respect to such claims,requiring their dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we answer this question in the affirmative,and therefore,vacate the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs flsa claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

as a general rule,the flsa prohibits an employer from requiring any of his employees to work more than forty hours per workweek unless the employee receives overtime compensation at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate at which he is employed.a.however,any employee employed in a bona fide executive,administrative,or professional capacity as such terms are defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the secretary of labor,is exempt from this general rule.id.at a.an employer bears the burden of proving that a particular employee job falls within this exemption.darveau detecon,cir.an employer who violates the flsa overtime provision is liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid overtime compensation and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages b.
on october,the named plaintiffs filed their initial complaint the complaint in north carolina state court against united mortgage,arthur kechijian,and larry austin the original defendants.the complaint alleged the original defendants paid their junior asset managers as salaried exempt employees,routinely required junior asset managers to work in excess of forty hours per week refused to pay them for hours worked in excess of hours per week,in august,began requiring junior asset managers to fill out time cards documenting the hours they had worked and following an investigation by the united states department of labor in,instructed junior asset managers to stop filling out the time cards.under the heading first claim for relief,the complaint alleged t he position of junior asset manager does not meet the standards for exemption under the flsa,a and alleged the original defendants violated the flsa by willfully failing to pay the named plaintiffs and other similarly situated employees overtime wages for hours worked in excess of forty hours per week regularly and routinely requiring the named plaintiffs and other similarly situated employees to work off the clock failing to make,keep,and preserve accurate time records sufficient to determine the wages and hours of the named plaintiffs and other similarly situated employees and other practices.additionally,the complaint alleged that the original defendants were employer s,within the meaning and definition of the flsa,d,and that the named plaintiffs were employee s of the original defendants,within the meaning and definition of the flsa,id.at e.
the named plaintiffs brought this portion of the case as an collective action,pursuant to b,on behalf of themselves and on behalf of all persons who were,are,or will be employed by united mortgage in the position of junior asset manager on or after the date that is three years before the filing of this complaint.specifically,b provides that an flsa action for overtime compensation may be maintained against any employer in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and other employees similarly situated.id.however,unlike in a class action filed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure or a comparable state court rule,in a collective action under the flsa,a named plaintiff represents only himself until a employee opts in as a party plaintiff by giving his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.id.see sandoz cingular wireless,llc,cir u nlike in a rule class action,in a flsa collective action the plaintiff represents only him or herself until employees opt in.also notable is the fact that,in an action to recover unpaid overtime and liquidated damages under the flsa,t he court in such action shall,in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs,allow a reasonable attorney fee to be paid by the defendant,and costs of the action.b.
as relief,the named plaintiffs sought,on behalf of themselves and any collective action plaintiffs,the amount of their respective unpaid wages and overtime compensation,and liquidated damages,as provided by the flsa,b injunctive relief requiring defendants to cease and desist from their violations of the flsa described herein and to comply with the flsa and such other legal and equitable relief as the court deems just and proper.additionally,the named plaintiffs sought to recover,on behalf of themselves and the collective action plaintiffs,their attorneys fees and the costs,as provided by the flsa,b.id.
based upon the same set of facts underlying the named plaintiffs flsa claims,under the heading second claim for relief,the complaint alleged the original defendants violated various provisions of the north carolina wage and hour act ncwha.et.pursuant to rule of the north carolina rules of civil procedure,this part of the case was styled as a purported class action in which the named plaintiffs sought to represent a class of all persons who were,are,or will be employed by united mortgage in the position of junior asset manager on or after the date that is two years before the filing of this complaint the ncwha class period.the complaint specifically alleged the original defendants willfully violated the ncwha by failing to pay the named plaintiffs and other members of the ncwha class their earned wages for all hours worked by failing to pay the same persons overtime pay by failing to make,keep,and preserve accurate time records sufficient to determine their wages and hours by failing to provide them lawful notice of company policies and practices concerning compensation or notice of any changes in such policies and practices and by other practices.with respect to relief,the named plaintiffs sought to recover,on behalf of themselves and the other members of the ncwha class,damages in the amount of their unpaid earned compensation,plus liquidated damages,as provided by the ncwha,stat.recovery of attorneys fees and costs,as provided by the ncwha,were also sought.
the original defendants timely removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of north carolina.after removal,on november,the original defendants moved to dismiss the ncwha claims,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,on the ground that the complaint alleged that all overtime claims are covered by the flsa,but failed to allege that any plaintiff worked unpaid overtime during the brief window of time when the applicable minimum wage under the fair labor standards act was less than the minimum wage provided under north carolina law.a b.according to the original defendants,under north carolina general statute a and all cases involving claims for unpaid overtime interpreting that statute,they are exempted from liability for unpaid overtime under the ncwha,because the named plaintiffs and the other members of the ncwha class are covered by the flsa.the original defendants rule b motion also sought dismissal of the complaint to the extent it sought recovery for violations of the record keeping and notice requirements of the flsa and the ncwha,on the ground that neither statute provided a private cause of action for such violations.
on december,the parties held a conference pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f.see.f requiring,inter alia,that at least days before a scheduling conference is to be held or a scheduling order is due under federal rule of civil procedure b,the parties must confer to consider the possibilities for promptly settling or resolving the case.an exchange of between opposing counsel then took place over the next couple of weeks.the show that the original defendants requested a settlement demand from the named plaintiffs the named plaintiffs agreed to work on preparing such a demand and the named plaintiffs requested the original defendants to produce documentation reflecting the hours worked and wage information for each of the named plaintiffs in order to aid in preparation of such demand.on january,the original defendants produced time sheets for the period of april,through may,with respect to named plaintiffs ma lissa simmons,monterrus marshall,and yolanda carraway.however,the original defendants produced no such time sheets for named plaintiff delana pruitt nor wage information for any of the named plaintiffs.
between january,and march,the named plaintiffs filed notices that a total of six persons had consented to be plaintiffs in their collective action under the flsa on march,the named plaintiffs filed an amended complaint the amended complaint.the amended complaint named seven additional defendants asserting each was an employer within the meaning and definition of the flsa and the ncwha,and deleted claims for injunctive and other remedial relief.otherwise,the amended complaint was substantially identical in substance to the complaint.
in response,on april,the original defendants and the newly named defendants collectively the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,upon substantially the same grounds as the first motion to dismiss.the named plaintiffs then filed notices that three more persons had consented to be plaintiffs in their collective action under the flsa,bringing the total of plaintiffs to nine by may,for ease of reference,we will refer to all nine as the plaintiffs.
of significant relevance to the issues on appeal,counsel for the defendants sent via electronic mail,united states mail,and facsimile a letter dated may,to counsel for the named plaintiffs.in the first sentence,counsel for the defendants stated that he was writ ing for the purpose of resolving this case for all parties.in the second sentence,he reported that his clients had authorized him,without admitting legal liability or fault,to offer each plaintiff full relief in this case.id.no specific mention was made regarding the named plaintiffs or an offer of judgment.the balance of the letter stated as follows 
each plaintiff will be compensated fully upon receipt of an affidavit stating the dates on which overtime was worked,the total hours they worked each week of their employment up to the date of their termination,the total amount of back pay they claim is owed to them,and a statement explaining how the calculation of overtime amounts claimed was done.my clients will also pay taxable costs and reasonable attorney fees supported by time records properly describing the work done and the hours reasonably worked which can be either agreed upon by the parties or submitted to the court for resolution.
this offer requires that the parties enter a settlement agreement specifying that all claims will be waived and released,this action will be dismissed with prejudice,the settlement will be kept confidential and there will be no admission of liability or disclosure of the settlement terms.i will provide you with the information my client has that is necessary to prepare the affidavits.
this offer of full relief moots this case since there no longer remains any active case or controversy between the parties.this offer remains open for five days after receipt on may.thereafter,if this offer is not accepted,i will file a motion to dismiss the case as moot.
on may,the named plaintiffs moved for conditional collective action certification of their flsa claims,pursuant to b.as part of such motion,the named plaintiffs sought notice to other potential collective action members and an order that the defendants disclose the names,addresses,email addresses,telephone numbers and social security numbers of all potential collective action members.from here forward,we will refer to the named plaintiffs and the plaintiffs collectively as the plaintiffs.
in a letter dated may,responding to a may,letter by counsel for the plaintiffs,counsel for the defendants stated that the offer of settlement in the may,letter included liquidated damages and pertained to the named plaintiffs as well as all of the plaintiffs.also on may,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,defendants moved to dismiss the entire case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.according to the defendants,the district court no longer possessed subject matter jurisdiction,because they ha d offered to satisfy plaintiffs claims in their entirety,leaving no live case or controversy requiring litigation.
the next day,on may,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the ncwha claims in the amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.based upon the plain language of the ncwha,the district court determined that the ncwha does not apply to litigants who also seek liability under the flsa.the district court determined that north carolina minimum wage was not higher than the federal minimum wage during any time when three of the named plaintiffs or any of the plaintiffs were employed by united mortgage moreover,the district court determined that,while united mortgage employed named plaintiff delana pruitt during january,when north carolina minimum wage was higher than the federal minimum wage,the amended complaint did not allege that she actually worked any overtime during that month.
on june,the plaintiffs moved to their motion for conditional certification of the flsa collective action and for notice to potential collective action members to report that,in accordance with local rule a,counsel for the plaintiffs had conferred with counsel for the defendants regarding the motion,but that defendants refused to consent to the motion.
on june,plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the district court order dismissing their ncwha claims and,in the alternative,sought leave to file a second amended complaint which sought to include william kelly,andre moser,and marlena brooks as named plaintiffs and contained a more specific allegation regarding named plaintiff delana pruitt employment.the district court subsequently denied this motion in toto.
on september,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the plaintiffs flsa claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in this regard,the district court determined that defendants offer of judgment to all plaintiffs and plaintiffs was for full relief,including attorney fees and taxable costs,and that c oncern over the defendants ability to plaintiffs has been allayed by the blanket nature of the offer of judgment.both the actual plaintiffs and plaintiffs have been offered relief in whole.the district court also denied the plaintiffs motion for conditional certification of the flsa collective action and for notice to potential collective action members on the ground that the plaintiffs flsa claims were moot prior to the plaintiffs filing such motion,and therefore,it no longer possessed subject matter jurisdiction to certify the collective action.apparently relying upon the same reasoning,the district court also refused to allow the motion to be amended.
this timely appeal followed.on appeal,the plaintiffs challenge the rule b dismissal of their flsa claims and the rule b dismissal of their ncwha claims.
the primary question presented in this appeal is whether the district court erred in holding that the contents of the letter dated may,from the defendants counsel to the plaintiffs counsel,as clarified by a letter from the defendants counsel thirteen days later,rendered the plaintiffs flsa claims moot,such that a live case or controversy no longer existed with respect to such claims,thus requiring their dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we review a district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.pitt county,cir.moreover,w e review a district court jurisdictional findings of fact on any issues that are not intertwined with the facts central to the merits of the plaintiff claims under the clearly erroneous standard of review ex rel.vuyyuru jadhav,cir.see also matter of block shim dev,cir in appellate review of dismissal of case as moot,review of factual findings is under clearly erroneous standard in light of the entire record as a whole.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states gypsum.
at the heart of the question presented is the doctrine of mootness.t he doctrine of mootness constitutes a part of the constitutional limits of federal court jurisdiction a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.united states hardy,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.see also iron arrow honor soc y heckler,federal courts lack jurisdiction to decide moot cases because their constitutional authority extends only to actual cases or controversies.mootness has been described as the doctrine of standing set in a time frame the requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation standing must continue throughout its existence mootness.arizonans for official english arizona,quoting parole comm geraghty.
a case can become moot either due to a change in factual circumstances,or due to a change in the law.bankwest.baker,cir alteration marks,internal quotation marks,and ellipses omitted.see also ross reed,cir if intervening factual or legal events effectively dispel the case or controversy during pendency of the suit,the federal courts are powerless to decide the questions presented.generally speaking,one such factual circumstance mooting a claim arises when the claimant receives the relief he or she sought to obtain through the claim.friedman,dunlap,cir.here,the district court held that the plaintiffs flsa claims became moot due to a change in factual circumstances.according to the district court,such change occurred when,o n may,defendants sent the plaintiffs an offer of judgment providing for full relief for all parties,including attorney fees and taxable offer was also open to the plaintiffs.emphasis added.ultimately,the district court held the defendants may,offer of judgment mooted the action,depriving this court of subject matter jurisdiction therefore,this case is dismissed.emphasis added.
the plaintiffs make several arguments challenging this holding.chief among them is that the contents of the may,letter did not comply with federal rule of civil procedure,which rule provided,at all times relevant to this action,that 
more than days before the trial begins,a party defending against a claim may serve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on specified terms,with the costs then accrued.if,within days after being served,the opposing party serves written notice accepting the offer,either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance,plus proof of service.the clerk must then enter judgment.
emphasis added the balance of rule provides that,in the event the plaintiff refuses the offer of judgment and then ultimately recovers less at trial than the offer amount,the plaintiff must pay the litigation costs incurred by the defendant from the time of the offer of judgment.id.the plain purpose of rule is to encourage settlement and avoid litigation.marek chesny.in furtherance of this purpose,an offer of judgment made pursuant to rule must specify a definite sum or other relief for which judgment may be entered and must be unconditional.charles alan wright,arthur miller,richard marcus,federal practice and procedure,ed.this is because the plaintiff must know unequivocally what is being offered in order to be responsible for refusing such offer.arkla energy res.roye realty developing,cir.
even when considering the clarifications made by the may,letter to the effect that the defendants may,offer included liquidated damages under the flsa and pertained to the named plaintiffs as well as the plaintiffs,we agree with the plaintiffs that the may,letter did not constitute a rule offer of judgment.first,the may,letter provided for a five day window to accept the defendants offer rather than a ten day window as provided by the applicable version of rule.second,rather than making an unconditional offer of judgment on specified terms,the letter conditioned the offer upon the plaintiffs submitting affidavits stating the dates on which overtime was worked,the total hours they worked each week of their employment up to the date of their termination,the total amount of back pay they claim is owed to to them,and a statement explaining how the calculation of overtime amounts claimed was done.third,rather than offer to have judgment entered against them as the district court found,the plain language of the letter offered only that the defendants would enter a settlement agreement specifying that all claims will be waived and released id.the district court finding that the may,letter offered for judgment to be entered against the defendants was clearly erroneous.fourth,in contrast to the public nature of an unsealed judgment entered pursuant to rule,the may,letter required the plaintiffs to keep the fact of settlement and the terms of the settlement confidential.see mccauley trans union,cir plaintiff is not obligated to accept a rule offer of judgment conditioned on settlement being kept confidential and judgment under seal party engaged in litigation is not entitled to confidentiality charles alan wright,arthur miller,richard marcus,federal practice and procedure ed.supp offer of judgment requiring confidential settlement rather than court judgment seeks something not authorized by rule.
while we agree with the plaintiffs that the may,letter,as clarified by the may,letter,did not constitute a rule offer of judgment,such agreement does not mean an automatic win for the plaintiffs.this is because the doctrine of mootness is constitutional in nature,and therefore,not constrained by the formalities of rule.nonetheless,for several reasons,we hold the defendants settlement offer,as set forth in the may,letter and as clarified by the may,letter,did not render moot the plaintiffs flsa claims for overtime wages.the first reason is that the offer for full relief in this case did not offer for judgment to be entered against the defendants,but rather only offered for the parties to enter into a settlement agreement.had the plaintiffs been allowed to litigate fully their flsa claims and had they fully prevailed on such claims,the district court would have entered a judgment against the defendants for full relief with respect to those claims.from the view of the plaintiffs,a judgment in their favor is far preferable to a contractual promise by the defendants in a settlement agreement to pay the same amount.this is because district courts have inherent power to compel defendants to satisfy judgments entered against them,spallone,grissom v.the mills,cir,but lack the power to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement absent jurisdiction over a breach of contract action for failure to comply with the settlement agreement.as ably explained in the well respected treatise federal practice and procedure 
settlements often do not involve the entry of a judgment against the defendant,as compared to a judgment of dismissal,so that from the plaintiff perspective the willingness of the defendant to allow judgment to be entered has substantial importance since
