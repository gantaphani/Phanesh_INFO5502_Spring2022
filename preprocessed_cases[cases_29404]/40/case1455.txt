piney run is a small stream with its headwaters near the border of carroll and baltimore counties in maryland.for the second time,the piney run preservation association the association has filed a citizen suit under the clean water act cwa or the act alleging that the county commissioners of carroll county the county are violating the cwa by discharging treated wastewater,effluent from the hampstead wastewater treatment plant the plant into piney run.the association specifically contends that the temperature of the discharged effluent at times exceeds the thermal limitation set forth in the county national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit on the county motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,the district court found that the maryland department of the environment mde was diligently prosecuting a cwa enforcement action against the county for violating the permit consequently,the court held that the association was barred by b b from maintaining this suit the association now appeals the order of dismissal,arguing that the district court erred in its diligent prosecution determination.we affirm.

as we explained in the prior cwa litigation between these parties,mde has classified piney run as a class stream,meaning that it is protected as a source of public drinking water and as a body capable of supporting a trout population.the plant is subject to the cwa and since has operated under a series of npdes permits granted by mde,the most recent one having been issued in.that permit contains express limitations on the amount of certain pollutants that the plant can discharge,but is a statutory not originally listed in it.see piney run ass n,at.
in march,as part of ongoing administrative litigation involving the plant,mde modified the county permit to include a thermal limitation for the plant discharged effluent and procedures for measuring ambient conditions in piney run.the thermal limitation provides that the effluent can not exceed the higher of or the ambient temperature of the stream.following contested proceedings before an administrative law judge,the modified permit became effective in early.several months later,the county applied to mde for an alternate effluent level ael,a less stringent temperature submitted a study plan for alternate effluent limitation for mde review during the pendency of this application,the county has provided mde with supplemental reports and appears to have cooperated with mde.mde has not yet made a final determination on this application.
apart from its ael application,the county petitioned the state circuit court for review of mde decision to modify the permit.the county also moved to stay enforcement of the modified permit pending the outcome of the petition for review.in turn,mde filed a complaint seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties against the county for,inter alia,violating the thermal limitation in the modified permit the mde enforcement action.eventually,the circuit court denied the county petition for judicial review,but it stayed enforcement of the modified permit until a final decision was rendered on the county petition for review or november,whichever came first.in light of the circuit court stay of enforcement of the modified permit and the county appeal of the denial of its petition for review,mde and the county jointly moved the circuit court to stay the mde enforcement action until the stay of the modified permit was lifted.the circuit court granted the joint motion and stayed the mde enforcement action.on november,the stay of enforcement of the modified permit expired,and that permit again became effective.subsequently,mde final decision modifying the permit was judicially affirmed 
in july,mde and the county entered into a consent judgment in the mde enforcement action reflecting their agreement as to appropriate and interim measures to insure compliance with the permit.the circuit court entered the consent judgment on july,and its terms became the order of the circuit court.see long state of,noting that consent judgments have the same force and effect as other judgments.
the consent judgment initially mandates that upon its effective date,the county shall achieve compliance with the thermal effluent limitations set forth in the modified permit.it also provides that in settlement of all violations of the thermal limitation that occurred between november,and july,the county would pay a civil penalty of for each day that a violation occurred.pursuant to this provision,the county paid penalties in the amount of.
prospectively,the consent judgment also imposes stipulated civil penalties of for each day that the county fails to comply with the thermal limitation of the modified permit meet any requirement or complete any required work,plan,or report or adhere to any required milestone date or schedule.in recognition of the county ael request and implementation of an ael study,the consent judgment provides that the stipulated penalties automatically begin to accrue on the day after performance by the county is due or the day a violation occurs,whichever is applicable,and will continue to accrue until the county satisfactorily completes performance or the violation ceases.if mde approves an ael and that approval is thereafter challenged,then stipulated penalties will continue to accrue however,if a final judgment is entered approving an ael,then stipulated penalties for events that do not exceed the ael will not be assessed by mde.conv
