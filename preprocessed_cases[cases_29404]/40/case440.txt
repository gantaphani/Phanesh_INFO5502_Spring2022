maribel,aracelis,and nilda collectively,plaintiffs,former employees of puerto rico commercial development administration cda,brought suit against carlos gabriel santiago,susana hernández colon,and vilma jiménez collectively,defendants,officials of that agency,pursuant to for wrongful termination because of their political affiliation.plaintiffs asserted that these adverse employment actions violated their first amendment rights under the united states constitution.
at trial,plaintiffs case focused on the circumstances of their dismissals at the end of the probationary periods for their career positions.at the close of plaintiffs case,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to.a,asserting that plaintiffs had not presented a prima facie case of political discrimination.the district court granted that motion in part and denied it in part.after defendants presented their case,which sought to justify plaintiffs terminations because of their poor job performance,defendants renewed their rule a motion.relying on our decision in,cir,which has now been vacated by the united states supreme court on the basis of its decision in unitherm food,d the district court concluded that plaintiffs had presented insufficient evidence of political discrimination to get their case to the jury conducting our own review of the evidence presented at trial,which includes a credibility contest between plaintiffs and defendants over the circumstances of plaintiffs job loss,we vacate the district court judgment in favor of defendants and remand for further proceedings.
before we summarize the evidence in this case,we must describe the ruling of the trial judge at the heart of this appeal.the jury trial began on september.at the close of plaintiffs case on september,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law under.a,asserting that plaintiffs had not presented sufficient evidence to reach the jury on their case of political discrimination.specifically,defendants argued that plaintiffs had not demonstrated that their political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor in their terminations.the district court granted defendants rule a motion in part and denied it in part 
all claims against vilma jiménez jiménez,director of human resources and legal services,were dismissed 
the claims brought by maribel negrón and aracelis gascot against susana hernández colon hernández,a human resources officer,were dismissed 
the first amendment claim of nilda pérez against hernández survived 
the first amendment claims of all of the plaintiffs against carlos gabriel santiago santiago,administrator of the cda,survived.
at the close of their case on september,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law a second time on the remaining claims,on essentially the same grounds as their first rule a motion.ruling from the bench that same day,the district court granted defendants motion.in presenting their renewed rule a motion,defendants relied heavily on our decision in,which was published during the trial.it is also apparent from the record that the district court reviewed during the noon break between the morning session of the defendants made their second rule a the afternoon session when the district court ruled on the motion.the district court explained its reading of the import of in these terms 
if this the case of did not meet the standard of proof for jury submission as to the fact of whether political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the challenged employment action,then this case,that we are trying now,the one that is before us,does meet it,either.
the truth of the matter is that the case of vázquez contained a lot more evidence of potential discriminatory motives and of a circumstantial nature than the one that we are trying.
so under those circumstances,it seems to me that i do see how i can let this case go to the jury i recognize,and i know,on the basis of my experience,that when these things happen in the context of positions like this,usually you have to look carefully,because there is always the good possibility that improper political motives were behind the personnel action.but it is not what i think it is what the evidence sustains.
and obviously,the problem that i have here is that there is no evidence other than a scintilla of evidence to let this case go to a jury,and this case is extremely clear as to what is required.and the case before me does satisfy the standard.
so on the basis of that,i have no other alternative but to disregard my own feelings as to what the case is and enter a judgment under rule,dismissing it on the basis of insufficiency of evidence on the issue of political discrimination under this case of vázquez santiago sic.no other alternative.
plaintiffs read this ruling as reflecting the district court focus on the evidence in their case only and a disregard of the evidence presented by defendants.if,in fact,the district court examined only the evidence presented in plaintiffs case when granting defendants renewed rule a motion,this would be an error of law.see wright miller,federal practice and procedure,civil ed.a renewed rule a motion will be judged in the light of the case as it stands at that time.potti duramed,cir our review of whether there was sufficient evidence to survive judgment as a matter of law must be based on the entire record,not just the record at the end of plaintiffs case,because the defendant proceeded to offer evidence in its own defense.
although plaintiffs reading of the district court ruling is plausible,defendants advance an equally plausible district court evaluated all of the evidence adduced during the trial when it announced its bench ruling.for example,in an exchange with defense counsel concerning the renewed rule a motion,the district court insisted r emember,i wanted the sic hear the evidence as a whole.
in the end,we need not decide which characterization of the district court ruling is accurate.even if the district court had unambiguously focused only on plaintiffs hence had committed an error of law by disregarding defendants evidence when ruling on the renewed rule a could not rule in plaintiffs favor if,in fact,the totality of the evidence did not permit their case to go to the jury.we engage in de novo review of the district court decision granting judgment as a matter of law.see webber int l paper,cir.we can affirm on any basis available in the record because w e are not wedded to the lower court rationale,but,rather,may affirm its order on any independent ground made manifest by the record.intergen grina,cir.therefore,the dispositive question on appeal is whether,in light of the totality of the evidence,the district court correctly ruled that there was insufficient evidence of political discrimination to permit the plaintiffs case to go to the jury.to pursue this inquiry,and to provide an adequate basis for explaining our decision,we must first set forth in some detail the evidence adduced at trial.
on november,general elections were held in puerto rico.the popular democratic party pdp candidate for governor won that election,leading to a change of administration from the incumbent new progressive party npp to the pdp.defendant santiago was appointed administrator of the cda on or about january.as such,he was in charge of all of the cda operations.at the time of the change in regime,defendant hernández served as a human resources officer and officer of labor relations,meaning that she carried out hiring and termination decisions and managed payroll,with santiago approval.plaintiff pérez worked in the human resources department of the cda,where she maintained attendance and payroll records.plaintiff negrón served as the director of the general services division.she was responsible for supervising the maintenance of the cda physical plant and equipment,obtaining supplies,and providing support for the vehicles and equipment of her division.plaintiff gascot was director of the cda management and entrepreneurial school.her duties included managing the school equipment and physical resources,budgeting,and planning the school curriculum.
within three to four weeks after the change of administration in early january,all of the plaintiffs had lost their jobs at the cda.plaintiffs case consisted almost entirely of descriptions of what happened to them in those three to four weeks,and the circumstances of their terminations from the cda.defendants case consisted entirely of explanations of why they were justified in terminating plaintiffs.although the trial lasted six days,and included other witnesses we summarize only the testimony of the three plaintiffs and the two remaining defendants.for the testimony of each of the,negrón,and divide the summary of their testimony into three sections before the change of administration after the change of administration and political affiliation testimony.then we summarize the testimony of and santiago testimony related as it pertains to each of the three plaintiffs and hernández related only as it pertains to plaintiff pérez.as noted earlier,the first amendment claims of each of the three plaintiffs against santiago survived defendants first rule a motion.but only pérez claim against hernández survived that same motion.

employment history following santiago arrival and alleged performance deficiencies 
plaintiffs counsel asked negrón about some incidents that occurred following the arrival of santiago.one incident involved changing the locks on the door of santiago office.according to negrón,santiago secretary instructed her to have the lock installed a certain way,and negrón contacted the appropriate company and conveyed these instructions.however,the technician installed the lock incorrectly.the following day negrón was told there was a problem.she once more called the company.the company came back and they once more reinstalled the lock.the only verbal admonishment negrón acknowledged had to do with this incident.that was the wrong way.so we proceeded to change it.
another incident involved the placement of some file cabinets and other furniture,including a.negrón testified that once she received the requests from santiago,she attempted to contact the two employees who performed these duties however,the position for one of those employees was vacant,and the other employee was quite old,and those file cabinets weighed approximately pounds.she informed santiago of the problem,but told him that she would ask two other employees to do the moving.because these two employees were not specifically tasked with this type of work,they had to coordinate schedules to find a time that would work,which caused a delay in the moving of the cabinets.to negrón recollection,santiago was pleased with the work that was done.
negrón also recalled santiago asking her to have an air conditioner duct moved which was in his office.she coordinated with the company that had the air conditioning contract and received the estimate for the work.however,that work was never carried out while negrón was at the cda because santiago never signed the authorization for her.
on her final evaluation,for the period from january,to january,santiago gave her failing marks.in the written evaluation negrón received,santiago stated that negrón had ignored his instructions and performed tasks carelessly and negligently.the evaluation contained similar comments about her cooperativeness.negrón stated that santiago never discussed his negative evaluation with her.negrón testified that santiago gave the evaluation to her at the end of the work day on january,her final day at the cda,and informed her that she did not pass her probationary period.
on,defense counsel questioned negrón account of her performance of the tasks requested by santiago.specifically,he asked her whether the furniture and file cabinets were moved on the same day that she was told to have them moved for more details as to why the air conditioner was never installed and whether the lock had been installed improperly because she conveyed inaccurate instructions to the technician.negrón responded that any delay in moving furniture and file cabinets was caused by unavoidable logistical issues,and the objects were moved as fast as possible the air conditioner was not installed because santiago never gave proper written authorization and the improper installation was the result of an error by the technician rather than an error in her instructions that was corrected as soon as was possible.
political affiliations 
negrón testified that she had been affiliated with the npp since she was very young.this affiliation was formalized in june when she went to an npp office and filled out paperwork to that effect.negrón stated that she knew the political affiliation of santiago d uring the few times that i was able to talk to him he would stress that he enjoyed the full trust of the governor and he would always say that he enjoyed a position of trust because he had the governor trust,so i understood that he was affiliated to that party pdp.in particular,negrón recalled santiago raising this issue of political affiliation when he asked her to change the car that had been assigned to him at the cda.
as for defendants knowledge of her political affiliation,negrón believed that her affiliation was known at the cda because the elections were already approaching by that time i n my area people would talk we would talk about who would win and who would lose we would talk and you would talk about who you felt was going to win and everybody just knew your party.

employment history following santiago arrival and alleged employment deficiencies 
aside from a general,meeting where he was introduced to the cda as the administrator on january,gascot recalled only one occasion in which she met personally with santiago,which occurred on january or.on that occasion she went to his office a group of employees was dismissed from their jobs and he asked me to explain to him regarding an aid program for them.i explained to him what the program was about,and what was normally done.gascot stated that santiago never discussed the nature of her work at the cda and never conducted any evaluation of the program she directed.gascot testified that during the transitionary period a report was made for the work performed at the school and it stated the amount of participants which had increased and the working plan.while it is unclear from the record whether gascot prepared this report herself,gascot stated that santiago never requested from her either statistics about the school or that working plan.
on her final evaluation,for the period from january to january,gascot noted that as to her planning,organization,and performance,santiago had written the same thing improper utilization of funds and resources available in the offering of courses,careless in the effective maintenance of the vehicle assigned to the school.gascot testified that this evaluation was not discussed with me at any time and was given to me on january.that was the date that ended my probation period.on january,gascot was told not to leave work that day without going to the administrator office.she went to the administrator office at pm,where she was handed a letter that read,in part i n view of the above,effective today,january,you are being separated from the position you have been occupying at the agency.if you are not in agreement with this decision you are entitled to discuss it within the next ten days with the personnel administration.gascot stated that w hen the document was given to me and i was about to talk defendant vilma giménez sic tells me that that sic is not the forum for me to talk.
according to gascot,it was only later,through santiago deposition,that she learned why santiago had given her such a negative final evaluation.gascot recalled that santiago had said that she had been assigned a mobile unit truck which was deteriorated and she had used it wrongly and it was not well used and there were badly used funds.to gascot knowledge,the vehicle was purchased by a prior administrator in or for the cda.it was her understanding that a ll agency vehicles are under the general services administration.they are the ones who provide maintenance of the vehicles.gascot claimed that she never used the vehicle during her time as director of the managerial school.gascot also learned through santiago deposition that rumors came to him from other business centers and business people that the courses were inefficient and nonoperative,but he could not recall the names of anyone from whom he heard these rumors.
on,gascot again testified that she believed that the agency vehicle for which santiago held her responsible was,in fact,the responsibility of the general services department,which,as of august,was run by negrón.

gascot testified that her affiliation was known at the cda because she first arrived at the cda as a special aide under an npp administration,a trust position.gascot recalled specifically that hernández had direct knowledge of her affiliation.gascot recalled an incident when she first started working as the director of the managerial school.hernández,who gascot identified as the institutional brain of the cda,asked her to identify her political affiliation.by institutional brain,gascot understood hernández to be an individual who dedicate s themselves to identify ing the political affiliation of the people when they come in.hernández was the person who knows everybody in there.
b.the defendants 
carlos gabriel santiago 
before being appointed as head of the cda,santiago was appointed the executive president of cofec,a corporation of economic development for the capital city of puerto rico.it is a development company which gives loans to small businesses in san juan and also other municipalities in the island.he was appointed by cofec board of twelve directors.he became administrator of the cda on january,and he stopped being the director in january.
while santiago acknowledged that hernández made the final decision on pérez retention of her position following her probationary period,he stated that hernández had consulted with him.hernández told him that she was satisfied with the inefficient way that pérez was performing the task of her job,and hernández understood that pérez was going to fulfill the expectations of the position.santiago ultimately endorsed hernández dismissal of pérez.
on by plaintiff counsel,santiago conceded that prior to pérez termination,santiago did not speak to her to discuss his intentions to terminate her.he admitted that he did not remember if hernández had told him about pérez educational qualifications or the fact that pérez position had been vacant for six months prior to her filling that position.
santiago stated that he got to know negrón and that her performance was low,very low more than poor.it was just bad.he testified that he gave her instructions to move furniture and file cabinets,change locks,and repair air conditioners.as to the moving of furniture and file cabinets,he stated that he gave negrón the instruction personally,but she did not comply.moreover,santiago stated that negrón misplaced the file cabinets because it was more than an issue of instructions or permission.it was more of negrón started establishing territory in the agency so it was more of hostility to me.he stated that the file cabinets were misplaced and negrón reaction was simply t hat there was no space anywhere else except in my office.on another occasion involving the moving of files,according to santiago,it took a few days,three or four days,because the argument was the same there was no space,so those had to remain there.
as to the,santiago stated that negrón counterordered the moving of the counter from a location preferred by santiago.he felt concerned and even pressured psychologically because the situation was more than just me saying things one way and things happening another.and it was more of a controversy.as to the air conditioning duct,santiago confirmed that the air conditioning in his office was never repaired.he also confirmed that the reason was that the order had to be in writing.however,santiago testified that he thought this was unreasonable.negrón insisted that every task that she was ordered to do,even if it was the simplest of tasks,had to be in writing it was enough that it had to be in a memorandum for negrón,but it also had to requisition had to be signed the process was done twice for whatever was needed.according to him,he asked negrón three times to fix the air conditioning duct,and it was never done.
as to the installation of a new lock on his office door,santiago recalled that he was in his office when it was installed.after the installation,when he went to leave,the lock was installed inside out,meaning that the lock that has the key is on the inside,and on the outside is the part where you can do it manually and so i am locked in my office.i am trapped.his specific complaint was that negrón did not remain to supervise the installation of the lock.in his opinion,with the lock incident as an exemplar,it was impossible to articulate a particular operational plan with negrón because,if things this simple could not be solved and saying that this was simply a mistake it was something that would concern any supervisor it even got to the point in my mind that i concluded that,if ever there was a person that was not going to cooperate it was negrón.
on his final evaluation of negrón,regarding the performance factor,santiago stated that negrón did not meet the goals and objectives,be them small as they could be,and also the effective solutions of unforeseen situations like the one regarding the lock it should be the duty of a director to constantly be in controversy with the head of an agency.it was her duty to keep in operational conditions the physical facilities of the agency,which negrón did not perform,did not do.as to the cooperation factor,negrón did have the appropriate attitude.it was more of a serious problem in terms of personality in terms of trying to be in controversy all the time.and also to collaborate that never happened and to obtain the maximum effort from the personnel.negrón never complied with this.on the contrary,she prevented things from happening.according to santiago,the period from january to january was more than enough time to observe negrón performance.he treated this stretch of time as days.
on,santiago revised this number of days for observing negrón to.he also admitted that his office was isolated from negrón a floor away such that he only observed her when the two had direct interaction.santiago conceded that one of the pieces of furniture that he requested be moved,a counter,was something that negrón could not move on her own.as to the lock,plaintiffs counsel asked,among other things,why santiago did not prevent the incorrect installation of the lock since he was in his office when it was installed.santiago stated that he was occupied with work and that the door was actually some distance from his desk.as to the air conditioning problem,plaintiffs counsel asked santiago whether it was in fact reasonable policy for negrón to have written authorization for work done in order to keep a record for accounting purposes,and because checks were issued by a separate department of the cda.santiago replied that negrón paperwork was additional,meaning redundant.plaintiffs counsel also questioned santiago as to the difficulty of completing negrón paperwork essentially,writing approved.santiago responded that it would set a problematic precedent,requiring signatures for everything.
santiago stated that he had an opportunity to evaluate gascot performance,which he described as poor,that it did not meet the standard.he claimed that as far as planning,coordinating,and directing the entrepreneurial school,gascot peformed duties that were more of a routine,more of a operational basis and instead of planning and coordinating and looking to the future,that effort did not exist.as to the agency vehicle in dispute,santiago stated that gascot and i had had our differences in how to use the mobile truck to the entrepreneurial school,the fact that it had been abandoned in the parking lot of the agency to be deteriorated.he testified that the vehicle was assigned to the entrepreneurial school the funds for it came from the entrepreneurial school and the side of the vehicle said commercial development,entrepreneurial school.santiago identified documents confirming the disrepair of the vehicle,dated december,and january.additionally,auditors from the controller office requested documents and information from negrón regarding the purchase,maintenance,and future use of the agency vehicle in question.
santiago stated that he believed that no one in the cda wanted to be responsible for the vehicle t he entrepreneurial school said it was from general services,and general services said it belonged to the entrepreneurial school.in summary,santiago expected gascot t o assume responsibility,to assume responsibility for things that are under her direct supervision b ut that did even happen.santiago also claimed that he never saw an annual plan for training services from gascot.he continued i honestly think that gascot did have the capacity to prepare such a plan.
santiago also testified that gascot failed to develop or propose a number of plans a capacitation plan for communication between the central school in san juan and centers throughout the island a study of needs to develop a study determining the needs for training which is offered to businessmen a promotion advertising plan for what was going to be published in the advertisements.additionally,he criticized gascot for allowing the course of offering of the entrepreneurial school to become obsolete or inefficient in terms to what the businessmen wanted.
santiago claimed that he spoke to gascot about all of these failures,but she gave her usual response,that she did give me a she did give me any way that i could believe that she was going to be in charge of that,that she would take care of it.he conceded that c ertainly there were other issues on his mind during the transition period,but that he devoted from five to hours to the entrepreneurial school and gascot.he stated that he saw the prior evaluations in the file,but those evaluations were not in agreement with what he saw of gascot work performance.he performed the final evaluation of gascot with the help of hernández and jiménez.
on,santiago admitted that his office was a number of floors away from that of gascot,and he only observed her when the two had direct interaction.he also identified a transition report that was given to him on his arrival at the cda,which stated that the agency vehicle for which gascot was responsible was purchased from general services by commercial development services and that the vehicle was already eight years old when it was purchased,meaning it was twelve years old when santiago first saw it.santiago also conceded that evaluations of an employee probationary period should only take into account actions performed during that period.
plaintiffs counsel also questioned santiago about an apparent inconsistency between his testimony on direct examination and his response to an interrogatory prior to trial.the interrogatory had asked for any and all reasons for dismissing gascot santiago listed and explained only the vehicle incident.he did not mention any inability to engage in planning.santiago also stated that,even though he was an accountant,he did not check the agency property ledger to determine,ultimately,who was responsible for the vehicle,but that he must have sent somebody to check it.
under further questioning from plaintiffs counsel,santiago identified a work plan for the entrepreneurial school,but stated that he had never seen the document.he also conceded that when he left the cda a year after becoming its administrator,the courses being offered by the entrepreneurial school had not changed.
susana hernández colon 
hernández testimony focused only on pérez on direct examination,hernández testified to a number of instances where pérez worked attendance sheets without being duly authorized by the immediate supervisor meaning that the agency would pay employees that had not been working.however,on questioning by the district court as to whether somebody else could have been at fault,hernández conceded that it was possible that more than one person may have been involved in this negligence.hernández also recounted incidents where she directly asked pérez to review the vacation leave records of certain employees,including some outgoing ones.according to hernández,pérez committed errors on these types of records as well,the consequence being that we would have paid the employee less days when the employee would have had a right to be paid their full days.pérez was working on nine cases during her final probation period in january,and hernández testified that this work area is simple.it is simple math that one has to do,but you are not simply calculating work days out of nine cases,six cases that were worked right i mean more than half the work that she did was bad.
hernández testified that the only equipment necessary for attendance work was a calculator a computer was unnecessary.hernández also stated that pérez used a computer to do this work when other employees in the human resources department required use of a computer.later,hernández approached pérez,and told her that instructions had been given so that she would leave the desk that had the computer,move to another desk,so that the computer could be used by the human resources analyst.according to hernández,pérez refused to move.
in her final evaluation of pérez,covering january to january,hernández found pérez had not been compliant in three areas availability to learn,reliability,and cooperation.as to availability to learn,hernández stated that pérez was given instructions toward her work,toward specific functions and she worked them wrong.as to reliability,hernández testified pérez did prove capable of following instructions.also it is more that she did want to do what was said to her.she did assume the responsibilities of the position.as for cooperation,hernández recalled specifically pérez refusal to allow others to use the computer that she was using.
on,hernández admitted that during pérez final period of probation,she actually supervised pérez a total of only six to seven days.she conceded that the final evaluation report was supposed to be given,in accord with regulations,ten days before the date of separation.in pérez case,the final evaluation was only given on the date of separation,which was january.although in her final evaluation she speculated that pérez did not want to continue working at the cda,she acknowledged that four years ago she had considered pérez a hard worker who would never leave her position.
plaintiffs counsel also questioned hernández about pérez apparent errors.hernández testified that some of the errors she testified to on direct examination occurred before she became pérez supervisor that it is improper to evaluate an employee based on things that were done during a period for which the employee had already been evaluated and that one type of error had nothing to do with pérez at all.hernández also stated that all of the attendance and payment records are recalculated at the end of a calendar year or when an employee leaves the agency before the end of the year.errors made in the initial calculation are usually caught and corrected to avoid improper payment.

will be granted only in those instances where,after having examined the evidence as well as all permissible inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to,the court finds that a reasonable jury could not render a verdict to the party favor.in carrying out this analysis the court may not take into account the credibility of witnesses,resolve evidentiary conflicts,nor ponder the weight of the evidence introduced at trial.

proving and defending political discrimination claims 
a government employee who does not occupy a position of confidence and trust,such as plaintiffs here,is protected from adverse employment decisions based on the employee political affiliation.see,cir.a plaintiff bringing a political discrimination claim bears the burden of producing sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably may infer that his constitutionally protected this case,political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind his dismissal.aponte,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also healthy city bd.of educ.doyle,d.a plaintiff bears the burden of persuasion on this issue throughout the case.

to meet this burden,political discrimination plaintiffs often present evidence of verbal or written statements of political or personal animus.see,cir witness testified that a defendant had made several comments to her to the effect that he was under political pressure for leaving too many npp members in cushy positions id.at witness testified that a defendant insisted that she use phraseology consistent with a particular political party id.at witness testified that the defendants made statements to her indicating that her demotion was politically motivated.plaintiffs who have lost their jobs also present evidence about the hiring practices of the defendant in the wake of an election,evidence that the defendants filled all,or most,recently vacated positions with supporters of their political,more specifically,evidence that the plaintiff immediate successor had the same affiliation as the defendant.for example,in,cir,where the plaintiffs were all members of the adverse party their superiors knew this,and their duties were given to active supporters of the party in power,we found there was ample evidence for the plaintiffs case to avoid summary judgment.id.at see also cordero,o ther evidence adduced by plaintiff established a prima facie case p laintiff adduced that every employment task for which she had been responsible prior to her demotion was performed thereafter by an npp member and that at least three new recruits were npp members.
a defendant,of course,can offer evidence challenging the claim that political affiliation played a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action.additionally,even if a plaintiff establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that political affiliation played a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action,a defendant can raise an affirmative defense specific to this type of case that is,a defendant can attempt to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff would have been dismissed regardless of his political affiliation,at see also healthy,at,cir.

b.the nature of plaintiffs and defendants cases 
plaintiffs case 
plaintiffs presented an unusual case of political discrimination.they did not present any evidence of overt statements of political discrimination.they also did not present evidence that employees of their political affiliation had been replaced predominantly by employees with an opposing political affiliation.plaintiffs did not even show that their own replacements,if any,had an opposing political affiliation.instead,after showing that defendants had opposing political affiliations and had knowledge of their political affiliations,plaintiffs focused almost exclusively on the suspicious way they were treated by defendants near the end of their probationary periods,and the allegedly spurious reasons supplied by defendants for their failure to survive their respective probationary periods.plaintiffs saw in this evidence a circumstantial case of political discrimination.
defendants case 
aware of the healthy line of cases,defendants presented a case that also focused on the reasons for plaintiffs dismissal.in their view,they were attempting to establish that regardless of any political discrimination,plaintiffs dismissals would have occurred anyhow for reasons.when they renewed their rule a motion,defendants stated that i t is defendant sic position that we have presented to the honorable court a strong healthy defense.defendants counsel continued defendants produced sufficient facts about plaintiffs sic failure to properly perform their duties,and will sic have rendered the same evaluations and will sic have taken the same termination decision for the reasons that are nondiscriminatory,in other words,healthy defense.
and the district court decision 
in concluding that plaintiffs had not made the requisite showings to get to the jury on their political discrimination claims,the district court relied on our decision.in,the plaintiff attempted to challenge her demotion in the wake of a change in political administration by relying on some of the typical indicia of political discrimination.see generally at.the defendants in that case reassigned several hundred employees,including the plaintiff.id.at.the plaintiff asserted that her reassignment to a lower position was based on improper political discrimination rather than the defendants claim of a systematic reclassification of existing positions.id.at.to demonstrate that the defendants had knowledge of her political affiliation,the plaintiff referred to a single encounter during routine campaign canvassing,and testimony about her prior activities and positions under a previous administration.id.at.as to political animus,the plaintiff offered two comments made by the defendants,id.at.the plaintiff also presented evidence about her qualifications for the job at issue,and the gradual erosion of her responsibilities when the new administration took charge.
in concluding that presented insufficient evidence to get to the jury on her political discrimination claim,we specified the following deficiencies she had not presented evidence creating a reasonable inference that the defendants were even aware of her political affiliation when her personnel file was reviewed and she was reassigned to another position her evidence fell short of proving that she had been treated in a discriminatory manner because of undisputed testimony that she did not meet the statutory procedural requirements for her present position one of the statements she relied mayor comment about cleaning house was not a direct statement about npp employees her supervisor statement of political animus was a stray comment that could not be attributed to the defendant city officials the actions of her supervisor in failing to provide her with adequate work for five months similarly could not be attributed to the defendants and importantly,the plaintiff offered no evidence that pdp members were hired to replace the reassigned npp members,at.
apparently focusing on these deficiencies,the district court saw as a baseline for the amount of evidence a political discrimination plaintiff must present in order to reach the jury 
if this the case of did not meet the standard of proof for jury submission then this case,that we are trying now does meet it either the truth of the matter is that the case of vázquez contained a lot more evidence of potential discriminatory motives and of a circumstantial nature than the one that we are trying.
the district court statement is a fair observation as far as it goes.as already noted,there is no evidence in this case of politically discriminatory remarks.there is no evidence of large scale demotions or firings of the members of one political party.but the court focus on some of the more familiar indicia of political discrimination described in may have prevented the district court from recognizing that the evidence of political discrimination presented by plaintiffs had produced a political discrimination case very different from.
d.the sufficiency of the evidence 
a plaintiff must typically make four showings to prove a case of political discrimination the plaintiff and the defendant belong to opposing political affiliations the defendant has knowledge of the plaintiff opposing political affiliation there is a challenged employment action and sufficient evidence,whether direct or circumstantial that political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor that the challenged employment action stemmed from politically based animus.family,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs testified,on direct examination,that they were all affiliated with the npp.they presented enough circumstantial evidence of santiago and hernández affiliation to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that defendants were affiliated with the pdp.plaintiffs proffered testimony that their political affiliations were within the cda itself,and hernández,one of the defendants,asked one of the plaintiffs to identify her political affiliation.also,plaintiffs evidence portrays a relatively small workplace where everyone knew who everyone else was and political affiliations were common office knowledge.given this evidence,a reasonable jury could conclude that defendants knew of plaintiffs political affiliations.there is no dispute that plaintiffs were terminated from their career positions at the end of their probationary periods.
therefore,not surprisingly,this appeal turns on the fourth showing required to prove political political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the challenged employment action.before evaluating the evidence on this issue for each plaintiff,we must make some preliminary points applicable to each plaintiff case.we are reviewing a district court decision to grant judgment as a matter of law.as a result,we must evaluate the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,here plaintiffs,and we draw all reasonable inferences in their favor.see,at.we may not take into account the credibility of witnesses,resolve evidentiary conflicts,nor ponder the weight of the evidence introduced at trial.id.that is the province of the jury.
moreover,in political discrimination cases where the defendants present evidence of the reasons for the adverse employment decisions at issue,the falsity of those reasons can provide circumstantial evidence that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.this proposition is in title vii law.in reeves sanderson plumbing,d,the supreme court stated that p roof that the defendant explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is quite probative of intentional discrimination,and it may be quite persuasive in appropriate circumstances,the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.see also mary honor center hicks,d p roving the employer reason false becomes part of and often considerably assists the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination mcdonough city of quincy,cir evidence that the defendant reason was pretext may ground a finding of liability.fite digital equipment,cir.the evidentiary significance of a false explanation for an employment decision is based on a general proposition of evidence law.as the supreme court explained in reeves s uch an inference of falsity is consistent with the general principle of evidence law that the factfinder is entitled to consider a party dishonesty about a material fact as affirmative evidence of guilt.reeves,at.emphasis added.this general proposition applies in this case.however,we are not suggesting that a jury finding that defendants gave false explanations for their adverse employment decisions would be sufficient alone to establish that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in those employment decisions.we are simply saying that such a finding would be circumstantial evidence of such discrimination.
we may also consider the circumstances surrounding the adverse employment decisions affecting the plaintiffs.prior to the change in administrations,all three plaintiffs had uneventful probationary periods with only positive evaluations.their final evaluations were the only negative marks on their records.these final evaluations were conducted over a brief period of as little as two weeks pérez to four weeks gascot,at a time when santiago and hernández faced many other demands for their attention because of the transition in administrations.although not required to do so,santiago conceded that he did not take into account plaintiffs prior,positive evaluations in reaching his termination decisions.plaintiffs were never admonished for their alleged performance deficiencies at the time of their occurrences,and they received their negative evaluations on the day of their respective terminations,in contravention of a regulation requiring that the termination and final evaluation be given to the employee no less than days before the date of separation.
again,we are not suggesting that this evidence alone establishes that political discrimination was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision of defendants.still,the three employees who described these strikingly similar stories were members of the same political party,now out of power.see,cir it is suspicious that both of the npp plaintiffs were demoted without being given any notice or opportunity to defend their promotions,especially since the initial explanation offered for the demotions was simply missing documentation further,these missing documents mysteriously reappeared after the plaintiffs presented their copies of the missing documents even after the missing documents were replaced,the plaintiffs were not reinstated rather,other justifications were given for their demotions.
importantly,defendants presented no evidence that they were conducting final evaluations of all probationary employees in the cda.they presented no evidence that these three employees were the only probationary employees in the department.they presented no evidence that they were engaged in a systematic review of the personnel files of all employees in search of hiring or promotion irregularities.under the circumstances,a jury could conclude that the common denominator that explains the strikingly similar stories of plaintiffs was their shared political affiliation.
without repeating the summaries of the evidence already presented,we turn now to a closer examination of the evidence presented by each plaintiff,with a particular focus on the points of conflict in the testimony of the parties.
in her testimony,pérez described her job duties and responsibilities,said that she performed them well,and noted that all of her prior evaluations during the probationary period were positive.pérez used a computer in compiling the wage and vacation information for which she was responsible.she said a computer was indispensable to do it efficiently.hernández painted a different picture of pérez performance,stating that she performed her duties deficiently,committed computational errors,insisted unnecessarily on the use of a computer,and was insubordinate when told to cease using a particular computer.
pérez challenged hernández account in several ways.on,hernández acknowledged that she disregarded a regulation requiring that a probationary employee receive the last evaluation ten days before the date of separation pérez received her last evaluation on the day of her separation.hernández admitted that by not following the applicable regulation prescribing when evaluations are given to an employee,she increased the number of days she had to conduct pérez final evaluation from two days to twelve days.with respect to the computational errors attributed to pérez,hernández admitted,on questioning by the district court,that other employees could have been responsible for pérez errors.on,hernández also acknowledged that she exaggerated the severity of the consequences of any errors pérez might have committed in her wage calculations.finally,hernández admitted that she included in her final evaluation alleged errors that would have been accounted for in the november to december evaluation,thereby inappropriately considering job performance outside of the final evaluation period.additionally,these prior evaluations were positive in spite of those errors.
in light of these challenges to hernández account of pérez performance deficiencies,and the responsibility of the jury for assessing the credibility of witnesses,we conclude that a reasonable jury could choose to believe pérez account of her performance and reject hernández account 
much like pérez,negrón testified about her job duties and her satisfactory performance of those duties.also like pérez,negrón discovered the specific objections to her work at the end of the final day of her probationary period,a violation of the notice required by the regulation prescribing procedures for probationary periods described above.negrón also described a number of specific tasks she was asked to perform for santiago on his arrival as cda administrator.the three tasks at issue were the installation of a new door lock for santiago office the moving of certain furniture and file cabinets and the repair of an air conditioning duct in santiago office.because of the content of her final probationary evaluation,negrón anticipated santiago negative account of her performance of these tasks and provided explanations in her direct testimony for the way she performed them.these explanations for her performance were never given directly to santiago or anyone else at the agency because she was never given the opportunity to do so.
santiago testified to a starkly different version of negrón performance of these tasks.on,plaintiffs counsel challenged the basis for santiago objections.as to the moving of the furniture and file cabinets,negrón had explained that the furniture and file cabinets were moved as fast as possible,and that the delay was caused by the lack of personnel to move the objects.santiago conceded that negrón had to wait for additional personnel because she could not have moved the objects on her own.as to the installation of the lock on santiago office door,negrón maintained in her direct testimony that the technician installed the lock improperly despite the specific instructions that she provided.when she was notified of this error,she promptly had the lock reinstalled properly.on,santiago was asked whether negrón ordered the technician to install the lock backwards.he admitted,i did say that she did it.instead,he complained that she should have checked the installation when the work was completed.but he also conceded that installing a lock is not that complex and that it was not necessary for her to observe the entire installation.as to the repair of the office air conditioning,santiago acknowledged that the only reason the air conditioning was not fixed was because he refused to provide the written authorization requested by negrón.when plaintiffs counsel asked santiago the reason for his refusal,santiago said that negrón paperwork was redundant and it would set a bad precedent.he never said the request was improper or against cda policy.
based on negrón points of contention with santiago account of her job performance,including the violation of the ten day requirement,we conclude that a reasonable jury could choose to believe negrón account of her work and reject santiago account as a false explanation.
like her fellow plaintiffs,gascot described a relatively uneventful probationary period.she detailed her duties as head of the school and recounted her satisfactory performance of those duties,as evidenced by her prior positive evaluations.like negrón,based on the contents of her final negative evaluation,gascot anticipated the objections that santiago had with the performance of her duties.in his evaluation,santiago stated as reasons for gascot dismissal improper utilization of funds and resources available in the offering of courses,careless in the effective mantenance of the vehicle in the school.later,in response to an interrogatory requesting all of the reasons for gascot dismissal,santiago mentioned only a single reason her mismanagement of a cda vehicle.in his deposition testimony,he elaborated to some degree on his dissatisfaction with gascot job performance.he referred to gascot mishandling of the cda vehicle he said that the school courses were ineffective and he said that gascot did not have an organized working plan for the school.on direct examination at trial,santiago significantly expanded on the deficiencies in gascot performance,listing a number of other plans that gascot had failed to produce,including a capacitation plan,a study of needs,and a promotional advertising plan.on,santiago admitted that his answer to the interrogatory had not included many of the problems with gascot performance that he was now describing.
curiously,when defendants counsel gascot,he permitted her to testify that she had prepared a training and service plan for the school and had submitted it as part of transition procedures to santiago.moreover,gascot stated in response to that same that santiago had no criteria for rendering his negative evaluation because h e did not meet with me and ask for the plan.he did not ask me for the study or the research of needs.he did say let see where are the studies.if he had asked me i would have given them all to him and would have avoided all of this.
on,santiago admitted to receiving a transition report,introduced into evidence by plaintiff counsel,which included a document that santiago identified as a working plan for the school,though he claimed to have never seen that working plan before.this exchange suggested that santiago criticized gascot for her failure to plan,yet he had received a document from her reflecting such planning.additionally,santiago conceded that while he criticized gascot for not updating the entrepreneurial school curriculum,that curriculum had remained unchanged at the time of santiago departure from the cda one year later,well after gascot departure.also,he acknowledged that the contents of the transit
