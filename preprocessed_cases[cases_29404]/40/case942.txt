this case arises from an action brought by current and former police officers appellants employed by the township of teaneck teaneck in teaneck,new jersey.appellants contended that teaneck violated the fair labor standards act flsa,et,by failing to pay proper overtime provide compensation for time spent attending daily roll calls muster time and provide compensation for time spent putting on donning and taking off doffing uniforms and equipment each day.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of teaneck on all of appellants claims.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm.
background 
factual background 
the teaneck policemen benevolent association,local,which represents teaneck police officers,and the superior officer association,which represents teaneck sergeants,lieutenants,and captains,have negotiated jointly with teaneck since.the present dispute has its origins in a collective bargaining agreement the agreement that was in effect for an original term of january,to december,and which remained in effect through june due to an impasse in negotiations.
overtime compensation 
the agreement provides that police officers work established and regularly recurring work periods of either seven or nine days.these periods combine so that police officers are required to work an average of hours per week over the course of a calendar year.officers work under either a six and three or a five and two plan.those working under the six and three plan work six tours over six consecutive days and then have three consecutive days off.those under the five and two plan work five tours over five consecutive days and then have two consecutive days off.
if an officer performs work in excess of his or her normal hours in any tour of duty,that work is considered overtime which is compensated at a rate of time and.the agreement provides for the accrual of overtime pay in blocks based on the amount of time worked after a regular tour.for example,if an officer works less than minutes past his scheduled tour,he receives no overtime if the officer works between minutes and minutes past his scheduled tour,he receives minutes of overtime if he works between and minutes past his scheduled tour,he receives minutes of overtime and if he works between and minutes past his scheduled tour,he receives one hour of overtime.any overtime beyond one hour accrues in blocks of minutes.
muster time 
the agreement also provides for inspection and roll call,or muster time,which takes place ten minutes prior to the start of officers tours and ten minutes at the end of their tours.officers are required to report for muster time dressed and prepared for duty.the effect of muster time is that for each tour,officers may work for eight hours and twenty minutes.on any given day,officers may work less than the eight hours and twenty minutes depending on the length of the muster period.in those instances,officers are still given credit for the full eight hours and twenty minutes.
donning doffing 
the agreement also sets forth specific uniform and equipment requirements to which teaneck police officers must adhere while on duty.the uniform components of individual police officers depend on whether the officer is assigned to the uniform division or the non uniform division.
regardless of assignment,there is no rule,regulation,or other policy requiring that police officers don or doff their uniform at teaneck police headquarters.however,some officers choose to don and doff partially at home and partially at work,and some choose to don and doff completely at teaneck headquarters,either in the locker rooms or their personal offices.the option to change at work is primarily for the benefit of police officers who have indicated concerns regarding 
the risk of loss or theft of uniforms and gear at home potential access to the gear by family members distractions at home that might interfere with the donning process safety concerns with performing firearm checks at home discomfort associated with wearing the gear while commuting the increased risk of being identified as a police officer while and potential exposure of family members to contaminants and bodily fluids.
the agreement,as well as all prior collective bargaining agreements between the parties,is silent as to whether teaneck officers are entitled to compensation for time spent donning and doffing.additionally,the officers unions have never requested,through contract negotiations or other means,compensation for time spent donning and doffing.
procedural background 
on december,local filed a complaint against the township of teaneck under the flsa to recover unpaid compensation for overtime time spent during muster time and time spent donning and doffing uniforms and equipment each day.on june,an amended complaint was filed which removed local as a party to the suit and left only the officers,in their individual capacities,as plaintiffs.
teaneck subsequently filed a motion to dismiss,but the motion was terminated when the district court stayed the case and directed the parties to mediation.following an unsuccessful mediation,the district court held a conference,at which teaneck moved under federal rule of civil procedure c to bar the officers from using any damages calculations that were not disclosed during discovery.to that point,the only calculation of damages the officers had disclosed during the discovery process was a spreadsheet prepared by one of the officers wives,which calculated individual officers overtime hours based upon an day.
the spreadsheet identified the dates each officer worked and those in which the officer was in uniform and not in uniform.it assumed that each officer worked eight hours,plus minutes in muster time,plus minutes daily donning and doffing for uniformed officers and minutes daily donning and doffing for officers.thus,according to the officers,they were entitled to overtime compensation for every day they worked hours,regardless of how many hours they worked in a workweek or a work period.the officers conceded that they did not produce anything in discovery that would provide a computation of damages under a hour theory,but defended that course of action based upon their perception that the agreement required overtime payment based upon an day and not a hour work week.after hearing argument,the district court concluded that there was no reason why there should be any permission to go beyond that which was disclosed in discovery and granted teaneck motion.
thereafter,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted teaneck motion and denied the officers motion on december.in regards to the officers overtime claim,the court concluded that teaneck qualified for an exemption to the general overtime provisions of a,pursuant to k,and could,therefore,raise the overtime threshold for its employees.the court also noted that the officers had failed to produce sufficient evidence of missed overtime pay.regarding muster time,the court concluded that the agreement contemplated such time as part of the normal hours in any tour of duty and was already a component of the officers salaries.finally,because the officers had the option of donning and doffing their uniforms and gear at home,and the option to change at work benefitted the officers and not teaneck,the district court regarded such activities as preliminary and postliminary to the principal activity of police work and,therefore,were under the flsa.the district court also noted that o of the flsa,which excludes donning and doffing from measured working time under the agreement,provided an additional basis for denying the officers donning and doffing claim.
the officers timely notice of appeal to this court followed.

iii.discussion 
appellants challenge to the district court order is based upon a series of alleged factual and legal errors.specifically,appellants argue that the district court erred in finding that teaneck qualified for an exemption to the general overtime provisions,pursuant to k appellants failed to meet their burden in establishing damages appellants are compensated for muster time as a component of their salaries donning and doffing police uniforms and gear is under the flsa and o of the flsa forecloses appellants from seeking compensation for donning and doffing.we will address each argument in turn.
overtime compensation 
the k exemption 
under the flsa,employers are generally required to pay employees at overtime rates for work in excess of forty hours per workweek.a.section k,however,contains a partial exemption from the general overtime provisions,permitting public agencies to establish a work period that lasts from seven to days for employees engaged in law enforcement or fire protection activities.k.the flsa interpretative regulations define the term work period as any established and regularly recurring period of work.a.
the exemption operates mainly to soften the impact of the flsa overtime provisions on public employers by rais ing the average number of hours the employer can require employees to work without triggering overtime requirement s.town of agawam,cir see also lawrence city of philadephia,cir recognizing that k exempts certain public agencies from the overtime requirements set forth in a.it also accommodates the inherently unpredictable nature of firefighting and police work by permitting employers to adopt work periods longer than one week.id.before a public employer may qualify for the k exemption,however,two things must be true the employees at issue must be engaged in fire protection or law enforcement within the meaning of the statute and the employer must have established a qualifying work period.calvao town of framingham,cir citing agawam,at.the employer bears the burden of proving that these conditions are satisfied.guthrie lady jane collieries,cir noting that t he burden of proof is on the employer to establish an flsa exemption see also arnold ben kanowsky.to meet this burden,the employer must demonstrate that the employee employer come plainly and unmistakably within the exemption terms.lawrence,at observing that flsa exemptions should be construed narrowly and against the employer citing arnold,at.
in the instant case,neither party disputes that teaneck police officers are engaged in law enforcement within the meaning of the flsa thus,the only issue before us is whether teaneck established a qualifying work period.appellants argue that it was error for the district court to conclude that teaneck qualified for and established a valid k work period because teaneck never intended to adopt the exemption.teaneck,on the other hand,argues that an employer burden under k does not require a demonstration of intent.the point of contention between the parties,namely,the means by which a law enforcement employer may establish a valid k work period,is a matter of first impression for this court.
this question presents an issue of statutory interpretation.as with any question of statutory interpretation,our analysis begins with the plain language of the statute.jimenez quarterman.we note first that the text of k does not specify how an employer establishes a qualifying work period.however,one thing is quite clear nothing in the language of the statute requires employers to express their intent to qualify for or operate under the exemption.see k no public agency shall be deemed to have violated subsection a of this section with respect to the employment of any employee in law enforcement activities if certain scheduling requirements are met.as teaneck correctly observes,the statute only requires the existence of a qualifying work period.nothing more.we will,therefore,decline to adopt a rule that requires employers to clear a hurdle not provided for in the statutory text.accordingly,we hold that employers seeking to qualify for the k exemption need not express an intent to qualify for or operate under the exemption.employers must only meet the factual criteria set forth in k.
appellants urge that two district court cases,menino,d and ackley department of corrections,support a different outcome.in,a group of police officers brought an action against the city in which they worked,alleging violations of the flsa regarding overtime compensation.d at.the district court in that case concluded that the city was not entitled to the k exemption because it had neither adopted a qualifying work period during the time at issue,nor was one in place.id.at.the court relied on language found in a footnote in agawam,which noted that employers were required to announce and take bona fide steps to implement a qualifying work period in order to take advantage of the k exemption.id.at citing agawam,at.
similarly,in ackley,the district court held that the defendant had not met its burden of proving that it adopted a k workweek exemption.ackley dep t of.the district court relied on an interdepartmental memorandum pertaining to overtime compensation,which stated that all employees were eligible for overtime compensation for hours worked in excess of hours in a work week.id.based upon this memorandum,the district court concluded that the employer compensated its employees in accordance with a.id.the district court concluded that the employer failed to produce any evidence that would contradict such a conclusion,and made note that the employer k argument appeared to have only been raised after suit was filed to avoid liability.id.appellants rely on ackley to support their argument that teaneck personnel policies and procedures manual the manual,as well as testimony from teaneck police department personnel,prove that the k exemption should not apply to teaneck.regarding the manual,appellants contend that the document fails to provide any indication that overtime payment for officers would be in accordance with k.regarding the testimony,appellants assert that not one agent of teaneck could even testify as to what the k exemption was or whether it had been adopted.
neither nor ackley alter our analysis.appellants reliance on,as well as the footnote citing to a first circuit decision,is unpersuasive and foreclosed by more recent case law from the first circuit,which rejects the notion that an employer is required to expressly state its intent to adopt a k work period.see calvao,at on the undisputed facts,the town actions were sufficient to establish a qualifying work period,despite the asserted lack of notice to its employees.the instant case can be further distinguished from because the employer in that case never implemented a qualifying work period,which played a significant role in the outcome of the case.here,appellants do not argue that teaneck five and two and six and three plans fail to meet the requirements of k.their only argument is that teaneck never made its intent to adopt the k exemption known,which is not a requirement under k.
appellants reliance on ackley is also foreclosed by more recent case law from the tenth circuit,which rejects a requirement that an employer expressly intend to adopt a k exemption.see spradling,at stating that an employer may establish a k work period either by public declaration or by actually meeting the requirements of the exemption.appellants reliance on ackley is further tainted by factual differences between that case and the instant case.there,the district court noted that the defendant failed to produce any evidence that it defined a work period as days and had actually compensated its employees in accordance with a.here,the undisputed facts,as well as current and former agreements,reveal that officers work and are paid in accordance with established and regularly recurring work periods of either seven or nine days.finally,as concluded above,the relevant inquiry into whether an employer has established a qualifying work period does not include a subjective component.nor is there a requirement that employers make a public declaration or an express statement that the work period has been or will be adopted.thus,appellants argument regarding the manual and the testimony of teaneck personnel also fails.
finally,we note that our holding here is in accordance with that of our sister circuits.all courts of appeals to consider this issue have held that,in order for an employer to qualify for the k exemption,only a factual inquiry is involved and no notice or declaration of intent is required on the part of the employer.see,calvao,at rejecting the plaintiffs argument that the town was required to notify affected employees before establishing a valid work period under k barefield vill.of winnetka,cir noting that nothing in the language of k requires employers to express a declaration of intent to qualify for the exemption an employer need only meet the factual criteria milner hazelwood,cir holding that flsa police and firefighters exemption need not be established by public declaration spradling city of tulsa,cir stating that an employer may establish a k work period either by public declaration or by actually meeting the requirements of the exemption freeman city of mobile,f d,cir rejecting appellants argument that the city never intended to avail itself of the k exemption.
turning to the merits of the instant appeal,the record clearly demonstrates that teaneck adopted a valid k work period.the agreement provides,and appellants concede,that police officers work either a or a period on a regularly recurring basis.indeed,appellants fail to even assert now that they do not work a or a schedule.appellants only contention is that the exemption does not apply because teaneck did not intend to do so,which we now conclude is irrelevant as to whether an employer meets the requirements of k.because neither party disputes that the teaneck police officers are engaged in law enforcement within the meaning of the flsa,and the record supports a finding that the officers work either a or a schedule on a regularly recurring basis,it was proper for the district court to conclude that teaneck qualified for the k exemption.
calculation of overtime damages 
when an employee brings a claim under the flsa,he ordinarily bears the burden of proving that he performed work for which he was not properly compensated.anderson clemens pottery,superseded by statute,portal to portal act of,as recognized in ibp,alvarez,see also reich gateway press,cir.because the flsa requires every employer to keep records of the wages,hours,and other conditions and practices of its employees,c,an employee easily discharges this burden by securing the production of those records,anderson,at.such a burden becomes difficult to meet,however,where an employer has not maintained its records.martin selker,cir.under those circumstances,t he burden of any consequent imprecision in an employee calculation of damages must be borne by th e employer,id.citing anderson,at,and the employee will only be required to submit sufficient evidence from which violations of the flsa and the amount of an award may be reasonably inferred.id.once this inference is created,the burden shifts to the employer to rebut that inference.id.citation omitted.
appellants argue that the district court erroneously applied the burden of proof standard when it concluded that they failed to establish overtime damages.appellants argue that teaneck records were so inaccurate as to render the proper calculation of damages impossible and,therefore,the burden of proof should have been shifted to teaneck to rebut appellants proffered evidence.teaneck,on the other hand,argues that it did maintain adequate employment records.teaneck points out,however,that the district court entry of summary judgment resulted not from a failure to shift the burden of proof,but from appellants failure to set forth any evidence of alleged uncompensated overtime,whether it be actual or estimated.
we agree with teaneck characterization of the district court opinion.the district court highlighted the fact that the only evidence submitted by the officers of alleged overtime damages was a spreadsheet,which based its calculations on the assumption that overtime accrued for any time worked beyond an tour.as the district court correctly observed,such a framework does not provide any basis for discerning whether the hours worked by each individual officer exceeded the necessary threshold for overtime under the flsa,which defines overtime entitlement based upon a work period and not a work day.see,a no employer shall employ any of his employees for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for the excess hours.the spreadsheet also fails to account for teaneck exemption under k,which increases the number of hours teaneck officers may work in a work period before triggering overtime requirements.see c overtime threshold of hours for cycles and hours for cycles.an estimation of damage,which fails to set forth the proper method of calculation and does not account for differences in officer scheduling,hardly provides a foundation for an inquiring court to reasonably infer flsa violations or the amount of an award.martin,at.
to be clear,the spreadsheet did indeed provide an estimation of muster time and time spent donning and doffing,but it failed to make clear whether each officer worked the entirety of his or her tour or how that tour fit into each officer broader work period.such a failure proves key here.the uncontested facts demonstrate that a tour commander handwrites each officer scheduled hours on a daily blotter,app.at the daily blotter records regularly scheduled hours,as well as muster time,overtime worked on a given day,sick time,vacation days or time due,and any shift exchanges among officers,teaneck maintains,in addition to the daily blotter,records of the time officers actually work overtime pursuant to the agreement,app.at when officers work overtime,they are required to punch a timecard,after which approval is obtained by a superior officer and eventually the chief officer,officers are permitted to sign out with the tour commander during the last ten minutes of their eight hour and twenty minute tour,but still receive credit for the full eight hours and twenty minutes and teaneck maintains overtime records,which reflect the reason for the overtime,necessary approvals for it,the method of compensation for it,and the overtime both worked and paid pursuant to the agreement,id.
despite all of the above information,appellants conceded that not a single officer was able to provide an estimate of his or her uncompensated overtime damages or time worked for which they believe they were not compensated.app.at.they also conceded that they were unable to provide any documentation that could be used to refute the hours set forth in teaneck records.id.amidst all of their concessions,appellants do not argue that they lacked access to the records maintained by teaneck,nor are there any allegations that teaneck withheld those records absent any evidence to support the officers estimates of their overtime damages,appellants calculations on the spreadsheet become mere speculation,and are insufficient to support the requisite inference necessary to meet their burden.martin,at the employee must submit sufficient evidence from which violations of the flsa and the amount of an award may be reasonably inferred.emphasis added.because appellants had the burden of proving that they performed work for which they were not properly compensated,and failed to do so,the district court properly granted summary judgment on their claim for overtime damages 
muster time 
appellants next argue that the district court incorrectly interpreted the agreement in reaching the conclusion that teaneck officers are compensated for muster time as a component of their base salaries.they contend that the agreement provides that officers are paid based upon an tour of duty and,therefore,the additional twenty minutes of daily muster time constitutes time for which they are uncompensated.teaneck,on the other hand,argues that officers are paid for muster time as a component of their base salaries,and that officers have always been aware of this arrangement.teaneck points out that the parties have negotiated terms of employment and compensation for years through collective bargaining and it would make little sense for the officers to repeatedly enter into an agreement under which they performed uncompensated work.this dispute,as the district court correctly observed,presents a matter of contract interpretation.
although federal law governs the construction of a collective bargaining agreement cba,traditional rules of contract interpretation apply when not inconsistent with federal labor law.teamsters indus.emps.welfare fund rolls royce motor cars,cir.w here a court is called on to interpret a cba it is generally appropriate for the court to look beyond the face of the cba.se.pennsylvania transp.auth.of signalmen,cir.the supreme court has affirmed this method of interpretation because 
a cba is not an ordinary contract for the purchase of goods and services,nor is it governed by the same old concepts which control such private contracts.it is a generalized code to govern a myriad of cases which the draftsman can not wholly anticipate.the collective agreement covers the whole employment relationship.it calls into being a new common law the common law of a particular industry.
emps.union union pac,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,when interpreting such agreements,it is necessary to consider the scope of other related cbas,as well as practice,usage and custom pertaining to all such agreements.id.
appellants set forth a number of arguments to support their position that muster time constitutes time for which officers are uncompensated.none of those arguments provide any basis upon which we can rely in interpreting the agreement and the employment relationship between the parties as a whole.for example,appellants direct our attention to a section of the agreement that states that officers are required to work an average of and a quarter hours per week over a calendar year cycle.appellants claim that it is mathematically impossible to arrive at an and tour and still work an average of thirty nine and a quarter hours per week.we find this argument to be flawed.the key language here is that officers work an average of and a quarter hours per week over a calendar year cycle.the implication underlying this language is that some weekly hours will exceed that average and others will not.appellants concede that officers have been able to leave prior to the time indicated on the daily blotter and that they often do not actually attend twenty minutes of muster time per day.thus,it would appear that the agreement accounts for early release,as well as the possibility of officers having to stay for a few extra minutes.regardless,appellants calculations provide no basis for this court to conclude,on the whole,that muster time is not compensated as a component of the officers base salaries.
the same can be said for appellants next argument.appellants claim that the agreement provides for overtime based on an day,rather than an and day.appellants point out that the agreement provides for full overtime compensation once officers reach the overtime threshold thus,it defies reason that teaneck would pay twice for time it already deems compensated.again,this argument fails to prove one way or another whether muster time is compensated as a component of the officers base salaries.the mere fact that the parties may have negotiated a generous overtime compensation package once a threshold timeframe is met provides little assistance in analyzing the question of muster time compensation.
finally,appellants direct our attention to two cases which they believe support their position that muster time should be compensated separately from their regular work schedules.see town of agawam,cir concluding that pay had to be included in officers weekly hours worked under the flsa and compensated as overtime since it pushed the officers weekly hours worked over the threshold barvinchak.reg l med,dist.lexis,analyzing the viability of a claim for straight time compensation under the flsa where the plaintiff has worked overtime under.however,neither of those cases align factually with that of the instant case,nor does the same legal standard apply.the court in,for example,found that the employer failed to establish a qualifying work period under k.as a result,the employer was required to adhere to overtime requirements set forth in a,which required that it pay overtime once an officer weekly hours exceeded the hour threshold,at.here,teaneck has established its eligibility for the k exemption,so the overtime threshold for teaneck officers is hours for officers under the work plan and hours for those under the plan.see c.twenty minutes of daily muster time for teaneck officers,regardless of whether they work a five and two plan or the six and three plan,does not push them over the applicable overtime thresholds as it did in.appellants reliance on barvinchak is similarly flawed as the court analysis was also based upon an overtime threshold of forty hours.
turning to the agreement in the instant matter,we think it is clear that muster time was contemplated as a component of the officers base salaries.article vii of the agreement sets forth that a normal tour of duty shall be an eight hour time division of the day for the purposes of assignment.see app.at emphasis added.that same section goes on to state that e mployees will report for duty ten minutes prior to the start of their tour and will be dismissed from duty ten minutes after the end of their tour.id.the only reasonable interpretation of this language is that an officer work schedule,on any given day,is eight hours and twenty minutes.such a reading would therefore encompass the tour of duty,the assignment,and pre and muster time.this reading of the agreement lends itself to the conclusion that muster time is a required component of an officer daily tour schedule,a fact that both parties were aware of at the time negotiations took place.
we note that our conclusion is reinforced by the parties extensive history of negotiations,which began in and continued every few years thereafter.there is no indication that muster time has ever been treated as a separate entity from an officer normal tour of duty,or that it was ever compensated separately.nor is there any indication that the officers disputed the arrangement.taking the agreement as a whole,combined with the actions of both parties over the course of thirty years,we conclude that teaneck officers are compensated for muster time as a component of their negotiated salaries.accordingly,we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment as it relates to appellants claim regarding muster time.
donning and doffing 
appellants assert various arguments regarding their donning and doffing claim,including allegations that the district court failed to consider that their uniforms are necessary to the principal work performed by the officers erred in holding that the uniforms are not for the benefit of the employer erred in concluding that o of the flsa applied to police uniforms and failed to consider their claim regarding safety equipment.the arguments set forth by appellants essentially claim that two exclusions to the wage and hour requirements,the portal to portal act of and o,do not apply to their daily donning and doffing.because the o exclusion speaks directly to the issue of time where a cba governs the employment relationship between an employer and its employees,and a cba governs the relationship between teaneck and its officers,that is where we will begin our analysis.
section o of the flsa sets forth that,when determining hours worked for purposes of the wage a
