the maryland transit administration mta,as the owner of the railroad running between clayton,delaware,and easton,maryland,applied to the surface transportation board stb or board formerly,the interstate commerce commission to abandon freight transportation use of the and to convert it to a recreational trail,as authorized by the national trails system act the trails act.the trails act authorizes owners of railroad to enter into agreements with entities,called sponsors,under which the sponsors agree to convert the into recreational trails,so long as they agree to reserve to the railroad the right to return the to railroad use.as part of the application for conversion to trail use,the sponsors must agree to assume full responsibility for any legal liability arising out of such use or agree to indemnify the railroad for any potential liability and assume responsibility for the payment of all taxes assessed with respect to the.d a.
the mta submitted to the stb interim user agreements it had reached with two sponsoring governmental agencies,in which the sponsors agreed to indemnify the mta for potential liability,subject to limitations of state sovereign immunity and to future legislative appropriations.the stb rejected the mta application,concluding that instead of assuming full responsibility for legal liability or indemnifying the mta for any potential liability,the proposed sponsors conditioned their undertakings by subjecting them to sovereign immunity and to future state legislative appropriations.the stb explained that instead of assuming full responsibility,the proposed sponsors offer ed the possibility of no responsibility.
the mta filed this petition for review,contending that the conditions imposed by the sponsors do not narrow the scope of the indemnity that would be undertaken and that the limitations of sovereign immunity and legislative appropriations were necessary that by requiring an unqualified indemnity clause,the stb regulation is,in any event,an unreasonable and impermissible construction of the trails act because it infringes on state sovereignty without clear expression of congressional intent to do so and that the stb inappropriately refused to exercise its duty to evaluate the substance of the sponsors undertakings by interpreting its responsibilities to be only ministerial.
for the reasons we give herein,we find the mta arguments unpersuasive,especially in light of its burden to demonstrate that the stb acted arbitrarily and capriciously.see.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the stb and deny the mta petition for review.
the mta acquired the mile railroad between clayton,delaware,and easton,maryland,from the trustees of the penn central transportation company in and later,for several years,tried to use it as a railroad through an operations agreement with the chesapeake railroad company.after the chesapeake railroad company failed,however,the mta filed a notice with the stb that it intended to abandon the use of the for railroad transportation and to covert the to a recreational trail.as required by the trails act and regulations under it,the mta,at the time also acting as a potential trail sponsor,included in its notice a statement of willingness to assume full responsibility for any legal liability arising out of the recreational trail use and for the payment of any taxes that might be assessed against the.
the stb duly issued a certificate of interim trail use citu to the mta in january,thus giving mta days to negotiate a trail use agreement.under the stb regulations,any sponsor was required to assume full responsibility for any legal liability arising out of the use of the unless the user is immune from liability,in which case it need only indemnify the railroad against any potential liability and for the payment of all taxes assessed against the.a.
after several extensions,in september,the mta shifted course.rather than assume direct responsibility as a trail sponsor,the mta submitted two new interim trail use agreements to the stb,one with the delaware department of natural resources and environmental control and one with the maryland department of natural resources.the mta asked the board to vacate the existing citu and issue new citus reflecting the new sponsors assumption of responsibility.in each agreement the sponsor conditioned its undertaking to indemnify the mta from liability.the agreement between the mta and the delaware sponsor provided 
notwithstanding the requirements of subsection a providing for indemnity and liability,nothing contained in this agreement shall constitute or be deemed to constitute an obligation of future appropriations by the delaware general assembly.mta acknowledges that licensee must obtain appropriations prior to payment of any damages.a lack of funds to perform any aspect of this agreement due to insufficient appropriation by the delaware general assembly shall not constitute a breach of this agreement.
emphasis added.in its statement of willingness to assume financial responsibility submitted with the agreement,the delaware department of natural resources reiterated the limitation of its undertaking,stating that it is entitled to sovereign immunity,and accordingly,will indemnify mta against any potential liability provided that such indemnification shall not constitute or be deemed to constitute an obligation of future appropriations by the delaware general assembly.
the agreement between the mta and the maryland sponsor provided similarly 
in order to establish interim trail use and rail banking under usc d and cfr,lessee is willing to assume,under the provisions of the maryland tort claims act,responsibility for any legal liability arising out of the lessee use of the area as a public recreation rail trail.
subject to appropriations by the maryland general assembly and to the extent permitted by law if at all,lessee shall protect,indemnify,defend and hold harmless lessor against and with respect to any and all liabilities arising out of or in any way connected with a the exercise or performance by lessee,b the use or operation by lessee,or c work performed by or on behalf of the lessee upon the trail.
emphasis added.
at the first level of review,the stb acting director of the office of proceedings denied the mta application to convert the to a trail because the sponsors failed to comply with the undertakings required by regulation a.the acting director noted that subjecting the sponsors agreements to indemnify the mta to future appropriations and making any liability subject to sovereign immunity could negate the required indemnification.
on appeal to the stb,the board affirmed the acting director.the board noted that under the trails act,prospective trail sponsors are required to assume full responsibility for any legal liability arising out of the use of the as a trail or,as authorized by regulation,to indemnify the railroad for any potential liability.it explained,r ecognizing that many states and their subdivisions enjoy sovereign immunity,the board regulations allow them to satisfy the trails act by agreeing to indemnify the railroad against any potential liability.quoting a.the board noted,however,that the delaware and maryland sponsors d id not satisfy the requirements of the trails act and the stb regulations.with respect to the delaware sponsor undertaking,the board pointed out that the sponsor willingness to indemnify the mta was subject to the requirements of delaware law and that the delaware general assembly might not provide funds in sufficient amounts to discharge the sponsor obligations.and with respect to the maryland sponsor undertaking,the board identified similar conditions,pointing out that the maryland sponsor would indemnify the mta only under the provisions of the maryland tort claims act and subject to appropriations by the maryland general assembly.further,the maryland sponsor included the qualification that it would indemnify the mta only to the extent permitted by law if at all.finally,the board noted that the maryland sponsor failed to include any undertaking to pay taxes that might be assessed against the.in conclusion,the board explaine
