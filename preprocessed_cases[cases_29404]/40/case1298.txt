the national treasury employees union nteu sought to amend its collective bargaining agreement with the internal revenue service irs to permit probationary employees to use the agreement grievance procedures to challenge removals alleged to be in violation of statutory rights or procedures.the irs refused to negotiate over nteu proposal on the grounds that the proposal would grant probationary employees greater procedural protections than were authorized under law and regulation.nteu appealed to the federal labor relations authority flra,which held for the irs.nteu now asks us to reverse the flra and find its proposal negotiable.we decline to do so because such a decision would ignore both the statutory and regulatory frameworks that congress and the executive branch have put in place,create a stark circuit split,and overturn nearly thirty years of settled practice.
most federal agencies,including the irs,are required by law to negotiate in good faith with unions for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement.a see also id.a defining agency id.a listing the refusal to negotiate in good faith as an unfair labor practice nrc flra,cir.such agreements must,subject to certain limited exceptions,contain procedures for the settlement of grievances,including questions of arbitrability.a.a grievance encompasses any complaint by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee.id.a.however,limits the requirement to provisions that are not inconsistent with any federal law or any rule or regulation.id.a see also nrc,at.

the office of personnel management opm is tasked with establishing the rules for the competitive service.id.pursuant to its authority,opm has codified the rules for probationary employees at part,subpart h.the rules set the length of the probationary period at a one year from the start of employment,a,a,and grant probationary employees some protections against removal,such as notice of a pending removal and limited rights of appeal to the merit systems protection board mspb,id.a.the rules do not affirmatively grant probationary employees the right to grieve removals alleged to be in violation of statutory rights or procedures.
nteu sought to amend its existing agreement with the irs to permit probationary employees to grieve removals where the grievance is confined to enforcing the procedures or rights contained in a statute,and any subsequent arbitration decision is controlled solely by the requirements of law and regulation such that the arbitrator is merely substituting for the federal authority that would hear the employee challenge.nteu,emphasis added.
the irs refused to negotiate over nteu proposal,arguing that it was outside duty to negotiate because it was contrary to law and regulation.id.the irs argued that,based on circuit and flra precedent,probationary employees may not grieve removals as a matter of law,and that such a procedure would be contrary to the opm regulations.id.at.
nteu appealed to the flra,which ruled in favor of the irs.the flra cited nearly three decades of flra precedent holding that proposals violate and the opm regulations to the extent they grant probationary employees procedural protections beyond those required by statute or opm regulations or the ability to grieve separation disputes.id.at.such proposals thus fall outside of requirement.relying upon two decisions by the circuit,nteu flra,and ins flra,the flra reasoned that while probationary employees have some rights to challenge removals in certain administrative and judicial forums,they are authorized to receive only minimal due process in connection with their separation,which does not include the right to grieve removals.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
nteu appeals the flra decision.we must uphold the decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.nteu flra,cir.nteu contends that we should not defer to the flra interpretations of the opm regulations.it argues that the regulations are outside the flra organic statute and regulatory domain,and are thus beyond the flra s special area of expertise.appellant br.at citing shanty town.epa,cir.the flra responds that d ue deference is paid to an flra determination of negotiability,appellee br.at quoting nrc flra,cir,while the flra interpretations of law outside its organic statute and implementing regulations should be followed to the extent the reasoning is sound,id.quoting ass of civilian technicians.lone star chapter flra.we need not entertain the question of the specific level of deference the flra should receive when interpreting the opm regulations,however,inasmuch as we conclude that the flra interpretation of the relevant law and regulations was correct.
nteu argument is simple.because congress did not exclude probationary employees from the definitions of employee and grievance in a,a,probationary employees are generally covered by the grievance procedure.and because congress explicitly excluded some disputes from the procedure such as those over examinations,certifications,or appointments,id.c,or removals for reasons,id.c see also id.but did not explicitly exclude disputes over removals generally,probationary employees should be able to grieve such disputes where the removals are alleged to be in violation of statutory rights or procedures.see appellant br.at.as we explain below,this reading of the statute runs counter to the whole statutory and regulatory scheme governing probationary employees.
congress has provided for a probationary period since it created the modern system with the pendleton act,stat,ch.amended.see stat,ch,see also kato ishihara,cir ins flra.congress continuing belief in the importance of a probationary period was reflected in the passage of the civil service reform act of csra,which both preserved the probationary period for new employees and expanded it to cover new appointments to managerial and supervisory positions.compare authorizing the creation of a period of probation before an appointment in the competitive service becomes absolute,with a authorizing the creation of a probationary period for both new employees and appointments to managerial and supervisory positions.
as the term probationary implies,employees so designated are on probation and subject to summary dismissal.they are,of course,just as entitled to be free of illegal or discriminatory treatment from their employers as are employees,and thus nteu is correct in arguing that its proposal is not designed to provide any substantive legal protections to probationary employees that do not already exist.appellant br.at.
this does not mean,however,that congress intended for the same remedies to be available to probationary and employees.see nteu flra nteu ii.this is reflected in the numerous ways that the law treats probationary and employees differently.for example,probationary employees are explicitly excluded from the protections against demotion or removal for unacceptable performance under.see f.these protections include written notice thirty days in advance of the adverse employment action,representation by an attorney or other representative,and a final written decision.id.b.probationary employees are not afforded the full rights that employees have to appeal a removal or demotion for unacceptable performance to the mspb.see id.e.similarly,probationary employees do not possess the protections granted to employees against removals for such reasons as will promote the efficiency of the service.id.a see also id.a a i.as the circuit has recognized,the substantial protections that congress made available only to tenured employees indicate that congress recognized and approved of the inextricable link between the effective operation of the probationary per
