on may,sie giok giang,a passenger on a sky express interstate bus traveling from north carolina to new york,was killed when the driver fell asleep at the wheel and ran the bus off the side of a virginia highway.about seven weeks before the crash,sky express had been given an unsatisfactory safety rating by the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa,a rating that ordinarily would require a passenger motor carrier to cease operations after days.the fatal crash occurred after that day period,but during an extension period granted by the fmcsa that allowed sky express to remain on the road for an additional days.at issue is whether the discretionary function exception to the federal tort claims act ftca bars an ftca claim against the fmcsa for allowing sky express to continue to operate during those days.the district court concluded that,pursuant to that exception,it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed the case.we affirm.
the present dispute stems from the operation of the federal regulatory scheme for monitoring the safe operation of interstate passenger motor carriers.congress has charged the secretary of transportation the secretary to determine whether an owner or operator is fit to operate safely commercial motor vehicles.a.in turn,the secretary has delegated this authority to the fmcsa.f.to carry out this mandate,the fmcsa has promulgated regulations that provide for compliance reviews of commercial motor carriers to ensure their safe operation.based on a compliance review,a commercial motor carrier is given a safety rating of satisfactory,conditional,or unsatisfactory.id.a satisfactory rating means that the motor carrier has adequate safety management controls in place.id.a conditional rating means that the motor carrier does not have adequate safety management controls in place and that the lack of those controls could result in safety violations.id.an unsatisfactory rating means that the motor carrier does not have adequate safety management controls in place and that the lack of safety management controls has resulted in safety violations.see delineating salient safety violations.
if a commercial motor carrier receives an unsatisfactory rating,it does not have to cease operation immediately.instead,for passenger carriers,an unsatisfactory rating becomes final beginning on the day after the date of the fmcsa notice of proposed unsatisfactory rating,a,at which point the carrier may not operate until the owner or operator is found to be fit,c.the carrier may seek an upgrade of its rating by submitting to the fmcsa a written description of corrective actions it has taken and documentation of those changes.a c.a request for an upgrade does not toll the day provisional period.however,in,when the events at issue in this case occurred,the regulations provided that i f the motor carrier has submitted evidence that corrective actions have been taken and the fmcsa can not make a final determination within the day period,the period before the proposed safety rating becomes final may be extended for up to days at the discretion of the fmcsa.f.
in,the fmcsa rescinded this day extension provision to make the regulations consistent with the policy and the statutory language of c and.c states that w ith regard to owners or operators of commercial motor vehicles designed or used to transport passengers,an owner or operator who the secretary determines is not fit may not operate in interstate commerce beginning on the day after the date of such fitness determination and until the secretary determines such owner or operator is fit.the statute provides the secretary with discretion to extend operations for some carriers for an additional days,but expressly excludes passenger carriers from that provision.c.
in,sky express,a commercial motor carrier based in charlotte,north carolina,operated buses engaged in interstate passenger transportation.on april,the fmcsa conducted a safety compliance review of sky express and gave the carrier an unsatisfactory rating.on april,the fmcsa sent sky express written notice of that rating,explaining that the rating would become final in days,on may,unless sky express took the necessary steps to improve the rating to conditional or satisfactory.on may,sky express submitted a request for change to proposed safety rating in which it detailed efforts it had taken to resolve the safety issues identified in the april,compliance review.
after reviewing sky express submission,the fmcsa concluded on may,that sky express had failed to provide adequate evidence that it had corrected all of the safety violations and thus decided to conduct a compliance review.in a may,letter from fmcsa field administrator darrell ruban to sky express,the fmcsa informed sky express that it was denying sky express request for a change in its rating because the submitted materials did not provide sufficient evidence that the violations cited in the compliance review have been corrected.the letter then notified sky express that the fmcsa would conduct a compliance review before june,during which sky express would need to provide additional documentation for review by safety investigators.in a second letter sent that same day,the fmcsa informed sky express that in order to provide additional time to conduct the compliance review,the deadline for sky express unsatisfactory rating to become final had been extended by days,from may,to june.
during that day extension period,on may,at approximately,a sky express bus traveling northbound on interstate crashed in caroline county,virginia after the driver fell asleep at the wheel and allowed the bus to go off the road and down an embankment.the bus flipped over and rolled upside down,and sie giok giang,a passenger,suffocated to death when her head became trapped between the collapsed bus roof and the top of her seat.
on april,appellant jonatan pornomo,giang adult son and the administrator of giang estate,filed a wrongful death action against the united states pursuant to the federal tort claims act,b,in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,richmond division.pornomo alleged that the fmcsa had been negligent in issuing the day extension because the language of c does not permit any extension of the day deadline,such that the regulation authorizing such an extension,f,was invalid.pornomo further contended that even if the fmcsa had the authority to issue an extension under f,the criteria for issuance of such an extension had not been met.
the united states filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that the district court did not have jurisdiction over pornomo claim because the issuance of the day extension was a discretionary act shielded from suit under the discretionary function exception to the ftca,and because pornomo claim that the fmcsa lacked statutory authority to promulgate and apply f was a challenge to the validity of the regulation that,under a,could be raised only in the court of appeals.the government also argued that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking because the conduct at issue here did not constitute a tort under virginia law.
the district court granted the motion,holding that the discretionary function exception applied to the decision to issue the day extension and that the united states therefore had not waived sovereign immunity for this suit.the court found that the plain language of f afforded the agency discretion to grant an extension.the decision was still a discretionary decision even though the regulation provided two preconditions,because those preconditions were not detailed or a safety check list,but instead required the application of fmcsa expertise to determine whether they had been met.the court then concluded that the fmcsa received a detailed,written corrective action plan from sky express but determined,using its judgment,that it needed more information to verify the contents of the plan.id.at.it further found that the fmcsa determined it was unable to make a final determination concerning sky express operating authority registration and therefore granted the extension to provide ad
