opinion of the court 
this appeal stems from litigation challenging a pennsylvania statute act that increased salaries for state legislators,executive officials and state judges.plaintiffs are pennsylvania citizens,a state representative and two cause and the league of women voters.they sued the commonwealth of pennsylvania,its governor and treasurer,the general assembly leadership,and the chief justice of the pennsylvania supreme court,in their individual and official capacities.plaintiffs allege that,for the past ten years,members of the pennsylvania supreme court have traded judicial decisions favorable to the pennsylvania general assembly in return for the legislature funding the state judiciary.according to plaintiffs,this arrangement culminated in the general assembly enactment of act in a manner during the dead of night.in this litigation,plaintiffs primarily challenge the manner in which act was enacted,seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief.because plaintiffs allege only general grievances shared by all citizens of pennsylvania,however,we conclude that they lack standing to pursue the claims they assert.therefore,having jurisdiction to consider this appeal under,we affirm the decision of the district court to dismiss plaintiffs action in its entirety.
background 
because the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims pursuant to.b and,see common cause of pennsylvania,d,we must accept as true all allegations and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,see lewis atlas van lines,cir rule b taliaferro darby twp.zoning,cir rule b and.
factual allegations 
in their second amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged the following 
events leading up to the general assembly enactment of act 
the pennsylvania constitution provides that 
t he judicial power of the commonwealth shall be vested in a unified judicial system consisting of the supreme court,the superior court,the commonwealth court,courts of common pleas,community courts,municipal and traffic courts in the city of philadelphia,such other courts as may be provided by law and justices of the peace.all courts and justices of the peace and their jurisdiction shall be in this unified judicial system.
art.v.based upon this constitutional provision,allegheny county,in,sued the commonwealth,arguing that,contrary to the relevant pennsylvania statutes enacted by the general assembly,the pennsylvania constitution required the commonwealth,rather than the county,to fund the county court of common pleas.see county of allegheny commonwealth.the pennsylvania supreme court agreed,holding that the statutory scheme for county funding of the judicial system is in conflict with the intent clearly expressed in the constitution that the judicial system be unified.id.at.nevertheless,the pennsylvania supreme court provided that,
because this order entails that present statutory funding for the judicial system is now void as offending the constitutional mandate for a unified system,we stay our judgment to afford the general assembly an opportunity to enact appropriate funding legislation consistent with this holding.until this is done,the prior system of county funding shall remain in place.
id.footnotes omitted.
notwithstanding this mandate from the pennsylvania supreme court,however,the general assembly declined to act to fund the courts.see.state ass of county comm rs commonwealth.after nine years of inaction,the pennsylvania association of county commissioners sought mandamus relief from the pennsylvania supreme court,asking the court to direct the general assembly to fund the state unified court system.see id.the pennsylvania supreme court granted a writ of mandamus pursuant to this writ,jurisdiction is retained and by further order a master will be appointed to recommend to this court a schema which will form the basis for the specific implementation to be ordered.id.at.
at about this same time,the general assembly,contrary to the pennsylvania constitution,was generally enacting legislation in ways that precluded involvement in the legislative process by both the public and the vast majority of legislators.app.at.common cause,as well as other parties,sued pennsylvania in state court,challenging the validity of these various legislative enactments.
in and,the general assembly negotiated with the pennsylvania courts over the commonwealth funding the court system.those negotiations resulted in the general assembly enacting legislation to fund the commonwealth unified judicial system in return for the pennsylvania supreme court judicial decisions upholding the legislation being challenged in state court.
enactment of act 
in,the chief justice of the pennsylvania supreme court,in secret,negotiated with state legislators for the enactment of a bill increasing the salaries of the commonwealth judges and justices.eventually,this pay hike was included in legislation that also increased the salaries for legislators and executive branch employees.
house bill,the bill that would become act,was initially a bill entitled relating to compensation for executive branch officials,which prohibited any member of the executive branch or any board from receiving compensation greater than that paid to the governor.app.at.the house passed house bill.the senate then amended house bill,changing it into a bill restricting its application to officials elected or appointed to an executive branch position after november.id.at.the senate passed the bill as amended.the house,however,rejected the revised bill and so house bill was referred to a conference committee consisting of three house and three senate members.the members of this conference committee,named as defendants in this litigation,included most of the general assembly leadership.
at approximately on july,the conference committee amended house bill,changing it from a bill about compensation for executive officials into a page bill,providing for massive increases of up to in the salary of every justice and judge of the pennsylvania unified judicial system,every member of the general assembly,and senior members of the executive branch including the governor and members of his cabinet.id.at.the revised bill also mandated that provisions of the act are nonseverable and if any provision of the act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid,the remaining provisions or applications of the act are void.id.at.according to plaintiffs,by including this provision,the commonwealth government intentionally created a financial conflict for state court judges to ensure they would not deviate from the negotiated goal of upholding salary increases for all three branches of state government.id.at.
this revised bill was presented to the senate and house within minutes after being reported out of the conference committee under a rule prohibiting any amendment.id.at.both chambers passed the bill.a few hours later,the governor signed the bill into law,and it immediately took effect id.at.
reaction to act 
there was a negative public response to act,focusing particularly upon its timing and method of passage stilp,at.several actions challenged act validity.see id.at.four months after its enactment,the general assembly,on november,repealed act in its entirety and reinstated the previous pay scheme act app.at see stilp,at.
procedural posture of this litigation 
plaintiffs initiated this federal litigation on october,a month before the pennsylvania legislature repealed act.plaintiffs amended their complaint once before that repeal,and a second time after the general assembly repealed act.in their second amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged five federal and eight claims,and sought both injunctive and declaratory relief.
defendants moved to dismiss all of plaintiffs claims,under.b and,for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted in a very thorough decision,the district court granted defendants motions to dismiss plaintiffs federal claims.see common cause,d at.in light of that determination,the court held that it did not need to consider plaintiffs pendent claims and,therefore,dismissed plaintiffs complaint in its entirety.id.at.plaintiffs appeal the district court decision dismissing their federal claims.
ii.standard of review 
the district court held,among other things,that plaintiffs lacked standing to assert the federal claims they are pursuing in this litigation.see id.at.absent article iii standing,a federal court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to address a plaintiff claims,and they must be dismissed.taliaferro,at.this court reviews dismissals for lack of standing de novo.graden conexant,cir,cert.denied,d see also goode city of philadelphia,cir.
in an appeal from a grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b,we review only whether the allegations on the face of the complaint,taken as true,allege facts sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the district court.challenges to subject matter jurisdiction under rule b may be facial or factual.facial attacks,like this one,contest the sufficiency of the pleadings,and the trial court must accept the complaint allegations as true.

iii.standing 
general standing principles 
standing implicates both constitutional requirements and prudential concerns.see kowalski tesmer,d.
in essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.the standing requirement is born partly of an idea,which is more than an intuition but less than a rigorous and explicit theory,about the constitutional and prudential limits to the powers of an unelected,unrepresentative judiciary in our kind of government.

constitutional standing requirements 
article iii,of the constitution restricts the federal judicial power to the resolution of cases and controversies.that controversy requirement is satisfied only where a plaintiff has standing.sprint commc ns apcc,d see also valley forge christian,at.
i n order to have article iii standing,a plaintiff must adequately establish an injury in fact,a concrete and particularized invasion of a legally protected interest causation,a fairly traceable connection between the alleged injury in fact and the alleged conduct of the defendant and redressability,it is likely and not merely speculative that the plaintiff injury will be remedied by the relief plaintiff seeks in bringing suit.
sprint commc ns.at quoting lujan,at.further quotation,alterations omitted see also cortes,at.in this manner does art.iii limit the federal judicial power to those disputes which confine federal courts to a role consistent with a system of separated powers and which are traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judicial process.valley forge christian,at.quoting flast cohen,d.determining that a matter before the federal courts is a proper case or controversy under article iii therefore assumes particular importance in ensuring that the federal judiciary respects the properly of the courts in a democratic society.daimlerchrysler,at.quotation omitted.n o principle is more fundamental to the judiciary proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.id.quotations omitted.if a dispute is not a proper case or controversy,the courts have no business deciding it id.
of particular relevance to this case,a plaintiff must allege an actual,concrete injury.see sprint commc ns.at lujan,at.it is not enough to assert a generalized,abstract grievance shared by a large number of similarly situated people.see valley forge christian,at.citing cases.we go on to discuss prudential standing.
prudential standing requirements 
in contrast to constitutional standing,prudential standing embodies judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction.elk grove unified sch,at.quotation omitted.although the supreme court has 
not exhaustively defined the prudential dimensions of the standing doctrine,the court has explained that prudential standing encompasses the general prohibition on a litigant raising another person legal rights,the rule barring adjudication of generalized grievances more appropriately addressed in the representative branches,and the requirement that a plaintiff complaint fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.
id.at.quotation omitted see also valley forge christian,at.twp.of piscataway duke energy,cir.
without such related to art.iii concerns but essentially matters of judicial courts would be called upon to decide abstract questions of wide public significance even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the questions and even though judicial intervention may be unnecessary to protect individual rights.
elk grove unified sch,at.quotation omitted.
of import in this case,then,even when the plaintiff has alleged redressable injury sufficient to meet the requirements of art.iii,the supreme court has refrained from adjudicating abstract questions of wide public significance which amount to generalized grievances,pervasively shared and most appropriately addressed in the representative branches.valley forge christian,at.quoting warth seldin,d.
generalized grievances 
whether styled as a constitutional or prudential limit on standing,the supreme court has sometimes determined that where large numbers of americans suffer alike,the political process,rather than the judicial process,may provide the more appropriate remedy for a widely shared grievance.fed.election comm akins,d citing cases.based upon this reasoning,the supreme court repeatedly has rejected claims of standing predicated on the right,possessed by every citizen,to require that the government be administered according to law.valley forge christian,at.quotation,alteration omitted citing cases see also massachusetts,d we will not entertain citizen suits to vindicate the public nonconcrete interest in the proper administration of the laws.lance coffman,d per curiam noting that the t he only injury plaintiffs allege is that the law has not been followed.this injury is precisely the kind of undifferentiated,generalized grievance about the conduct of government that we have refused to countenance in the past.lujan,at.we have consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about only harm to his and every citizen interest in proper application of the constitution and laws,and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at not state an article iii case or controversy.id.at.citing cases goode,at holding taxpayers lacked standing to assert claims based upon generalized injury that all persons in philadelphia suffered cortes,at holding voters and taxpayers lacked standing to assert a generalized grievance of concerned citizens taliaferro,at,holding homeowners lacked standing to assert generalized challenge to local zoning ordinance pub.interest research group of,magnesium elektron,cir holding plaintiffs lacked standing to assert generalized claim that they were injured by knowing that creek was being polluted.
such claims amount to little more than attempts to employ a federal court as a forum in which to air generalized grievances about the conduct of government.valley forge christian,at.quotation,alteration omitted.therefore,assertion of a right to a particular kind of government conduct,which the government has violated by acting differently,can not alone satisfy the requirements of art.iii without draining those requirements of meaning.id.at.
this reasoning invariably appears in cases where the harm at issue is not only widely shared,but is also of an abstract and indefinite example,harm to the common concern for obedience to law.akins,at.quotation omitted.the abstract nature of the example,injury to the interest in seeing that the law is the case of the concrete specificity which prevents a plaintiff from obtaining what would,in effect,amount to an advisory opinion.id.at.often the fact that an interest is abstract and the fact that it is widely shared go hand in hand.but their association is not invariable,and where a harm is concrete,though widely shared,the supreme court has found injury in fact.see also massachusetts,at.goode,at noting in that case that a ppellants lack standing,not because the alleged injuries they suffer are widely felt,but because their injuries are no different in nature from the general interest in enforcing compliance with the law which the public shares.
in this appeal,plaintiffs argue they are not asserting generalized grievances,but are instead alleging the deprivation of personal rights under the first,fifth and fourteenth amendments.even so,plaintiffs must allege that they directly suffered an actual injury to those rights.see valley forge christian,at.see also goode,at,applying same standing analysis to a citizen taxpayer claims alleging the deprivation of rights under the first,fifth and fourteenth amendments to access the courts and to petition the legislature,and thus requiring plaintiff to establish an actual and direct injury to her rights in order to have standing.
plaintiffs status 
the named plaintiffs include four potts,carl silverman,william koch and william are pennsylvania residents,citizens and taxpayers.plaintiff greg vitali is a citizen and taxpayer in pennsylvania.he is also a member of the pennsylvania house of representatives who voted against act 
two of the cause of pennsylvania and the league of women associations.common cause is a national citizen advocacy organization concerned with advancing integrity in government.common cause primary goal is governmental accountability and responsiveness,which it promotes through lobbying,oversight,education,outreach and litigation programs.app.at.common cause of pennsylvania has over members in pennsylvania.id.
plaintiff league of women voters of pennsylvania is a membership based,corporation organized under the laws of pennsylvania.the league purpose is to promote the informed and active participation of citizens in their government.id.at.its membership consists of pennsylvania citizens,taxpayers,and voters.id.
an association or organization standing presents special considerations.
a n organization or association may have standing to bring suit under two circumstances.first,an organization may be granted standing in its own right to seek judicial relief from injury to itself and to vindicate whatever rights and immunities the organization or association itself may enjoy.alternatively,an association may assert claims on behalf of its members,but only where the record shows that the organization individual members themselves have standing to bring those claims.
cortes,at citations,alterations omitted see also.psychiatric soc y green spring health,cir.thus,an organization may sue to redress its members injuries,even without a showing of injury to the association itself.united food comm l workers union local brown group,d.
a n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.id.at.quoting hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d see also.psychiatric soc y,at.the first requirement,that at least one of the organization members would have standing to sue on his own,is grounded on article iii as an element of the constitutional requirement of a case or controversy.united food comm l workers union local,at.quotation omitted.the second prong 
is,at the least,complementary to the first,for its demand that an association plaintiff be organized for a purpose germane to the subject of its member claim raises an assurance that the association litigators will themselves have a stake in the resolution of the dispute,and thus be in a position to serve as the defendant natural adversary.
id.at.the third prong,on the other hand,is prudential in nature,rather than a constitutional requirement.see id.at.
in this case,the two plaintiff associations base their standing solely on injuries suffered by their members.therefore,because plaintiffs common cause and the league of women voters have alleged no injury to themselves as an organization,distinct from injury to their taxpayer members,their 
claim to standing can be no different from those of the members they seek to represent.the question presented,then,is whether their members,or any one of them,are suffering immediate or threatened injury as a result of the challenged action of the sort that would make out a justiciable case had the members themselves brought suit.
valley forge christian,at.quotation omitted.because the standing of the two plaintiff associations thus rests on the standing of their members,and because plaintiffs allege that the associations members suffered the same injury as the individual plaintiffs,save perhaps representative vitali,we will address the associations standing together with that of the individual plaintiffs.
plaintiffs claims 
the standing inquiry often turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted.raines byrd,d quotation omitted.therefore,i n determining whether appellants have standing,we must consider their specific allegations and the relief which they seek.goode,at citing city of los angeles lyons,d.although in their second amended complaint,plaintiffs originally alleged five federal claims,on appeal they continue to pursue only three of those five claims 
the state judiciary involvement in the legislative process deprived plaintiffs of due process 
in their second amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged only that defendants deprived plaintiffs of due process when defendants engaged in private conversations on legislative matters with one or more justices of the pennsylvania supreme court that might come before the court.app.at.the district court held that plaintiffs lacked standing to assert this claim.see common cause,d at.we agree.clearly these allegations,which challenge the legislative process,are insufficient to allege more than a generalized,abstract grievance,shared by all pennsylvania citizens.the complaint does not attempt to identify an actual,concrete injury that this conduct caused any of the named plaintiffs.goode,at,dismissing taxpayers claim because their alleged injuries are no different in nature from the general interest in enforcing compliance with the law which the public shares.
for the first time on appeal,plaintiffs attempt to focus on the potential state judicial process,arguing that defendants actions deprived plaintiffs of due process,and specifically an impartial decisionmaker,because act gave the judiciary a pecuniary interest in any litigation challenging that act the judiciary participated in creating the challenged legislation and the pennsylvania chief justice negotiated with the legislature for the predetermined result of any later court challenges to act brought before the pennsylvania supreme court.a litigant generally can not create standing through new allegations asserted for the first time on appeal.see storino borough of point pleasant beach,cir see also in re mystic tank lines,cir noting t his court has consistently held that it will not consider issues that are raised for the first time on appeal,absent exceptional circumstances.even considering these new allegations,however,plaintiffs have still failed to establish that they suffered an actual injury from this challenged conduct sufficient to give them standing.
for example,plaintiffs do not allege that they ever challenged act in state court and that,in doing so,they were deprived of an impartial decisionmaker.instead,they allege,in the abstract,that if plaintiffs had brought suit in pennsylvania courts challenging act,they would not have had an impartial decisionmaker the appellants here,who have challenged such enactments before and could be expected to do so again,were thereby denied any chance of the constitutionally required access to an impartial tribunal,and thus due process of law,in state court.aplt.br.at.that is not sufficient to state the actual or imminent injury necessary for constitutional standing.see massachusetts,at.lujan,at.
further,plaintiffs go on to articulate this claim as follows 
the fact,all with state constitutional rights to an open and deliberative legislative process guaranteed them by article iii of the state constitution these rights have consistently been found to be justiciable and defensible in the pennsylvania courts,and thus the plaintiffs here also possessed a legal right to bring suit in state court to challenge the deprivation of their article iii rights by the passage of act and other legislation challenged in the past or potentially challengeable at the time of these events.
aplt.br.at emphasis added see also id.at arguing defendants,who are leading figures of the pennsylvania state government,attempted systematically to deny a neutral and disinterested decision maker to the people of their commonwealth id.at asserting the chief justice and potentially other justices agreed before the legislation was even enacted that the state courts would uphold it against legal challenge by any citizens emphasis added.these arguments highlight the fact that plaintiffs are asserting only a generalized,abstract grievance held by all pennsylvanians.plaintiffs have,thus,failed to allege that they have directly suffered a personalized,actual or imminent injury,as article iii requires.
for all of these reasons,we conclude the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs due process claim because they lacked standing to assert it.
the truncated legislative process underlying the general assembly enactment of act deprived plaintiffs of equal protection and due process 
plaintiffs,in their second amended complaint,next challenged the manner in which the general assembly enacted act,alleging that defendants,by implement ing a truncated legislative process,as part of a continuing pattern of illegal statutory enactment,deprived plaintiffs of both due process and equal protection.app.at.the district court held that plaintiffs lacked standing to assert this claim,as well.see common cause,d at.again,we agree.plaintiffs failed to allege how this legislative process actually injured them directly.instead,they alleged a generalized,abstract grievance shared by all pennsylvanians.
on appeal,plaintiffs assert only an equal protection claim.thus,we deem them to have abandoned any due process challenge to the manner in which the general assembly enacted act,although our conclusion that plaintiffs lack standing would equally bar plaintiffs due process claim had it been preserved.see kost,at.
for the first time on appeal,plaintiffs make additional allegations to support their standing to challenge the way act was enacted.they also differentiate the grounds on which the citizen plaintiffs have standing from the basis for representative vitali standing.
again,plaintiffs generally can not create standing through new allegations asserted for the first time on appeal.see storino,at see also in re mystic tank lines,at.nonetheless,even considering these additional allegations,plaintiffs have failed to establish that they have constitutional standing to pursue this challenge to the procedures by which the general assembly enacted act.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that 
the process designed by defendants to enact act,in which a select few legislators were the only ones draft,propose or alter even a single word of the legislation,deprived the vast majority of legislators,including appellants representative plaintiff greg vitali,and their constituents such as appellants of equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.
aplt.br.at.more specifically,plaintiffs argue on appeal that defendants deprived them of equal protection by assigning the original house bill to a conference committee,composed of only named defendants,which completely redrafted the original house bill in secret,and then submitted it to the general assembly under a rule prohibiting any of the other legislators from amending the submitted bill.
as a result defendants ensured that they and only they were able to exercise the full panoply of legislative functions in drafting,debating and amending the text of the act,while consigning plaintiff representative greg vitali and the elected representatives of the remaining appellants to a mere vote on final passage.a small class of legislators thus was given the abilities constitutionally appertaining to membership in the general assembly to draft,discuss,debate,and amend the legislation at others were completely and expressly denied such ability.
because plaintiffs differentiate between representative vitali standing and that of the other citizen plaintiffs,we will address vitali standing separately 
plaintiff vitali standing 
l egislators,like other litigants in federal court,must satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisites of article iii standing.goode,at quoting russell dejongh,cir alteration omitted.
concerns for separation of powers and the limited role of the judiciary are at the core of article iii standing doctrine and the requirement that a plaintiff allege an injury in fact.those concerns are particularly acute in legislator standing cases,and they inform the analysis of whether a legislator plaintiff has asserted an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing to sue.
russell,at.
on appeal,plaintiffs suggest that defendants deprived vitali of equal protection of the law by denying him,and other legislators,the ability to discuss,debate and perhaps amend act before having to vote on that legislation.as plaintiffs point out in their brief,state legislators have,under different circumstances,sued based upon a direct injury suffered by that particular legislator.for instance,in bond floyd,state representative julian bond sued the georgia legislature,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that would permit him to take his seat in the georgia legislature,after that body excluded him for comments bond made against the vietnam war,among other things.see,d.similarly,in ammond mcgahn,a new jersey state senator,alene ammond,a democrat,sued the democratic senate caucus after the caucus excluded her for making negative remarks about the caucus.see,rev on other grounds.cir see also parker merlino,cir concluding,without addressing standing,that there was no merit to the claim asserted by several state legislators that other legislators violated their first and fourteenth amendment rights by terminating the opportunity for further debate before the legislature voted on two pending bills gewertz jackman,holding federal court had authority to consider state legislator claim challenging the democratic caucus decision to remove him from the appropriations committee noting that,although the legislator claim implicated operations of the state legislative body,the federal court was require d to consider this individual legislator claim that his constitutional rights have been violated by the legislature or its leaders see davids akers,cir considering merits of claims brought by state legislators challenging the committee appointments made by the state house speaker.
in each of these cases,the courts addressed the merits of these claims brought by individual state legislators without specifically discussing whether those legislators had standing to assert those claims.however,the supreme court has repeatedly held that the existence of unaddressed jurisdictional defects has no precedential effect.lewis casey,d see also fed.election comm nra political victory fund,d united states tucker truck lines.see generally steel citizens for a better env t,d noting that supreme court has often said that jurisdictional rulings have no precedential effect.
in this case,in any event,vitali does not allege that he has suffered a direct and concrete injury specific to him,as a result of defendants challenged conduct.rather,he challenges a procedure that excluded most of the pennsylvania legislators.
other cases,also relied upon by plaintiffs,have concluded that a legislator has standing to challenge the nullification of his particular vote.
l egislators have a legally protected interest in their right to vote on legislation and other matters committed to the legislature,which is sometimes phrased as an interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes.not every affront to a legislator interest in the effectiveness of his vote,however,is an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing to sue.
russell,at citing cases.for example,
courts have drawn a distinction between a public official mere disobedience of a law for which a legislator is not an injury in an official distortion of the process by which a bill becomes law by nullifying a legislator vote or depriving a legislator of an opportunity to is an injury in fact.
cases where a public official has directly injured a particular legislator by nullifying his vote,however,involve circumstances much different than those alleged here.see id.at citing cases bender williamsport area sch,d noting,in dicta,that a lone dissenting school board member might have standing to assert a claim seeking to maintain the effectiveness of his vote,if state law required a unanimous board vote and the rest of the board,nevertheless,acted without the dissenting member consent.
the third circuit addressed several such cases in russell,at.there,this court noted,for example,that coleman miller,stands,at most,for the proposition that legislators whose votes would have been sufficient to defeat or enact a specific legislative act have standing to sue if that legislative action goes into effect or does not go into effect on the ground that their votes have been completely nullified.russell,at quoting raines,at.emphasis added see also baird norton,cir.
and in dennis luis,cir,the third circuit 
held that a group of legislators had standing to challenge the appointment by the governor of the virgin islands of an acting commissioner of commerce without consulting them,where c of the organic act,c,provided that the appointment of a commissioner of commerce was subject to the advice and consent of the legislature.the plaintiffs in dennis thus alleged that they possessed a specific right under c of the organic act that the governor had violated,and they had no clear recourse through the political process.
russell,at.
further,in silver pataki,
the new york court of appeals recognized an injury in fact when a state assembly member alleged that the governor made illegal use of his line item veto power by using it on bills that were not lawfully subject to the line item veto.the state assembly member had voted in favor of the bills in question,and the new york court of appeals held that the plaintiff had standing in silver,the governor veto nullified the pending bills and forced the assembly member to try to persuade a supermajority of his colleagues to override the governor veto if he wished to restore the status of the bills as law.
russell,at.
the circumstances alleged in this case are much different.here,representative vitali was not precluded from voting on act.id.at concluding legislator,asserting claim that governor violated applicable deadlines in nominating justices of the virgin islands supreme court,did not allege that his ability to vote had been nullified where the legislator was still able to confirm,reject,or defer voting on the governor nominees.nor has vitali alleged that his vote was in any other way nullified.at most,vitali merely alleges he was denied full input on the drafting and consideration of act.but the denial was not specific to him rather,its impact was felt by all legislators other than the select leadership.however,the legislative process inevitably involves a division of responsibilities,and leadership necessarily will have greater input in legislation being considered.
for these reasons,we conclude that vitali has failed to allege that the manner in which the general assembly enacted act actually and concretely injured him in particular.even if vitali had alleged such an injury which we conclude he has not,vitali has also failed to satisfy prudential standing concerns.vitali challenge to the manner in which the general assembly enacted act is a clear example of one of those abstract questions of wide public significance which amount to generalized grievances,pervasively shared and most appropriately addressed in the representative branches which the supreme court counsels federal courts to avoid adjudicating.valley forge christian,at.quoting warth,at.see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure ed noting that most disagreements among state legislators will involve matters of state law,or issues of federal law that can not be disentangled from the political functions of the legislature.standing should be denied as to the federal questions,for reasons of federalistic deference to state legislatures that mirror the deference to congress.
for these reasons,the district court did not err in concluding plaintiff vitali lacked standing to challenge the manner in which the general assembly enacted act.
citizens plaintiffs standing 
on appeal,the citizen plaintiffs and the associations whose members are pennsylvania citizens allege that their elected state representatives were,like representative vitali,precluded from drafting,debating and amending act.the new jersey district court has suggested that a state legislator constituents might be able to assert such a claim 
the action by the caucus in denying senator ammond the opportunity to attend its deliberations deprived her constituents of the equal protection of the law.in effect,the action by the caucus created two classes of voters.one class consists of those citizens whose senators could effectively participate fully in the legislative process and another class whose senator could participate only to a limited degree.
even if we were to adopt the district of new jersey reasoning,however,the citizen plaintiffs in this case are able to assert only a generalized,abstract grievance shared by most defendant legislators denied plaintiffs representatives the equal opportunity to draft,debate and amend act before voting on that bill.see app.at plaintiffs arguing to the district court that defendants,through their mechanism by avoiding the legislative process mandated by the pennsylvania constitution,cut out the vast majority of the representatives and the people of pennsylvania from the deliberative processes of the general assembly.these are representational rights that are personal to every citizen in this state.such injury is insufficient to confer constitutional standing.
and even if they had established constitutional standing which we conclude they did not,the citizen plaintiffs can not satisfy prudential standing concerns.see valley forge christian,at.
conclusion 
it is clear that,before the district court,all of the plaintiffs failed to establish their standing under article iii to pursue their due protection claim challenging the manner in which the general assembly enacted act.for the first time on appeal,plaintiffs make additional standing arguments.nevertheless,even if we were to consi
