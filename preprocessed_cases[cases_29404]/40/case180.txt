this is a case about the canada lynx.the endangered species act makes it unlawful to take a member of an endangered species.a b.by regulation,it is also unlawful to take a threatened species,that is,one likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.a.the term take means to harass,harm,pursue,hunt,shoot,wound,kill,trap,capture,or collect.u.
the canada lynx is a wild cat,weighing about pounds,which eats small animals,particularly the snowshoe hare,and is most commonly found in canada.it is not listed as an endangered species.in,the fish and wildlife service fws of the federal department of the interior listed the canada lynx as a threatened species throughout its range certain states contiguous to canada,as well as certain western states.in maine,a listed state,canada lynx are found primarily in the northern portion of the state,in state wildlife management districts wmd through.maine prohibits the trapping of canada lynx,but allows the regulated trapping of many other furbearing animals.
this appeal is from the district court denial of plaintiffs motion to enjoin maine state officials from allowing the use of any foothold traps,which are used to legally trap other species,in wmds through.plaintiffs argued this relief was necessary to prevent incidental takes of lynx in these traps.see defining incidental taking.the district court held that plaintiffs had not shown irreparable injury,even recognizing the special emphasis in the endangered species act esa on protecting threatened species.we affirm.
plaintiffs are two private groups,animal welfare institute and wildlife institute of maine together awi,that sued in august,under the esa citizen suit provision,g.they allege that maine,by allowing trappers to obtain permits to use foothold traps also called leghold traps to catch other species that are neither threatened nor endangered,violates the esa because some individual lynx will incidentally be caught in such traps.
foothold traps spring shut on an animal leg or foot,holding the animal in place until the trapper returns.trappers usually use foothold traps to trap coyote and fox.there are no known instances of lynx deaths caused by a foothold trap still,historically,a small number of canada lynx are trapped and released each year in maine.
earlier litigation over the protection of the canada lynx,brought by an organization called the animal protection api in october,had resulted in a consent decree which provided significant protections for the canada lynx.see animal welfare institute martin,d,awi i describing earlier litigation.
under that consent decree,maine issued new regulations in and,which limited the size of foothold traps in lynx territory in an effort to reduce the number of incidental takes of canada lynx maine also attempted to reduce any harm from incidental takings of canada lynx by requiring trappers to report any incidental canada lynx takings.this,in turn,allows biologists from the maine department of inland fisheries and wildlife if w to examine the captured lynx and rehabilitate any injured lynx before releasing them to the forests.
the consent decree remains in effect unless and until the fws acts favorably on maine application for a federal incidental take permit itp a b.an itp allows takes incidental to otherwise lawful activity when requisite measures to minimize and mitigate harms are taken such that the permitted incidental takes will not appreciably impact the species as a whole.a.maine filed its first draft itp application in august maine filed a complete itp application in june,and in august,at the request of fws,filed a revised application.fws has taken no action yet on the application and so the consent decree continues in effect 
the present plaintiffs,apparently dissatisfied with the relief accomplished earlier,filed suit in august alleging that maine had not done enough unless and until an itp is issued,they argued,the court was required by the esa to issue a preliminary injunction banning all foothold traps.the court rejected the argument that as a matter of law injunctive relief must issue,even absent a showing of irreparable harm,upon a showing that incidental takings result from maine decision to allow any foothold traps.awi i,d at.the court denied preliminary injunctive relief as to foothold traps,but set the matter for hearing on evidence as to the actual risk of incidental trapping in foothold traps and actual consequences to the canada lynx of any such trapping.
as to conibear traps,the court granted preliminary injunctive relief on november,enjoining if w to immediately promulgate regulations,by emergency order if necessary,to prevent further takes in these traps.id.at.the court found irreparable harm in the death of a single lynx that had been killed by a conibear trap in november a second lynx was killed in a conibear trap shortly after the court issued its opinion.id.at.even though awi had not established that the death of one threatens the species as a whole,it had demonstrated that the current regulations are inadequate and it is predictable that if the regulations are not amended,other lynx will suffer irreparable harm.id.at.the court found that under the esa the balance of hardships and public interest factors tip heavily in favor of the protected species.id.quoting strahan coxe,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in april and june,the district court held a hearing,which had extensive evidence as to both types of traps.the court found awi had not shown it was likely that lynx would be taken in conibear traps under the new regulations promulgated by maine as a result of the preliminary injunction.awi iii,d at.awi does not appeal this finding and so conibear traps are not at issue in this appeal.
maine conceded that canada lynx would continue to be caught in foothold traps,even after the tighter regulations.awi iii,d at.as to consequences to the lynx of being caught in a foothold trap,the court found as a matter of fact that awi had failed to prove lynx suffer serious physical injury from incidental takes in foothold traps.the court recounted if w records of lynx takings from to,distinguishing between periods before and after the tighter regulations were imposed in.id.at.in the period from,during which thirty lynx were taken in foothold traps,if w was able to assess just under half,and only one had an injury that required veterinary treatment.id.none of the thirty died as a direct result of being trapped.id.in,eight lynx were taken and if w was able to assess five of them two sustained no injuries,and the other three had minor skin lacerations one also had a very slight limp upon release.id.
the court found that awi had failed to prove the truth of its assumption that most of the taken lynx suffered some sort of injury,or to provide any reliable data to counter if w evidence.id.at.rather,awi relied on studies about lingering negative effects of trapping on other species,or,in one case,about the convergence of multiple stressors on canada lynx in a different part of the country.see id.at.the court found that awi use of generalizations from other regions and species amounted to a failure of proof.id.at.on the question of whether canada lynx caught in incidental takes in foothold traps would be more likely to die from predation or starvation in the future,the court found that any incremental impact is unknown and probably unknowable.id.at.
the court did accept the testimony of awi experts that canada lynx might experience physical symptoms of as an elevated breathing rate and temperature,or hormonal or other chemical a result of being trapped.id.at.but the court rejected expert testimony that canada lynx could die from capture myopathy,a deterioration of the animal organ systems resulting from overproduction of lactic acid during a temporary capture.id.at.the court was skeptical that any stress caused by incidental takes in foothold traps could be so damaging for two reasons.first,it was unlikely a temporary trapping by humans would cause death if the stress of daily survival efforts does not.id.second,there was firm evidence that some lynx repeatedly visit traps for food despite repeatedly being trapped,undercutting awi argument that being trapped is an intensely stressful experience for lynx.id.
given these factual findings,the court concluded awi had failed to demonstrate that irreparable harm was likely to occur absent an injunction.the court further noted that even assuming awi had shown that some canada lynx suffer debilitating injuries from takes,it certainly had not established that these injuries threatened the canada lynx species.id.at.the court quoted the holding in water keeper alliance department of defense,cir,that absent a showing that animal deaths were likely and that these would impact the species,it was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to issue an injunction.id.plaintiffs do not challenge the findings of fact.
we start with the question of standing.while maine has not challenged the plaintiffs standing,we have jurisdiction only if plaintiffs meet the constitutional standing requirements.lujan.defenders of wildlife.plaintiffs must show that they have suffered an injury in fact,that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful actions,and that it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.nulankeyutmonen nkihtaqmikon impson,cir quoting lujan,at second alteration in original.plaintiffs must clearly allege facts demonstrating standing we then construe those facts and reasonable inferences drawn from them in plaintiffs favor.id.at.
in addition,as a prudential matter,each plaintiff organization may sue based on injuries to its members interests only if at least one of its members would have standing to sue as an individual,the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose,and individual members participation is not necessary to either the claim asserted or the relief requested friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,see also dubois dep t of,cir.animal welfare institute purpose as an organization is to reduce the sum total of pain and fear inflicted on animals by humans,and wildlife institute of maine purpose is to advoca te for wildlife and represent nonconsumptive interests of wildlife in maine.the interests invoked in this litigation in observing the canada lynx free from incidental trapping are germane to these purposes.
plaintiffs affidavits from members who are maine residents assert the members frequently visit wildlife refuges and parks in maine to try to observe lynx and other wildlife species.this desire to use or observe an animal species is undeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of standing.lujan,at.the members also allege a cognizable injury to this interest that maine trapping regulations,by causing canada lynx to be taken,interfere with the canada lynx natural state and may increase the animals risk of death,reducing the likelihood that the members will observe canada lynx in their natural state on future visits.see id.at see also friends of the earth,at stating plaintiffs meet injury in fact requirement by averring they use the affected area and the challenged activity will lessen their recreational and aesthetic interest in the area sierra club,at finding that an adverse effect on the scenery,natural and historic objects,and wildlife of a park that would impair the enjoyment of the park by those who use it would constitute a cognizable harm.plaintiffs have adequately alleged that this injury is fairly traceable to the challenged if w regulations,and redressable by the injunctive relief plaintiffs seek.
in order to obtain a permanent injunction plaintiffs must ordinarily satisfy a test.a plaintiff must demonstrate that it has suffered an irreparable injury that remedies available at law,such as monetary damages,are inadequate to compensate for that injury that,considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant,a remedy in equity is warranted and that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.monsanto geertson seed farms,quoting ebay mercexchange,internal quotation marks omitted.
for purposes of this case we will assume that the incidental taking of canada lynx in foothold traps results in a violation of the esa the questions before us have to do with the appropriate remedies for such a violation.our standard of review of denial of injunctive relief depends upon the nature of the issues involved.overall,review is for abuse of discretion.calderon,cir.nonetheless,review of underlying legal determinations is de novo.id.
plaintiffs attempt to characterize their case as turning on pure issues of law,and they make several related arguments.first they argue that congress,in enacting the esa,has so displaced the traditional four equitable factors used by courts in deciding on injunctive relief that the district court was required to issue an injunction on finding there was a taking of a single member of a threatened species.awi argues that in the esa,congress circumvented the traditional injunction inquiry,mandating prioritization of species protection,which curtails courts traditional discretion to deny equitable relief.they base this argument on united states oakland cannabis buyers cooperative,and weinberger.they are wrong.
even under the esa,the supreme court has said that courts are not mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law.valley auth.hill.while reciting this language,awi actual argument is to the contrary.awi argues that where a court finds an ongoing violation of the esa,the court is indeed obligated automatically to issue an injunction with terms stringent enough to end the violation,regardless of what the facts may be.that is not so.
awi claims are based on a mistaken reading of a line of cases beginning with hill,in which the supreme court found that only a permanent injunction against bringing a million dam online would suffice to remedy the tennessee valley authority violation of section of the esa id.at.the dam,if operated,would completely destroy the entire habitat of the newly discovered endangered snail darter,thereby extinguishing the species.id.at.the court stated that congress has spoken in the plainest of words in the esa,making it abundantly clear that the balance has been struck in favor of affording endangered species the highest of priorities.id.at.the court held that it was not free to balance the equities where congress had mandated institutionalized caution for the protection of listed species,and that it must therefore enjoin the dam operation.id.
the supreme court has since explained that the drastic result in hill stemmed from the strong and undisputed showing of irreparable harm that would occur absent an injunction an entire species would become extinct.oakland cannabis,at weinberger,at.since the existence of irreparable harm was essentially conceded in hill,the discussion of remedy focused on the changes the esa made to the remaining elements of the injunction analysis.see hill,at.after stating the general proposition that a court sitting in equity balances the equities and hardships of a case in its discretion,id.at,the court went on to find that congressional intent in the esa foreclosed the court from strik ing a balance of equities on the side of the tellico dam,id.at.rather,it was abundantly clear that the balance has been struck in favor of endangered species.id.
the circumstances here are none so dire,as the district court uncontested findings of fact show.awi did not prove that any single canada lynx has suffered serious physical injury or death from an incidental take in a foothold trap.the district court found the statutory violation here has not caused the death of any canada lynx,let alone that it poses the ultimate danger of extinction to which the hill court responded.
by contrast,the district court held that maine previous,conibear trap regulations did pose a mortal risk to at least some canada lynx,and the district court issued an injunction,forcing maine to amend its regulations immediately.awi i,d at.the district court thus engaged in exactly the analysis required by law.
this circuit has consistently applied the traditional tests for preliminary injunctions
