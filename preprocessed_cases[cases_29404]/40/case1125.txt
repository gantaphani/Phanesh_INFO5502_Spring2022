opinion of the court 
vineland fireworks,vineland appeals the decision of the acting director director of the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms explosives atf to revoke its license to manufacture fireworks and to deny its application for the renewal of its license to import fireworks.the director found that vineland failure to keep records of its daily summary of magazine transactions on occasions over the course of many months constituted a willful violation of f and.we hold that the director interpretation of willful is reasonable,and substantial evidence supports its finding that vineland willfully violated the above provisions.for the reasons that follow,we will deny the petition for review of the director order.
vineland is a fireworks manufacturer and distributor owned and operated by rose pacitto with locations in vineland,new jersey and coamo,puerto rico.vineland applied for and became licensed by atf in march.for approximately eleven years prior to her application,pacitto worked at fireworks by girone,a fireworks manufacturer and distributor owned and operated by felix girone,pacitto former husband.fireworks by girone operated out of the same site that later became vineland.
in,the united states attorney for the district of new jersey indicted fireworks by girone for knowingly and willfully manufacturing explosive materials without keeping proper records,in violation of,f,and a.the indictment stemmed from atf inspections in and,in which inspectors found that fireworks by girone had manufactured thousands of explosive devices without record and had improperly stored the devices.the investigators discussed the violations with pacitto at that time because the company federal explosives license listed her as a responsible person.fireworks by girone pleaded guilty to the charge,and pacitto then as rose girone signed the plea agreement.subsequently,atf revoked fireworks by girone license.
in november,after fireworks by girone license was revoked and pacitto had begun operating on the site under the new license for vineland,atf contacted pacitto and informed her of its earlier inspection of fireworks by girone in july and the violations it found.in particular,these violations included failure to maintain records of the daily magazine transactions for explosives for approximately a period in violation of.on december,atf and pacitto met to discuss these violations,and atf instructed pacitto on the requirements for compliance with federal explosives law 
on july,atf conducted a safety inspection of vineland,and it cited vineland for two violations trucks with explosives without a variance and improperly storing fireworks.on july,atf again conducted a safety inspection of vineland,and it cited vineland for three violations trucks with explosives without a variance improperly storing fireworks and high explosive bulk salutes and failing to keep proper records of fireworks and salutes.pacitto signed the violations report,and on august,she met with atf to discuss the violations in a warning conference.subsequently,atf sent pacitto a letter,stating you are reminded that future violations,repeat or otherwise,could be viewed as willful and may result in the revocation of your license.
on october,atf again conducted a safety inspection of vineland.the atf inspectors found a number of violations,and on august,the director of industry operations dio for the philadelphia field division of atf issued a notice of revocation of vineland license to manufacture explosives pursuant to d.the dio also issued a notice denying vineland application for a renewal of its license to import fireworks pursuant to b.
on july,atf inspectors conducted a safety inspection of vineland facility in puerto rico and found a number of additional violations.on december,the dio amended the notices to include these additional violations.the amended notices set forth thirteen violations,each of which charged that vineland had willfully failed to comply with federal laws and atf regulations.we summarize the charged violations as follows 
willful failure to properly store explosive materials in violation of j and,d,and.vineland stored pounds of deteriorated stars in a trailer that also contained deteriorated chemicals,and the trailer was not an approved type magazine.
willful failure to properly store explosive materials in violation of j and and.vineland had three magazines within feet of the trailer in count and less than feet from a road.
willful failure to properly store explosive materials in violation of j and,and.on october,vineland did not have adequate locks,hoods,and hinges on its storage containers.
willful failure to properly maintain records in violation of f and.between july,and october,vineland did not state the method it used to count explosive materials on ten occasions in its daily summary of magazine transactions.
willful failure to properly maintain records in violation of f and.on six occasions between july,and october,vineland failed to enter the manufacturer name or brand name of explosive materials,the total quantity of materials received in and removed from each magazine during the day,and the total remaining quantity at the end of the day in its daily summary of magazine transactions.
willful failure to properly maintain records in violation of f and.on thirty occasions between january and august,vineland committed the same violation as in count.
willful failure to properly maintain records in violation of f and a.between july,and october,vineland did not properly mark cannon shots with the correct name and location of the manufacturer.
willful failure to properly maintain records in violation of f and b.between july,and october,vineland did not enter the proper records regarding the cannon shots mentioned in count.
willful failure to properly store explosive materials in violation of j and f.between july,and july,vineland did not notify the local fire safety officials of the location and other information of the explosive materials at its facility in puerto rico 
willful failure to properly maintain records in violation of f and.between january,and january,vineland did not enter a separate record stating the dates of distribution of explosive materials on two occasions at its facility in puerto rico.
willful failure to properly store explosive materials in violation of j and.between july,and july,vineland did not keep the area surrounding a magazine clear of brush and grass at its facility in puerto rico.
willful failure to post license in violation of g and.on july,vineland did not have its license posted at its facility in puerto rico.
vineland requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.the central question of the hearing was whether vineland violations were willful.for an entity to import,manufacture,or deal in explosive materials,it must have a license.see.however,an entity that has willfully violated any of the provisions of this chapter et or regulations issued hereunder can not obtain a license.id.b.if a licensee has violated any provision,including those provisions governing the way in which a licensee obtains its original license,atf may revoke its license or deny the renewal application for its license.see id.a each license or permit shall be renewable upon the same conditions and subject to the same restrictions as the original license or permit.id.d the attorney general may revoke any license or permit issued under this section if in the opinion of the attorney general the holder thereof has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation prescribed by the attorney general under this chapter.thus,atf may deny the renewal of a license or revoke a license if the licensee has willfully violated the statutory provisions or atf regulations.see id.a,b,d.
on february,and,an alj of the united states environmental protection agency presided over the hearing on these violations.on june,the alj issued a recommended decision,in which he recommended reversing the revocation of the license and the denial of the renewal application for the license,finding that the violations were not willful.
on june,the dio filed a petition for review with the director.on april,the director issued his order,affirming in part and reversing in part the alj recommended decision.the director affirmed the alj decision as to violations,and,finding that vineland did not willfully commit these violations however,the director reversed the alj decision as to the remaining violations,finding that those violations were willful.as a result,he directed that vineland licenses be immediately revoked this timely appeal followed.
we have jurisdiction to review the director decision to revoke an explosives license and deny a renewal application pursuant to e and.we review the director decision,which is the final order revoking vineland license and denying its renewal application.see e we review the decision using the judicial standards of review set forth in.see e.to the extent that this appeal challenges the director interpretation of the statutory provisions atf administers,we utilize principles of chevron deference.see chevron natural res.def.council,d.
vineland argues that the director did not limit his review of the alj decision to a determination of whether it was arbitrary and capricious,and he should have so limited his standard of review pursuant to.we review an agency decision to apply a particular standard of review to determine if it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see also chen accounting office,a board decision that applied the wrong standard of review to the decision of its hearing examiner would be arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.
the administrative procedure act apa,governs the way in which administrative agencies function.it provides that,where an agency reviews an alj decision,the agency has all the powers which it would have in making the initial decision except as it may limit the issues on notice or by rule.b.thus,congress permits the agency to limit its review using its powers,but if it chooses not to do so,it exercises de novo review over the alj decision.see id 
we must determine whether atf issued a regulation that limited the director review of an alj decision because if it did not,the director exercises de novo review over the alj decision as provided in b.atf has promulgated a regulation governing appeals involving the revocation of an explosives license.see section provides that,following the alj initial decision,either party may appeal to the director by filing a petition for review.it further states the petition will set forth facts tending to show a action of an arbitrary nature,b action without reasonable warrant in fact,or c action contrary to law and regulations.id.
we can not conclude that this regulation limits the director standard of review because the regulation instructs the petitioner,not the director.see id.informing the petitioner that t he petition will set forth facts showing these types of actions.the text of the regulation does not limit the director review to the three listed types of errors.see id.moreover,even assuming that it did,it does not include particular standards of review for each error.for example,an action contrary to law and regulations does not provide a standard of review,but is simply a type of error therefore,we can not conclude that atf expressly limited the director standard of review of the alj decision pursuant to b 
vineland argues,however,that we should conclude that atf implicitly limited the director review to an arbitrary and capricious standard because the regulation is so similar to the apa provision governing judicial review of an agency decision.the apa provides 
the reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be 
a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law 
b contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity 
c in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations 
d without observance of procedure required by law 
e unsupported by substantial evidence or 
f unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the facts are subject to trial de novo by the reviewing court.
in comparing the atf regulation with the judicial review standards set forth in,we can not conclude that the atf regulation so closely parallels the judicial review standards that we can infer that atf intended to adopt those standards.first,while expressly provides that a court must use the listed standards of review in reaching its decision,the atf regulation does not instruct the director to consider these three listed types of actions as its standards of review.see.second,the atf regulation does not mirror the language of.although both the atf regulation and contemplate challenges for actions that are arbitrary,unwarranted by the facts,or contrary to law,expressly provides standards of review for each type of action while does not,particularly for actions contrary to law.
had atf intended to limit its standard of review in a way similar to the apa,we believe it would have more closely mirrored the statute in its regulation.for example,in chen,the court of appeals for the district of columbia held that the general accounting office personnel appeals board board limited its standard of review of a decision by a single member of the board.at.it found that the applicable standards under the board regulation mirror ed the judicial review standards under both the apa and the board organic statute,both of which limited judicial review to a substantial evidence standard.id.at.it further found that,in promulgating the regulation,the board stated that it intended for its standard of review to mirror the judicial review standards of.id.as a result,the court concluded it seems clear that the board new regulations give it only appellate review powers and not de novo review authority to reopen and review an individual member decisions.see also id.at.
the atf regulation at issue in the present case is not similar to the one in chen,at.as noted above,the atf regulation,does not require the director to conduct its analysis using those particular standards of review.additionally,it does not mirror the apa standards by stating that the director should review the alj conclusions for substantial evidence.see id.finally,and most importantly,unlike in chen,at,atf did not state that it intended for the director standards of review to be the same as the judicial standards of review.for all of these reasons,we conclude that the circuit decision in chen supports our conclusion that,had atf intended to limit its standard of review,it would have used more particular language to do so.
based on the foregoing,we can not conclude that atf has limited the director standard of review of the alj decision pursuant to b.as a result,b mandate that the agency has all the powers which it would have in making the initial decision remains intact.therefore,to the extent that the director exercised de novo review over the alj decision,it was not an abuse of discretion for him to do so.
vineland argues that the director erred in his interpretation of willful under b.where,as here,congress has implicitly delegated powers to an agency,we must give the agency interpretation deference so long as it is reasonable.see chevron,at.for the following reasons,we conclude that the director interpretation of willful under b is reasonable 
the director interpreted willfulness under b as plain indifference to,or intentional disregard of,a known legal duty.he further stated that a licensee has willfully violated the regulations if,with knowledge of what the regulations require,the dealer repeatedly violates those regulations.however,he rejected the alj interpretation of willfulness to the extent that the alj stated that it required a bad purpose and permitted a justifiable excuse defense.the director stated willfulness does not require proof that vineland acted with the specific purpose to disobey the law.
we must determine whether the director interpretation of what constitutes a willful violation pursuant to b is reasonable,and we conclude that it is.first,the director interpretation is in accord with the legal definition of willful,which is v oluntary and intentional,but not necessarily malicious.black law dictionary ed.black law dictionary further defines willfulness as t he voluntary,intentional violation or disregard of a known legal duty.id.like the director interpretation of willful and willfulness,these definitions require knowledge of the conduct,but they do not require a bad purpose or allow for a justifiable excuse 
furthermore,the director definition is in accord with courts of appeals addressing what constitutes a willful violation in a similar licensing firearms licensing is similar to explosives licensing because atf administers both firearms licensing and explosives licensing,and the statutory provisions governing the revocation of each type of license require that the licensee has willfully violated a statutory provision or a regulation.compare e,with id.b.thus,firearms licensing is analogous to explosives licensing,and it is a useful framework for interpreting the term willful.
the six courts of appeals addressing what constitutes a willful violation of the firearms licensing provisions have agreed on an interpretation,holding that a firearms dealer violation is willful where he knew of his legal obligation and purposefully disregarded or was plainly indifferent to the requirements.lewin blumenthal,cir see also rsm,herbert,cir requiring either deliberate disregard or plain indifference willingham sports,bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms explosives,cir same appalachian res.dev.mccabe,cir same perri dep t of the treasury,cir same stein blumenthal,cir same.a number of these courts of appeals have expressly stated that,in finding willfulness,there is no requirement of bad purpose.see willingham,at appalachian res,at cucchiara sec y of the treasury,cir stein,at lewin,at.instead,these courts merely require violation of the regulations with knowledge of their requirements.see rsm,at willingham,at appalachian res,at cucchiara,at stein,at lewin,at.finally,they have never permitted a justifiable excuse defense.see,rsm,at rejecting the licensee arguments that the violations were not willful,but instead were inadvertent errors due to a high volume of sales.here,the director interpretation of what constitutes a willful violation under b follows the courts of appeals interpretations of what constitutes a willful violation under e,and we conclude that it is reasonable 
vineland suggests that we should require the following circumstantial evidence to support a finding of willfulness a pattern of repeated violations,which includes a more than one violation of the same kind and b temporal proximity between the two violations and specific,ongoing warnings by atf to correct the violation.vineland admits that it does not have case law to support this intuitive definition.however,we must review the director interpretation to determine if it is reasonable,not to determine if a better definition exists.thus,we can not adopt vineland definition.
based on the foregoing,the director interpretation of what constitutes a willful violation of b is reasonable.
the director concluded that a licensee corrective actions have no bearing on a determination of whether the licensee has willfully violated federal explosives laws or regulations.vineland argues that its future compliance is relevant to the willfulness determination.we hold that the director conclusion is reasonable.
the statutory provision requires a determination of whether the licensee willfully violated federal explosives laws or regulations.see b,d.this determination is not based on the future conduct of the licensee,whether it will willfully violate the laws,and it is not based on a combination of the past,present,and future conduct of the licensee,whether the licensee has willfully violated the laws,is continuing to willfully violate the laws,and will willfully violate the laws tomorrow.instead,the inquiry turns on the past conduct of the licensee.see id.based on this statutory language,the director the likelihood that the licensee will correct the violations is not relevant to whether the licensee has willfully violated the reasonable.
additionally,the director conclusion is reasonable because it is again in agreement with other federal courts addressing this argument in the context of firearms licensing.for example,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit has stated that events occurring after the regulations have been violated are not relevant to a determination of whether the violations were willful at the time they occurred.cucchiara,at stating that the licensee correction of its recordkeeping system subsequent to the license revocation is immaterial to the question of willfulness at the time the violations occurred see also salvage auction sec y,dep t of treasury,holding that evidence of corrective actions is irrelevant under the statute because the statute focuses on the willfulness of the violations and the compliance of the firearms dealer before the license was revoked.
vineland arguments do not persuade us that the director conclusion was unreasonable.vineland first argues that requires a finding of the likelihood of future compliance prior to revocation of the license.section discusses the opportunity for compliance that atf must afford its licensees.it provides n o license or permit will be revoked or renewal application denied without first calling to the attention of the licensee or permittee the reasons for the contemplated action and affording him an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with all lawful requirements.however,this regulation expressly excludes cases of willfulness as long as the regional director alleges willfulness in his notice of denial of an application or revocation of a license or permit.id.therefore,where,as here,the notice the licensee received from the dio alleged willfulness,the licensee need not be afforded an opportunity to comply prior to revocation or denial of renewal of a license.
vineland next argues that the director interpretation conflicts with his prior opinion in in the matter of luna tech,pyropak,order of the director,june,luna tech,in which he considered the licensee future compliance.however,to the extent that the director considered the licensee future compliance in luna tech,he did so in analyzing whether the licensee should be permitted an opportunity to comply pursuant to.as noted,does not apply here,and thus,we are not persuaded that the director conclusion was unreasonable in this case.
based on the foregoing,the director conclusion that the potential for future compliance is not relevant to a determination of willfulness is reasonable.
the director concluded that atf failure to cite a violation did not preclude atf from citing the licensee in a subsequent inspection for the same violation unless the licensee demonstrated that atf had affirmatively misled the licensee as to the requirements.vineland challenges this conclusion,arguing that the prior inspection history is relevant to the issue of willfulness.we hold that the director conclusion is reasonable.
the director interpretation of willfulness placed the focus on whether the licensee had the requisite knowledge of the requirements yet failed to comply with them.if the licensee had knowledge of the requirements,whether atf had previously cited the licensee would be irrelevant to a determination of willfulness unless atf had affirmatively told the licensee that it was in compliance.thus,based on the director interpretation of willfulness,this further interpretation is reasonable.
additionally,the director conclusion is reasonable because it is in accord with a district court interpretation of willfulness in the context of firearms licensing.see breit johnson sporting goods,ashcroft,d.in breit,the licensee argued that atf should not be able to revoke its license because atf had not cited it for previous violations.id.at.the court rejected this equitable estoppel argument because the licensee had knowledge of the requirements and could not demonstrate that atf had misled it.id.the director conclusion is in accord with this decision,and thus,it is reasonable 
based on the foregoing,the director conclusion is reasonable.
vineland argues that the director erred in concluding that vineland willfully violated atf regulations in violations,and.we review the director conclusion that vineland willfully violated the atf regulations for substantial evidence using the director reasonable interpretation of what constitutes a willful violation.see e stating that the standard of review for adjudicatory proceedings is whether the decision is unsupported by substantial evidence see also e stating that the court of appeals will review the decision pursuant to.we conclude that substantial evidence supports the director decision that vineland willfully violated f and by failing to keep proper records in its daily summary of magazine transactions as charged in violations and.
in the alj recommended decision,he found that while the charged incidents in violations and had occurred,vineland had not willfully violated f and in failing to keep proper records.the director disagreed with the alj,finding that vineland had willfully violated the applicable law and regulation.the director acknowledged that pacitto bookkeeper,adele huryn,missed work during the relevant months for cancer treatments however,he found that,while huryn illness was unfortunate,it could not negate a finding of willfulness as to pacitto.
the director then applied his interpretation of willfulness,and found that pacitto was aware of the recordkeeping requirements because atf had instructed her as to the requirements in its december meeting.he further stated that,regardless of what felix girone had informed her prior to about a relaxation of recordkeeping during the busy season,pacitto knew that was incorrect after december.he also noted that,despite atf failure to cite previous recordkeeping violations occurring between and,he could find that vineland had been willful in its violations because vineland had knowledge of the proper requirements.he then applied the relevant standard,finding that vineland willfully violated the recordkeeping requirements because pacitto chose to neglect the daily summary of magazine transactions times between january and september despite having knowledge as to the requirements.
the director reasonable interpretation of willfulness is that a licensee has willfully violated the regulations if,with knowledge of what the regulations require,the dealer repeatedly violates those regulations.a great deal of evidence supports the director conclusion that pacitto had knowledge of the recordkeeping requirements under f and.pacitto does not dispute that she was aware of the requirements,and as the director pointed out,pacitto spoke with atf inspectors regarding the requirements of at the december meeting thus,there is evidence in the record that pacitto had knowledge of the requirement.
additionally,the evidence supports the conclusion that pacitto repeatedly violated the regulation.her failure to properly record the transactions was not a event as vineland claims,but instead occurred on occasions.moreover,pacitto failure to comply did not occur during a brief time period,but extended for months with the end result being,as the director noted,that thousands of pounds of explosives left vineland facility without any record being kept.while we agree with the director that huryn illness was clearly unfortunate and requires much sympathy,her illness did not provide pacitto carte blanche to stop complying with the regulation requiring her to keep a record of the daily summary of magazine transactions.
based on the foregoing,substantial evidence supports the director conclusion that pacitto had knowledge of the recordkeeping requirements,and yet did not comply with them times over a period therefore,substantial evidence supports the director ultimate conclusion that vineland willfully violated f and.
at oral argument,vineland conceded that,were we to find that substantial evidence supported even one of the director conclusions that vineland had willfully violated federal law and atf regulations,the director decision to revoke its license and deny its renewal would be proper.therefore,because we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the director conclusion as to violations and,we find it unnecessary to reach a conclusion as to the remaining violations.
for the foregoing reasons,we will deny the petition for review of the director order.
i agree with the majority that the atf was not required to give deference to the alj factual findings and legal conclusions.i also agree that substantial evidence supports the atf finding that vineland willfully violated certain statutory and regulatory requirements and that its petition for review should therefore be denied i take issue,however,with the majority assertion that we owe chevron deference to the atf interpretation of the term willfully as it appears in b.
section b of title states that,upon the filing of an application for a license to manufacture or deal in explosives,the attorney general shall issue the appropriate license if,among other things,the applicant has not willfully violated any of the provisions of through or regulations issued t hereunder.b.as explained by the majority,the atf concluded that proof that vineland acted with knowledge that its conduct was it distributed fireworks without maintaining the daily records that it knew were required by sufficient to establish willfulness within the meaning of b.the majority then holds that the atf interpretation of the term willfully is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d.however,i see no need to invoke chevron on that point.since it appears that we would independently arrive at the atf position on willfulness,there is no occasion to defer and no point in asking what kind of deference,or how much.edelman lynchburg,d.
moreover,chevron instructs us to give deference to an agency reasonable policy choice when congress gave the agency the authority to make such a choice.here,the atf did not even purport to be doing that.there is nothing in the atf decision that suggests that its interpretation of willfully was the result of its independent determination that its construction was desirable to further some policy goal.instead,the atf relied entirely on decisions of the various courts of appeals interpreting that term in the firearms and explosives licensing contexts,and it concluded from those decisions that the alj had applied the incorrect standard.app.in other words,the agency accurately saw itself as applying a general legal standard,not making a decision within its peculiar administrative ken.colacicco apotex,cir noting that we are ordinarily leery of an agency view of what is essentially a legal issue blackburn reich,cir because the secretary based his decision in the instant case on judicial precedent rather than his own interpretation of the statute,we owe no more deference than we would any lower court analysis of the law.quoting thomas hodgson sons,ferc,cir.indeed,nowhere in its briefing did the agency ask for chevron deference,as one might have expected it would had it believed it necessary.
for these reasons,i do not believe the majority chevron analysis is required in this case,and i decline to join it.
a responsible person is a n individual who has the power to direct the management and policies of the applicant pertaining to explosive materials.
neither the administrative law judge,nor the director,attributed the july violations to vineland.
atf inspectors visited vineland in october and december,but did not issue citations.atf and vineland argue as to whether these inspections were full inspections of vineland premises,but this dispute is irrelevant to our resolution of this appeal.
atf dismissed violation.
atf does not appeal the director decision with respect to those violations.
on june,this court granted an emergency motion staying the revocation of vineland license pending review of the director order.
the alj decision is the final decision only if the director affirms the decision.see.
in pertinent part,the statute provides when the presiding employee makes an initial decision,that
