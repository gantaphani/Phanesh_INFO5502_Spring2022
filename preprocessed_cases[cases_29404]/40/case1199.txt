opinion of the court 
we review here two orders by the district court of new jersey.in the first,the district court granted telkom sa motion to dismiss telcordia technologies petition to confirm a partial arbitral award.specifically,the district court dismissed telcordia petition with prejudice because of issue preclusion or estoppel resulting from a previous decision by the circuit court of appeals dismissing a similar petition by telcordia without prejudice.in the alternative,but still in the first order,the district court dismissed the petition without prejudice because the court chose to exercise its discretion not to enforce the award at this time.
in the second order,the district court dismissed the petition for lack of personal jurisdiction over telkom and denied telcordia request for jurisdictional discovery.for the reasons that follow,we find that the district court does have personal jurisdiction over telkom.furthermore,we find that considerations of comity and the proper interpretation of the new york convention dictate that the petition be dismissed without prejudice.
background 
telcordia,with a principal place of business in piscataway,new jersey,entered into a multimillion dollar contract with telkom,a south african telecommunications company that was formerly the telephone monopoly pursuant to the agreement,telkom was to pay telcordia more than million for customized telecommunications software.unfortunately,the performance of the contract was racked with disputes,mainly with respect to whether the software complied with certain contractual specifications 
pursuant to the parties contract,the two companies entered into binding arbitration in south africa according to the rules of the international chamber of commerce icc.the arbitrator was anthony boswood,qc,of fountain court temple,london,england.during the proceedings,telkom sought intervention from the south african high court to correct alleged errors in the arbitration specifically,telkom concluded that the arbitrator was viewing issues from the perspective of english law,instead of south african law,as required by the parties agreement.before the high court could act,on september,the arbitrator held that telkom was liable to telcordia for breach of contract.on september,the icc international court of arbitration formally issued its final award in favor of telcordia and directed the parties to give it effect.
shortly thereafter,telcordia petitioned the united states district court for the district of columbia to confirm the arbitral award pursuant to the new york convention contemporaneously,telkom had filed a separate action in the south african high court to have the award set aside or annulled pursuant to section of the south african arbitration act.article iii of the new york convention provides that each state party shall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon.the setting aside or annulment of the arbitral award by the south african court would be grounds for other courts to refuse recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award pursuant to article v of the new york convention.specifically,article v e provides that 
recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused,at the request of the party against whom it is invoked,only if that party furnishes to the competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought,proof that 
e the award has not yet become binding on the parties,or has been set aside or 
suspended by a competent authority of the country in which,or under the law of which,that award was made.
in july,the district court dismissed the case without prejudice on the grounds that it lacked personal jurisdiction over telkom and,alternatively,that the case could not proceed under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.telcordia appealed to the court of appeals for the circuit.that court affirmed on the alternative ground that under article vi of the new york convention the district court should have adjourned its proceeding and awaited the outcome of the pending action in south africa article vi provides a mechanism by which courts asked to enforce an arbitral award can adjourn to await the type of proceeding in the situs jurisdiction referenced in article v e.accordingly,the circuit dismissed the petition without prejudice.
on november,and while the case was on appeal in the circuit,the south african high court issued a decision setting aside the award and ordering a new arbitration.on november,the supreme court of appeal of south africa agreed to hear telcordia appeal from the trial court annulment of the award.this appeal is currently pending.
undeterred,telcordia brought a petition to enforce the arbitral award in the district of new jersey.the district court dismissed the petition with prejudice based on estoppel the circuit decision and,alternatively and cryptically,dismissed without prejudice pursuant to the new york convention.in a second order,the district court dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction over telkom.telcordia timely appealed both orders to this court.
ii.subject matter jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to because telcordia sought confirmation of an arbitral award under the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards the new york convention,et.this court has appellate jurisdiction over the two final orders under.

the standard of review of a district court decision to defer to foreign annulment proceedings under article vi of the new york convention is one of first impression for this circuit.we agree with the second circuit that in light of the permissive language of article vi of the convention and a district court general discretion in managing its own caseload and suspense docket,the proper standard for reviewing a district court decision whether to adjourn is for abuse of discretion.europcar italia maiellano tours,cir internal citations omitted.

the district court of new jersey may assert personal jurisdiction over telkom to the extent provided under new jersey law.see carteret,at quoting provident bank california fed.sav.loan ass n,cir.new jersey statute provides for jurisdiction up to the limits of the protection afforded to nonresidents by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.charles gendler,telecom equip.pursuant to the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,in personam jurisdiction may be asserted over a nonresident so long as the defendant has certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe washington.quotation omitted.
