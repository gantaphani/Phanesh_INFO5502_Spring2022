in,respondent the city of chicago gave a written examination to applicants seeking firefighter positions.in january,the city announced it would draw candidates randomly from a list of applicants who scored at least out of points on the examination,whom it designated as well qualified.it informed those who scored below that they had failed and would not be considered further.it informed applicants who scored between and,whom it designated as qualified,that it was unlikely they would be called for further processing but that the city would keep them on the eligibility list for as long as that list was used.that may,the city selected its first class of applicants to advance,and it repeated this process multiple times over the next six years.beginning in march,several applicants who scored in the qualified range but had not been hired filed discrimination charges with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and received letters.they then filed suit,alleging as relevant here that the city practice of selecting only applicants who scored or above had a disparate impact on in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,see k a i.the district court certified a class petitioners here of who scored in the qualified range but were not hired.the court denied the city summary judgment motion,rejecting its claim that petitioners had failed to file eeoc charges within days after the unlawful employment practice occurred,e,and finding instead that the city ongoing reliance on the test results constituted a continuing title vii violation.the litigation then proceeded,and petitioners prevailed on the merits.the seventh circuit reversed the judgment in their favor,holding that the suit was untimely because the earliest eeoc charge was filed more than days after the only discriminatory act sorting the scores into the well qualified,qualified,and not qualified categories.the later hiring decisions,the seventh circuit held,were an automatic consequence of the test scores,not new discriminatory acts.
held a plaintiff who does not file a timely charge challenging the adoption of a practice may assert a claim in a timely charge challenging the employer later application of that practice as long as he alleges each of the elements of a claim.
a determining whether petitioners charges were timely requires identify ing precisely the unlawful employment practice of which they complain.delaware state college ricks.with the exception of the first selection round,all agree that the challenged practice here the city selection of firefighter hires on the basis announced in occurred within the charging period.thus,the question is not whether a claim predicated on that conduct is timely,but whether the practice thus defined can be the basis for a claim at all.it can.a title vii plaintiff establishes a prima facie claim by showing that the employer uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on one of the prohibited bases.k.the term employment practice clearly encompasses the conduct at issue exclusion of passing applicants who scored below when selecting those who would advance.the city use d that practice each time it filled a new class of firefighters,and petitioners allege that doing so caused a disparate impact.it is irrelevant that subsection k does not address accrual of claims,since the issue here is not when the claims accrued but whether the claims stated a violation.they did.whether petitioners proved a violation is not before the court.
b the city argues that the only actionable discrimination occurred in when it used the test results to create the hiring list,which it concedes was unlawful.it may be true that the city adoption in of the cutoff score gave rise to a freestanding claim.if so,because no timely charge was filed,the city is now entitled to treat that past act as lawful,united air lines,evans.but it does not follow that no new violation occurred and no new claims could arise when the city later implemented the decision.evans and later cases the city cites establish only that a title vii plaintiff must show a present violation within the limitations period.for claims which require discriminatory intent the plaintiff must demonstrate deliberate discrimination within the limitations period.but no such demonstration is needed for claims,such as this one,that do not require discriminatory intent,ledbetter goodyear tire rubber.contrary to the seventh circuit reasoning,even if both types of claims take aim at prohibited discrimination,it does not follow that their reach is coextensive.
c the city and its amici warn that this reading will result in a host of practical problems for employers and employees alike.the court,however,must give effect to the law congress enacted,not assess the consequences of each approach and adopt the one that produces the least mischief.
d it is left to the seventh circuit to determine whether the judgment must be modified to the extent that the district court awarded relief based on the first round of hiring,which occurred outside the charging period even for the earliest eeoc charge.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
title vii of the civil rights act of prohibits employers from using employment practices that cause a disparate impact on the basis of race among other bases.k a i.it also requires plaintiffs,before beginning a federal lawsuit,to file a timely charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.e.we consider whether a plaintiff who does not file a timely charge challenging the adoption of a practice here,an employer decision to exclude employment applicants who did not achieve a certain score on an examination may assert a claim in a timely charge challenging the employer later application of that practice.
in july,the city of chicago administered a written examination to over applicants seeking to serve in the chicago fire department.after scoring the examinations,the city reported the results.it announced in a january,press release that it would begin drawing randomly from the top tier of scorers,those who scored or above out of,whom the city called well qualified.those drawn from this group would proceed to the next phase a test,background check,medical examination,and drug test and if they cleared those hurdles would be hired as candidate firefighters.those who scored below,on the other hand,learned by letters sent the same day that they had failed the test.each was told he had not achieved a passing score,would no longer be considered for a firefighter position,and would not be contacted again about the examination.
the applicants those who scored between and,whom the city called qualified were notified that they had passed the examination but that,based on the city projected hiring needs and the number of applicants,it was not likely they would be called for further processing.the individual notices added,however,that because it was not possible to predict how many applicants would be hired in the next few years,each qualified applicant name would be kept on the eligibility list maintained by the department of personnel for as long as that list was used.eleven days later,the city officially adopted an eligible list reflecting the breakdown described above.
on may,the city selected its first class of applicants to advance to the next stage.it selected a second on october,and repeated the process nine more times over the next six years.as it had announced,in each round the city drew randomly from among those who scored in the range on the test.in the last round it exhausted that pool,so it filled the remaining slots with qualified candidates instead.
on march,crawford smith,an applicant who scored in the qualified range and had not been hired as a candidate firefighter,filed a charge of discrimination with the eeoc.five others followed suit,and on july,the eeoc issued all six of them letters.two months later,they filed
