opinion of the court 
this matter comes on before this court on an appeal by the plaintiffs,the estate of robert smith,pauline smith,dana smith,and wanda smith,to whom we refer collectively as the smiths,from the district court order entered january,granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants,specifically named and john doe employees of the pennsylvania state police.the smiths also appeal from the district court orders of september,october,november,and november,to the extent that they denied their requests to take additional depositions and to extend the time for discovery.for the reasons stated herein,we will affirm in part and reverse in part the district court order granting summary judgment and will affirm its discovery orders without prejudice to the smiths seeking to reopen discovery on the remand we are ordering.
background 
decedent robert smith,a former police officer and vietnam veteran,suffered from various medical problems,including stress disorder ptsd and coronary heart disease.several members of the state police were familiar with smith,largely as a result of ongoing problems between smith and his neighbor,michael shafer.prior to the events giving rise to this litigation members of troop l of the state police had investigated a number of complaints shafer and smith had lodged against each other.smith also had complained numerous times about the conduct of troop l members,and the state police at one point had charged smith with making false reports to law enforcement and harassment.the smiths allege that through these contacts the state police came to know that smith was in fragile physical and mental health,had a major heart condition,had undergone knee replacement surgery,suffered from hypertension,recently had been hospitalized,and was required to be free from stressful situations and to take medication.several troopers stated in their depositions,and police event logs confirm,that certain troopers were aware that smith suffered from ptsd and experienced flashbacks.
the events directly resulting in this litigation started on july,when,in response to a complaint by shafer,troopers james marasco and nicholas scianna of troop l went to smith residence at approximately marasco responded to shafer complaint even though smith residence was outside his assigned geographic patrol area.the troopers did not have an arrest warrant or a search warrant.in an attempt to contact smith,they repeatedly knocked on his door,but he did not respond.they then called the barracks and spoke to corporal mervin rodriguez who advised them to have the residence telephoned and to leave if there was no answer.the call was made but was not answered.marasco and scianna,however,did not leave,but instead went to the back of the house searching for smith 
scianna testified that while in the back of the house he observed a small red light in a window and thought that smith might be videotaping the officers.marasco testified that he saw the light on scianna body,and written reports state that the troopers believed that smith was directing a firearm at scianna the smiths dispute this account,noting that the troopers never saw a firearm.moreover,the smiths point to contradictory statements concerning where on scianna body they allegedly saw the red light,the location of the officers when they first saw the light,and whether the light was emanating from smith or shafer home.in any event,the officers retreated and called for assistance.rodriguez and trooper thomas rodriguez responded and unsuccessfully attempted to communicate with smith over a police vehicle public address system and by telephone.rodriguez then called state police lieutenant fetterolf to request assistance from the state police special emergency response team sert.fetterolf agreed and contacted corporal hall of sert,who,with captain torkar,activated sert.
fetterolf testified that at the time he agreed to activate sert,he considered the scenario to be a barricaded gunman situation.he also testified,however,that the circumstances did not lead him to believe that a gun might be involved,or even that someone was barricaded in smith home.hall testified that sert should not have been activated unless officers had prepared or were in the process of preparing a warrant,or if there were exigent circumstances.nevertheless the state police activated sert before they made the decision to obtain a warrant even though,in hall opinion,exigent circumstances did not exist.
before sert arrived,several officers began to establish a perimeter around smith residence.rodriguez testified that at some point he and rodriguez saw an individual they believed to be smith walk from the residence to a shed in the backyard.the individual did not respond to their calls and they did not identify him positively as smith.
sert responded with a negotiation team and a tactical team.it appears that at least sert members wearing riot gear and camouflage and armed with various weapons were present.sharpshooters targeted firearms at the house,a helicopter hovered overhead,and the state police would not allow anyone,even family members,to come or go to the premises without police permission.sert unsuccessfully attempted to contact smith by telephone and over the pa system.smith,however,did contact his daughter dana on the telephone,telling her that there were state troopers outside his house.dana later advised the state police personal communications officer pco of this call.
in the early morning of july,trooper weaver,the criminal investigator,filed criminal charges of aggravated assault,simple assault,and recklessly endangering a person against smith and obtained a warrant for his arrest.moreover,trooper andrew wenger obtained a search warrant for smith premises.according to the smiths,sert rejected offers from family,friends,and neighbors to attempt to communicate with smith and prevented chris zwicky,a neighbor familiar with the woods near smith house,from searching for smith.they also chose not to record a message from anyone close to smith,despite having technology to do so,and decided not to utilize dana smith as a mediator,despite her having received a call from smith asking her to do so.finally,sert rejected the use of a psychologist.
sert then entered and cleared the house and the shed in the backyard using rocks,tear gas,and flash bang distraction devices.nevertheless the police did not find anyone in either structure.they did,however,recover eight weapons including handguns with scopes,though none had a laser sight.the officers also found a video cassette and a camcorder,which they seized after obtaining a warrant,as well as smith wallet,identification,cash,credit cards,keys,false teeth and medication he was required to take by reason of recently having had triple bypass surgery.after learning that smith had a hunting hideout in the woods,sert searched the wooded area adjacent to smith residence with zwicky aid having failed to locate smith,the officers called off the search and,around midday on july,left the scene.
on july,the complaint against smith was withdrawn.that same day,smith brother filed a missing persons report because smith had not returned home.the parties dispute the nature of the search effort over the next days.the defendants presented records indicating that marasco and corporal elser conducted a foot search for smith on july,that corporal schell conducted an aerial search in a state police helicopter and interviewed neighbors that wenger inquired into smith cell phone records to determine if the phone had been used that,on july,elser contacted the lebanon veterans administration hospital in an effort to locate smith and that,on july,members of the state police searched the wooded area behind the smith residence,describing that area as impenetrable,though they eventually found smith cell phone.
on the other hand,the smiths proffer evidence indicating that the police did not treat smith like an armed fugitive or missing person by,for example,conducting a inquiry or a sustained search,trying to contact family or friends,or checking with local hospitals or commercial establishments.they also proffer expert testimony suggesting that the officers conduct in the days following the incident,as well as during the incident itself,fell below accepted standards of police practice.they note that,according to police records,the july,search lasted only minutes and extended only to feet into the woods,that the police failed to use any maps,diagrams,photos,or compass during their july,search,and that the police rejected requests by family and friends to use available search dogs.
the smiths also suggest that police actually located smith cell phone earlier than july,pointing to smith brother testimony to the effect that weaver mentioned finding the phone on july.they assert that the police hid this discovery,as well as the discovery of smith body at some point prior to july.they proffer evidence suggesting that police on july,were in the part of the woods where smith body later was found that the police helicopter,which was equipped with heat sensors designed to locate bodies,hovered above this spot for an extended period of time that police were searching that location at the same time smith cell phone received an incoming call and that clippings of brush cut back by police were found within ten to yards of smith body.furthermore,they submit that if the police did not recover the phone until july,there is no way they could have failed to smell the odor of smith decomposing corpse,which later was found only ten to yards from the place where they recovered the phone.id.forensic pathologist sanford edberg stated in his report that a person should have been able to notice the smell and the buzz of flies within one day from a distance of ten to yards.
on july,smith friend,alan achey,found smith severely decomposed body in a wooded area approximately yards from smith home.edberg estimated that smith died sometime between and on july,and concluded that,given smith medical condition,the stress of the incident probably led to a fatal heart attack.
the smiths brought this action in the district court pursuant to,alleging that the defendants violated smith rights under the first,fourth,and fourteenth amendments.the smiths also included wrongful death,survival and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims under state law.after extensive discovery proceedings,the defendants moved for summary judgment on july,both on the merits and on the basis of qualified immunity.on september,the district court granted the smiths motion to extend discovery pursuant to.f,but on october,the district court denied the smiths appeal from an order of the magistrate judge denying their request to take more than ten depositions,a limitation the magistrate judge earlier had imposed.on november,the district court denied the smiths renewed motion to take additional depositions and for an extension of time for discovery and then,on november,denied the smiths renewed rule f motion.on january,the district court again denied the smiths renewed motions to take additional depositions and to extend discovery,granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on all section claims on the merits mentioning,but not predicating its decision on,the qualified immunity arguments.the court dismissed the state law claims without prejudice.this appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and in that the complaint alleged federal civil rights claims under and supplemental state law claims.on january,the district court entered final judgment in the case,and on february,the smiths timely filed their notice of appeal.we therefore have jurisdiction pursuant to.
standard of review 
we exercise de novo review of the district court grant of summary judgment.see kneipp tedder,cir.we review questions concerning the scope of discovery for abuse of discretion.see brumfield sanders,cir.
iii.discussion 
summary judgment order 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress 
notwithstanding its broad language section does not create substantive rights rather it merely provides a remedy for deprivations of rights established elsewhere in the constitution or federal laws.kneipp,at.thus,the initial question in a section action is whether the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all.donahue gavin,cir quoting county of sacramento lewis,d 
the smiths alleged that the defendants violated smith rights to substantive due process under the fourteenth amendment both under the danger doctrine and by engaging in a.they further alleged that the defendants violated smith rights to be free from the use of excessive force,unreasonable searches and seizures,and malicious prosecution under the fourth amendment.finally,the smiths alleged that the defendants violated smith rights under the first amendment by retaliating against him for complaints he had made concerning prior contacts with the state police officers.in a comprehensive opinion the district court found that,as a matter of law,the smiths could not show that smith had suffered any deprivation of a constitutional right and thus the court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants.
substantive due process claims 
the smiths advance two substantive due process theories danger and and mishandling of smith corpse.
danger doctrine 
in kneipp tedder,we recognized the danger theory of section liability,holding that a plaintiff must prove four elements the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct the state actor acted in willful disregard for the safety of the plaintiff there existed some relationship between the state and the plaintiff and the state actors used their authority to create an opportunity that otherwise would not have existed for the third party crime to occur.kneipp,at citing mark borough of hatboro,cir.the fourth element reference to a third party crime arises from the doctrine origin as an exception to the general rule that the state does not have a general affirmative obligation to protect its citizens from the violent acts of private individuals.see kneipp,at.the courts,however,have not limited the doctrine to cases where third parties caused the harm as kneipp itself demonstrates.in that case,a police officer stopped a visibly intoxicated husband and wife,joseph and samantha kneipp,for allegedly causing a disturbance.kneipp,at.when the officer allowed joseph to go home to relieve the babysitter watching his son,joseph assumed that the police would take samantha,whose blood alcohol level later was estimated at,either to the hospital or to the police station.id.at.the officer,however,eventually sent samantha home alone,and she was found later that night unconscious at the bottom of an embankment next to a parking lot across the street from the kneipps home.id.as a result of her exposure to the cold,she suffered hypothermia,which caused a condition known as anoxia,which in turn resulted in permanent brain damage impairing many basic body functions.id.the kneipps instituted a district court action against the police officers who obtained a summary judgment.the kneipps appealed and we reversed and remanded the case for trial.id.at.
although kneipp provides the framework for evaluating a danger claim,recent cases have refined certain elements of the test we set forth above.first,in county of sacramento lewis,the supreme court held that an officer deliberate indifference or reckless disregard alone would not lead to liability for violating substantive due process rights in a pursuit case liability attaches only to conduct that shocks the conscience.at.at.in miller city of philadelphia,building on county of sacramento lewis and other supreme court cases,we suggested that the shocks the conscience standard was applicable to all substantive due process cases.miller,cir.second,in morse lower merion school district,we refined the third and fourth prongs of the danger test.morse,cir.in morse we held that the third relationship between the state and the depends on whether the plaintiff was a foreseeable victim,either individually or as part of a discrete class of foreseeable victims.id.at.furthermore,we clarified that,with respect to the fourth the opportunity for harm the dispositive factor appears to be whether the state has in some way placed the plaintiff in a dangerous position that was foreseeable,and not whether the act was more appropriately characterized as an affirmative act or an omission.id.at.
here,analyzing the first and fairly direct district court concluded that the officers,even with knowledge of smith poor health,as a matter of law could not have foreseen that he would flee from the house and as a consequence suffer a heart attack in the woods.app.at.but we believe that this conclusion ignores evidence that,if believed,could lead a jury to conclude that smith suffered foreseeable harm.to start with,the official incident report states that it was the officers purpose to make smith appear,and once officers believed they had seen smith moving from the house to the shed,marasco and rodriguez moved into a position to block smith return to the residence if attempted.id.at.moreover,as noted above,at least some of the officers on the scene were aware of smith mental and physical condition,including his tendency to have flashbacks to his service in vietnam under stressful situations,and,once the search of the residence was conducted,at least some officers were aware that smith had fled without his necessary medication.in this regard the smiths pathology expert stated that a person such as smith,suffering from post traumatic stress disorder would have been greatly alarmed by the arrival of police with a helicopter and the assault on his residence with bright lights,breaking windows with rocks,flash bang distraction devices and tear gas,all of which caused him to flee the house and hide in the woods where the stress of these actions caused a fatal heart attack.id.at.the smiths also proffer the expert testimony of mccauley,a police practices expert,who opined that a reasonably trained police officer would have reasonably concluded that injury or death to smith was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of smith mental and medical conditions,especially knowing he was without his medication.id.at.
when we consider this evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the smiths favor,we conclude that the district court erred in determining that a jury could not find that smith harm was foreseeable.as in kneipp,a jury could find that t he affirmative acts of the police officers here created a dangerous situation,requiring that they take additional measures to ensure the plaintiff safety,especially where police intervened to cut off the plaintiff private source of protection.kneipp,at.
this case is not like morse,in which a daycare operator was not liable for leaving the rear entrance of a school open,thereby allowing an individual with a history of mental illness to enter and kill a teacher.in morse,we held that harm to the teacher was not foreseeable,largely because the defendants were unaware that any mentally deranged person might be waiting outside the building.morse,at.we realize that the number of officers aware of smith mental and physical condition and failure to bring proper medication when he fled is unclear.nevertheless,the smiths have presented sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find that at least some of the officers were aware of smith condition and should have foreseen that he might flee and suffer adverse medical consequences when sert was activated.
with respect to the second element in a danger district court found that neither the decision to confront an individual suffering from ptsd with officers dressed in fatigues,a helicopter,and weapons nor the officers alleged failure to conduct a fully thorough search shocked the conscience.app.at.the district court failed to recognize,however,that,as we noted in miller,the precise degree of wrongfulness required to reach the level depends on the circumstances of a particular case.miller,at.as we indicated in united artists theatre circuit,township of warrington,cir,since county of sacramento lewis,our cases have repeatedly acknowledged that the meaning of the shocks the conscience standard varies depending on the factual context.brown commonwealth of.dep t of health,cir shocks the conscience standard applies to the actions of emergency medical personnel.for example,in the custodial situation of a prison,where forethought about an inmate welfare is possible,deliberate indifference to a prisoner medical needs may be sufficiently shocking,while a much higher fault standard is proper when a government official is acting instantaneously and making pressured decisions without the ability to fully consider the risks.miller,at.
in cases involving a hyperpressurized environment,such as a prison riot or a chase,liability normally will attach only where a purpose to cause harm is demonstrated.id.in miller itself,we held that a social worker acting to separate a parent and child was operating in an environment somewhere between the prison chase scenario and the custodial situation,and that conduct could be established by a showing of more than negligence or deliberate indifference,but less than a purpose to cause harm.id.the plaintiffs in that case therefore had to show a level of gross negligence or arbitrariness that indeed shocks the conscience.id.at.
in this case,the officers were confronted with what fetterolf described as a barricaded gunman situation.this case,however,did not involve the hyperpressurized environment of an prison riot or a chase.see miller,at.indeed,the official incident report shows that at least one hour passed between the time marasco and scianna approached smith residence and the time fetterolf authorized a request to activate sert.during that time no shots were fired and the officers did not see a firearm brandished.moreover,at least after the police arrived at the smith residence,the police had no reason to be concerned about the safety of third parties.thus,this case does not involve a hyperpressurized environment such that the smiths to recover would have to demonstrate that the defendants had an actual purpose to cause harm.
at the same time,however,this case is not one in which the police had the luxury of proceeding in a deliberate fashion,as prison medical officials can.miller,at.because the urgency and timing involved in this case is more like the situation in miller,the smiths here must demonstrate a level of gross negligence or arbitrariness that indeed shocks the conscience.id.at.we think based on our reading of the precedents in this elusive area of the law that,except in those cases involving either true decisions or,on the other end of the spectrum,those in which officials have the luxury of relaxed deliberation,an official conduct may create danger liability if it exhibits a level of gross negligence or arbitrariness that shocks the conscience.
the smiths have produced sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the officers conduct both with regard to activating sert and with regard to searching of the woods shocked the conscience.in addition to the evidence already discussed,the smiths proffer the expert opinion of mccauley,who suggests that the officers conduct fell significantly below accepted professional standards for dealing with emotionally disturbed persons,stating in particular that h ad the officers acted in accordance with accepted police training and practices in dealing with emotionally disturbed persons,it is more likely than not that the suffered by smith would have been avoided,and that police inappropriately assumed a rigid enforcement role,which aggravated and escalated the tenor of the situation.at.
furthermore,the smiths have amassed evidence calling into question the adequacy of the search efforts and the motives behind the numerous decisions that cut smith off from private sources of potential aid.although it is true that the officers in this case,unlike the officer in kneipp,did not,as the district court noted,completely abandon the situation or totally cut off all outside help,we are unwilling to adopt the position that their efforts to mitigate a danger that they allegedly created necessarily insulate them from liability.if the smiths can prove that the officers efforts were so minimal as to constitute gross negligence or arbitrariness that shocks the conscience,then the second prong of the kneipp test will be met.in this case,the district court should not have determined as a matter of law that the officers efforts were adequate where questions of fact remain as to what they could have and should have done to confront a known emotionally disturbed person and to conduct a proper search for that person after he was flushed from his home.
it appears to be undisputed that the third prong of the kneipp state created danger relationship between the plaintiff and the been met here.in any event,as in kneipp,the defendants here,exercising their powers as police officer s exerted sufficient control over smith to meet the relationship requirement.see kneipp,at.
to meet the fourth prong of the test the smiths must demonstrate that the officers used their authority to create an opportunity that otherwise would not have existed for harm to befall smith.see kneipp,at.a reasonable jury could conclude that the decisions to activate sert against someone in smith physical and mental condition,flush smith from his home,confine him to the densely wooded area,block his route of return,reject the use of search dogs,not allow family or friends to communicate with him over the pa system,and search only a short distance into the woods after observing that smith was without his wallet,identification,cash,credit cards,keys,and medication,among other actions,created just such an opportunity as in kneipp,it is conceivable that,but for the intervention of the police,which arguably put the victim there in a worse position and increased her risk of danger,smith would have returned home on his own or with the encouragement of his family or friends.id.at.
the district court found that this element could not be proven because the officers employed legitimate tactics.app.at.this conclusion both usurps the role of the jury as the smiths have presented substantial evidence calling into question the officers motives and tactics and misapplies the fourth prong of the kneipp test,which asks only whether,but for the defendants actions,the plaintiff would have been in a less harmful position.evidence of the legitimacy of the tactics used by the troopers may be relevant to the shocks the conscience prong,but it says little about whether such tactics increased the risk to smith.the smiths have produced sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find that the troopers placed smith in a foreseeably dangerous position.
inasmuch as we have concluded that a reasonable jury could find that there was a constitutional violation in this case,we turn to the question of whether the defendants knew or should have known that their actions were clearly unlawful as they advanced a qualified immunity defense in the district court and do so on this appeal.officials are entitled to immunity unless the law clearly proscribed the actions they took.mitchell forsyth,d.g overnment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.
in considering the qualified immunity defense we first observe that we delineated the elements of a danger claim in mark borough of hatboro,at,and more clearly adopted the theory and defined its contours the following year in kneipp.thus,the right at issue in this case was clearly established at the time the incident occurred.a plaintiff,however,must show more to survive a motion for summary judgment predicated on a qualified immunity defense.the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson creighton,d.moreover,in a case the district court should analyze the specific conduct of each defendant with respect to the constitutional right at issue.grant city of pittsburgh,cir emphasis in original.
inasmuch as the district court did not reach the qualified immunity question,and in recognition that the record is unclear as to the relationship between each defendant specific conduct and the rights at issue,we find it appropriate to remand the qualified immunity issue to allow the district court to make the necessary factual determinations with respect to qualified immunity in the first instance.see id.at c rucial to the resolution of any assertion of qualified immunity is a careful examination of the record preferably by the district court to establish,for purposes of summary judgment,a detailed factual description of the actions of each individual defendant viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff we think that the district court is in a far better position than we are to review the record for evidence as to the specific conduct of each of the defendants.see also brown united states,cir a lthough it is within our power to do so,it would be inappropriate for us to decide this question on appeal,even if the record provided a sufficient basis for its resolution.
alleged and mishandling of smith corpse 
that prevent a person who has been wronged from vindicating his rights violate the right of access to the courts protected by the substantive due process clause.swekel city of river rouge,cir bell city of milwaukee,cir ryland shapiro,cir see also wolff mcdonnell,d the right of access to the courts is founded in the due process clause and assures that no person will be denied the opportunity to present to the judiciary allegations concerning violations of fundamental constitutional rights.i f state officials wrongfully and intentionally conceal information crucial to a person ability to obtain redress through the courts,and do so for the purpose of frustrating that right,and that concealment and the delay engendered by it substantially reduce the likelihood of one obtaining the relief to which one is otherwise entitled,they may have committed a constitutional violation.swekel,at citing ryland,at.
notwithstanding the broad formulation of the principle that a state officer may create constitutional liability,in practice the courts have been cautious in allowing liability to be imposed on that basis.thus,a plaintiff typically can not recover for any or discovery abuses after an action has been filed inasmuch as the trial court can deal with such situations in the ongoing action.in fact,if alleged in the course of litigation are regarded as actionable under section it is foreseeable that an initial civil rights action,or indeed any action against a state or local government or its officers,will be only the first in a series of such cases.thus,only prefiling conduct that either prevents a plaintiff from filing suit or renders the plaintiff access to the court ineffective or meaningless constitutes a constitutional violation.id.at see also foster city of lake jackson,cir suggesting that the right of access to the courts encompasses a right to file an action,but not the right to proceed free of discovery abuses after filing.
the smiths point out that the police refused to return smith answering machine tapes after they dropped the charges against him and that when they returned the tapes they did not contain any of the officers voices,despite the fact that police records show that officers left numerous messages during the incident.they suggest that the defendants either have withheld tapes containing their voices,or altered tapes to erase their voices.furthermore,the smiths point to a note in an internal police record referring to concerns about possible civil litigation to suggest that the defendants tampered with the tapes for the purpose of impeding the smiths from pursuing their rights.app.at.finally,the smiths rely on the evidence summarized above suggesting that the police came into contact with smith body earlier than reported and that their refusal to use search dogs prevented a more definitive autopsy by allowing the body to decompose.
even if the smiths can prove that the defendants attempted to effectuate a,they have not made a showing that the defendants efforts either prevented the smiths from filing suit or rendered their access to the courts ineffective or meaningless.nor have the smiths provided support for their contention that a more complete autopsy could have revealed more helpful information than was obtained from the autopsy conducted which,when coupled with their expert testimony,supplied a basis for a jury to attribute smith death to defendants conduct.furthermore,the smiths raised the issue of potentially altered tapes in the district court which thus was in a position to address their concerns.
in any event,the smiths were able to bring this action and present substantial evidence of central importance to their case.as a result,even assuming that they have proffered sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that there was a,the alleged conduct did not prevent them from filing suit or render their access to the courts ineffective or meaningless.indeed,this very opinion demonstrates that the smiths have been able to develop the facts in this case quite effectively.overall,we are satisfied that neither their nor mishandling theories can support a substantive due process claim.
first amendment retaliation claim 
to prove that the defendants violated smith first amendment rights by retaliating against him for filing complaints,the smiths must show that smith engaged in protected activity that the government responded with retaliation and that the protected activity was the cause of the retaliation.see anderson davila,cir.the district court properly concluded that the smiths provided insufficient evidence of a causal link to survive summary judgment.
we first consider the timing of the alleged retaliation remembering that e ven if timing alone could ever be sufficient to establish a causal link,the timing of the alleged retaliatory action must be unusually suggestive of retaliatory motive before a causal link will be inferred.krouse am.sterilizer,cir.thus,in recognition of that principle,we have held that such an inference could be drawn where two days passed between the protected activity and the alleged retaliation,see jalil avdel,cir,but not where months had elapsed,see krouse,at.smith lodged all his complaints between and so that the timing of the alleged retaliatory action,which started on july,is not unusually suggestive of retaliatory motive.
we have recognized,however,that timing plus other evidence may be an appropriate test where the temporal proximity is not so close as to be unduly suggestive.farrell planters lifesavers,cir.but the smiths have not offered other evidence in support of their retaliation claim,suggesting merely that,drawing all inferences in their favor,the officers targeting of smith on july,and the force with which they acted could convince a reasonable jury of the causal link.this suggestion,however,does not constitute affirmative evidence.although it is undisputed that a number of the officers were aware of smith complaints,there is no evidence to suggest that an intent to retaliate against him caused or contributed to the events of july.in fact,the officers went to smith premises on that day in response to a complaint by shafer rather than on their own initiative.
we also point out that a court in considering a first amendment retaliation claim against a police officer should be cautious in allowing it to proceed to trial in the face of the officer summary judgment motion.in this regard we observe that officers should not by reason of potential civil liability be discouraged from intervening when their services are needed by the not surprising circumstance that a claim has been lodged against a person with whom they have had previous adverse dealings.society may pay a high price if officers do not take action when they should do so.we therefore will affirm the district court judgment as to this claim.
fourth amendment claims 
the smiths predicate their fourth amendment argument on four theories use of excessive force unreasonable seizure unreasonable search malicious prosecution.
a.the red dot and probable cause 
the smiths assertion that there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether marasco and scianna actually saw a red light and believed that that light might be emanating from a weapon pointed at them by smith is central to their fourth amendment theories the district court found that the troopers knew that smith was mentally unstable and that he possessed guns that it was undisputed that scianna observed a red light in the window of the smith residence and that marasco saw a red dot appear on scianna person and that the troopers were aware that shafer once had complained about smith shooting out his lights.the district court then applied these findings in determining that the officers had an objectively reasonable belief that smith was engaged in criminal activity and that the force they used was a reasonable response to the danger they faced.
the smiths argue primarily that a reasonable jury could discredit the officers account of the incident and find that marasco did not in fact believe that smith targeted a weapon at scianna.they note our approval of an opinion by the court of appeals for the ninth circuit warning that courts should be cautious on summary judgment to ensure that the officer is not taking advantage of the fact that the witness most likely to contradict his decedent is unable to testify,and that the court may not simply accept what may be a selfserving account by the officer but must also look at the circumstantial evidence that,if believed,would tend to discredit the police officer story,and consider whether this evidence could convince a rational fact finder that the officer acted unreasonably.abraham raso,cir quoting scott henrich,cir.of course,this admonition does not alter the requirement that a party opposing summary judgment must present affirmative direct or defeat summary judgment,and may not rely simply on the assertion that a reasonable jury could discredit the opponent account.see williams borough of chester,cir.
p robable cause to arrest exists when the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer knowledge are sufficient in themselves to warrant a reasonable person to believe that an offense has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested.orsatti new jersey state police,cir.although,generally,the question of probable cause in a section damage suit is one for the jury,montgomery de simone,cir,a district court may conclude that probable cause did exist as a matter of law if the evidence,viewed most favorably to plaintiff,reasonably would not support a contrary factual finding,and may enter summary judgment accordingly.sherwood mulvihill,cir.
the smiths have not proffered affirmative evidence raising questions of material fact with regard to the officers account.first,they rely on various facts allegedly suggesting that marasco had an improper motive alleged contradictions in the record as to why the officers went to the scene the fact that marasco decision to respond to a complaint about bright lights was made at,when bright lights could not have been a problem the fact that marasco was outside of his assigned geographic position and marasco failure to heed his supervisor directions to leave the premises if smith did not respond.improper motive,however,is irrelevant to the question whether the objective facts available to the officers at the time reasonably could have led the officers to conclude that smith was committing an offense.see whren united states,d subjective intentions play no role in ordinary,fourth amendment analysis.
the smiths also point to contradictions concerning where on scianna body the troopers purportedly observed the light and whether both officers were in the backyard when scianna mentioned seeing what he at first took to be a video camera in the window.however,neither of these inconsistencies tends to discredit the essential portion of marasco account that,at some point when the officers were together,he observed what he reasonably took to be a laser sight pointed at scianna.
finally,the smiths suggest that any red light,if the troopers indeed saw one,could not have been emanating from smith residence because the troopers at one point stated that the beam was pointed at scianna back while he faced the rear of the house.the smiths further argue that it is undisputed that shafer was home at the time and that he likely possessed firearms.the record,however,will not support a finding that the light emanated from shafer property.moreover,the officers already had spoken to shafer and there is no suggestion that they considered him a threat of any magnitude.more importantly,marasco testified that the red light shone on different parts of scianna body as he turned around,so the fact that the light was at some point on scianna back and at another point may have been on his chest or arm is not determinative of the place of the origin of the light.even if the light came from some other part of smith property,the officers,based on their knowledge that smith possessed firearms,their knowledge of shafer complaint that smith had shot out his lights,and the fact that smith was not answering their calls despite indications that he was on the property,reasonably concluded that smith might be targeting them with a weapon.
in sum,the record establishes that the officers had an objectively reasonable belief that smith might be in the house,ignoring their attempts to communicate with him and bearing a firearm.the record also establishes that,at some point,marasco believed that scianna was being targeted by that firearm.at that point,therefore,the officers had probable cause to seek to arrest smith.
excessive force claim 
of course,the fact that the defendants had probable cause to arrest smith does not mean that they could use any amount of force in that process.rather,they could not use excessive force.to state a claim for excessive force as an unreasonable seizure under the fourth amendment,a plaintiff must show that a seizure occurred and that it was unreasonable.abraham,at.inasmuch as the defendants do not contest that there was a seizure in this case,in considering the excessive force contention the only question on appeal is whether the force used to effect that seizure was reasonable.
the test of reasonableness under the fourth amendment is whether,under the totality of the circumstances,the officers actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them,without regard to their underlying intent or motivations.graham connor,d.thus,if a use of force is objectively unreasonable,an officer good faith is irrelevant likewise,if a use of force is objectively reasonable,any bad faith motivation on the officer part is immaterial.see abraham,at.factors to consider in making a determination of reasonableness include the severity of the crime at issue,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,and whether he actively is resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight,see graham,at.at,as well as the possibility that the persons subject to the police action are themselves violent or dangerous,the duration of the action,whether the action takes place in the context of effecting an arrest,the possibility that the suspect may be armed,and the number of persons with whom the police officers must contend at one time,see sharrar felsing,cir.of course,
t he reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,rather than with the vision of hindsight the calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make circumstances that are tense,uncertain,and rapidly the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.
graham,at.at.finally,although reasonableness under the fourth amendment should frequently remain a question for the jury,abraham,at,defendants can still win on summary judgment if the district court concludes,after resolving all factual disputes in favor of the plaintiff,that the officer use of force was objectively reasonable under the circumstances,id.quoting scott henrich,at.
as already noted,the record establishes that the officers had an objectively reasonable belief that smith might be targeting them with a firearm.for purposes of the smiths excessive force claim,however,the objective reasonableness inquiry does not end here.the ultimate question on review is whether the decision to activate sert and sert subsequent actions were objectively reasonable responses to this situation.the smiths have proffered sufficient evidence to make this a question appropriate for resolution by a jury.
the district court concluded that the force used in this case was far less extreme than that the police used in sharrar felsing,in which we affirmed a district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant officers on an excessive force claim.app.at.it is true that the officers conduct here was certainly no more forceful than in sharrar,where an swat team dressed in black fatigues and carrying shotguns,rifles,and submachine guns was deployed,a police sniper was called in,a perimeter was established,and police,after calling the suspects out of their house,forced the suspects to the ground and repeatedly yelled at them,k eep your fucking head down or i blow it the fuck off.sharrar,at.in sharrar,with respect to the excessive force claim,we concluded w hile the language and method used to effect the arrests appear to be more akin to the behavior associated with police in overdramatized b movies or tv shows than the police conduct ordinarily expected in a quiet,family seaside town,we are reluctant to establish a precedent that would subject every police arrest of a group of possible violent offenders to compliance with marquis of queensberry rules of fair play.id.at.the district court,seizing on this language,concluded that the less severe conduct in this case was therefore not unreasonable.
the district court erred by failing to take into account another portion of the reasonableness equation,namely,the severity of the threat to which officers were responding,in keeping with the graham and sharrar factors in sharrar,officers were arresting four men and had been advised that at least one of the men had used a gun in a violent episode one to two hours before.furthermore,there had been some suggestion that the suspects were involved with drugs,and arrests actually were made.id.in this case,by contrast,officers were approaching only one man and,unlike in sharrar,where a violent assault involving a gun was itself the catalyst for the police arriving on the scene,were responding to a minor complaint.
we realize that several officers knew of smith ptsd or at least considered him unstable,and it generally was believed that smith possessed firearms.these factors may be seen as tending to support the use of force.nevertheless,there were a number of other graham and sharrar factors suggesting unreasonableness.there was no indication that smith had been using a gun recently or that smith ever has used a gun in a violent manner.no arrest was made,and the smiths have proffered evidence suggesting that an arrest warrant was not even sought until after sert was activated.most importantly,there is no indication in the record that smith had any history of violence of which the officers may have been aware.finally,unlike in sharrar,where just over three hours transpired between the victim call and the arrest of the four suspects,here,according to the incident report,approximately two and one half hours transpired between shafer call to the police and the decision to activate sert,and at least six hours passed between the phone call and initiation of the first rock assault on the smith residence.in fact the police did not finally clear the residence until approximately on july,approximately eight and or nine hours after the call that initiated their activity.a number of the relevant factors therefore cut against a determination that they used reasonable force.
we also point out that the district court does not appear to have considered certain other relevant facts in the light most favorable to the smiths.for example,the district court summarily concluded that the officers awareness of smith ptsd cuts in favor of reasonableness because,given smith history of mental problems and possession of weapons,the officers reasonably would believe that their lives were in danger.the question the district court should have asked,however,was not simply whether the officers reasonably believed their lives were in danger,but whether the activation of sert and the tactics of that unit were a reasonable response to that belief in the circumstances of this case.
we recognize that a jury could conclude,as the district court apparently did,that this overwhelming show of force was a reasonable response to the threat the officers perceived.however,a jury should be allowed to consider the testimony of the smiths police practices expert,mccauley,who opined that the police responded unreasonably to a situation involving a known emotionally disturbed person edp.likewise,it appears to be significant that hall,who played a part in the decision to activate sert,testified that sert is not activated unless a warrant has been or is in the process of being prepared,or if exigent circumstances exist.hall did not believe that there were exigent circumstances,and the decision to obtain a warrant appears to have been made after sert was activated.if sert activation was unwarranted under sert own procedures,that fact is at least probative of unreasonableness.
in sum,the smiths have proffered evidence sufficient to require that the question of the reasonableness of activating sert and of sert tactics be submitted to a jury.as the court of appeals for the tenth circuit recently has noted,
the decision to deploy a swat team to execute a warrant necessarily involves the decision to make an overwhelming show of far greater than that normally applied in police encounters with citizens.indeed,it is the swat team extraordinary and overwhelming show of force that makes dynamic entry a viable law enforcement tactic in dealing with difficult and dangerous situations 
the swat designation does not grant license to law enforcement officers to abuse suspects or bystanders,or to vent in an unprofessional manner their own aggression,personal frustration or animosity toward others.if anything,the special circumstances and greater risks that warrant dynamic entry by a swat team call for more discipline,control,mindfulness,and restraint on the part of law enforcement,not less.swat officers are specially trained and equipped to deal with a variety of difficult situations,including those requiring a swift and overwhelming show of force.at all times,swat officers no less than in camouflage or keep it clearly in mind that we are not at war with our own people.
holland harrington,cir emphasis in original 
as with the smiths danger claim,the district court did not reach the issue of qualified immunity.for the reasons expressed above,we will remand the case to allow the district court to determine that issue in the first instance.
unreasonable seizure 
even assuming that there was a seizure because smith was still in the house when the police formed a perimeter around his property,the smiths can not establish a fourth amendment violation based on the officers conduct following observation of the red dot by marasco.we recognize that it is undisputed that officers did not have a warrant when they arrived at smith home or when they established a perimeter around his property before activating sert and that a warrantless seizure in a person home violates the fourth amendment unless both probable cause and exigent circumstances are present.see payton new york,d.but as we already have pointed out there was probable cause here to believe a crime had been committed.thus,we address the exigent circumstances consideration.it is established that there are exigent circumstances if the safety of either law enforcement or the general public is threatened.warden hayden,d.a court makes the determination of whether there were exigent circumstances by reviewing the facts and reasonably discoverable information available to the officers at the time they took their actions and in making this determination considers the totality of the circumstances facing them.see united states sculco,d.inasmuch as the officers had reason to believe that a weapon was being pointed at them,they had reason to fear for their own safety.consequently,there were exigent circumstances and establishment of a perimeter did not constitute an unreasonable seizure.
unreasonable search 
the smiths also contend that marasco and scianna engaged in an unreasonable search before they believed they were being sighted.fourth amendment protections extend not only to a person home,but also to the curtilage surrounding the property.united states dunn,d in this case,after smith failed to respond when marasco and scianna knocked at the front door,the officers,according to their testimony,proceeded into the backyard of the house and marasco,at least,entered the garage.at that time,the officers did not possess a warrant,nor were there exigent circumstances,inasmuch as the officers simply were responding to a minor complaint and there was no indication of any danger to the officers or others safety or of any other conduct suggesting the existence of an exigency.furthermore,the district court found that the officers entered the curtilage,where smith had a legitimate expectation of privacy,and we find no reason to disturb that finding.
the defendants correctly point out that courts generally recognize a knock and talk exception to the warrant requirement.see,rogers pendleton,cir.officers are allowed to knock on a residence door or otherwise approach the residence seeking to speak to the inhabitants just as any private citizen may.id.according to one scholar,when the police come on to private property to conduct an investigation or for some other legitimate purpose and restrict their movements to places visitors could be expected to go,walkways,driveways,porches,observations made from such vantage points are not covered by the fourth amendment.wayne lafave,search and seizure a treatise on the fourth amendment f ed.supp footnotes omitted.rogers itself,however,stands for the proposition that this principle does not extend officers the right to make a general investigation in the curtilage based only on reasonable suspicion,at least where the inhabitant requests that the officers leave.id.
some courts of appeals have been more permissive of this sort of police activity,holding that it is reasonable and lawful as a matter of law for officers to move away from the front door as part of a legitimate attempt to interview a person.see united states hammett,cir a police officer may,in good faith,move away from the front door when seeking to contact the occupants of a residence.united states raines,cir recognizing that law enforcement officers must sometimes move away from the front door when attempting to contact the occupants of a residence and finding that a deputy sheriff did not interfere with defendant privacy interest when he,in good faith,went unimpeded to the back of defendant home to contact the occupants of the residence to serve civil process united states daoust,cir i f the front door is inaccessible,there is nothing unlawful or unreasonable about a state police officer going to the back of the house to look for another door,all as part of a legitimate attempt to interview a person.united states anderson,cir we can not say that the federal law enforcement agents action in proceeding to the rear after receiving no answer at the front door was so incompatible with the scope of their original purpose that any evidenc
