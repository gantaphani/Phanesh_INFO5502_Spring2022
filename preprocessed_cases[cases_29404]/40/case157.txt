we are entering an era in which retirement benefits paid to public employees are subject to heightened scrutiny.in this case,a municipality became convinced that former firefighters and police officers who had retired on disability pensions were collecting a particular benefit full reimbursement of certain medical expenses without legal warrant.the municipality acted on this conviction and stopped paying the tab.a group of affected retirees sued to enforce continued payment,alleging that the municipality violated state statutes,constituted an ultra vires act,contradicted principles of equity,and offended the due process clause of the united states constitution.
the district court entered summary judgment against all but three of the plaintiffs.the court then held a bench trial and resolved the remaining claims.the plaintiffs appeal the summary judgment rulings.we affirm.
background 
we briefly rehearse the relevant factual and procedural background,supplementing this account in our subsequent discussion of particular issues.
the plaintiffs comprise retired firefighters and police officers previously employed by warwick,rhode island the city at various points over the past three decades,each of them sustained a debilitating injury in the line of duty,resulting in a grant of disability leave by the city board of public safety the board.when it became apparent that the plaintiffs injuries precluded a return to active duty,the board exercised its discretion to place them in retirement.see warwick,code of ordinances a,a,a,a.each plaintiff received a disability pension that included defined medical benefits.
the present dispute centers on the extent of this benefit.in the first instance,the city funds the payment of retirees medical through health insurance,which covers part,but not all,of those costs.for many years,the city also reimbursed excess medical expenses,expenses not covered by insurance.this meant that one hundred percent of each retiree medical expenses was reimbursed.
in,the city took a fresh look at its past practice and concluded that,in accordance with a recent decision of the rhode island supreme court,it was not obliged to reimburse all of a disabled retiree medical expenses.consequently,the city personnel director,oscar shelton,informed the plaintiffs,by letter dated december,that as of january,the city would no longer reimburse medical expenses not covered by insurance.because the letter directed disabled retirees instead to the health insurance provided as part of their pensions,it had the additional effect of requiring that,upon reaching the age of,disabled retirees would have to apply for medicare.
dismayed by this,the plaintiffs asked for a hearing before the board.the board responded that 
a lthough the request can be placed on the agenda,the board position is,pursuant to the rhode island supreme court decision,that any retiree who has written confirmation that the city board of public safety will pay of injury related medical bills after retirement will have those bills paid in full.otherwise,the board position is that the city health insurance,as part of the retirement plan,meets the city obligation.
after unsuccessfully presenting their claims to the city council,see laws,the plaintiffs brought suit in state court against the board,the city,and a myriad of municipal officials including shelton.their complaint challenged termination of the practice of fully reimbursing medical expenses as violative of state statutory law,unauthorized,barred by principles of equitable estoppel,and offensive to due process.the defendants removed the action to the federal district court.see.
in due season,the defendants sought summary judgment.see.the district court initially granted the motion on all claims.cahoon shelton cahoon i,cv,wl,at.on the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration,the court later vacated the judgment with respect to the equitable estoppel claims.see cahoon shelton cahoon ii,cv,wl,at.after further discovery limited to the equitable estoppel issue,the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the estoppel claims of all but three of the plaintiffs.see cahoon shelton cahoon iii,cv,wl,at june.
the three exempted plaintiffs james gordon,michael kraczkowski,and thomas thompson tried their estoppel claims to the court,which found that the board had explicitly promised to reimburse all of gordon and kraczkowski medical expenses but had made no comparable promise to thompson.see cahoon shelton cahoon iv,cv,wl,at.the court entered judgment accordingly.id.at.the plaintiffs timely appeal of the summary judgment rulings followed.the defendants have not appealed the judgments in favor of gordon and kraczkowski on the estoppel claims.for his part,thompson has not appealed from the adverse findings in the bench trial although he,like the plaintiffs generally,continues to press a global claim of estoppel.
ii.analysis 
in this venue,the plaintiffs resurrect the same asseverational array that they presented in the court below.after delineating the legal standards that govern our inquiry,we address each of the plaintiffs four global asseverations.we then turn to the individualized and conceptually distinct claims mounted by gordon and kraczkowski.because the latter two claims stand on a different conceptual footing,we hereafter use the term the plaintiffs to designate all the plaintiffs other than gordon and kraczkowski.

when interpreting state law,a federal court employs the method and approach announced by the state highest court.carolina trucks,volvo trucks of,cir pharmacies,feliciano de melecio,cir.the rhode island supreme court has made it pellucid that in interpreting state statutes,a court ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the legislature.webster perrotta.the best evidence of such intent can be found in the plain language used in the statute.steinhof murphy,quoting state germane.

b.the iod statute.
the plaintiffs principal argument hinges on state statutes,municipal ordinances,and the interplay among them.the touchstone of this argument is the iod statute,which reads in relevant part 
whenever any police officer or fire fighter of any city is wholly or partially incapacitated by reason of injuries received in the performance of his or her duties,the respective city by which the police officer or fire fighter is employed,shall,during the period of the incapacity,pay the police officer or fire fighter the salary or wage and benefits to which the police officer or fire fighter would be entitled had he or she not been incapacitated,and shall pay the medical expenses for the necessary period in addition,the cities shall pay all similar expenses incurred by a member who has been placed on a disability pension and suffers a recurrence of the injury or illness that dictated his or her disability retirement.
the iod statute comprises two sentences.the district court concluded that neither sentence was sufficient to carry the burden of the plaintiffs statutory argument.the court reasoned that the first sentence sentence did not apply because,as retirees,the plaintiffs were no longer employed by the city.cahoon i,wl,at.it concluded that application of the second sentence sentence was sidetracked by the combined effect of laws and warwick municipal ordinances.id.at.consequently,the court held that the plaintiffs were not,as a statutory matter,entitled to full reimbursement of medical expenses.id.at.
the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred that sentence entitles them,even after their retirement,to full reimbursement of medical expenses and that sentence independently produces the same result.
we start with sentence.the plaintiffs maintain that this sentence confers benefits not only during the course of employment but also during retirement.in their view,the language of sentence is ambiguous,and the district court interpretation fails to effectuate the intent of the state legislature the rhode island general assembly.we find this argument unpersuasive.
the language of section a is clear as a bell.the section creates two tiers of benefits the first,codified in sentence,applies to persons who are still employed but temporarily disabled the second,codified in sentence,applies to persons who are retired due to a disability.the instruction in sentence to pay during the period of the incapacity the salary or wage to which the injured worker would be entitled had he or she not been incapacitated unequivocally denotes a person presently employed.after all,a retiree,by definition,no longer draws a salary or wages.rather,as sentence makes manifest,a retiree is placed on a pension.equally telling is the legislature use of the present tense is employed in sentence.
this reading is reinforced by the statutory description of the benefit period as a period of the incapacity.that description plainly envisions that benefits under sentence are meant to apply for a limited time.by contrast,sentence speaks of retirement an unlimited time.the contrary reading urged by the plaintiffs would obliterate this line of demarcation.
if more were needed and we do not think that it is fully reimbursing the medical expenses of disabled retirees under sentence would make sentence entirely superfluous.courts should avoid construing a statute in a way that will divest any of its component parts of meaning.see,state clark,brennan kirby.there is every reason to honor that precept here.
our reading of section a is wholly consistent with the case law.the state highest court has determined that the language of the iod statute is clear and unambiguous.see brissette potter,aiudi pepin.in addition,our parsing of the statute two sentences conforms with that court precedents.see,webster,at concluding that the benefits contemplated by sentence apply to a firefighter or police officer only while he or she remains a member of the department emphasis in original brissette,at stating that the first portion of the statute relates specifically to salary while the second clause relates to medical expenses for a member who has been placed on a disability pension.
the recent case of hagenberg avedisian,mirrors the circumstances with which we are confronted.there,a retired warwick police officer sought full reimbursement of medical expenses under the iod statute.id.at.the court held that sentence did not compel such reimbursement for an officer who had retired on a disability pension.id.at explaining that t he iod statute never was intended to supplement a retired officer retirement benefits.as the court had explained in an earlier case,u pon acceptance of disability pension benefits,a plaintiff may not seek additional benefits pursuant to.elliott town of warren,per curiam.here,the plaintiffs availed themselves of the city retirement benefits regime and they can not now resort to the prophylaxis of section.
in an effort to lessen the impact of these precedents,the plaintiffs insist that the general assembly,by enacting section,intended to give disabled firefighters and police officers greater benefits than those available under traditional workers compensation laws.this insistence puts the matter in a false light.it was only through sentence,which ensures the payment of full salary and medical benefits during the period of temporary incapacity,that the general assembly intended to exceed the generosity of the workers compensation laws.see labbadia state,describing the advantages of the iod statute the workers compensation laws.nothing in the text of section suggests that the legislature purpose was to give injured firefighters and police officers better retirement benefits.see hagenberg,at.
this brings us to sentence,which states that the city shall pay all similar expenses incurred by a member who has been placed on a disability pension.the plaintiffs position is that this language cinches their entitlement to full reimbursement of medical expenses.the language of sentence,if read in a vacuum,gives this position a certain superficial allure.but a court can not and must not read a statute in a vacuum,and sentence runs headlong into laws,which directs that,in cases of irreconcilable conflict between two legislative provisions,one general and the other specific,the latter shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision.
the specific provision applicable here is laws,which authorizes municipalities to provide,by ordinance or through collective bargaining,for the retirement of the personnel of their police and fire departments who have been on leave of absence from their employment due to injuries sustained in the performance of their duties.because warwick provides retirement medical benefits to its disabled firefighters and police officers through a combination of city ordinances and collective bargaining agreements cbas the court below held that this specific arrangement took precedence over the more general provision contained in sentence and,therefore,that the plaintiffs were not entitled to full medical benefits under section a.cahoon i,wl,at.this holding is manifestly correct.
we need not tarry.sentence is a general provision.it conflicts with the combination of laws and the city actions in pursuance thereof.for present purposes,this conflict renders sentence inapposite.see germain city of pawtucket,per curiam concluding that city retirement benefits law for injured firefighters was specific compared to section,where former was applicable only to the city,while latter was a general statute which applies to all cities and towns.
the plaintiffs proclaim that there is no conflict between section and the city retirement scheme.but the conflict is obvious.warwick ordinances provide disabled retirees with health insurance,see warwick,code of ordinances a,a,and this insurance covers some but not all medical expenses,leaving the retirees responsible for the balance.furthermore,the insurance coverage attaches only until medicare can be expected to bear the load.id.c,b.this scheme directly and ineluctably conflicts with the second sentence of section a,which requires the full payment of any medical expenses and does so without any medicare.see morry city of warwick,per curiam.
the significance of this conflict is made clear by the decision in germain,which explains that the general assembly designed section to protect only those firefighters and police officers who are employed by cities that do not have their own pension plans.at.
the statute in no way repeals or supersedes the various special acts that authorize municipalities to establish their own pension and retirement benefit plans.see trembley city of central falls.thus,where a pension system that includes medical benefits is in effect,may not serve as a default source of benefits.elliott,at see hagenberg,at an injured officer employed by a municipality that has its own retirement system is restricted to the benefits provided by the particular statutory scheme.
the plaintiffs mount two additional.first,they contend that the grant of health insurance coverage to retired firefighters and police officers is effectuated not by section,but by section,which gives municipalities authority to provide healthcare coverage for all employees.this latter statute,they say,is another general statute,thus eliminating the perceived conflict.this contention is unavailing.
the ordinances that grant the city authority to provide health insurance coverage for its retired public safety personnel enumerate not only section,but also every other power thereunto enabling.warwick,of ordinances a see id.a.this language plainly encompasses section,which addresses the narrower subset of retired firefighters and police officers.
in all events,whether or not a conflict exists between sections and,there is an undeniable conflict between both of those general provisions and the specific provision of section.so long as that is true,section can not come to the plaintiffs rescue.
alternatively,the plaintiffs labor to refute the conclusion that section should not be read to permit,in effect,a bifurcation of benefits some governed by state statutes and others governed by municipal ordinances.see cahoon i,wl,at.but the state supreme court decision in elliott stands squarely in their path.see elliott,at rejecting any entitlement to a bifurcation of pension and medical benefits when a disability pension system is in place.
while the plaintiffs strive to distinguish elliott on the ground that the claimant in that case was seeking both salary and medical expense reimbursements,id.at,there is no reason to believe that the general assembly intended a claim for one kind of retirement benefits under section to be treated differently from a claim for some other kind of retirement benefits.indeed,the case law suggests the opposite conclusion.see hagenberg,at see also lanni ferrante,mem.concluding that plaintiff,having voluntarily elected to recover his disability pension benefits from the municipal pension system may not seek benefits pursuant to united states,cir noting venerable principle that grant of a greater power includes grant of a lesser power.
the short of it is that sentence functions as a mechanism,assuring injured retirees that municipalities will not leave them completely high and dry with regard to medical expenses if,however,a municipality provides medical coverage for retirees,there is no gap to fill and,thus,no room for section to furnish default benefits.see hagenberg,at.that the benefit separately provided is less than one hundred percent of medical expenses does not alter this reality.see,elliott,at.
here,the city has created a retirement system that covers its public safety retirees and affords them medical benefits.it is this system,not sentence,that dictates the medical benefits available to the plaintiffs.
in a effort to carry the day,the plaintiffs assert that the city retirement plan incorporates the benefits due to retirees under section.this assertion lacks force.
to be sure,some municipalities maintain retirement systems which,either through legislative acts or cbas,incorporate the provisions of the iod statute and provide that retirement benefits for disabled public safety officers should be distributed accordingly.see,brissette,at.warwick,however,is not among that number.nothing in the city ordinances or cbas indicates an intent to integrate the terms of section into the city retirement system.there would be no justification in straining to reach such a result by judicial fiat.
hagenberg confirms this understanding.the court there explicitly stated that an officer who retires with a disability pension forfeits the benefits of,unless the municipality has no disability pension system.at.the court statement that the component of the city retirement system that paid medical benefits was in accordance with the iod statute,id.at,signifies only that the city maintained a disability retirement system that provided medical benefits sufficient to obviate any need to resort to default benefits under section.thus,we conclude that the plaintiffs claims for full reimbursement of medical expenses by operation of the iod statute,whether seen in terms of sentence or sentence,are without merit.
ultra vires.
when the city came to the belated realization that its practice of fully reimbursing disabled retirees medical expenses was gratuitous,its personnel director shelton put a stop to it.the plaintiffs contend that the decision as to whether to halt the practice was the board prerogative and that,therefore,shelton unilateral action was ultra vires 
the plaintiffs contention puts the cart before the horse.warwick ordinances explicitly provide that the board has the responsibility for approving all applications for retirement,death,termination,and disability benefits.warwick,code of ordinances,see id.hence,the board is the only entity in the city that has the authority to authorize full reimbursement of medical expenses.this is crucial because the record is barren of any evidence that the board ever authorized the full reimbursement practice on a global basis.
without such an authorization from the board,the payments made by the city to reimburse medical expenses were themselves ultra vires.it follows inexorably that no special authorization was needed to halt them.after all,when a party has no lawful right to receive payments from the public fisc,halting the stream of unauthorized payments requires no particular formality.see town of johnston pezza,absent some equitable barrier to the cessation of unauthorized payments a matter to which we shortly shall return,a municipality is allowed to correct an ultra vires practice regardless of which municipal officer brings it to a halt.see id.at almeida zoning bd.of review of tiverton,see also pub.serv.of town of west newbury,cir discerning no authority for the proposition that a municipality can not nullif y an action invalid from the beginning.
equitable estoppel.
the plaintiffs next invoke the equitable exception to the halting of an ultra vires practice,positing that the city prolonged reimbursement of medical expenses estops it from changing course at this late date.the district court rejected this global theory,cahoon iii,wl,at,even though it found that specific promises had been made to gordon and kraczkowski,cahoon iv,wl,at.
to succeed on an equitable estoppel claim,a party must establish that the defendant made an affirmative representation directed to him for the purpose of inducing him to act or fail to act in reliance thereon,and that such representation did induce him to act or fail to act to his injury.prov.teachers union prov.sch,quoting lichtenstein parness,accord saccucci auto,am.honda motor,cir applying rhode island law.with respect to a governmental entity,estoppel must be predicated upon the acts or conduct of the public entity officers,agents or official bodies acting within the scope of their authority.potter crawford,per curiam internal quotation omitted.measured against these benchmarks,the plaintiffs estoppel claims are triply flawed.
the first flaw is the absence of any evidence that the board made either a promise or an affirmative representation to disabled firefighters and police officers generally that the city would fully reimburse disabled retirees medical expenses.for aught that appears from the record,the board was not consulted.in the absence of such evidence,the district court appropriately granted summary judgment on the equitable estoppel claims.see ret.bd.of emps.ret.diprete.
the second flaw is equally destructive to the fabric of the plaintiffs argument.t he doctrine of equitable estoppel should not be applied against a governmental entity when,as here,the alleged representations or conduct relied upon were ultra vires.romano ret.bd.of emps.ret.because the city full reimbursement of medical expenses was ultra vires,see supra part ii c,the claims for equitable estoppel founder.see,tech.investors town of westerly.
third,and finally,the rhode island supreme court has noted that t he key element of an estoppel is intentionally induced prejudicial reliance.el marocco club,richardson,quoting greenwich yacht club coastal res.mgmt.council.the plaintiffs have proffered nothing to show that the city intentionally induced reliance on a continuation of full reimbursement indeed,they have not even identified a reason why the city might have wanted to induce such reliance
