plaintiff kenneth rossignol brought suit against defendants for their organized efforts to suppress the distribution of the election day issue of plaintiff island publishing company newspaper,mary today.plaintiffs sought damages and injunctive relief under,the maryland constitution,and maryland common law.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs federal claims on the grounds that defendants had not acted under color of state law.it then dismissed plaintiffs remaining state claims without prejudice.rossignol voorhaar,d.because defendants sought to censor plaintiffs criticism of them in their official roles,because their official positions were an intimidating asset in the execution of their plan,and because this sort of conspiracy by public officials was precisely the target of,we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the facts of this case are largely undisputed.mary today is a weekly newspaper owned by kenneth rossignol and primarily serving mary county in southern maryland.it has reported extensively and often critically on local government and public officials,including county sheriff richard voorhaar and his deputies,from captain steven doolan at the top of the rank all the way to the bottom.in defendants own words,mary today published constant belittlement and scandalous things about the sheriff deputies performance,including what they buy for the agency,equipment,and positions they ask for.nor was this just one article it was constantly,week,after week,after week.this criticism also extended to a personal friend of voorhaar named richard fritz,a candidate for mary county state attorney in the november elections who enjoyed broad support in the sheriff office.
several deputies in the sheriff office anticipated that the election day issue of mary today would be critical of them and their favored candidates,particularly voorhaar and fritz.over the course of a series of meetings and conversations,both on the job at the sheriff office and in the evening at private homes,some of the deputies formulated a plan to deal with this problem.they decided to form two teams on election day,each comprising three sheriff deputies,and buy out the stock of mary today at vending locations throughout the county.they viewed the seizure as a good opportunity for two things to piss rossignol off and to protest their disagreement with rossignol irresponsible journalism.they planned to stage a bonfire party when the seizure was completed.
the election day issue of mary today bore the headline fritz guilty of rape.it accurately reported that in,fritz and three other men had pled guilty to carnal knowledge of a girl.fritz,who was eighteen at the time of the rape,was sentenced to probation and a suspended sentence of eighteen months in state prison.the same article reported that fritz opponent had been convicted of marijuana possession in.another article in the issue also reported an eeoc complaint which charged that voorhaar had assigned a deputy who complained of sexual harassment to work directly under the supervision of the harasser.six thousand five hundred total copies of mary today were printed papers delivered to stores in mary county,placed in newspaper boxes throughout the county,delivered by mail to subscribers,and distributed to other counties.each copy cost cents.
late on the night before the election,six sheriff deputies set out in two cars.the officers were off duty,wearing plainclothes,and driving their personal cars.they drove throughout the county,buying newspapers from both newsboxes and local stores.to prove that they were purchasing the newspapers and not stealing them,defendants got receipts from the stores and videotaped themselves removing papers from newsboxes.later that night,rossignol discovered defendants plan and drove through the county attempting to resupply the stores and newsboxes.but defendants followed him around the county,buying up the fresh inventory as soon as it was replenished.
during the course of the mass purchase,a group of defendants met with an sheriff deputy who had contacted them on their pagers in order to conduct official business.some defendants also stopped at a sheriff office outpost to use facilities there during the course of the evening.one defendant wore his fraternal order of police sweatshirt with the word sheriff written on top of the county seal.two other defendants carried their service weapons during the mass purchase those firearms are visible on two videotapes of the incident and were noticed by at least one eyewitness.
many local clerks were quite familiar with county law enforcement personnel because of eleven policy of giving free coffee and soft drinks to police officers,even those out of uniform.thus,many of the clerks who interacted with defendants during the night knew that they were sheriff deputies.one clerk testified that he sold the full supply of the paper to defendants because they were police officers,had a real intimidating attitude,and made it real apparent that they could make my life here a living hell.a different clerk told one of her store other customers that the mary deputies were taking all of the papers.a manager of one eleven was told by one of her night employees that it was a police officer who bought them.a clerk at another store also explained to her manager the next morning that cops came in and bought them all.and a police report on the incident further notes that several of the clerks at convenience stores and a night watchman at walmart had recognized some of the men involved in the seizure as mary county deputies.
the mass purchase was completed at approximately,defendants having visited roughly forty stores and forty newsboxes and removed at least copies of the paper.at least more copies were seized without payment from retailers who had not yet opened,but defendants contend that any copies taken without payment were not taken by them.one witness testified that after the mass purchase he could not find any papers anywhere in the county.
both voorhaar and fritz personally supported and participated in the mass purchase.approximately one week before the election,one deputy spoke with voorhaar and secured his approval for the plan.voorhaar approved the plan,personally contributed to defray purchasing costs,and wished his deputies good luck on the endeavor.he also personally purchased multiple copies of the newspaper early in the morning on election day.and during the days following the election,he made extensive comments in local media defending and celebrating the seizure.likewise,fritz explicitly approved the plan and was directly involved in planning its implementation and mapping out with the other defendants exactly how they should proceed on the night before election day.fritz testified that he contributed of his own money to the seizure at a minimum,he served as a conduit for contributions which had been given to him.he also offered legal advice to defendants about the constitutionality of their plan,researching the issue before advising them that it was legal under both maryland and federal law.
plaintiffs brought suit in november,alleging violations of their rights under the first,fourth,and fourteenth amendments,as well as under the maryland constitution and at common law.after extensive discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.in february,the district court granted summary judgment against plaintiffs on the claims and accordingly dismissed plaintiffs state law claims without prejudice.plaintiffs now appeal.
as a threshold matter,there can be no question that,if defendants acted under color of state law,they violated these plaintiffs constitutional rights.the seizure clearly contravened the most elemental tenets of first amendment law.first,defendants targeted rossignol newspaper for suppression and retaliation because they disagreed with its viewpoint and intended to prevent its message from being disseminated.this by itself was sufficient to violate the constitution.it is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys.rosenberger rector and visitors of of virginia,d.and when,as here,the government targets not subject matter,but particular views taken by speakers on a subject,the violation of the first amendment is all the more blatant.id.at.see also city of paul,d.
second,the category of speech that defendants suppressed occupies the core of the protection afforded by the first amendment.mcintyre ohio elections comm n,d.discussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates for public office have always been integral to the operation of the system of government established by our constitution.buckley valeo,d per curiam.and it is by no means easy to see what statements about a candidate might be altogether without relevance to his fitness for the office he seeks.monitor patriot roy,d overturning state libel judgment against newspaper for criticism of a political candidate three days before the primary.the first amendment therefore affords the broadest protection to such political expression in order to assure the unfettered interchange of ideas,since i n a republic where the people are sovereign,the ability of the citizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential.buckley,at.citations omitted.it is for that reason that the first amendment has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office.monitor patriot,at.in suppressing criticism of their official conduct and fitness for office on the very day that voters were heading to the polls,defendants did more than compromise some attenuated or penumbral first amendment right they struck at its heart.
third,the fact that defendants paid for the newspapers in no way affects the conclusion that the seizure violated plaintiffs right to disseminate core political speech.governmental restraint on publishing need not fall into familiar or traditional patterns to be subject to constitutional limitations on governmental powers.miami herald publ g tornillo,d.the first amendment is about more than a publisher right to cover his costs.indeed,it protects both a speaker right to communicate information and ideas to a broad audience and the intended recipients right to receive that information and those ideas.bd.of,island trees union free sch.dist.pico,d.liberty of circulation is as important to freedom of the press as liberty of publishing indeed,without the circulation,the publication would be of little value.lovell city of griffin.quoting ex parte jackson.
it is because of the inherently communicative purpose of first amendment activity that compensation in the form of lost profits is legally insufficient as a remedy for the loss of first amendment freedoms.see elrod burns,d plurality opinion citing new york times united states,d.the fact that a small newspaper seeks to turn a meager profit does not remove it from the protections of the first amendment.the supreme court has made clear that the degree of first amendment protection is not diminished merely because the newspaper or speech is sold rather than given away.city of lakewood plain dealer publ g,d.what matters is that defendants intentionally suppressed the dissemination of plaintiffs political ideas on the basis of their viewpoint.and in doing so before the critical commentary ever reached the eyes of readers,their conduct met the classic definition of a prior restraint,near minnesota.

we have no doubt that the seizure in this case was perpetrated under color of state law.the requisite nexus between defendants public office and their actions during the seizure arose initially out of their censorial motivation.defendants executed a systematic,plan to suppress the distribution of mary today.and they did so to retaliate against those who questioned their fitness for public office and who challenged many of them in the conduct of their official duties.the defendants scheme was thus a classic example of the kind of suppression of political criticism which the first amendment was intended to prohibit.the fact that these law enforcement officers acted after hours and after they had taken off their badges can not immunize their efforts to shield themselves from adverse comment and to stifle public scrutiny of their performance.revene charles cty.comm rs,cir.
to begin with,it is clear that if a defendant purportedly private actions are linked to events which arose out of his official status,the nexus between the two can play a role in establishing that he acted under color of state law.in layne sampley,cir,for example,an police officer was in plain clothes,had been on vacation for several days,and was sitting in his personal car when he shot the plaintiff.the sixth circuit nonetheless held that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant had acted under color of state law,in large part because the animosity grew out of the officer performance of his official duties.id.at.and in united states causey,cir,the fifth circuit held that a police officer had acted under color of state law when he conspired with two civilians to murder a woman who had filed police brutality charges against him.important to the decision was the fact that the desire to retaliate against the victim arose out of her criticism of the defendant actions in his official capacity.id.at.
indeed,where the action arises out of purely personal circumstances,courts have not found state action even where a defendant took advantage of his position as a public officer in other ways.for example,in martinez colon,cir,an police officer shot his coworker with a revolver while they were both in the stationhouse.the court nonetheless held that the defendant had not acted under color of state law because the shooting had arisen from a singularly personal frolic tormenting an acquaintance,and because defendant status as a police officer simply did not enter into his decision to torment the victim.id.at see also bonsignore city of new york,cir no state action where police officer shot his wife with a police revolver and then committed suicide.
