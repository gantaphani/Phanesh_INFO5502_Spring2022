opinion of the court 
on saturday,april,eric betts suffered a tragic spinal cord injury while attempting to make a tackle during a football game at the new castle youth development center ydc.following the injury,betts sued ydc and several of its staff members pursuant to,claiming various constitutional violations.the district court entered summary judgment for ydc and its staff in their official capacities,finding them immune from suit under the eleventh amendment.summary judgment also was entered on the merits in favor of the defendants in their individual capacities.betts filed this timely appeal 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
our review of defendants entitlement to eleventh amendment immunity is plenary.haybarger lawrence county adult prob.and parole,cir.we review the district court summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see groman twp.of manalapan,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.a genuine issue of material fact exists when the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.see anderson liberty lobby,d.when the moving party has carried its burden,the nonmoving party must set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.e.unsupported assertions,conclusory allegations,or mere suspicions are insufficient to overcome a motion for summary judgment.see williams borough of west chester,cir.
the ydc houses youths who have been adjudicated delinquent and committed by pennsylvania juvenile courts to the care and custody of the pennsylvania department of welfare bureau of juvenile justice services.at the time of his injury,betts had been committed to the ydc secure treatment program a maximum security program for serious offenders and was assigned to one of five residential cottages.counselors worked in the cottages and were required to accompany the residents at all times.on weekends,residents had free time during which they were permitted to use indoor and outdoor basketball courts,several gyms and weight training equipment,a swimming pool,and an outdoor area available for football or walking.during daytime activities such as the football game involved in this case,at least one ydc staff member had to be present for every six residents.
on the day betts was tragically injured,two counselors accompanied ten residents,including betts,to the outdoor area to play football.by their previous agreement,residents from pittsburgh chose to square off against residents from philadelphia.as was their habit,the residents played tackle football without any equipment.during the course of the fateful game,a player simulated a kickoff by throwing the ball into the air.betts who had prior experience playing organized and tackle and touch football ran down the field full force and hit the ball carrier with his head.betts testified at his deposition that he really tried to hurt the opposing player because his adrenaline was rushing.
upon impact,betts fell to the ground and was unable to get up.while betts was lying on the ground,a counselor advised betts to tell people he had been playing touch,not tackle,football an ambulance transported betts to a local hospital,where he was evacuated by helicopter to elizabeth hospital in youngstown,ohio.unfortunately,betts spinal cord injury was so severe that it resulted in quadriplegia.
following the accident,betts sued ydc and several of its staff members in their official and individual capacities.as relevant to this appeal,betts claimed his rights were violated under the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,asserting that ydc and its staff in their official capacities were immune from suit under the eleventh amendment.the district court agreed,holding that the pennsylvania department of public welfare dpw is an administrative agency without existence apart from the commonwealth.betts new castle youth dev,wl,at.and because the ydc is a pennsylvania state agency regulated,monitored and maintained by the dpw,it was entitled to the same immunity.id 
as for betts claims against the ydc staff members,the district court ruled on the merits.on betts eighth amendment claim,the district court held there was insufficient evidence to raise genuine issues of fact as to the existence of a substantial risk of serious harm and the defendants deliberate indifference to that risk.id.at.regarding betts claims under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,the district court held that his claim for deliberate indifference failed for the same reason it failed under the eighth amendment and that there was no liability under the danger doctrine because the challenged behavior did not shock the conscience.id.at.
state governments and their subsidiary units are immune from suit in federal court under the eleventh amendment,which provides the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.the supreme court extended the eleventh amendment reach to suits by plaintiffs,thus barring all suits against states in federal court.lombardo pennsylvania dep t of public welfare,cir citing hans louisiana.individual state employees sued in their official capacity are also entitled to eleventh amendment immunity because suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action against the state.hafer melo,d internal quotation marks omitted.however,t he supreme court has long held that counties,municipalities,and political subdivisions of a state are not protected by the eleventh amendment.febres camden bd.of,cir citations omitted.the party asserting eleventh amendment immunity bears the burden of proving its applicability.christy pennsylvania tpk.comm n,cir 
i n certain instances summary disposition of the eleventh amendment issue is possible,however,in close cases,evidence beyond the mere statutory language is required.blake kline,cir.when evidence beyond mere statutory language is required,we apply an test to determine whether an entity is an alter ego or arm of a state for purposes of eleventh amendment immunity.christy,at collecting cases.in this case,the district court did not apply the christy test because it found dispositive the relevant statutory language and betts concessions concerning dpw control of ydc.betts claims the district court erred by failing to apply the christy test.we disagree with betts and,in doing so,endeavor to clarify when the christy test should and should not be applied.
the fundamental flaw in betts argument lies in its fallacious premise,that this is a case where evidence beyond mere statutory language is required.as we stated long before christy was decided in certain instances summary disposition of the eleventh amendment issue is possible blake,at see also christy,at in general,a claim of eleventh amendment immunity will occasion serious dispute only where a relatively complex institutional arrangement makes it unclear whether a given entity ought to be treated as an arm of the state.citation omitted.we agree with the district court that this case is one where summary disposition is not only possible,but appropriate.
as the district court duly noted,pennsylvania and federal law establish that the dpw is entitled to eleventh amendment immunity because it is an administrative agency without existence apart from the commonwealth.see.stat.executive and administrative work of the commonwealth of pennsylvania shall be performed by various executives and administrative agencies,including the department of public welfare pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d holding that defendants including pennsylvania dpw,and pennhurst state school and hospital a state institution were entitled to immunity under the eleventh amendment lavia pennsylvania dep t of corrections,cir because the commonwealth of pennsylvania department of corrections is a part of the executive department of the commonwealth,see.stat,tit,it shares in the commonwealth eleventh amendment immunity.lombardo,at.as betts conceded in the trial court,ydc is a pennsylvania state agency regulated,monitored and maintained by the dpw.betts,wl,at citing the complaint see also beers capitol whetzel,cir noting that ydc is a detention facility for juveniles run by the pennsylvania department of public welfare.accordingly,the district court concluded that ydc was entitled to the same immunity as the dpw.
the district court holding is firmly grounded in pennsylvania statutory law,which provides 
state institutions means and includes all hospitals for the mentally ill or any other institutions for mentally retarded or epileptic persons,or for juvenile delinquents and dependents,and charitable institutions,within this commonwealth,maintained in whole by the commonwealth,and whose boards of trustees are departmental administrative boards within the department.
the dpw has supervision over all state institutions,id.at,and pennsylvania statutory scheme for dpw administration of these institutions further evidences that ydc does not have independent status apart from the commonwealth.see id.at payment of costs,dpw control over contracts for repairs,alterations or equipment,dpw control over contracts for utility services dpw authority to lease land at state institutions to municipalities for purposes of garbage disposal dpw power to appoint superintendents of state institutions.this statutory scheme which explicitly includes institutions for juvenile delinquents within the definition of state institutions is the beginning and the end of the matter for purposes of eleventh amendment immunity.this is not a case involving complex institutional arrangements with actors 
in sum,because pennsylvania law provides,and betts concedes,that institutions for juvenile delinquents are state institutions existing within the department of public welfare and ydc was,in fact,managed by dpw,we hold that the district court did not err in granting eleventh amendment immunity to ydc and its staff in their official capacities.the district court was not required to reflexively apply the christy test because ydc is clearly an arm of the commonwealth under state law.
following its initial ruling with respect to the eleventh amendment,the district court proceeded to adjudicate the merits of betts claims against the ydc staff in their individual capacities,as required by hafer melo,d.we turn first to betts eighth amendment claim.
betts contends the district court erred in entering summary judgment on his eighth amendment claim because he raised genuine issues of material fact as to the existence of a substantial risk of serious harm and the defendants deliberate indifference to that risk.
the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment restrains prison officials from certain actions,the use of excessive force against prisoners,and imposes on them a duty to provide humane conditions of confinement.farmer brennan,d.that is,prison officials must ensure that inmates receive adequate food,clothing,shelter,and medical care,and must take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates.id.quoting hudson palmer,d for an alleged deprivation to rise to the level of an eighth amendment violation,it must result in the denial of the minimal civilized measure of life necessities.id.at.quoting rhodes,at.to prove an eighth amendment violation based on a failure to ensure his reasonable safety,betts must show that the defendants were deliberately indifferen t to a substantial risk of serious harm.id.at.the question of ydc deliberate indifference is a subjective inquiry,while risk of harm is evaluated objectively.see atkinson taylor,cir.
in helling mckinney,d,an inmate filed suit against prison officials alleging eighth amendment violations based on his involuntary exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ets emanating from his cellmate cigarettes.at.alleging cellmate smoked five packs a day.the prison obtained a directed verdict from the district court but the court of appeals reversed in part,concluding that the lower court erred by denying helling the opportunity to prove his allegations of unreasonable exposure to a future harm.id.at.
the supreme court affirmed the court of appeals,holding that helling had alleged a sufficiently serious harm involuntary exposure to levels of smoke that created an unreasonable risk of harm to future health.id.at.with respect to proving the objective element of a harm rising to the level of a constitutionally serious deprivation on remand,the supreme court stated helling would have to prove that he was exposed to unreasonably high levels of ets.id.such a showing requires more than a scientific and statistical inquiry into the seriousness of the potential harm and the likelihood that such injury to health will actually be caused by exposure to ets.id.at.objectively serious harm also requires an assessment of society view of the risk,whether it violates contemporary standards of decency to expose anyone unwillingly to such a risk.id.at.thus,under helling,for betts to satisfy the objective component of his claim he must establish the seriousness of the injury,a sufficient likelihood that serious injury will result from playing tackle football without protective equipment,and the risks associated with permitting youth to play tackle football without equipment violate contemporary standards of decency.betts easily meets the first factor,but fails the other two.
it goes without saying that quadriplegia is an exceptionally serious harm.but betts has presented no evidence that playing tackle football without equipment poses a substantial risk of serious harm.instead,betts argues that the risk of serious harm associated with allowing residents to play tackle football without protective equipment is sufficiently obvious that any reasonable adult would realize it.betts br.at.we disagree with betts assertion that the excessive nature of the risk of serious injury from football is obvious.
in support of his claim that the risk of serious harm inherent in playing tackle football without equipment is obvious,betts cites some of the defendants admissions at their depositions that playing football may result in serious injury.specifically,betts notes that counselor stuart admitted he was aware that new england patriots wide receiver darryl stingley was paralyzed after he was speared by jack tatum of the oakland raiders during an nfl preseason game in.but the fact that football players have suffered grievous injuries while playing the game sheds no light on the frequency or likelihood of such injuries.the mere possibility that an injury may result from an activity does not mean that there is a substantial risk of that injury occurring.see baze rees,d plurality an isolated mishap alone does not violate the eighth amendment because such an event,while regrettable,does not suggest a substantial risk of serious harm.while betts submitted expert reports concluding that his injury was caused by his tackle and that cervical spine injuries have occurred in other football games,these reports offer no insight into the frequency or likelihood of such injuries see rish johnson,cir affidavit from infectious disease expert regarding precautions for preventing spread of disease was insufficient to establish that risk of disease without protective equipment was obvious.
life is fraught with risk of serious harm and the sports world is no exception.but an eighth amendment violation may not be predicated on exposure to any risk of serious harm the risk must be substantial.see helling,at.eighth amendment claim may be based on a condition of confinement that is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering.because the record in this case is devoid of evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that serious injury is a common or likely occurrence in tackle football games,the district court did not err in granting defendants summary judgme
