opinion of the court 
shipping solid waste to midwestern landfills has become big in places like new jersey where capacity at landfills is scarce.railroads are prime beneficiaries of the increased demand for the means of shipping waste across the country.many railroads accommodate this demand by building facilities within their for the storage and loading of waste,which often is brought to the loading facility by truck.as one might imagine,transferring solid waste from truck to rail car is not the cleanest of businesses,and so the state of new jersey has tried to regulate it.railroading,however,is historically the subject of federal regulation,so any state regulation affecting it raises the question of preemption.because we conclude that the district court factfinding does not support its conclusion that all of the state environmental regulations at issue are preempted here,we remand for consideration of each regulation individually.
facts and procedural history 
in business since the century,the new york susquehanna and western railway corporation susquehanna operates in new york,new jersey,and pennsylvania.this dispute centers on activities at five of its new jersey solid waste transloading facilities 
four of the facilities at issue dealt primarily or exclusively in solid waste generated at construction and demolition sites waste.susquehanna built these facilities itself and either leased or owned the land.at each facility,susquehanna sold most of its shipping capacity to a primary customer.these primary customers,known as shippers,acted as middlemen between the generators of waste and the railroad.for a fee,they took title to waste from the operators of the sites that generated it and hauled it by truck to susquehanna transloading facilities.they then paid susquehanna to load the waste onto rail cars and ship it to landfills which they paid to take final title to the waste.because the shippers value added was their ability to move waste efficiently from sites to landfills,they used contracts with susquehanna to ensure that they could do so.rather than operating the transloading facilities itself,susquehanna hired a loading company to unload the trucks bringing in the waste,oversee its storage,and load it onto rail cars.
the fifth facility dealt only in contaminated soil,which was stored in sealed containers and emptied directly into sealed rail cars.the loading agent at that facility was a susquehanna subsidiary,and the shipper had an exclusive contract with susquehanna.because the facility catered to only one customer,that customer controlled access to the facility.
at least initially,the transloading facilities were a mess nearby residents complained that their houses and yards were covered in dust and grime,the noise was excessive,and the wastewater and stormwater runoffs were dirty.of equal if not more concern to state officials was that the facilities posed,in the officials judgment,potentially deadly fire hazards.the pollution and its perceived danger caused a public outcry,and new jersey officials responded by promulgating a series of health,safety,and environmental rules that have come to be known as the regulations.see.
for transloading facilities that deal only in containerized solid waste,the regulations require that 
the rail carrier provide the state with a narrative from an officer of the rail carrier describing the facility operations and certifying that containers will not be opened and that employees,the public or the environment will not be exposed to solid waste except as allowed in accordance with state law 
nonputrescible not decaying solid waste not remain at the rail facility for more than days,putrescible decaying solid waste for not more than hours,and nonhazardous liquid waste in sealed containers not more than days 
solid waste received,stored or transferred at the rail facility be contained in sealed containers that do not leak any liquids or solid materials and are not opened for any purpose at the facility,except that a container holding liquid waste may be opened briefly for the purpose of sampling the liquid provided the container is immediately resealed 
the operation not result in the migration of odors outside the confines of the rail carrier property 
all solid waste containers staged or stored at the facility be secured at all times in a manner that prevents unauthorized access to the containers and their contents 
an adequate water supply and adequate equipment be maintained or be readily available to extinguish any and all types of fires 
solid waste vehicles not be queued or staged on any public roadway 
the queuing and staging of solid waste vehicles be conducted so as to prevent traffic backups and related traffic hazards on access roads servicing the facility 
facilities and all appurtenances,other than those owned or operated by rail carriers,including vehicles while,be positioned and buffered in such a manner that sound levels generated by the operation not exceed limits established pursuant to noise control rules 
only solid waste vehicles properly registered and displaying the appropriate registration number and solid waste decal be admitted at the facility 
the state designated representatives and inspectors be admitted to inspect any building,or any other portion of the rail facility,at any time 
any release or discharge of any solid waste that would harm human health and the environment at the facility be immediately reported by the facility operator or its designee to the state 
an emergency coordinator be designated who will be available during all hours of operation for the purpose of handling emergency situations,such as,but not limited to,spills,discharges or releases of solid wastes at the facility and 
the facility maintain daily records of waste and submit quarterly reports within days of the end of each calendar quarter summarizing waste receipts.

see generally d.
susquehanna asserted from the outset that it did not need to comply with the regulations because they were preempted by the interstate commerce commission termination act,b.after negotiations between susquehanna and the state failed,the state,alleging multiple violations of the regulations at each site that continued for days,assessed a civil penalty against susquehanna of million per day per site.specifically,the state alleged that one or more of the sites 
did not store waste in a fully enclosed building complying with the uniform construction code all sites 
did not properly channel wastewater from the tipping floor into sewer system connections all sites 
did not properly collect,store,and dispose of wastewater generated through normal facility operations all sites 
did not properly control dust migration all sites 
failed to operate certified scales for purposes of reporting waste transported by trucks all sites 
spilled hazardous waste onto tracks and adjoining areas rather than keeping it contained one site 
failed to clean waste storage areas every hours four sites 
failed to keep property surrounding waste management areas free of litter and debris four sites 
did not properly control odor emissions four sites 
did not properly control insects and rodents four sites 
failed to pave roadways and areas where waste was loaded or unloaded two sites 
allowed particulates to be released into the atmosphere causing air pollution one site 
allowed nonputrescible waste to remain for more than days one site,and 
failed adequately to control access to the facility one site.
in response to the civil penalty,susquehanna sued the state in the federal district court for the district of new jersey,asking the court to declare that all of the regulations were preempted by federal law and to enjoin new jersey from enforcing the penalty.after the parties took limited discovery,the district court held a hearing in december to assess the conditions of the facilities and the issue of federal preemption.two days into the hearing,after susquehanna had called all of its witnesses but the state had only begun examining its first,the court discontinued the hearing to attend to other matters.over the next eight months,the parties tried to settle the dispute.in august,they gave up.the court asked for a final round of briefing and proposed to rule on preemption without concluding the hearing.neither party objected,and the court held that the termination act preempted all of the regulations.the state appeals 
because the district court heard live testimony and resolved disputed factual issues on that basis,we treat this case as though it comes to us after a bench trial thus we review the court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.frederick dep t of pub.welfare of,cir.
ii.whether susquehanna activities are covered by the termination act preemption clause 
in relevant part,the termination act provides that t he jurisdiction of the surface transportation board over transportation by rail carrier is exclusive t he remedies provided under this part with respect to the regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under federal and state law.b internal paragraph divisions omitted.the act defines transportation as 
a a locomotive,car,vehicle,vessel,warehouse,wharf,pier,dock,yard,property,facility,instrumentality,or equipment of any kind related to the movement of passengers or property,or both,by rail,regardless of ownership or an agreement concerning use and 
b services related to that movement,including receipt,delivery,elevation,transfer in transit,refrigeration,icing,ventilation,storage,handling,and interchange of passengers and property.
it defines rail carrier,in relevant part,as a person providing common carrier railroad transportation for compensation.
the first question to which we turn is whether the activities at issue are transportation by rail carrier,and thus subject to the termination act.we begin with whether susquehanna engages in transportation activities,and follow up with whether it acts as a rail carrier.
whether susquehanna activities are transportation 
it is undisputed that operations of the facilities include dropping off cargo,loading it onto susquehanna trains,and shipping it.thus the facilities engage in the receipt,storage,handling,and interchange of rail cargo,which the termination act explicitly defines as transportation.see b.these operations fit within the plain text of the termination act preemption clause.
the state,however,argues that the operations must be integrally or closely related to providing rail service to qualify as transportation under the surface transportation board prevailing interpretation of the act but the state position seems based on a misreading of the board caselaw.it is true that the board wrote in borough of riverdale,wl declaratory order,that facilities not integrally related to the provision of interstate rail service are not subject to our jurisdiction or subject to federal preemption.id.at.but consider the entire paragraph 
finally,it should be noted that manufacturing activities and facilities not integrally related to the provision of interstate rail service are not subject to our jurisdiction or subject to federal preemption.according to the borough,susquehanna has established a corn processing plant.if this facility is not integrally related to providing transportation services,but rather serves only a manufacturing or production purpose,then,like any property,it would be subject to applicable state and local regulation.our jurisdiction over railroad facilities,like that of the former interstate commerce commission,is limited to those facilities that are part of a railroad ability to provide transportation services,and even then the board does not necessarily have direct involvement in the construction and maintenance of these facilities.see growers marketing pere marquette.we can not determine from the current record whether this facility is actually a corn processing plant or some sort of transloading operation for the transfer of corn syrup,for example that is related to transportation services.
id.emphasis added.in other words,the board distinguished manufacturing,which is not sufficiently related to transportation by rail,and transloading,which is.
accepting the factual findings of the district court in our case as true,it deals with transloading.hence,whatever the legal effect of the board adverb integrally which we suspect is minimal or none,transloading qualifies as transportation.
in addition,the court of appeals for the second circuit has held that transloading activities fall within the termination act definition of transportation.see green mountain green mountain cir,cir certainly,the plain language of the termination act grants the surface transportation board wide authority over the transloading and storage facilities undertaken by green mountain.thus we hold that transloading operations are transportation under the termination act.
the state claims,however,that the district court erred in not recognizing that susquehanna engages in waste sorting and processing as well as transloading at its facilities.sorting and processing,it argues,are not transportation because they do not have the requisite nexus to the movement of property by rail.rather,those activities can be done anywhere and need not have anything to do with the loading or shipment of solid waste.amicus curiae national solid wastes management association,a trade association of solid waste collectors and processors,agrees.it explains that separating recyclables from other c d waste is part of its members function as waste processors.solid waste mgmt.ass br.at.according to the association,the food chain works as follows people with waste pay a shipper to take title to it.the shipper then delivers the waste to a processor who,for a fee,separates out valuable materials,such as scrap metal,wood,and appliances.the shipper sells the valuables to recycling plants.it also engages a railroad to take the remaining waste to a landfill,and it pays the landfill to take title to the waste.shippers make money by getting more for the the initial owner and from recycling they pay for processing,transport,and ultimate disposal.here,according to the association,we have a railroad acting as transport company,transloader,and processor.by charging a low combined fee susquehanna expert refers to the transloading process as a loss leader,the railroad increases demand for its real service,which is hauling waste to landfills.but here the rub waste processing is a heavily regulated industry.according to the association,the railroad gains a competitive advantage if it can shield its processing activities from regulation by characterizing them as transportation by a rail carrier and thus preempting burdensome state regulations.id.
the district court characterized the sorting activities at the facilities as the de minimis removal of items that did not comply with the shipper and landfill disposal contract.it further found that because sorting and loading took place at the same time,they were actually one process,the dominant character of which was loading.app.at.op.the court likened it to a loader removing a toyota camry from a shipment it knew was supposed to be ford explorers.id.determining how to review the court characterization is difficult because the line between fact and law here is blurry.on one hand,susquehanna expert plausibly characterized the removal of some items as an incidental and normal part of the loading process,id.quoting app.at test.of william rinnicke,and the district court,as factfinder,was entitled to credit that testimony.see kingwood twp.bd.of,cir.moreover,the association characterization of this kind of sorting as waste processing with value independent of the transloading process,while perhaps persuasive,is not in the record.on the other hand,even accepting the facts underlying susquehanna characterization as true,we must apply those facts to the termination act definition of transportation to decide whether they fit.see evans united arab shipping,cir noting that whether the facts meet a statutory standard is an issue of law citations omitted.
given all of the record evidence,we conclude that whether the district court characterization of the sorting process was correct is immaterial.the regulations do not specifically regulate the aspect to whatever extent there is one of susquehanna facilities,nor does the civil penalty order have anything specifically to do with sorting or processing as opposed to storage and loading.thus the question of whether a state could specifically regulate the sorting process apart from the loading process is not before us.the regulations and penalty assessment here broadly regulate storage and transloading,irrespective whether the rail carrier also processes waste.since both storage and transloading fall within the definition of transportation,we need not consider whether the incidental processing activities do as well.
whether the transloading activities are undertaken by a rail carrier 
the state argues that susquehanna is not acting as a rail carrier when it ships waste from the transloading facilities for two reasons susquehanna does not operate the transloading facilities itself,and it grants virtually all of its hauling capacity at each facility to one shipper.
susquehanna control over the transloading process 
our hi tech decision dealt with whether transloading activities were performed by a rail carrier.hi tech trans,llc,cir.in that case,we noted that hi tech,the transloader,operated the transloading facility under a license agreement with cpr,the rail carrier and owner of the land.id.at.hi tech constructed and maintained the facility.id.moreover,the license agreement established that hi tech was not cpr agent,and cpr disclaimed any liability from hi tech operations.id.cpr did not charge shippers a fee for using the hi tech transloading facility presumably,the shippers paid hi tech for the service.id.
this case is different because the rail carrier owned or leased the land and built the transloading facilities,shippers pay the rail carrier to load their freight,and the rail carrier does not disclaim liability for the loading process.the board noted that the hi tech situation was substantially different from a situation in which a rail carrier builds and owns a transloading facility,and holds it out to the public as its own facility,but chooses to have a contract operator,which,presumably,would qualify as transportation by rail carrier.hi tech trans,llc hi tech stb,wl,at denying request for a declaratory order.relying on this language,the district court concluded that our case is just what the board describes a rail carrier susquehanna building,owning,and advertising its own transloading facilities,which it uses a contract agent to operate.
while the district court conclusion that this case is distinguishable from hi tech is correct,a footnote from our hi tech decision complicates the issue.we wrote that w e do not suggest that a party can contractually determine its status as a railroad carrier for regulatory purposes.at.this is a perplexing statement because the contract before us obviously plays some role in determining the nature of the loader relationship to the railroad.id.that is,after all,why it define the parties relationship.our point in hi tech,though,was that railroads and loaders may not change by contract what in practice is a substantively different relationship.
here,susquehanna contracts with shippers to load their waste,which it then pays a loading agent to do on its behalf.in hi tech,the loader contracted with shippers directly.the state argues that this is a distinction without a material difference,as susquehanna essentially just funneled money from shipper to loader often the exact same amount.the difference,however,is that susquehanna,by contracting directly with the shipper,assumed more liability than the hi tech rail carrier.susquehanna could be sued for breach of contract or potentially negligence or some other tort if something went wrong the hi tech railroad could not,as it was not a party to the shippers and loaders agreements.we regard this as a substantive difference between the hi tech case and this one,and therefore conclude that the district court appropriately distinguished it.
susquehanna contracts 
the state also argues that susquehanna does not qualify as a rail carrier when it hauls freight from the transloading facilities because it does not act as a common carrier though the state concedes that susquehanna does so in other contexts.this is relevant because only common carriers fit the termination act definition of rail carrier.the statute does not further define the term common carrier,but the general definition is a carrier that is required by law to transport passengers or freight,without refusal,if the approved fare or charge is paid.black law dictionary ed.the core of the state argument is that,because susquehanna sells in advance all the facility or nearly all the c d facilities of its capacity to one shipper,it offers nothing to the general public,as the definition of common carrier requires.
the common law differentiates between private carriers and common carriers.see,york cent,wall.holding that common carriers may limit their liability by undertaking private carriage.we have held that 
t he distinctive characteristic of a common carrier is that he undertakes to carry for all people indifferently,and hence is regarded in some respects as a public servant.the dominant and controlling factor in determining the status of one as a common carrier is his public profession as to the service offered or performed.
kelly,aff and adopted as circuit precedent,cir.a private carrier,on the other hand,offers services to limited customers under limited circumstances and assumes no obligation to serve the public at large.lone star steel mcgee,cir citing ward,pub.untils.comm n.
susquehanna was certified by the interstate commerce commission as a common carrier decades ago,and that certification is current.but,as judge warren burger noted,a common carrier may in some circumstances operate as a private carrier.overseas airways,civil aeronautics,see also york,at.even so,a claim of such private carriage must show that the private activity is distinguishable from the public or common transportation business regularly carried on.the claimed private carriage must be viewed in relation to and against the background of the entire carrying activity.overseas airways,at.
here,though the record on this issue is scant,a susquehanna officer testified that it publishes its charges for hauling waste,app.at,which indicates that it holds itself out to the public as available to transport waste.b requiring that common carriers provide their rates upon request.moreover,as susquehanna points out,there is nothing in the record and no apparent allegation that it has ever turned away a potential waste customer.thus,if we follow the circuit court of appeals command to view susquehanna operation against the background of the entire carrying activity,it appears merely part of its overall operation.overseas airways,at.susquehanna holds itself out as willing to haul waste for a reasonable and publicly available rate it does,in fact,haul waste for multiple customers and there is no evidence of it turning away a customer.moreover,susquehanna expert testified credited by the district court that the industry lends itself to arrangements in which a middleman shipper consolidates demand so as to generate multiple carloads that can be transported to a landfill as a group.this saves the cost of down the line.allowing multiple shippers to load at a single transload facility would be difficult because their waste would have to be stored separately as they presumably would not have contracts with the same landfills,requiring more space than many facilities can easily muster given the narrowness of railroad.thus the norm is for railroads to build large customers their own dedicated facilities at different points on the same rail line and to leave some capacity open for smaller shippers.
in the context of shipping bulk waste,we believe the concept of common carrier must be flexible enough to accommodate reasonable commercial practice.indeed,in its decisions the board merely defines the term common carrier as a person or entity that holds itself out to the general public as engaged in the business of transporting persons or property from place to place for compensation.am.orient express ry,wl,at,declaratory order.in determining whether there has been a holding out,one must look to the character of the service of the party in relation to the public.id.quoting.on this record it appears that susquehanna holds itself out to the public as providing waste transport services in the manner common in the industry.this,we believe,is sufficient to affirm the district court determination that susquehanna acts as a common carrier.
iii.whether the regulations fall within the scope of federal preemption 
a.the scope of the termination act preemption clause 
having established that susquehanna storage and transloading activities qualify as transportation by a rail carrier under the termination act,the next question is whether the act preempts the state attempt to regulate the environmental effects of these activities.the termination act states that the remedies provided under this part with respect to the regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under federal and state law.b internal paragraph divisions omitted.keeping in mind that a federal law does not preempt state laws where the activity regulated by the state is merely a peripheral concern of the federal law,san diego.trades council,millmen union,local garmon,d,we must look to the termination act remedies with respect to the regulation of rail transportation,b,to determine its core concerns.the termination act regulates,inter alia,rail carriers rates,terms of service,accounting practices,ability to merge with one another,and authority to acquire and construct rail lines.see generally.thus it regulates the economics and finances of the rail carriage provides a panoply of remedies when rail carriers break the rules.see.
because the act subject matter is limited to deregulation of the railroad industry.coast ry.city of palm beach,cir,courts and the board have rightly held that it does not preempt all state regulation affecting transportation by rail carrier.see green mountain,at rail,pinelands comm n,d,vill.of ridgefield park,susquehanna ry,riverdale,wl,at s tate or local regulation is permissible where it does not interfere with interstate rail operations.contrary to new jersey and the amici argument,the termination act does not preempt only explicit economic regulation.rather,it preempts all state laws that may reasonably be said to have the effect of managing or governing rail transportation,while permitting the continued application of laws having a more remote or incidental effect on rail transportation.coast ry,at internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.what matters is the degree to which the challenged regulation burdens rail transportation,not whether it is styled as economic or environmental.
soon after congress enacted the termination act,the newly created surface transportation board ruled that,while broad,the act preemption clause does not usurp the right of state and local entities to impose appropriate public health and safety regulation on interstate railroads,so long as those regulations do not interfere with or unreasonably burden railroading.king county,wl,at.in cities of auburn kent,wa,wl,at declaratory order,the board expounded further 
t here are areas with respect to railroad activity that are reasonably within the local authorities jurisdiction under the constitution.for example,even in cases where we approve a construction or abandonment project,a local law prohibiting the railroad from dumping excavated earth into local waterways would appear to be a reasonable exercise of local police power.similarly,as noted by the secretary of transportation,a state or local gov
