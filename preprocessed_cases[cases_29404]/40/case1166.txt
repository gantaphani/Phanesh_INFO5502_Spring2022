opinion of the court 
senator ronald russell of the legislature of the virgin islands here challenges the validity of the nominations and appointments of judges maria cabret,ive swan,and rhys hodge as justices of the supreme court of the virgin islands.governor charles turnbull submitted those nominations to the legislature and,at a special session called for that purpose,the legislature voted unanimously to confirm justices cabret,swan and hodge in his complaint,senator russell sought,inter alia,a declaration from the district court that the justices commissions were void because the governor failed to comply with the statutory deadline for submitting his nominations to the legislature and because the governor exceeded his statutory authority under section a of the organic act,a,by calling the special session at which the nominees were confirmed.senator russell appeals from the district court order dismissing his complaint.we conclude that senator russell lacks standing to pursue both counts of his complaint.
on october,governor turnbull approved act,which established the supreme court of the virgin islands.act provides that t he governor shall appoint,with the advice and consent of the legislature,three justices and subject to the advice and consent of the legislature,appoint a qualified person to fill any vacancy occurring in the office of justice in the supreme court.
section a of act provides a time frame for the governor to submit his initial nominations to the legislature 
notwithstanding title virgin islands code,chapter,as added by section of this act,the governor shall submit nominations for the associate justices of the supreme court to the legislature within ninety days after the effective date of any act appropriating monies to fund the operations of the supreme court.
on december,the legislature passed act over governor turnbull veto.section of act provides that t he virgin islands public finance authority shall make available,forthwith,to the superior court of the virgin islands the sum of million dollars to construct and establish the virgin islands supreme court on croix.
on july,days later,governor turnbull submitted the nominations of justices cabret,swan,and hodge to the legislature.on october,governor turnbull called a special session of the legislature,which he scheduled for october,for the purpose of considering his nominees and a proposed bill regarding funding for the supreme court.at the special session,senator russell made two motions seeking to delay the vote on the nominees until november,and to send them back to the senate judiciary committee.he lost both motions by close margins,and the legislature unanimously voted to confirm all three nominees.
count i of senator russell complaint sought a declaration that the nominations were null and void because they were not submitted to the legislature within ninety days after the effective date of any act appropriating monies to fund the operations of the supreme court,as required by section a of act.count ii sought a declaration that the governor act of calling a special session of the legislature was a violation of the doctrine of separation of powers.specifically,senator russell asserted that the governor power to call special sessions under a of the organic act,a,is limited to doing so for the purpose of considering legislation,and that he may not call a special session for the purpose of having his judicial nominees considered.the district court dismissed senator russell complaint.as to count i,the court applied the principles set forth in cort ash,d,and held that the statute setting forth the deadline does not confer a private right of action on senator russell.as to count ii,the district court held that senator russell lacked standing under article iii of the constitution because he had not suffered an injury in fact.senator russell now appeals.
this appeal presents questions regarding the standing of a legislator to sue another government official in court to redress an injury the legislator claims to have suffered in his official capacity,rather than as a private citizen.legislators,like other litigants in federal court,must satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisites of article iii standing including the requirement that the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact,constituting an invasion of a legally protected interest that is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.united states hays,d see also allen wright,d.
concerns for separation of powers and the limited role of the judiciary are at the core of article iii standing doctrine and the requirement that a plaintiff allege an injury in fact.see daimlerchrysler cuno,d allen,at.warth seldin,d.those concerns are particularly acute in legislator standing cases,and they inform the analysis of whether a legislator plaintiff has asserted an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing to sue.see alaska legislative council babbitt,chenoweth clinton,goldwater carter.en banc,vacated on other grounds,d charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure,at ed.supp describing the supreme court analysis of legislator standing in raines byrd,d as standing indeed virtually political question concerns.with these general principles in mind,we turn to the specific injuries that senator russell alleges in his complaint.
in the proceedings before the district court,senator russell testified that,in his view,the deadline in act was intended to extinguish the governor authority to submit nominations after the deadline had passed.senator russell argues that the governor refusal to honor this deadline injures him by nullifying his vote in favor of that law.we disagree.
the supreme court,this court,and others have held that legislators have a legally protected interest in their right to vote on legislation and other matters committed to the legislature,which is sometimes phrased as an interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes.see coleman miller.t hese senators have a plain,direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes.babbitt,at in narrow circumstances,legislators have a judicially recognized,personal interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes.dennis,at recognizing an injury to the legislators interest in their right to advise and consent kennedy sampson,a ppellee object in this lawsuit is to vindicate the effectiveness of his vote.no more essential interest could be asserted by a legislator.not every affront to a legislator interest in the effectiveness of his vote,however,is an injury in fact sufficient to confer standing to sue.see chiles thornburgh,cir a precise definition of what type of loss of effectiveness of a congressman vote is judicially cognizable is of crucial significance to the standing inquiry.too broad a definition would allow a legislator to rush to court whenever he lost a vote and too narrow a definition might allow abuses of the legislative process to go unchecked.
in particular,the authorities appear to hold uniformly that an official mere disobedience or flawed execution of a law for which a legislator appears to be the gravamen of count i of senator russell not an injury in fact for standing purposes.see id.at rejecting the argument that the defendants failure to comply with these laws deprived the senator of the effectiveness of his vote on the legislation and that the deprivation constitutes a legally cognizable injury goldwater,at stating a test for legislator standing that distinguishes between complete withdrawal or nullification of a voting opportunity and a diminution in a legislator effectiveness,subjectively judged by him or her,resulting from executive action withholding information or failing to obey a statute enacted through the legislator vote,where the still has power to act through the legislative process to remedy the alleged abuses,the latter of which is insufficient to confer standing on the legislator daughtrey carter,no legislator standing to challenge executive nonenforcement of a law harrington bush,no legislator standing to sue the executive for diso
