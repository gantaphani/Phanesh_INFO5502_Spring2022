the pennsylvania attorney general and the executive director of the state ethics commission appeal the district court grant of a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of.k,a state statute mandating confidentiality in proceedings before the state ethics commission.we agree with the district court that this statute,to the extent it prohibits a complainant from disclosing his own complaint and the fact that it was filed,unconstitutionally constrains political speech.we will affirm the narrow preliminary injunction granted by the district court.
background 
gene stilp,plaintiff in this action,is a government watchdog who takes great pride in publicly protesting actions of public officials within pennsylvania state government.stilp describes himself as one of the and most public protestors of fraud,waste and corruption within commonwealth government.one of stilp tools for combating public corruption is the pennsylvania public official and employee ethics act ethics act,et.however,the confidentiality provision of the ethics act precludes stilp from publicizing the fact that he is filing a complaint with the state ethics commission.the limited question presented on appeal is whether,under the first amendment,the state may subject stilp to civil sanction or criminal punishment for publicly disclosing his own complaint and the fact that he has filed it or intends to file it with the state ethics commission.
a.the state ethics act 
the pennsylvania legislature enacted the ethics act to promote ethical conduct and integrity among individuals holding public office.the ethics act statement of purpose provides 
that public office is a public trust and that any effort to realize personal financial gain through public office other than compensation provided by law is a violation of that trust.in order to strengthen the faith and confidence of the people of this commonwealth in their government,the legislature further declares that the people have a right to be assured that the financial interests of holders of or nominees or candidates for public office do not conflict with the public trust.
id.a.the ethics act provides,inter alia,that n o public official or public employee shall engage in conduct that constitutes a conflict of interest.id.a.
to implement and enforce the ethics act,the legislature authorized the creation of a state ethics commission empowered to m ake recommendations to law enforcement officials either for criminal prosecution or dismissal of charges arising out of violations of the ethics act.id.defendant john contino is executive director of the ethics commission.
the ethics act sets forth procedures for the filing and investigation of a complaint.upon receiving a complaint signed under penalty of perjury by any person or upon its own motion,the commission,through its executive director,shall conduct a preliminary inquiry into any alleged violation,to be completed within days.id.at a.if a preliminary inquiry establishes reason to believe that this chapter has been violated,the commission may,through its executive director,initiate an investigation to determine if there has been a violation.id.c.
the ethics act prohibits the filing of frivolous complaints,an infraction which the ethics commission is empowered to investigate.id.l.any person who willfully affirms or swears falsely in regard to any material matter may be punished by a fine and five years imprisonment.id.e.a person harmed by wrongful use of the ethics act,including the filing of frivolous complaints,is entitled to damages for 
the harm to his reputation by a defamatory matter alleged as the basis of the proceeding.
the expenses,including any reasonable attorney fees,that he has reasonably incurred in proceedings before the commission.
any specific pecuniary loss that has resulted from the proceedings.
any emotional distress that has been caused by the proceedings.
any punitive damages according to law in appropriate cases.
section k of the ethics act,the provision challenged in this action,mandates confidentiality in all proceedings before the ethics commission.absent exceptions inapplicable here,section k provides that no person shall disclose or acknowledge to any other person any information relating to a complaint which is before the commission.according to the ethics commission,section k does not prohibit a complainant from disclosing substantive allegations of unethical conduct,but it does prohibit a complainant from disclosing the fact that a complaint has been filed with the ethics commission and disclosing a plan or intent to file a complaint with the ethics commission.a.violation of section k confidentiality mandate is punishable by a fine and one year imprisonment.e.
stilp prior ethics act petition 
in november,stilp prepared an ethics act complaint alleging the improper use of public funds for political purposes by a prominent member of the state legislature.before filing the complaint,stilp issued a press release stating that the pennsylvania state ethics commission will be asked to investigate the use of taxpayer funds for political purposes.the contracts totaled during.t he complaint is attached.stilp press release successfully attracted media attention at least three separate news articles reported the allegations asserted in his complaint.the ethics commission,however,declined to open an investigation and summarily dismissed stilp complaint one day after filing.
unfortunately for stilp,the publicity caused by his press release led the investigative division of the ethics commission to open an inquiry into whether stilp had violated section k.by letter of january,defendant contino summarized the alleged violation 
that eugene stilp,a private citizen violated section k when he publicly disclosed or caused to be disclosed that a complaint against a public official had been filed with the commission by disclosing or acknowledging to other persons information relating to a complaint he was filing or filed with the state ethics commission regarding the conduct of the majority leader of the house democratic caucus by providing copies of the complaint to the media 
on december,stilp settled the matter by consent decree,admitting a violation of section k and paying a civil fine of.in its written adjudication,the ethics commission emphasized that stilp violated section k by announcing his intention to file an ethics act complaint t he prohibition of section k of the ethics act encompasses a complaint that will be pending before the commission.
this action,brought under,asserts a facial challenge to the constitutionality of section k.stilp seeks declaratory and injunctive relief rendering the confidentiality provisions of section k unconstitutional and unenforceable on grounds that they abridge the freedom of speech guaranteed by the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.stilp wishes to file additional complaints under the ethics act,and to do so publicly,but fears civil sanction or criminal prosecution for violating section k.stilp,however,does not challenge the ethics commission december,adjudication.
the district court,following an evidentiary hearing at which stilp and contino testified,held that stilp had satisfied the requirements for preliminary injunctive relief and issued an order enjoining defendants from enforcing k against a complainant that discloses the fact that he or she filed a complaint with the commission.defendants appealed.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under and we have jurisdiction under a we review the grant of injunctive relief involving first amendment rights by conduct ing an independent examination of the factual record as a whole.miller mitchell,cir quoting mcternan city of york,cir 
analysis of the district court preliminary injunction 
a district court may grant a preliminary injunction where the requesting party demonstrates a likelihood of success on the merits he or she will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied granting relief will not result in even greater harm to the nonmoving party and the public interest favors such relief.miller,at.
because this action involves the alleged suppression of speech in violation of the first amendment,we focus our attention on the first factor,whether stilp is likely to succeed on the merits of his constitutional claim.see,elrod burns,d the loss of first amendment freedoms,for even minimal periods of time,unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.defendants concede that,if we find that stilp is likely to succeed on the merits,the other requirements for a preliminary injunction are satisfied.
section provides a civil remedy for violation of the united states constitution by persons acting under color of law.the first amendment provides that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech,const.amend.i,thus affording broad protection from governmental intrusion for conduct involving expression.although,when ratified,the first amendment limitation on legislative power applied only to congress,the guarantee of free speech was later applied to regulation by state government.gitlow new york.freedom of speech protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.a s a general matter,the first amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message,its ideas,its subject matter,or its content.ashcroft aclu,d internal quotation marks omitted.prohibition of such expression is presumptively invalid.united states stevens,d.

here,the ethics commission has construed section k to prohibit disclosure of the fact that an ethics act complaint has been,or will be,filed.in landmark communications,virginia,the supreme court addressed the inherent constitutional tension created by confidential governmental proceedings,d.the petitioner in landmark asserted a facial challenge to a virginia statute that prohibited disclosure of information concerning proceedings before the state judicial inquiry and review commission,empowered to investigate allegations of judicial misconduct.the statute prohibited disclosing the identity of the judge under investigation and classified the offense as a misdemeanor.
the virginian pilot,a landmark newspaper,obtained and published accurate information about a pending judicial inquiry,including the identity of the judge under investigation and the fact that a formal complaint had not yet been filed.in response,a state grand jury indicted landmark for violating the confidentiality statute.at trial,testimony revealed that landmark believed the confidentiality statute applied only to parties appearing before the review commission.because landmark never entered an appearance in the proceeding,landmark editors believed it was lawful to publish information concerning a matter of public importance.the state trial court disagreed.it held the statute was applicable to nonparticipants and found landmark guilty.
landmark appealed to the virginia supreme court,which applied the clear and present danger test to balance the government interest in preserving confidentiality against landmark right of publication under the first amendment.the virginia supreme court identified three state interests advanced by confidentiality 
a protection of a judge reputation from the adverse publicity which might flow from frivolous complaints,b maintenance of confidence in the judicial system by preventing the premature disclosure of a complaint before the commission has determined that the charge is well founded,and c protection of complainants and witnesses from possible recrimination by prohibiting disclosure until the validity of the complaint has been ascertained.
id.at.concluding that the review commission could not function without confidentiality,the virginia supreme court held that the statute was indispensable to the suppression of a clear and present danger posed by the premature disclosure of the commission sensitive proceedings the imminent impairment of the effectiveness of the commission and the accompanying immediate threat to the orderly administration of justice.id.
the united states supreme court granted landmark petition for review and reversed.the court began its analysis by enumerating the state interests putatively advanced by confidentiality encouraging the filing of complaints and participation of witnesses,insulating judges from reputational harm caused by frivolous complaints,maintaining confidence in the judiciary by avoiding premature disclosure of frivolous claims,and creating an incentive for judges to resign voluntarily to avoid negative publicity.id.at.the court found those interests,while legitimate,were insufficient to justify imposing criminal sanctions for engaging in speech that would otherwise be free.id.at.quoting justice frankfurter,the court explained that speech can not be punished when the purpose is simply to protect the court as a mythical entity or the judges as individuals or as anointed priests set apart from the community and spared the criticism to which in a democracy other public servants are exposed.id.at.
the court then considered whether the first amendment limits the contempt power of courts to impose punishment for judicial criticism and statements interfering with grand jury investigations.see bridges california.reversing contempt convictions pennekamp florida.same craig harney.same wood georgia,d reversing contempt conviction where there was no evidence that petitioner statements actually interfered with grand jury investigation.the landmark court found this line of authority broadly protects the freedom of expression 
what emerges from these cases is the working principle that the substantive evil must be extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high before utterances can be punished,and that a solidity of evidence is necessary to make the requisite showing of imminence.the danger must not be remote or even probable it must immediately imperil.
the threat to the administration of justice posed by the speech and publications in bridges,pennekamp,craig,and wood was,if anything,more direct and substantial than the threat posed by landmark article.if the test could not be satisfied in the more extreme circumstances of those cases,it would seem to follow that the test can not be met here.
landmark at at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in holding the virginia confidentiality statute unconstitutional,the court explained that the need for confidentiality must yield to the first amendment it is true that some risk of injury to the judge under inquiry,to the system of justice,or to the operation of the judicial inquiry and review commission may be posed by premature disclosure,but the test requires that the danger be clear and present and in our view the risk here falls far short of that requirement.id.at.
defendants argue that landmark is distinguishable because the virginian pilot was a third party with no involvement in the judicial review proceeding,whereas here,stilp is the party who seeks to initiate an ethics act proceeding.defendants contend that,unlike third parties,if stilp chooses to utilize the ethics act as a forum for political debate,then he must abide by section k confidentiality mandate.we reject this distinction on two grounds.first,the purported harm caused by disclosing the fact that a complaint was filed does not vary according to the identity of the disclosing party.second,the complainant interest in publicizing his own political speech is certainly as strong,if not stronger
