marta carrasquillo,an employee at the puerto rico department of corrections and rehabilitation the dcr,brought a civil rights action under against the commonwealth of puerto rico,the dcr,and various dcr officials collectively,defendants,alleging political discrimination in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments.the united states district court for the district of puerto rico granted summary judgment in favor of defendants,a decision carrasquillo now appeals.after careful consideration,we affirm.
factual background 
the dcr hired carrasquillo in.in october,carrasquillo was promoted to investigating agent i,and was assigned to work in the intelligence unit of the auxiliary secretariat for the investigation of the correctional system the saisc,for its spanish acronym.between and,carrasquillo worked under the supervision of one of the defendants,norberto jiménez,an investigative agent in the saisc.in march,jiménez resigned from the dcr,and carrasquillo took his place as supervisor of the intelligence unit of the saisc.
on september,carrasquillo was again promoted,this time to investigative agent ii to reflect her added supervisory responsibilities.among other duties,carrasquillo was responsible for disciplining employees and authorizing vacation time,sick leave,adjustments to records,and overtime.
in august,jiménez returned to the dcr after being appointed special assistant to the secretary of the dcr.upon his return,jiménez again assumed the supervision of the saisc intelligence unit,thereby replacing carrasquillo.
carrasquillo alleges that,as supervisor of the saisc intelligence unit,jiménez took away many of the professional responsibilities she had before his return to the unit.for example,carrasquillo alleges that jiménez ordered her to perform clerical duties until he could hire a secretary.she also claims that he had her name removed from reports filed by investigative agents.carrasquillo states that she was generally not allowed to participate in field operations,and that when she was asked to participate in an operation,she was told to show up at an hour after the operation had concluded.she also alleges that after jiménez took over the supervision of the intelligence unit,there were a number of days in which carrasquillo was not given work assignments.
carrasquillo further states that in april,jiménez took over her office space.she claims that when she was transferred to a new work area,she was asked to return several items,including official license plates,a radio,a vest,keys to a governmental vehicle,and a gas card for a governmental vehicle.carrasquillo alleges that she complained to jiménez about the fact that he had divested her of supervisory functions and assigned her menial job tasks and told him that she felt marginalized,harassed,and discriminated against as a result.carrasquillo also testified that at some point,jiménez called her into his office and told her,we are in power the members of the popular democratic i have the power to kick out of here anybody i want.
although carrasquillo alleges that her professional duties and office location changed after jiménez return to the dcr,she admits that her job title and salary scale were not altered.the record shows that the only change affecting her salary was that after jiménez replaced carrasquillo as supervisor of saisc,she became eligible for overtime pay,whereas she had not been entitled to such pay as supervisor.
carrasquillo is a member of the new progressive party npp in puerto rico,while jiménez is a member of the popular democratic party pdp.carrasquillo claims that her affiliation and activism in the npp were well known within the dcr because she was listed in the party roster,openly participated in political campaigns,raised campaign funds for a mayor of canóvanas,worked as an electoral officer,regularly attended npp rallies,and worked tallying votes during election time.carrasquillo further contends that when she was replaced by jiménez,she suffered a de facto demotion on the basis of her membership in the npp.
on june,carrasquillo filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico alleging political discrimination in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments,age discrimination in violation of the age discrimination in employment act of adea,and violation of various state law provisions.on july,defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under.c.before the district court addressed its rule c motion,the dcr filed a motion for summary judgment on september.
carrasquillo did not respond to defendants rule c motion within the time prescribed.carrasquillo sought an extension to file the opposition,but on october,the district court denied carrasquillo request as untimely and deemed defendants motion unopposed.thereafter,carrasquillo timely filed an opposition to defendants summary judgment motion.however,in her opposition,carrasquillo did not provide a statement admitting,denying,or qualifying defendants statement of uncontested facts,as required by local rule c.see civ.c a party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate,short,and concise statement of material facts.the opposing statement shall admit,deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted,shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation.instead,carrasquillo filed her own statement of uncontested facts,which did not reference or relate to defendants filing.
on march,the court granted in part and denied in part defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings.the court dismissed carrasquillo adea claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.in addition,upon finding that the dcr is an arm of the commonwealth of puerto rico and no indication that puerto rico has waived its eleventh amendment immunity,the court also dismissed all claims for monetary damages against the commonwealth,the dcr,and the individual defendants in their official capacities.carrasquillo first amendment,fourteenth amendment,and supplemental claims survived the early dismissal.only jiménez,who was sued in his personal capacity,remained as a defendant.
on july,the court granted jiménez request for summary judgment.the court found that carrasquillo had failed to specifically deny,qualify,or otherwise object to jiménez statement of uncontested facts in her opposition,as was required by local rule c.the court concluded that,under these circumstances,the facts submitted by jiménez,including sworn affidavits stating that jiménez did not know about carrasquillo political affiliation,were to be deemed uncontested,and therefore admitted by carrasquillo.the court held that,having failed to rebut the assertion that jiménez lacked any knowledge of carrasquillo political affiliation,carrasquillo could not establish a prima facie case of political discrimination.
the district court went on to hold that carrasquillo political discrimination claim failed even if it were to consider her nonconforming supplemental statement of uncontested facts because her factual assertions were not sufficient to demonstrate a causal connection linking defendants allegedly discriminatory acts to carrasquillo political beliefs or association.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court order granting summary judgment de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,with all reasonable inferences drawn in her favor.see rodríguez smithkline beecham,cir.
the right to associate with the political party of one choice is an integral part of the basic constitutional freedom to associate with others for the common advancement of political beliefs and ideas protected by the first amendment.kusper pontikes,d.public employees therefore generally enjoy protection from adverse employment actions based on their political affiliations.see branti finkel,d.this protection extends to changes in employment,which,although not as extreme as dismissal,result in working conditions unreasonably inferior to the norm for the posit
