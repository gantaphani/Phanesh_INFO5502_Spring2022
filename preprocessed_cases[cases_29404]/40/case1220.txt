opinion of the court 
this case arises from the claim of an american indian nation to a portion of its aboriginal land.for the reasons that follow,we find that any aboriginal rights held by the delaware nation to the land known as tatamy place were extinguished by thomas penn via the walking purchase of.we also find that the tribe does not hold fee title to tatamy place.thus,the district court properly dismissed the delaware nation claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a cause of action.the delaware nation commonwealth of,et,dist.lexis,wl.accordingly,we will affirm the dismissal order of the district court although we do not base our conclusion on the same reasoning.
background 
in january,the delaware nation filed this lawsuit,as the successor in interest and political continuation of the lenni lenape and of lenni lenape chief moses tundy tatamy,claiming aboriginal and fee title to acres of land located in northampton county,pennsylvania,known as tatamy place.the defendants in this case are residents or businesses,currently occupying the land,or government entities sanctioning the tenants possession.the delaware nation seeks to enforce its rights to tatamy place pursuant to the trade and intercourse act,also known as the indian nonintercourse act,and federal common law.the delaware nation is seeking both equitable relief and monetary damages.
the history of tatamy place is yet another sad example of our forefathers interactions with the indian nations.the following historical allegations are taken from the complaint and the public record in,william penn secured a charter from king charles ii for what is now pennsylvania.through the charter,william penn and his heirs were vested with control of pennsylvania land as its proprietor william penn formed a government consisting of three branches a governor with limited powers,a legislative council empowered to propose legislation,and a general assembly empowered to approve or reject the legislative initiatives proposed by the council.sections xvii through xix of the charter established a proprietary government that gave penn broad powers in selling or renting his lands.those purchasing land from him must have his approval of any method they themselves might use to sell the land to others.penn government provided for secure private property.
in contrast to governors of other colonies,william penn achieved peaceful relations with the indians,including the lenni lenape,by acquiring land through purchase rather than conquest.william penn son,thomas,was one of the eventual successors to his father interests in pennsylvania in,thomas penn executed the walking purchase with the delaware nation.this purchase included tatamy place.to make a tragic story short,the walking purchase was the result of a massive fraud perpetuated by thomas penn on the delaware nation 
although most members of the delaware nation left the area following the walking purchase,a leader of the group,chief tatamy,continued to occupy tatamy place with the approval of the penns.in consideration for chief tatamy friendship towards the white settlers,he was issued two land patents for tatamy of which postdate the walking purchase.the first patent was dated april,and the second was dated january.
the patent provided 
at the instance and request of the said tundy tatamy in consideration of his surrendering and delivering up to be cancelled the said former patent of the said premises of the sum of forty eight pounds sixteen shillings and five pence lawful money of pennsylvania to our use paid by the said tundy tatamy we have given granted released confirmed and by these presents for us our heirs and successors do grant release and confirm unto said tundy tatamy and his heirs the said three hundred and fifteen acres of land as the same now set forth 
also,chief tatamy had to seek special permission from the provincial council of pennsylvania to remain in tatamy place following the walking purchase.the minutes of the provincial council meeting of november,indicate that the governor granted permission to chief tatamy to remain on his land on the express condition that the other petitioners were by no means to be included in this permission,nor any other of the delaware indians,whom they call their cousins,nor any besides themselves and their proper families dwelling in the same houses with them.iv minutes of the provincial council at.
after chief tatamy,the history of the title to the land is not clear.the next record concerning tatamy place is a deed recorded on march,in which edward shipper,as the executor of the estate of william allen,conveys the land to the strecher family.the deed recites a purported agreement between the strechers and allen forty years prior to allen death.nonetheless,the history fails to explain how title passed from chief tatamy to william allen or his predecessors.
the delaware nation complaint alleges two general theories as to why the group is entitled to recovery.first,the delaware nation contends that,because tatamy place was taken by deception via the walking purchase,the tribe aboriginal rights were never validly extinguished.as such,the delaware nation has a right of continued occupancy and use consistent with the doctrine of discovery.second,the delaware nation,as the successor in interest to chief tatamy,claims fee title to tatamy place based on the land grants from the proprietors.the delaware nation further asserts that the subsequent alienation of fee title from chief tatamy violated the trade and intercourse act of.stat,
on november,the district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a cause of action.the delaware nation,dist.lexis fed.civ.proc.b.the district court,having found that the delaware nation admitted that thomas penn had the sovereign authority to take tatamy place,ruled that thomas penn method of acquisition,fraud,was legally irrelevant.moreover,the district court found that the nonintercourse act was inapplicable in this case because tatamy place did not represent tribal land.the delaware nation appealed.

iii.discussion 
thomas penn extinguishment of aboriginal rights 
the doctrine of discovery,which governs the relationship between the european colonial powers and the indians,holds that the discovering nation takes fee title to the land,subject to the aboriginals right of occupancy and use.county of oneida oneida indian nation of new york state,d johnson,wheat.all our institutions recognise the absolute title of the crown,subject only to the indian right of occupancy,and recognise the absolute title of the crown to extinguish that right.the indians right of occupancy and use aboriginal title could only be extinguished with the consent of the sovereign.county of oneida,at.the delaware nation claims in its appeal that the king of thomas the sovereign over the territory that included tatamy place.therefore,thomas penn could not extinguish aboriginal title via the walking purchase and,consequently,the delaware nation maintains a right of occupancy and use.
the delaware nation argument fails because the issue of thomas penn lack of sovereign authority was not raised before the district court.the delaware nation,dist.lexis,plaintiff does not contest that thomas penn and the other pr
