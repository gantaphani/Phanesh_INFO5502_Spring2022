in,shortly after all three plaintiffs were formed,plaintiffs purchased the john inn and surrounding land,an hotel and restaurant located on acres in the city of myrtle beach,looking to further development.sunrise then examined the zoning regulations,decided on a proposal for a tower with,obtained financing,entered negotiations with a builder,and began to execute contracts to individual units in the new tower.

in mid,sunrise applied for a permit to build the new hotel.they then submitted to the board a proposal that complied with all of the zoning ordinances.the board suggested changes to the proposal and later held a second hearing.this hearing was attended by residents of the area who voiced opposition to sunrise proposal.after the hearing,the board denied the proposal,citing section of the city code.sunrise then appealed the board decision to the city council and was granted a hearing where area residents again voiced opposition to the proposal.five days later the city council denied the proposal because of its view that the proposal violated sections and of the city code.plaintiffs then appealed the decision of the city council to the circuit court.
while the appeal of the city council decision was still pending,plaintiffs brought the instant action in the court of common pleas of horry county,a state court,seeking to recover their costs as well as lost profits from the of units in the proposed tower.the complaint asserted causes of action against the city council as well as several individual members of the board.the complaint sought damages under for violations of the due process,equal protection,and takings clauses for attorney fees and inverse condemnation under south carolina state law.the defendants then removed the case to federal district court.the parties agreed to stay this action until the resolution of the state court appeal of the city council denial of plaintiffs proposal.
on may,the court of common pleas issued an order reversing the decision of the city council withholding the permit,finding that myrtle beach decision violated the holding of peterson outdoor advertising city of myrtle beach,board denial of proposal must be based on application of the city code to the facts of the case,because it was arbitrary,subjective,without evidentiary support,an abuse of discretion,and a denial of plaintiffs due process and equal protection rights.the court then determined that would be futile and ordered myrtle beach to issue the permit to sunrise.at some point in,plaintiffs sold the site for approximately four million dollars.
myrtle beach appealed the court of common pleas decision to the south carolina court of appeals,which affirmed in.an appeal was then taken by myrtle beach to the supreme court of south carolina,which initially granted certiorari,but later dismissed the writ as improvidently granted.at that point defendants made the permit available to plaintiffs.
after the supreme court of south carolina dismissed the writ of certiorari,the district court lifted its stay in this case,and both parties later filed motions for summary judgment.at the hearing on the motions,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment which contended that the south carolina court of appeals decision was res judicata of their due process and equal protection claims,as well as granted defendants motion for summary judgment on those same claims.the district court also reserved ruling on the rest of defendants motion.plaintiffs then filed a motion for reconsideration.the district court held a hearing on that motion,after which it improvidently dismissed two of the plaintiffs for lack of prudential standing denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration,and granted the defendants motion for summary judgment as to the takings and inverse condemnation claims.
on appeal,plaintiffs advance five arguments as to how the district court allegedly erred.first plaintiffs assert that the district court erred by holding that myrtle beach was not barred by res judicata from arguing that it had not violated plaintiffs due process,equal protection and fifth amendment rights.second,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in holding that sunrise development and s h development,did not have prudential standing third,plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in dismissing their due process claims and argue the board actions were illegitimate under the guise of the esthetic ordinance.fourth,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by dismissing their equal protection claim because they failed to present evidence as to being similarly situated and the victim of illegitimate discretion.lastly,plaintiffs assert that the district court erred in dismissing their takings and inverse condemnation claims by holding that their intended use of the property was not an antecedent property right and that the delay was caused by the time required to get judicial review.

plaintiffs assert that the district court erred by not applying the doctrine of res judicata to bar myrtle beach from arguing that its actions did not violate their constitutional rights.the judgment they argue should be given res judicata effect is the decision of the common pleas court which stated that myrtle beach actions were arbitrary,subjective,without evidentiary support,an abuse of discretion,merely a pretense to stop development,and a denial of plaintiffs due process and equal protection rights.

even if we consider the requirement of identity of the subject matter to be satisfied,which is not at all certain,the federal constitutional rights of due process and equal protection were not adjudicated in the south carolina court of appeals that proceeding was nothing other than a court review of an administrative determination by local zoning authority.that court summarized its decision as follows we conclude the decision of city council was arbitrary because it was based,not on the evidence in the reco
