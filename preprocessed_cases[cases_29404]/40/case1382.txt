appellant collezione europa usa,incorporated collezione,and its adversary in this proceeding,appellee universal furniture international,incorporated universal,are competing furniture companies.in,universal sued collezione in the middle district of north carolina,alleging infringement under the copyright act with respect to two of universal furniture collections,as well as violations of the lanham act and the north carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices act the udtpa.in opposing the copyright claim,collezione argued that the furniture at issue is not copyrightable.the district court disagreed,however,concluding that universal possessed valid copyrights in its furniture designs and that collezione had infringed those copyrights.see universal furniture int l,collezione europa usa,the liability opinion the court also concluded in its liability opinion that collezione had misrepresented universal furniture lines as its own,in contravention of both the lanham act and the udtpa.after conducting a thorough hearing on the damages issues,the court awarded more than million to universal.see universal furniture int l,collezione europa usa,the damages opinion 
collezione has appealed from the rulings made in the liability opinion,in favor of universal,under the copyright act,the lanham act,and the udtpa.furthermore,collezione contends that the court erred in the damages opinion in excluding its proof of deductible expenses.as explained below,we affirm.
universal and collezione have been embroiled in litigation since over collezione alleged copying of two of universal furniture collections.collezione has a reputation as being a furniture company that is,one that imitates the designs of its competitors for a lower cost.indeed,collezione president acknowledged that his company routinely imitated other companies furniture designs.
universal is a north business that designs,imports,and distributes furniture that is manufactured outside this country.in,universal predecessor,universal furniture industries,incorporated ufi,entered into a agreement with the norman hekler design firm the service agreement.through a subsequent merger in the merger,ufi became universal furniture limited ufl.in,universal entered into an agreement with ufl the asset agreement.among the assets purchased by universal were all of ufl intellectual property rights,including the service agreement.
steven russell was the hekler designer who created the two universal collections that are the subject of this dispute the grand inheritance collection the gic and the english manor collection the emc.russell designed the gic in and the emc in,and both collections were manufactured for universal by a chinese corporation called lacquercraft.the gic line became available to the public in april and the emc line became available in april.
russell began his design process for the gic and emc lines by consulting public domain sources such as furniture books and antiques magazines.russell then did conceptual doodles by hand until he came up with designs that were pleasing to his eye.russell asserted that he did not simply replicate research references in his designs.rather,he used the references as inspiration and combined elements from the public domain to create a different look than has been seen before.id.at.russell objective was to blend looks from historical periods rather than reproduce a particular period and to bring something new to the party on an historical theme.id.at.although he was influenced by functional concerns in designing the furniture,russell was also motivated by aesthetic goals such as making the furniture attractive to consumers.
in may and november,universal filed registration forms with the copyright office seeking copyright protection for the gic and emc lines.a supplementary registration form filed in july for the gic line described the subject of the registration as the decorative sculptural designs on furniture adaptation of preexisting decorative designs compilation of decorative designs on suites of furniture.similarly,the emc registration form noted that,although the collection contained public domain elemental designs,universal sought copyright protection in the o riginal decorative designs appearing on suites of furniture including original adaptations of public domain designs and original compilations of decorative designs.id.at.the copyright office issued registrations to universal for the gic and emc lines on the same day it received the applications.
in,rhodes major purchaser of the emc and gic collezione seeking a cheaper alternative to universal furniture.as a result,collezione agreed to design furniture that would mimic the emc and gic lines.collezione chief financial officer paul frankel admitted that collezione intended to sell furniture similar to the gic and emc lines.unaware that universal had obtained its copyrights,frankel nevertheless believed that the gic and emc designs were not entitled to copyright protection and that collezione had the right to mimic them.
in,collezione introduced one collection the to imitate the gic line and another collection the to imitate the emc line.collezione displayed the collection at the high point,north carolina furniture market in october.upon learning that collezione was displaying furniture that was nearly identical to the emc line,universal senior vice president stephen giles visited the high point market.giles was shocked by the similarity between collezione collection and the emc line,and also concluded that collezione was displaying furniture actually manufactured by universal.indeed,giles believed that collezione had simply removed universal stickers from some pieces.in some instances,he noticed stickers which he had designed bearing the name of universal manufacturer,lacquercraft.giles took photographs of what he observed and provided the evidence to universal vice president victor hsu.
claiming a violation of its copyrights,universal promptly sent collezione a cease and desist letter.universal also filed suit against collezione in october in the middle district of north carolina,alleging violations of the copyright and lanham acts as well as state law violations of the udtpa.although collezione believed that universal gic and emc lines were not entitled to copyright protection,it agreed to redesign its and collections to distinguish them from the gic and emc lines.collezione also agreed to submit the redesigns to universal before marketing them,but it later displayed the redesigns at a san francisco furniture market and in the magazine furniture today without first submitting them to universal.when the redesigns were finally submitted to universal,they were still substantially similar to the gic and emc designs.
in may,universal sought a preliminary injunction in the district court barring collezione promotion and sale of its and collections.the court denied the motion,however,observing that the design compilations on universal furniture likely were not conceptually separable from the furniture utilitarian function,rendering them unprotectable.we affirmed the district court ruling on the preliminary injunction.see universal furniture int l,collezione europa usa,app x cir.in so doing,however,we emphasized the sparse record and stated that our intention was not to categorically exclude universal and other comparable design compilations from copyright protection.id.at.
in may,universal lawsuit against collezione proceeded to a bench trial in greensboro on the liability issues.the district court thereafter ruled,in its liability opinion,that universal owned its copyrights and that the gic and emc designs were copyrightable.more specifically,the court found that the not the furniture two elements necessary for copyright protection originality and conceptual separability.although the decorative elements of universal designs were derived mostly from the public domain,the court concluded that the designer compilation of the elements was sufficiently unique to meet the test of originality.the court also found the decorative elements conceptually separable from the furniture utilitarian function,because the designer functional considerations ended after he had sketched the basic shapes of the pieces and because the designer selectively placed elements on the furniture to achieve a new look.see liability opinion.
after comparing collezione redesigned and collections to the gic and emc lines,the district court determined that nearly all of collezione furniture in these collections infringed universal copyrights because they were substantially similar to the gic and emc designs on extrinsic and intrinsic levels the court also assessed the extrinsic similarity by comparing the companies furniture collections as a whole.it evaluated the issue of intrinsic similarity by making individual comparisons among the relevant furniture pieces.finally,the court concluded that collezione had violated the lanham act and the udtpa by reverse passing off universal furniture as its own.see liability opinion.the court reserved the issue of damages for later determination.
in november,the district court awarded universal a permanent injunction prohibiting collezione from producing or displaying derivative works of universal gic and emc lines.see universal furniture int l,collezione europa usa,the injunction the injunction also barred collezione from marketing or selling any furniture in its collection except for noninfringing chairs and rectangular tables or its collection.on january,we denied collezione motion to stay the injunction pending appeal.
after collezione filed for bankruptcy in february,universal requested relief from the automatic stay to allow the district court to resolve the damages issues.the bankruptcy court agreed and lifted the stay,and a damages hearing was conducted in the district court in june.
for collezione violation of the copyright act,the court awarded universal more than million,representing the gross revenues that collezione had garnered from selling the infringing items.see damages opinion.although copyright infringers are entitled to seek a reduction in damages by proving deductible expenses and profits unrelated to the infringement activities,the court rejected collezione proof in that regard.the court so ruled after giving collezione repeated opportunities to present an accurate picture of its deductible expenses.the court declined,however,to award damages to universal on either the lanham act or udtpa claims,reasoning that any such damages would be duplicative of those awarded under the copyright act.
collezione has filed a timely notice of appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review a judgment resulting from a bench trial under a mixed standard of findings may be reversed only if clearly erroneous,while conclusions of law are examined de novo.roanoke cement,llc falk,cir.a court calculation of damages is a finding of fact and therefore is reviewable only for clear error,but to the extent those calculations were influenced by legal error,review is de novo.united states ex rel.maddux supply paul fire marine ins,cir.
in disposing of this appeal,we assess the issues in the same order as did the district court.we begin by examining whether universal owned valid copyrights in the gic and emc furniture designs and,if so,whether collezione infringed those copyrights.we then assess whether collezione contravened the lanham act and the udtpa by displaying universal furniture as its own at the high point furniture market in.finally,we review collezione contention that the court erroneously excluded its evidence of deductible expenses in making the damages award.
collezione first challenges the district court conclusion that universal possessed valid copyrights in the gic and emc furniture designs and that collezione infringed those copyrights.in this regard,collezione presents four appellate contentions.first,collezione maintains that the court erred in ruling that universal owned the copyrights.second,collezione insists that universal designs on the gic and emc lines are not sufficiently original for copyright protection.third,collezione contends that the gic and emc designs are not conceptually separable from the furniture utilitarian aspects,and thus not entitled to copyright protection.and fourth,collezione maintains that,even if the gic and emc designs are copyrightable,it did nothing that infringed those copyrights.we address these contentions in turn.
we begin with the issue of whether universal owned the copyrights.the copyright act affords protection to original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression,now known or later developed,from which they can be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated.a.a plaintiff claiming copyright infringement must establish ownership of the copyright by the plaintiff and copying by the defendant.keeler brass cont l brass,cir.a certificate of registration issued by the copyright office is prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate,such as ownership.c.when such a certificate exists,the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that the claimed copyrights are invalid.kramer andrews,cir.however,the copyright office practice of summarily issuing registrations perhaps even the day of filing the application,as in this case counsels against placing too much weight on registrations as proof of a valid copyright.universal furniture,fed.appx.at.accordingly,a reviewing court should assess other relevant indicia of ownership,such as the parties intent and the terms of transfer agreements and other documents establishing a chain of title.see,sco group,novell,cir accusoft palo,cir.
collezione maintains that universal failed to establish a chain of title linking universal to the service agreement between the norman hekler design firm and universal predecessor company,ufi.more specifically,collezione contends that universal did not prove ownership of the copyrights to the emc and gic designs that steven russell of the hekler firm designed after the service agreement was made.
the registrations issued by the copyright office for the gic and emc lines identify universal as the claimant.these registrations were presumptive proof of universal ownership of the asserted copyrights,and the other evidence also suggests that result.the asset agreement between ufl and universal conveys all right,title,and interest to the intellectual property including,but not limited to,the intellectual property listed on schedule e.schedule e,in turn,lists the service agreement between hekler and ufi.the service agreement is also specified as among the contracts explicitly transferred to universal.see id.at.although russell designed the emc in,after the asset agreement,such agreement clearly transferred the intellectual property rights specified in the service agreement.the terms of the service agreement are not,and the asset agreement could therefore include future designs made by hekler employees.indeed,the service agreement provides that hekler shall apply its skill,knowledge,and expertise to the design of each item of furniture as ufi may,from time to time,request in writing.id.at.
in making its argument,collezione misunderstands that it bears the burden of rebutting the presumption of ownership established by the copyright registrations.kramer,at.universal documentation of the merger and the asset agreement links universal to the hekler contract and to russell design of the gic and emc under the service agreement.collezione argues that universal failed to prove that the service agreement was included in the merger between ufi and ufl.nevertheless,the asset agreement between ufl and universal explicitly includes the service agreement with hekler,which indicates that ufi remained a party to the service agreement and thus had the right to transfer that agreement to ufl in the merger.although universal did not present evidence of the specific assets that ufl acquired in the merger,this was not universal burden.finally,although the copyright act generally requires a writing to transfer copyright ownership,it makes exceptions for transfers that occur by operation of law.a.and certain of our sister circuits have ruled that mergers transfer copyrights by operation of law and obviate the writing requirement.see taylor four seasons greetings,llc,cir lone ranger television,program radio,cir.as a result,the district court did not err in concluding that universal established its ownership of the asserted copyrights 
next,we assess whether universal designs on the gic and emc lines are sufficiently original for copyright protection.to claim a valid copyright,universal was obliged to show that the gic and emc designs are original and conceptually separable from the utilitarian aspects of the furniture.superior form builders dan chase taxidermy supply,cir.each of these elements requires fleshing out the term designs because the industrial design of even aesthetically pleasing furniture is not entitled to copyright protection.id.at.recognizing this distinction,the district court properly looked to the copyright registrations that universal filed,which describe the subjects of the protection as the decorative sculptural designs on furniture,the adaptation of preexisting decorative designs,and the compilation of decorative designs on suites of furniture.see liability opinion.
establishing originality implicates only a light burden.original,as the term is used in copyright,means only that the work was independently created by the author as opposed to copied from other works,and that it possesses at least some minimal degree of creativity.feist publ ns,rural.serv.t he requisite level of creativity is extremely low even a slight amount will suffice.the vast majority of works make the grade quite easily,as they possess some creative spark.id.
even when the work at issue is a compilation of preexisting design elements,the originality threshold remains low copyright protection may extend to such a compilation,even if the material of which it is composed is not copyrightable itself it is sufficient if original skill and labor is expended in creating the work.kramer,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the mere fact that component parts of a collective work are neither original to the plaintiff nor copyrightable by the plaintiff does not preclude a determination that the combination of such component parts as a separate entity is both original and copyrightable.id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.for compilations of preexisting elements,the principal focus should be on whether the selection,coordination,and arrangement are sufficiently original to merit protection.feist,at.
the submission of a valid certificate of copyright registration creates a presumption of originality for five years from the date of the registration.swirsky carey,cir.however,as we have explained,this presumption is fairly easy to rebut because the copyright office tends toward cursory issuance of registrations.universal furniture int l,collezione europa usa,fed.appx,cir.t he presumption of validity may be rebutted where other evidence in the record casts doubt on the question,such as evidence that the work had been copied from the public domain or by evidence that the work was a utilitarian article.fonar domenick,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
the supporting evidence in this record demonstrates that the gic and emc designs are original.russell design process satisfied the low burden for originality in that it demonstrated some creative spark and did not involve wholesale copying.feist,at.under the evidence,russell expended original skill and labor in selecting and adapting the decorative elements,and he created an original separate entity by blending elements from different historical periods.kramer,at.his consultation of public domain sources does not render the emc and gic designs for copyright purposes.he did not set out to create an authentic period reproduction in designing the emc and gic furniture.although the ornamental elements placed on the gic and emc furniture were culled from a variety of public domain sources,russell did more than simply copy those sources.he consulted various reference books and magazines and then sketched until he arrived at a design that he deemed to be aesthetically pleasing.russell explained that he than sources.his objective was to bring something new to the party on a historical theme.id.at.he described his skill as offer ing modernized interpretations of historical pieces of furniture,which he accomplished by blending elements to create a different look than has been seen before.id.at.universal expert witness,furniture designer thomas moser,testified that the act of collecting and sorting through,synthesizing from other sizes,in some cases making an artistic leap by joining two vastly different periods together requires a good deal of training and experience and artistry.id.at.although moser agreed that the gic and emc ornamental designs originated in the public domain,he opined that the selection,coordination,and arrangement of these elements reflected russell creative judgment.moser explained that these elements are not simply compiled they pass through the filter of the creator,who takes them and adapts them to serve his purposes.id.at.
in arguing against originality,collezione relies on a single second circuit decision involving a design process that is readily distinguishable from universal.in batlin son,snyder,cir,the appellant took the famous metal uncle sam mechanical bank design and recreated it in plastic.the court of appeals held that the plastic recreation was not sufficiently original for copyright purposes because it was a mere copy of the metal version,and the mere reproduction of a work of art in a different medium should not constitute the required originality.id.at quoting nimmer,the law of copyright,at.the court,however,did not further address the issue of originality in connection with compilations.in this situation,russell did more than simply take decorative designs from the public domain and copy them wholesale on furniture.he modified and arranged the decorative elements in unique ways,which is more than sufficient to satisfy the low threshold for originality.
we turn now to a more vexing question in this case whether universal gic and emc designs are conceptually separable from the utilitarian aspects of such furniture.we must approach this inquiry mindful of the nebulous standard with which the court was obliged to grapple.see masquerade novelty,unique,cir courts have twisted themselves in knots trying to create a test to effectively ascertain whether the artistic aspects of a useful article can be identified separately from and exist independently of the article utilitarian function.bonazoli int l,d,t he conceptual separability analysis often sounds more like metaphysics than law nimmer on copyright,describing conceptual separability as an ethereal realm.when we affirmed the denial of the preliminary injunction sought by universal,we expressed concern that finding the gic and emc designs copyrightable would potentially enlarge the law of copyright beyond its intended borders by extending copyright protection to two entire furniture collections based on their ornate,opulent look alone.universal furniture,fed.appx.at.with the benefit of a full record,however,we are confident that the district court correctly applied the conceptual separability test and did not expand the law to protect any useful article that might be deemed aesthetically pleasing.superior form,at.
copyright protection extends to sculptural works,including some useful articles.a t he design of a useful article shall be considered a sculptural work only if,and only to the extent that,such design incorporates pictorial,graphic,or sculptural features that can be identified separately from,and are capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the article.id.under this conceptual separability test,useful articles may qualify for copyright protection.galiano harrah operating,cir.
congress enacted the current phrasing of the conceptual separability test in order to codify the supreme court holding in mazer stein,at,reprinted in.in mazer,the court held that china statuettes of dancing figures that appeared on the bases of table lamps merited copyright protection.at.although the term conceptual separability does not appear in the mazer decision,the idea is embedded in the court recognition that the statuettes were the original tangible expression of the creator ideas,even though they appeared on an otherwise mundane utilitarian object.id.
in a decision rendered soon after the amended language appeared in the copyright act,the court of appeals for the district of columbia explained the underlying policy concern with which reviewing courts struggle if one manufacturer were given the copyright to the design of a useful article,it could completely prevent others from producing the same article.esquire,ringer.further,consumer preference sometimes demands uniformity of shape for certain utilitarian articles and thus it would be unfair to grant a monopoly on the use of any particular such shape,no matter how aesthetically well it was integrated into a utilitarian article.id.professor nimmer,however,posits that it is not entirely clear that the result is undesirable because i f copyright is to be accorded only to the nonfunctional form of a work,this would not inhibit competitors from making available to the public the utilitarian essence of an industrial product.nimmer on copyright emphasis added.
because the evolving iterations of the conceptual separability test are cogently charted in several cases,we need not retread the path here.see,galiano,at pivot point int l,charlene,cir.after an extensive analysis of the varying approaches,the seventh circuit concluded that courts had moved toward a approach,distilling the conceptual separability test as follows 
conceptual separability exists when the artistic aspects of an article can be conceptualized as existing independently of their utilitarian function.this independence is necessarily informed by whether the design elements can be identified as reflecting the designer artistic judgment exercised independently of functional influences.if the elements do reflect the independent,artistic judgment of the designer,conceptual separability exists.conversely,when the design of a useful article is as much the result of utilitarian pressures as aesthetic choices,the useful and aesthetic elements are not conceptually separable.
pivot point,at internal quotations and citations omitted.
our circuit has not elaborated extensively upon conceptual separability.in superior form builders,we considered whether animal mannequins used to mount animal skins were copyrightable.at.we held that the mannequins were not useful articles under the copyright act and therefore did not need to meet the test of conceptual separability.id.at.however,because we went on to address conceptual separability t o the extent that an argument can be made that the mannequins perform a utilitarian function,the decision provides some guidance here.id.we observed,for example,that the industrial design of a unique,aesthetically pleasing chair can not be separated from the chair utilitarian function,and therefore,is not subject to copyright protection.id.at emphasis added.the industrial design of a chair is unlike the design of statuettes adorning lamp bases because the objective of the chair design is to create a utilitarian object,albeit an aesthetically pleasing one,whereas the objective in creating a statue of a dancer is to express the idea of a dancer.id.
superior form example of the industrial design of a chair fails to directly address the category of designs at issue here compilations of decorative elements adorning utilitarian furniture.in other words,universal does not seek copyright protection for the purely industrial designs of its furniture,and the district court correctly recognized as much by explaining that the shape of the furniture can not be the subject of a copyright,no matter how aesthetically pleasing it may be,but the decorative elements that are separable from the furniture can be.liability opinion emphases added.conceptual separability directs a reviewing court to answer whether protection extends to the nonfunctional form of a work.nimmer on copyright.
in carol barnhart economy cover,cir,the second circuit held that mannequins of human torsos used to display clothing had no artistic or aesthetic features that were physically or conceptually separable from their utilitarian dimension.the court thus rejected the designer argument that the mannequins were akin to sculptures and could serve a decorative function apart from the utilitarian purpose of serving as a vehicle for clothing and accessories.id.at.that the mannequins may have been aesthetically satisfying was not enough for copyright protection.id.the second circuit distinguished that case from an earlier decision finding copyright protection in belt buckles bearing sculptured designs cast in precious metals and principally used for decoration.id.citing kieselsteincord accessories by pearl,cir.the highly ornamental designs on the belt buckles were totally unlike the bare model of a human torso the unique artistic design of the buckles was wholly unnecessary to performance of the utilitarian function of the belts.id.at.in contrast,the sculpted anatomical elements on the torso mannequins,while perhaps aesthetically pleasing,were inextricably intertwined with the utilitarian feature,the display of clothes.id.
synthesizing these principles,we are compelled to reach the same conclusion as the district court the decorative elements on universal gic and emc are conceptually separable from the furniture utilitarian aspects.the gic and emc designs are highly ornate collections of furniture adorned with shells,acanthus leaves,columns,finials,rosettes,and other carvings.steven russell described the collections as an ornamentation explosion,and universal expert thomas moser similarly described the emc and gic as essentially vehicles for expressing ornament.these decorative compilations are not industrial designs of furniture.they are not like a bare human torso mannequin for which adornment is the very utilitarian purpose of the object.like statuettes on a lamp base,the gic and emc design compilations are superfluous nonfunctional adornments for which the shape of the furniture which is not copyrightable serves as the vehicle.the designs can therefore be identified separately from the utilitarian aspects of the furniture.indeed,the designs are wholly unnecessary to the furniture utilitarian function.carol barnhart,at.a carved scroll of leaves on a nightstand post,for example,does nothing to improve the utilitarian aspect thereof.
as in pivot point,russell process reflects an artistic judgment exercised independently of functional influences.at.to be sure,russell was influenced by function in designing these decorative elements.after all,he explained,furniture has got to function.but his objective in compiling these decorative elements onto the basic shapes of the furniture was not to improve the furniture utility but to give the pieces a pretty face.id.at.he developed the shape of the furniture before turning to ornamentation.for many of the decorative elements on the furniture,such as carved shells and leaves,russell purpose was entirely aesthetic.moser similarly testified to the exuberant ornamentation on the gic and emc furniture and opined that the ornamentation has little or nothing to do with the function of these lines.id.at.in sum,russell design and placement of these decorative elements was not as much the result of utilitarian pressures as aesthetic choices.pivot point,at.aesthetic choices were the dominant force at work in russell design process.
however,the conceptual separability test is a conjunctive one the decorative elements adorning the gic and emc lines must be capable of separate identification from the utilitarian aspects of the furniture,and they must be capable of existing independently of,the utilitarian aspects of the furniture.this poses somewhat of a metaphysical quandary for decorative elements on furniture.the elements serve no purpose divorced from the become designs in space.but the test is conceptual separability,not physical separability.nimmer on copyright.the house committee that drafted the copyright act contemplated that the conceptual separability test could be satisfied in this very context 
o nly elements which can be identified separately from the useful article as such are copyrightable.and,even if the design contains some such element for example,a carving on the back of a chair or a floral relief design on silver flatware,copyright protection would extend only to that element,and would not cover the overall configuration of the utilitarian article as such.
at,reprinted in,emphasis added.like sculpted designs on belt buckles,the decorative elements adorning the gic and emc lines are conceptually separable sculptural elements,at.their form is not inextricably intertwined with the function of furniture.carol barnhart,at.they are artistic and aesthetic features that can be conceived of as having been added to,or superimposed upon,an otherwise utilitarian article,and they are therefore capable of existing independently of the furniture.id.
because the gic and emc designs are original and conceptually separable from the utilitarian aspects of the furniture,we agree with the district court that the compilation of design elements on the emc and gic lines are entitled to copyright protection 
we next assess whether collezione infringed universal copyrights.assuming that the district court correctly applied the legal standard,its factual findings regarding the similarity between universal gic and emc lines and collezione and collections are entitled to considerable deference.roanoke cement,at see also taylor,at observing that most circuits apply a clearly erroneous standard of review to factual finding of substantial similarity even though credibility is not implicated.collezione argues that the court incorrectly applied the legal standard for copyright infringement by comparing universal and collezione furniture as a whole,rather than comparing the compilations of design elements.
a successful claim of copyright infringement requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant copied the original elements of that copyright.lyons morris costumes,cir.when the plaintiff possesses no direct evidence that the defendant copied its protected work,it may create a presumption of copying by indirect evidence establishing that the defendant had access to the copyrighted work and that the defendant work is substantially similar to the protected material.id.internal citation omitted.substantial similarity is a test.the plaintiff must show that the two works are extrinsically similar because they contain substantially similar ideas that are subject to copyright protection and intrinsically similar in the sense that they express those ideas in a substantially similar manner from the perspective of the intended audience of the work.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
the extrinsic inquiry is an objective one on which expert testimony may be relevant.dawson hinshaw music,f d,cir.the extrinsic analysis looks to external criteria of substantial similarities in both ideas and expression.apple computer microsoft,cir.the intrinsic inquiry,in contrast,implicates the perspective of the object intended observer.dawson,at.in assessing intrinsic similarity,the factfinder looks to the total concept and feel of the works,but only as seen through the eyes of the intended audience of the plaintiff work.lyons,at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.judge learned hand phrased the intrinsic test as whether the ordinary observer,unless he set out to detect the disparities,would be disposed to overlook them,and regard their aesthetic appeal as the same.peter pan fabrics,martin weiner,cir.
collezione maintains that the district court incorrectly applied the substantial similarity test by comparing the noncopyrightable elements of the parties furniture collections.on the extrinsic prong,collezione argues that the court comparison of the two furniture collections as a whole improperly factored in noncopyrightable features such as the furniture shape and color.on the intrinsic prong,collezione argues that the court comparison of individual pieces of furniture within each collection also encompassed these noncopyrightable features.
in the furniture context,the external criteria of similar ideas and expressions will presumably be the collections historical themes and ornamentation.taylor,at concluding that district court correctly applied extrinsic test to holiday greeting card designs by considering the cards similar holiday themes,paper stock and printing techniques.idea and expression are broad concepts,and the district court properly compared the ideas and expressions of universal and collezione collections by considering the furniture as a whole.
still,substantial similarity asks whether a defendant copied the original elements of a copyright.lyons,at emphasis added.the district court extrinsic analysis briefly mentioned the furniture noncopyrightable features such as similarity of shape and color.and the court would have erred had it found similarity only in the collection noncopyrightable features.see herzog castle rock entm t,cir a court may grant summary judgment for defendant as a matter of law if the similarity between the two works concerns only noncopyrightable elements of the plaintiff work.but the court extrinsic analysis largely focused on the copyrightable aspects of universal gic and emc the ornamentation.the court determined that the collections shared a highly decorative appearance with a traditional feel and very ornamental designs combined with basic styles that resemble furniture pieces from england in the or centuries.liability opinion.in so finding,the court relied on universal expert testimony,which is helpful to the extrinsic prong.dawson,at.in thomas moser view,universal and collezione collections shared a great collection of ornamental detail,principally in the form of relief carvings and were similar in terms of placement,selection,arrangement,and most certainly execution.moser explained that universal gic had a consistency in the application of the ornament,neither too much or too little,and that collezione collection shared this aesthetic harmony.id.at.he described the ornamentation on these collections as taking up the same amount of space on the furniture.in sum,the district court correctly applied the extrinsic prong by considering whether the protected aspects of universal gic and emc lines were substantially similar in idea and expression to collezione and collections.we thus find no clear error in the court determination of extrinsic similarity.
collezione argument with respect to the intrinsic prong of substantial similarity is also unavailing because,as other circuits have observed,analytic dissection of protected and unprotected elements is inappropriate under the intrinsic prong,given that the ordinary observer does not make this distinction.taylor,f d at knitwaves,cir.rather,the ordinary observer encounters the furniture as one object.
the district court properly assessed whether the ordinary observer of individual pieces of furniture within the disputed collections would see each piece the same,discounting any trivial differences.liability opinion see taylor,at a finding of substantial similarity is not precluded where differences in detail do little to lessen a viewer overwhelming impression that the defendant products are appropriations.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the court made detailed comparisons of the ornamental designs on the individual pieces within the competing collections.collezione resorts to selective references to the liability opinion to suggest that the intrinsic similarity analysis focused on noncopyrightable elements.br.of appellant.although the court again mentioned noncopyrightable features such as the furniture shape and color,it appropriately focused on whether the ordinary,reasonable observer would find the furniture lines,as a whole,to be substantially similar.taylor,at.additionally,the court analysis clearly concentrated on the compilation of designs on the furniture.for example,it found that collezione sideboards were near
