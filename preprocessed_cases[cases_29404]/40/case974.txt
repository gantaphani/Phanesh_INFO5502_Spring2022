opinion of the court 
debra haybarger appeals the district court decision granting summary judgment to william mancino on her claim under the family and medical leave act fmla,et.haybarger contends that the district court erred in holding that,as a matter of law,mancino was not her employer under the fmla.as a threshold matter,we hold on an issue of first impression in our court that a supervisor in a public agency may be subject to individual liability under the fmla.we further hold that there exists a genuine dispute of material fact concerning whether mancino is himself subject to such liability.accordingly,we will vacate and remand the matter to the district court.
in,debra haybarger began working as an office manager for lawrence county adult probation and parole lawrence county probation,an agency of the lawrence county court of common pleas.beginning in,her supervisor was william mancino,the director of probation and parole.mancino reported to michael occhibone,the court administrator,who reported to judge dominick motto,the president judge of the lawrence county court of common pleas.
haybarger has type ii diabetes,heart disease,and kidney problems,which forced her to miss work frequently to seek medical attention.haybarger testified that mancino expressed dissatisfaction with her absences despite recognizing that they were due to illness.most notably,mancino repeatedly wrote in his annual performance evaluations that haybarger needed t o improve her overall health and cut down on the days that she misses due to illness.she also testified that he asked her why she breathed heavily and why she needed to visit the doctor so often,and advised her that she needed to start taking better care of her self.
on march,mancino formally disciplined haybarger by placing her on a probationary period that required weekly informal progress assessments and monthly formal meetings.mancino alleged in his discipline letter that haybarger conduct,work ethic,and behavior were to the adult probation office.he further alleged that she demonstrated a lack of leadership,no clear understanding of the subordinate positions that she supervised,and a lack of empathy to subordinate workers.mancino testified during his deposition that he consulted with occhibone before issuing the discipline letter,but that he had the independent authority to issue the letter on his own and did not require occhibone approval.
approximately six months later,mancino informed occhibone and judge motto that haybarger job performance had not improved since he disciplined her in march.mancino claims that he did not have authority to terminate haybarger employment,but he admits that he advised judge motto to dismiss her.further,he wrote in a summary of haybarger dismissal to lawrence county probation human resources department human resources that after two meetings with occhibone concerning haybarger performance,he told occhibone that he had decided that he had no other alternative at this time but to terminate her employment.according to occhibone,judge motto agreed with mancino recommendation,believing that mancino took all measures to help haybarger retain employment and that unfortunately termination was necessary.accordingly,mancino wrote in his summary to human resources that judge motto permitted him to terminate her.
mancino,occhibone,and judge motto informed haybarger of her termination at a meeting in the courthouse on october.additionally,mancino wrote haybarger termination letter on the same date,stating that u pon final review of your probationary period,i feel that no progress or sic has been made by you,further,that you are incapable of performing at the level necessary to complete your assigned duties as the office manager in my office.he further stated that a fter conferring with the district court administrator,michael occhibone,and the president judge,dominick motto,we are in agreement that your termination is necessary and in the best interest of the overall operations of the adult probation office.
haybarger sued lawrence county probation,the county of lawrence,and mancino under the americans with disabilities act the ada,et,the pennsylvania human relations act the phra.const.stat,the rehabilitation act,et,and the fmla.on march,the district court dismissed all of haybarger claims against the county of lawrence haybarger ada,fmla,and phra claims against lawrence county probation haybarger fmla claims against mancino in his official capacity and haybarger ada claim against mancino in both his individual and official capacities.there thus remained pending the rehabilitation act claim against lawrence county probation and the fmla and phra claims against mancino in his individual capacity.
after limited discovery,lawrence county probation moved for summary judgment based on the eleventh amendment.the district court denied lawrence county probation motion for summary judgment,and we affirmed.see haybarger lawrence cnty.adult prob.parole,cir.
on remand,lawrence county probation moved for summary judgment on haybarger rehabilitation act claim,and mancino moved for summary judgment on haybarger fmla claim the district court denied summary judgment on haybarger rehabilitation act claim,and lawrence county probation and haybarger subsequently settled the rehabilitation act claim.
as to the fmla claim against mancino in his individual capacity,the district court held that,while the fmla permits individual liability against supervisors at public agencies,haybarger failed to present sufficient evidence to hold mancino liable.the district court reasoned that an individual supervisor is an employer for fmla purposes only if he or she has sufficient control over the employee conditions and terms of employment.haybarger lawrence cnty.adult prob.parole,dist.lexis,at.july,quoting kilvitis cnty.of luzerne,d.the district court then stated that an employer has adequate control if he or she has the authority to hire and fire.id.quoting narodetsky cardone,dist.lexis,at.because mancino lacked final authority to fire haybarger,the district court concluded that mancino did not have sufficient control over haybarger employment for liability to attach and granted mancino motion for summary judgment.haybarger filed her instant appeal,contending that a genuine dispute of material fact remains concerning whether mancino was her employer under the fmla.
the district court had jurisdiction under,and we have jurisdiction under we exercise plenary review over district court decisions granting summary judgment.see farrell planters lifesavers,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the movant demonstrates that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact.a.a material fact is a fact that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby,d.for an issue to be genuine,all that is required is that sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties differing versions of the truth at trial.id.at quoting first bank of cities serv,d.
although haybarger challenges only the district court holding that mancino was not her employer under the fmla,and mancino concedes in his brief that supervisors at public agencies are subject to liability under the fmla,we have not yet decided whether supervisors at public agencies are subject to liability under the fmla.because we necessarily must decide whether supervisors at public agencies are subject to liability before determining whether the district court erred in holding that mancino was not haybarger employer,we first address whether the fmla permits individual liability against supervisors at public agencies we then consider whether the district court erred in holding that mancino was not an employer under the fmla.
we look first to the fmla language to ascertain whether congress intended to permit individual liability under the fmla.see,hafer melo,d analyzing congressional intent to hold that permits suits against officers in their personal capacity.the fmla defines an employer as follows 
a in general.the term employer 
i means any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce who employs or more employees for each working day during each of or more calendar workweeks in the current or preceding calendar year 
ii includes 
i any person who acts,directly or indirectly,in the interest of an employer to any of the employees of such employer and 
ii any successor in interest of an employer 
iii includes any public agency,as defined in section x of the fair labor standards act of x and 
iv includes the general accounting office government accountability office and the library of congress.
a i iv emphasis added.
section a ii i inclusion of any person who acts,directly or indirectly,in the interest of an employer plainly contemplates that liability for fmla violations may be imposed upon an individual person who would not otherwise be regarded as the plaintiff employer.indeed,otherwise,a ii i adds nothing to a i definition of an employer as any person who employs or more employees.see darby bratch,cir holding that a ii i plainly includes persons other than the employer itself.
the department of labor implementing regulations for the fmla confirm that the fmla permits individual liability.the regulations state that e mployers include any person acting,directly or indirectly,in the interest of a covered employer to any of the employees of the employer,any successor in interest of a covered employer,and any public agency.a.the regulations then explicitly provide that individuals such as corporate officers acting in the interest of an employer are individually liable for any violations of the requirements of fmla.d.in promulgating the regulations,the department of labor responded to concerns of imposing individual liability under the fmla by noting that the fair labor standards act flsa,et,which defines employer similarly to the fmla,already holds corporate officers,managers and supervisors acting in the interest of an employer individually liable.summary of major comments for the fmla regulations,citations omitted.accordingly,the fmla regulations leave little doubt that individual liability is available under the fmla 
as recognized in modica taylor,that congress,in drafting the fmla,chose to make the definition of employer materially identical to that in the flsa means that decisions interpreting the flsa offer the best guidance for construing the term employer as it is used in the fmla,cir quoting wascura carver,cir.we held under the flsa that a real estate management company acting as agent for various building owners is an employer of persons whose wages were paid by the owners.hodgson arnheim neely,cir,rev on other grounds,d.in hodgson arnheim neely,a real estate management company operated eight office buildings and one apartment complex under a management contract.id.at.the management company collected rent for each building and deposited the collections in a separate bank account for each building.id.the expenses for each building were paid from the bank account established for that building.id.the real estate management company had the authority to hire and to supervise each building maintenance employees.id.although the real estate management company exercised substantial control over employment practices,it lacked complete authority because the building owners maintained the right to review hiring practices.id.at.we held that,despite the building owners right to review employment practices,the real estate management company was an employer under the flsa because it act ed in the interest of an employer.id.at citations omitted.we noted that the flsa contemplates the possibility of several simultaneous employers,any one of which may be liable as an employer under the act.id.at.
much as a real estate management company acts as an agent for building owners,supervisors act as agents for their employers.although a supervisor may not have ultimate authority over employment practices,we held in hodgson that a higher decisionmaker ultimate authority does not relieve lower decisionmakers from liability.accordingly,we recognize today that,just as a real estate management company acting as an agent for building owners may be liable as an employer under the flsa,an individual supervisor working for an employer may be liable as an employer under the fmla 
furthermore,we discern no reason to distinguish between public agencies and private employers under the fmla insofar as individual liability is concerned.under a iii,an employer includes any public agency.as we discussed supra,the fmla regulations provide that e mployers include any person acting,directly or indirectly,in the interest of a covered employer to any of the employees of the employer,any successor in interest of a covered employer,and any public agency.a.the fifth and eighth circuits have already recognized that the fmla inclusion of public agencies in both its statutory language and its regulations demonstrates that individual supervisors at public agencies are subject to liability.see modica,at darby,at.district courts within our own circuit have reached the same conclusion.see,kilvitis,d at hewett willingboro bd.of,d,hayduk city of johnstown,d.
the sixth and eleventh circuits,however,do not permit individual liability against supervisors at public agencies.see mitchell chapman,cir wascura,at.the sixth circuit reasons that the fmla does not permit individual liability because the fmla individual liability provision does not refer to the fmla public agency provision.see mitchell,at.the sixth circuit construes the fmla as containing four modifiers of the meaning of employer in a i iv.id.at.according to the sixth circuit,the modifiers in a i iv each relate to the term employer,but they do not relate to each other because the plain text separat es the clauses into distinct provisions.id.at.the second modifier provides that a n employer includes any person who acts directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer,while the third modifier provides that a n employer includes any public agency as that term is defined in the flsa.id.at citing a ii iii.because the sixth circuit does not believe that the individual liability provision in the second modifier relates to the public agency provision in the third modifier,the sixth circuit holds that individual liability is not available against supervisors at public agencies.id.at.
the sixth circuit indicates that interpreting the modifiers as relating to each other results in redundancies,noting most importantly that b states that a public agency shall be considered to be a person engaged in commerce or in an industry or activity affecting commerce.id.at.it reasons that b is superfluous if the first modifier in a i,defining an employer as any person engaged in commerce or in any industry or activity affecting commerce who employs or more employees,relates to the third modifier in a iii,stating that employers include public agencies.id.further,the sixth circuit adds that the fmla regulations provide that a public agency is exempt from l a i or more employees requirement,demonstrating that the first modifier in a i does not relate to the third modifier in a iii.id.
finally,the sixth circuit reasons that combining a ii i individual liability provision with a iii public agency provision results in a definition of employer that is nearly the same as the flsa definition of employer.id.because the fmla ordinarily refers to the flsa when it adopts a definition found in the flsa,the sixth circuit holds that it is unlikely that congress intended to create the same definition of an employer in the fmla as in the flsa.id.accordingly,the sixth circuit concludes that the fmla distinguishes between public agencies and private employers and does not make individuals at public agencies liable for fmla violations id.at.
although the sixth circuit highlights several ambiguities in the fmla,we agree with the fifth circuit analysis in modica.see at.first,as the fifth circuit observes,the fmla indicates a relationship between a modifiers by stating that the term employer means its definition in a i and then includes the provisions in a ii iv.id.at.therefore,an employer means any person e
