this is an appeal from a dismissal of a federal false claims act fca complaint on grounds that it was jurisdictionally barred by the fca public disclosure provision.the appellant,the estate of robert cunningham relator brought an fca suit against millennium laboratories of california millennium and john doe physicians collectively,appellees,alleging that millennium encouraged physicians to bill the government multiple times for single drug tests and to perform excessive,medically unnecessary original and confirmation tests.
prior to the filing of said complaint,millennium had filed a suit against relator employer,calloway laboratories calloway,in california state court california suit,attaching from calloway employees to third parties suggesting fraudulent activity in millennium billing practices.the district court found this prior disclosure to constitute a jurisdictional bar to relator suit,dismissing his complaint.this appeal followed.
since we find error in the district court dismissal of all of relator claims when only some of them had been disclosed by way of being substantially similar to the information contained in millennium prior california suit,we affirm in part and vacate in part the district court dismissal,remanding for the district court consideration of whether relator remaining fca claim was sufficiently pled under.b and b.
background 
factual background 
jurisdiction is determined based on whether it existed at the time the plaintiff filed the original complaint,sallen corinthians licenciamentos ltda,cir,so we provide the factual background as alleged in relator original complaint.since we ultimately find that said facts were integrated in relator amended complaint,we only distinguish between the two complaints when there are noted differences as to the language and count number of their respective allegations 
as relevant here,millennium developed a urine program for physicians to monitor the medications of chronic pain patients and to assess patients compliance with prescribed medication regimes.the testing method begins as testing in a doctor office and uses various test strips units inserted into a single cup filled with the patient urine specimen collectively,the test kit.
robert cunningham,now deceased,worked as a compliance officer for calloway,a competitor of millennium,in and.it was during his employment at calloway that cunningham learned of the allegedly improper billing practices at issue in his qui tam complaint against millennium and the unnamed physicians.cunningham labeled millennium alleged fraudulent practices,collectively,as millennium physician billing model in his original complaint.the overall scheme is alleged to involve different components,but as a general matter,is 
designed to encourage physicians to perform and order medically excessive and unnecessary testing,thereby significantly increasing the revenues of the john doe physician defendants at the expense of the government and private health insurance programs,and by increasing the john doe physician defendants revenues,significantly increase millennium revenues and market share,enabling millennium to profit from the billing for reflex screenings and confirmations.
the complaint states that,unlike other laboratories which profit from the tests ordered by a physician with no payment to the physician,millennium model allows a physician to substantially increase his or her revenue based upon the laboratory tests ordered.the complaint then proceeds to break down the various aspects of the larger scheme,which involves alleged fraudulent activity related to multiple billing for single test kits,excessive testing without medical necessity,and improper confirmation testing.
first,millennium is alleged to have billed multiple times for the testing of a single test kit.specifically,the original complaint alleges that millennium encouraged doctors to use a qualitative drug screen which uses a single specimen,and to bill the government and private insurance programs multiple units for the single testing event devices aspect.millennium then encouraged doctors to improperly bill the government under cpt codes,other pathology and laboratory codes,resulting in federal monies lost as a result of laboratory services which were not performed as claimed or were inflated.millennium did this by informing physicians that,rather than bill one unit of for each test kit,the physician should bill as many units as there are panels in the test kit.emphasis added.further,millennium gave physicians a document,entitled gross revenue by insurance category for multi clin panel test kit,which suggested that each physician can bill at least units per kit,despite the fact that all nine units are tested in a single testing event.relator alleges fraud in that payment because use of cpt code would only be proper if it was billed in one unit rather,at millennium encouragement and in conspiracy with millennium,the john doe physician defendants have billed federal programs and other health insurance programs multiple units of per patient per day.
second,relator claims that millennium directed and encouraged physicians to test excessively,more than was reasonable or medically necessary aspect.specifically,the original complaint alleges that millennium 
represents to the physician that by simply ordering one test per day and billing medicare at the rate of per panel for nine units,the physician can earn per day millennium also informs the physician that if she or he were to order twenty tests per day and bill medicare at the rate of per panel for nine units,the earnings would be per day 
thus,as distinct from the first set of allegations,the second set of allegations does not involve billing more than one time for a single unit,but rather involves the unnecessary frequency with which physicians were encouraged to use and bill entire test kits.these allegations also include charges that millennium informed physicians that,if they were to order twenty tests per day,they could earn per day based on the standard indemnity,auto insurance,and w orkmen compensation policies at the reasonable and customary rate of per panel for nine units.these amounts are also reflected in the gross revenue by insurance category for multi clin panel test kit document,which also breaks down the potential revenues a physician can earn by ordering between one and twenty tests per day.the complaint states that millennium thus encourages the physician to order more testing than that physician would have prior to engaging in millennium point of care model,and increases millennium market share by drawing other physicians to the practice with the hope and promise of greater revenues.it further alleges that the physician defendants did order significantly more testing for their patients since entering the conspiracy than they did prior to participating in the conspiracy with millennium.this would include the initial screens conducted by the physician defendants.the alleged fraud consists of millennium promotion of said billing model and physician defendants misrepresentation of the medical necessity of the tests performed.
third and finally,the complaint alleges fraudulent activity related to confirmation testing of initial screen tests aspect.after performing an initial qualitative test,physicians at the point of care may confirm the results of those tests by another method.the complaint claims that millennium encouraged physicians to order more testing than they would have otherwise not only with respect to the initial tests,but with the confirmation tests as well.the fraud that the complaint alleges is that millennium knowingly encouraged the physician defendants to misrepresent the medical necessity of confirmation testing.defendants knew that these practices and procedures resulted in fraudulent claims to the federal government through the medicare,medicaid,and other federally funded programs.
prior to the relator filing of the instant suit,millennium filed a complaint in its own right against calloway and unnamed john does,inclusive,in the superior court of california,alleging,inter alia,defamation and intentional interference with contractual relations.millennium complaint alleged that two calloway account executives sent to individuals and a millennium customer describing millennium practice of billing insurance companies and the government twice for the same service,and claiming that that practice could put both millennium and physicians at risk of potential legal exposure or potential insurance fraud.since the attached to the california complaint were both the factual basis for the claims alleged in the complaint,as well as basis for the district court jurisdictional determination regarding prior public disclosure,we will describe the facts alleged therein in detail.we only list facts that are relevant for the public disclosure bar as it governs relator complaint.
the first attached to the california complaint is from a calloway account executive,greg williams,to michael schatman,of pacific northwest university health sciences in yakima,washington,and marty schultz.williams expresses his shock that their clinic chose a lab for services that allow the clinic to generate revenue by billing for the drug screens.there is a very lab going around,called millennium,that is offering this revenue generating scenario.i hope this is not the lab you all have bought into.williams goes on to describe the severe pitfalls of the physician billing scheme utilized by millennium,stating that there are patients and insurances being billed twice for the same service and the screens that clinics are billing the code for should be bundled,but clinics are each metabolite screened for on the cup or test strip.williams suggests that these practices are unlawful,unethical,and the basis for an office being audited 
the second was also sent by a calloway account executive,stephen schur,but was sent to a millennium customer.schur consisted of a introduction to an attached information sheet q a sheet i.the introduction indicates that the attached sheet should clear things up and invites further contact should the customer have any questions.q a sheet i in its own right appears to be a guide drafted for physicians as a means to clarify the value of calloway services.the sheet distinguishes between calloway own model and the competing physician screening model.it does not mention millennium by name,but states that s ome laboratories that promote the physician screening model are sure to attract the attention of regulatory authorities for unlawful billing practices.these include suggesting that a physician can bill multiple units of cpt code,sometimes with a qw modifier,for qualitative tests performed by a physician office using one of a variety of drug testing kits on the market.q a sheet i then claims that the center for medicare and medicaid services cms does not authorize the billing of multiple units of they are considered a single test for billing.it further asserts that state medicaid manuals require that,when a test kit with multiple drug test cards is used,the provider should bill for a single instance of with a qw modifier,not multiple.secondly,the q a sheet provides the following question and answer about confirmation testing by labs promoting the physician screening model 
the lab promoting the physician screening model does confirmation testing so at least the issue of detecting specific drugs within a drug class is handled.right 
possibly.it appears some of these labs are performing and billing for confirming eia analysis.this is considered by cms because your point of care testing is also eia enzyme immunoassay testing and regulations specifically prohibit one eia test confirming another eia test.the physician needs to order only confirmation tests performed by or.
the third attached to the california complaint was also sent by stephen schur to teresa tinc of pain diagnosis,and contained another q a sheet q a sheet ii.the body of schur described the attached q a sheet more fully,identifying the information contained therein as info that is pertinent to a physician billing model like millennium a model that is potentially fraudulent.the first question on q a sheet ii involves whether a physician who perform s a drug screen with a point of care device may bill the patient insurance for drug screening.the response states that,while s ome laboratories promote a physician screening model suggesting that a physician can bill multiple units of cpt code,sometimes with a qw modifier this is incorrect and possibly abusive.it states the same reasons for challenging the practice as stated in q a sheet i cms not authorizing the billing of multiple units when they should be considered as a single test and also referencing state medicaid manuals prohibiting the practice.q a sheet ii also copies exactly the language of q a sheet i regarding confirmation testing under the physician screening model described therein.
procedural history 
cunningham filed his original complaint in this action five days after millennium filed the california suit,on december.on february,his estate filed an amended complaint.millennium moved to dismiss that complaint on three grounds the fca public disclosure bar deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction in the alternative,relator failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under.b and,lastly,he failed to plead fraud with the requisite particularity under.b.
the district court granted millennium motion,dismissing relator complaint with prejudice on grounds that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the fca public disclosure bar.
ii.discussion 
a.the fca public disclosure bar 
in challenging the district court dismissal order,relator argues that the court erred when it found that millennium california complaint had publicly disclosed all of the allegations made in relator own complaint.even if the multiple billing allegations described as aspect were disclosed in the california suit,relator claims,millennium complaint did not state facts relating to aspects and of the fraudulent billing practices that relator complaint exposes,namely,excessive testing and excessive confirmation testing of negative results.
further,relator contends that mere rumors of improper billing stated in calloway account executives are insufficient to constitute a public disclosure of millennium fraudulent conduct and it does not put the government on notice of fraud as required under the statute and this circuit case law.what is exposed,relator claims,is a sanitized,innocuous version of millennium business model,not the details of the fraudulent conduct.relator also asserts that the allegations in his complaint were not based upon millennium california complaint since aspects and are only discussed in relator complaint and are not mentioned in the california complaint and relator did not learn of the multiple billing fraud of aspect from the california complaint.relator argues in the alternative that,if the court finds that the information contained in the instant complaint was publicly disclosed in the california suit,the court should assert jurisdiction under the original source exception as cunningham was an original source who acquired all of his information through his own investigation,without an intervening agency.
finally,relator states that it was error for the district court to dismiss the complaint with prejudice,without granting leave to amend,because the dismissal was based on a mistakenly abridged reading of the complaint,and on remand,relator should be allowed to file a second amended complaint given the,liberal standards for amendment.upon amendment,relator promises to provide more of millennium marketing materials,and laboratory testing forms demonstrating millennium intent that physicians profit from billing for a multiplicity of results derived from a single urine test,and that millennium and the defendant physicians both profit from performing as many tests as possible regardless of medical necessity,in violation of the fca.
this court reviews de novo the district court dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.abdel aleem opk biotech llc,cir.jurisdiction is determined based on whether it existed at the time the plaintiff filed the original complaint.sallen,at.
pursuant to the fca,e a,
n o court shall have jurisdiction over an action based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a civil hearing,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information 
for the public disclosure bar to apply,each of three elements must be met a public disclosure of the allegations or transactions in a relator complaint must have occurred said disclosure must have occurred in the manner which is specified in the fca and the relator suit must be based upon those publicly disclosed allegations or transactions.united states,ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,cir quotations and citation omitted.if those elements have been met,then a court may only exercise jurisdiction over the suit if the relator falls within the original source exception.id.
a prior public disclosure may occur through any public document available on the docket in a civil hearing.see united states ex rel.poteet bahler,cir.to be a disclosure of fraud,a disclosure must either contain a direct allegation of fraud or allow for a proper inference of fraud by revealing a misrepresented state of facts in conjunction with a true state of facts.id.at.in assessing whether a given suit is based upon publicly disclosed allegations,we look to whether those allegations are substantially similar to said allegations.united states ex rel.ondis city of woonsocket,cir.we do this by comparing the substance of the prior disclosures with the substance of a relator complaint.poteet,at.
as a preliminary matter,we must address the issue of which complaint relator original or amended complaint we are comparing to millennium california complaint for the purposes of the public disclosure bar.the record is not entirely clear which complaint was reviewed below for the purposes of the public disclosure bar.the district court first cited to the proper rule that a court must determine whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over an action based on the original complaint filed but then only considered its subject matter jurisdiction over the allegations made in count one of the original complaint,summarily stating in footnote that,since relator other three counts do not appear in the first amended complaint,they thus have no bearing on this motion to dismiss.the district court then went on to say that,even if the additional three claims were not barred by the public disclosure bar,they do not provide relator with the ability to amend the complaint to include a claim that was jurisdictionally barred at the time cunningham filed the original complaint.after making this statement in a footnote,the district court did not analyze whether the claims made in the three separate counts in the original complaint were either integrated into the amended complaint in its factual section or under the single fca count or barred by the fca public disclosure provision as a result of having been disclosed in millennium california suit.
the district court erred in the first instance when it did not consider all fca counts of the original complaint in determining whether or not said complaint was jurisdictionally barred by prior public disclosure.it also erred when it failed to meticulously compare relator allegations in both the original and amended complaint regarding excessive and confirmatory testing with the information contained in millennium california complaint and attached.specifically,in reciting the relevant substantially similar facts shared by millennium california complaint and relator complaint,the district court only cited to the california complaint attached detailing the multiple billing fraudulent scheme,or,as the district court described the scheme,a plan that billed insurance agencies and the federal government multiple times for the same test.a detailed comparison,however,reveals that,while the district court was correct that millennium california complaint discussed the purportedly fraudulent activity associated with millennium multiple billing practices,it failed to assess whether relator excessive and confirmatory testing allegations contained in counts and of the original complaint,and retained in paragraphs,and of the amended complaint,were also disclosed in the california suit.therefore,while we agree with the district court that aspect of relator fraud allegations was disclosed in the california suit,we must also address the prior disclosure of aspects and as alleged in the original complaint and retained in the amended complaint.perusing both relator complaints and the california complaint,we find that aspect of relator fca allegations was also disclosed in the california suit,but aspect was not.
aspects and of the alleged scheme 
we first discuss the multiple billing allegations and our reasons for affirming the district court dismissal of the relator complaint as barred by the fca public disclosure provision.relator appears to concede that the multiple billing scheme alleged as aspect of its fca claim was disclosed in the california complaint,stating that that complaint was limited to th e discrete issue of multiple billing,and the district court holding in dismissing the complaint was wrong because the california complaint is devoid of the other two aspects of the fraud excessively frequent testing,and the automatic confirmation of negative results.emphasis added.however,for the sake of thoroughness,we briefly review the reasons the public disclosure bar applies to aspect as alleged in relator complaint.
relator is incorrect and misguided in suggesting that aspect was not publicly disclosed in the california suit as fraud because the allegations made in that case consisted of mere rumors.since relator does not contest that a disclosure of information on a civil docket may constitute public disclosure for the purposes of the fca,we construe relator challenge to be directed at the extent to which millennium complaint made a direct or properly inferrable public disclosure of fraud.yet,the california complaint and attached could not have been more explicit that the information the calloway account executives were spreading about millennium billing practices concerned allegations that they involved and encouraged unlawful and unethical misrepresentations to the government and private insurers about billing for multiple tests when in fact only a single unit was tested.as cited supra,in the first attached,williams states the following about millennium billing practices 
first,there are the patients and insurances being billed twice for the same service.medicaid and medicare frown upon being billed twice for the same thing second,these screens that clinic are billing the code for should be bundled,but clinic are each metabolite screened for on the cup or test strip and again medicaid and medicare frowns upon that.
the third attached to the california complaint states that participating in any plan to increase revenues by billing excessive or incorrect codes violates a number of federal and state statutes,and that millennium billing model involving billing for each test strip rather than the single testing event puts physicians at risk for potential insurance fraud.
even assuming these statements did not constitute direct allegations of fraud,the compare millennium version of the facts associated with its billing with the true state of those facts as claimed by calloway account executives.specifically,the say that,while millennium represents that physicians can bill multiple units of for qualitative tests,cms does not authorize the billing of multiple units of they are considered a single test for billing.therefore,the district court did not err in finding that the disclosure constituted a disclosure of fraud.
while we share relator concern that a person or entity committing fraud against the government could theoretically shield itself from a qui tam action through preemptively filing its own action,thus creating a sanitized public disclosure while barring a future whistleblower action,the supreme court has been clear that can bar such suit under the fca,and it has further characterized concerns about insulation from fca liability as unwarranted in most cases.schindler elevator united states ex rel.kirk,d dismissing as pure speculation concerns that potential defendants may insulate themselves from fca liability by making foia requests graham cnty.soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,d stating that careful disclosure of potential fraud would not immunize a fraudulent actor from fca liability in an action brought by the united states because it still tips off the attorney general furthermore,congress carefully preserved the rights of the most deserving qui tam plaintiffs those who qualify as original sources quotations and citations omitted.
finally,relator is incorrect in suggesting that his suit is not based upon the allegations contained in the california suit as to aspect.relator misconstrues what this court has understood the terms based upon to mean in the context of fca liability.we do not,as relator suggests,determine whether information in a subsequently filed action is based upon a prior filing in terms of whether the former is parasitic to the latter.rather,we compare the respective substance of the prior disclosures with a relator complaint and determine if they are substantially similar.ondis,at.as just discussed,the allegations in both suits detail a scheme involving multiple billing or individual billing for the unbundled components for a single test under cpt codes and.we thus find that,as to aspect,the district court was not incorrect in finding that all requirements of the public disclosure bar were met,and it properly found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction as to relator fca claim based on the aspect allegations.
relator fca claim based on its allegations as to aspect of millennium purportedly fraudulent scheme is also barred since aspect was both publicly disclosed and was substantially similar to information provided in millennium california suit.the facts alleged pertaining to millennium confirmation testing scheme in relator complaint were as follows since the start of the company in,millennium used and promoted the physician billing model designed to,inter alia,increase the physician defendants revenues,and significantly increase millennium revenues and market share,enabling millennium to profit from the billing for confirmations the physician defendants ordered significantly more testing for their patients since entering the conspiracy than they did prior to participating in the conspiracy with millennium,and this included confirmatory tests ordered by the physician defendants and in conspiracy with the physician defendants,millennium knowingly encouraged them to misrepresent the medical necessity of confirmation testing.
the california complaint states that millennium business strategy included physicians sending drug tests and results to an independent laboratory,such as millennium,for confirmation testing and additional testing for drugs not tested with the point of care device,and further states that the laboratory only bills for any confirmation tests and additional testing that is necessary.this statement in millennium complaint is counterposed with statements made in calloway account executives regarding confirmation testing and billing.as cited supra,calloway account executives forwarded q a sheets warning of the potential fraud surrounding billing for confirmation tests.specifically,they warned that billing practices like millennium may be considered by cms because your point of care testing is also eia enzyme immunoassay testing and regulations specifically prohibit one eia test confirming another eia test.the physician needs to order only confirmation tests performed by or.
thus,the allegations in relator complaint and the california suit both concern fraudulent billing of confirmation tests when such tests were purportedly unnecessary,and they further link that practice with millennium billing model which benefits millennium and the physician defendants.since these allegations are substantially similar,relator fca claim as based in aspect of millennium fraudulent scheme is jurisdictionally barred.
further,the claims arising from aspects and in relator complaint can not be saved by relator belated assertion that he was the original source of the information concerning millennium alleged fraud.an original source,as defined by statute at the time relator original complaint was filed,is an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.e b.
knowledge is direct if it is as marked by absence of an intervening agency,instrumentality,or influence immediate.ondis,at citation omitted.knowledge is not direct if it is based on research into public records,review of publicly disclosed materials,or some combination of these techniques.id.knowledge is independent if it did not depend on the public disclosure or if it merely constitutes a use of an individual unique expertise or training to conclude that the material elements already in the public domain constitute a false claim.id.at.the relator as the proponent of federal jurisdiction bears the burden of proving its existence by a preponderance of the evidence.id.at.
relator raises his original source argument for the first time on appeal.he contends that he had direct and independent knowledge of the information at issue because he undertook an independent investigation into millennium activities by reviewing millennium physician billing model and other documents as well as speaking to a number of people about millennium practices during his tenure at calloway.specifically,he claims that he reviewed complaints from the sales force,interviews with lead industry personnel,actions he observed,documents he obtained,and information he gleaned independently.relator further claims that even information he gleaned from public sources,including the california complaint,should be exempted from the public disclosure bar because he discovered and synthesized that information.
however,because relator never raised his original source argument before the district court,it is waived.warren freedenfeld assocs.mctigue,cir if any principle is settled in this circuit,it is that,absent the most extraordinary circumstances,legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court can not be broached for the first time on appeal.quoting teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen and helpers union,local superline transp.et,cir in any event,while relator claims in a conclusory manner that he conducted an independent investigation of millennium fraudulent practices,he fails to show how the knowledge he obtained was direct.specifically,the sources he lists for obtaining the information calloway sales force and lead industry personnel are third parties,and relator makes no argument to meet his burden in showing that the information gleaned from those sources is marked by the absence of an intervening agency,instrumentality,or influence.see ondis.further,our case law is clear that k nowledge that is based on research into public records,review of publicly disclosed materials,or some combination of these techniques is not direct.id.to the extent that relator asks this court to join other circuits in holding that discovery and synthesis of information from different public sources during the course of an independent investigation can result in original sourcing,we decline to do so.this,because of the scant and vague evidentiary basis upon which relator makes his claims both as to aspects and of the alleged fraud and as to the nature of his purported independent investigation beyond interviews with calloway sales force and leading industry personnel.see,kennard comstock resources,cir united states bank of farmington,cir united states ex rel.barajas northrop,cir see also united states ex rel.yannacopolous dynamics,d.
finally,we review a district court denial of leave to amend a complaint for abuse of discretio
