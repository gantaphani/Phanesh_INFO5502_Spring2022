appellants steven may and angela radcliffe brought this action under the false claims act,the fca,against purdue pharma and purdue pharma,together,purdue.giving preclusive effect to this court decision in united states ex rel.radcliffe purdue pharma,cir,the district court dismissed the action on res judicata grounds.because we agree with the appellants that this action is not barred by res judicata,we vacate the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
mark radcliffe,the husband of appellant angela radcliffe,was a district sales manager for purdue.radcliffe was laid off as part of a reduction in force in june,and he subsequently executed a general release the release of all claims against purdue in order to receive an enhanced severance package.radcliffe thereafter filed an fca action against purdue qui tam i in which he alleged that purdue falsely marketed its narcotic pain medication oxycontin to physicians as being twice as potent as ms contin a cheaper,drug also manufactured by purdue,thus making it appear that oxycontin was cheaper per dose than ms contin.the government investigated radcliffe allegations and declined to intervene in his action.
the district court eventually dismissed qui tam i with prejudice,concluding that radcliffe amended complaint did not satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of rule.see.b in alleging fraud or mistake,a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.on appeal,we affirmed the dismissal on alternate grounds,concluding that the release barred radcliffe fca claims.see radcliffe,at.
after we issued our opinion in radcliffe,steven may and angela radcliffe the relators commenced this fca action against purdue qui tam ii setting forth allegations nearly identical to those advanced by mark radcliffe in qui tam i.as noted,angela radcliffe is mark radcliffe wife steven may was formerly a sales representative for purdue under mark radcliffe supervision.
purdue moved to dismiss the relators complaint on res judicata grounds,arguing that our decision in radcliffe barred the relators from proceeding with qui tam ii.see,martin am.bancorporation retirement plan,cir res judicata precludes the assertion of a claim after a judgment on the merits in a prior suit by the parties or their privies based on the same cause of action.purdue also argued that the fca bar,see e,divested the district court of jurisdiction over the action and that the complaint did not allege fraud with the particularity required by rule.
as to the res judicata question,purdue contended that radcliffe was a judgment on the merits because it affirmed a dismissal that the claims asserted in qui tam i and qui tam ii were identical and that the parties were identical because qui tam i was brought on behalf of the united states as the real party in interest,such that the government and any other relators seeking to allege identical claims are bound by its judgment.the relators argued that radcliffe was not a decision on the merits for res judicata purposes,but they did not directly dispute purdue contention that the parties were identical.
citing adkins allstate insurance,cir,the district court held that radcliffe was necessarily a decision on the merits because it affirmed the grant of a motion.see adkins,at for purposes of res judicata,a summary judgment has always been considered a final disposition on the merits.and because the relators did not challenge the other requirements,the district court held without further analysis that the instant case is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.the district court therefore dismissed the action without considering the other issues raised by purdue.this appeal followed.
the relators argue on appeal that the district court erred by giving preclusive effect to radcliffe and dismissing their action on res judicata grounds.the preclusive effect of a judgment issued by a federal court is a legal question governed by federal common law and subject to de novo review.see taylor sturgell,d federal common law determines preclusive effect of judgment clodfelter republic of sudan,cir district court application of res judicata reviewed de novo.
generally speaking,whether res judicata precludes a subsequent action turns on the existence of three factors a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and the later suit and an identity of parties or their privies in the two suits.clodfelter,at cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the relators contend that radcliffe was not a judgment on the merits because the decision was premised on a determination that mark radcliffe lacked standing to pursue the fca claims.because article iii standing requirements are jurisdictional,see,united states day,cir,cert.denied,d,and jurisdictional dismissals are not judgment s on the merits for purposes of res judicata,goldsmith mayor of,cir the relators argue that radcliffe is not entitled to preclusive effect.
we disagree with the relators reading of our decision in radcliffe.standing principles require the plaintiff to have suffered an injury in fact.lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks omitted.in the context of the fca,however,it is the government,not the relator,that has been injured by the defendant fraud.fca relators nonetheless have standing to bring an fca action because the fca effect s a partial assignment of the government damages claim and thus statutorily vests private citizens with standing.agency of natural res.united states ex rel.stevens,d.
in radcliffe,we discussed fca standing principles in the course of rejecting one of radcliffe arguments against enforcement of the release.as we explained,radcliffe had a statutory fca claim,and the necessary legal standing as partial assignee once the government suffered an injury and radcliffe became aware of the fraud.radcliffe,at emphasis added.we did not conclude that radcliffe lost standing when he executed the release,but instead simply held that his execution of the release effected a waiver of his right to sue purdue.see id.at explaining that mark radcliffe had the right to bring an fca action before he signed the release,a right he waived under the terms of the release.
although we reject the relators assertion that radcliffe was a jurisdictional dismissal,we nonetheless agree with their position that the district court erred by giving radcliffe preclusive effect.
as the government notes in its amicus brief,the traditional inquiry is modified in cases where the earlier action was dismissed in accordance with a release or other settlement agreement.see keith aldridge,cir.a judgment entered based upon the parties stipulation,unlike a judgment imposed at the end of an adversarial proceeding,receives its legitimating force from the fact that the parties consented to it.norfolk chevron,cir.thus,where a dismissal is based on a settlement agreement,the principles of res judicata apply in a somewhat modified form to the matters specified in the settlement agreement,rather than the original complaint.id.that is,given the contractual nature of consent decrees and settlement agreements,the preclusive effect of a judgment based on such an agreement can be no greater than the preclusive effect of the agreement itself see keith,f d at when a consent judgment entered upon settlement by the parties of an earlier suit is invoked by a defendant as preclusive of a later action,the preclusive effect of the earlier judgment is determined by the intent of the parties.charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure judgments that rest on stipulations,admissions in pleadings,or consent to the very judgment itself should be given effect according to the intention of the parties see also ohio valley envtl.coal.aracoma coal,cir settlement agreements operate on contract principles,and thus the preclusive effect of a settlement agreement should be measured by the intent of the parties.internal quotation marks omitted 
the release executed by mark radcliffe in qui tam i was personal to him and addressed only his rights and the claims that he might assert against purdue.neither the relators nor the government were parties to or intended beneficiaries of the release.see restatement second of contracts see also united states ex rel.ubl iif data solutions,cir explaining that the effect of an agreement settling fca claims is a question of federal common law as to which the restatement second of contracts provides guidance.the release itself,therefore,could not serve as a defense to any claims that the relators or other might assert against purdue.indeed,we made this very point in radcliffe when we noted that the release did not prohibit the government or another relator from pursuing similar claims against purdue.radcliffe,at.our decision in radcliffe enforcing the release did not and could not broaden the scope of the release.accordingly,because the release does not bar from proceeding against purdue,the judgment enforcing the release can not bar such claims.
purdue arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.our dismissal in radcliffe may well have been a dismissal on the merits under rule.see.unless the dismissal order states otherwise,a dismissal under this subdivision b and any dismissal not under this rule except one for lack of jurisdiction,improper venue,or failure to join a party under rule operates as an adjudication on the merits.shoup bell howell,cir f or purposes of res judicata,a summary judgment has always been considered a final disposition on the merits.internal quotation marks omitted.as the supreme court has explained,however,it is no longer true that a judgment on the merits for purposes of rule is necessarily a judgment entitled to effect.semtek int l,lockheed martin,d emphasis added.as discussed above,the preclusive effect of a judgment enforcing a settlement agreement is determined by the intent of the parties as reflected by the terms of that agreement,and the release did not bar anyone other than mark radcliffe from bringing suit against purdue.regardless of the procedural vehicle through which our decision enforcing the release was entered,our decision simply did not broaden the scope of the release.see am.cyanamid capuano,cir a dismissal with prejudice contained in a consent decree is not a ruling on the merits that applies to others under the law of claim preclusion.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.accordingly,the district court erred by dismissing qui tam ii as barred by principles of res judicata.
we turn now to the contention urged by purdue and the government that the district court dismissal can be affirmed because the action is prohibited by e,the fca public disclosure bar.addressing that argument requires us to first determine which version of the statute applies to this case.
the complaint focuses on conduct occurring between and.at that time,the bar provided 
no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
e a emphasis added.
section e,however,was amended on march,after the occurrence of the conduct alleged in the complaint,but before the commencement of this action.see patient protection affordable care act,j,stat.the statute as amended provides that 
the court shall dismiss an action or claim under this section,unless opposed by the government,if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed 
i in a federal criminal,civil,or administrative hearing in which the government or its agent is a party 
ii in a congressional,government accountability office,or other federal report,hearing,audit,or investigation or 
iii from the news media,
unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
e a emphasis added.purdue argues that the amended version of the statute applies,while the relators argue that the prior version of the statute applies.
t he principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal.landgraf usi film,internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,a presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence,and that presumption must apply unless congress has clearly manifested its intent to the contrary,hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d.the presumption against retroactivity,however,is limited to statutes that would have genuinely retroactive effect.landgraf,at.a statute has retroactive effect if it takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
applying these principles,the supreme court has twice held that the fca amendments may not be applied to cases arising before the effective date of the amendments.see graham cnty.soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,d the legislation makes no mention of retroactivity,which would be necessary for its application to pending cases given that it eliminates petitioners claimed defense to a qui tam suit.see also schindler elevator united states ex rel.kirk,d citing graham county and stating that the amendments are not applicable to pending cases.the circuit courts considering the issue have likewise applied the pre version of the statute.see united states ex rel.zizic,llc,cir united states ex rel.goldberg rush.med,cir united states ex rel.jamison mckesson,cir united states ex rel.poteet bahler,cir united states ex rel.hixson health mgmt,cir.
purdue suggests the analysis should be different in this case,however,because graham county and schindler,unlike this case,involved complaints that were filed before the statute was amended.we disagree.the retroactivity inquiry looks to when the underlying conduct occurred,not when the complaint was filed.see landgraf,at t he legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place emphasis added.while changes in jurisdictional and procedural rules are often applied to pending cases,that is not because the date of filing controls,see hughes aircraft,at refusing to apply fca amendments to action that was commenced after the effective date of the amendments,but because application of those new rules often does not have an impermissible retroactive effect.see landgraf,at application of a new jurisdictional rule usually takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.internal quotation marks omitted id.at because rules of procedure regulate secondary rather than primary conduct,the fact that a new procedural rule was instituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit does not make application of the rule at trial retroactive.
the supreme court determined in graham county and schindler that application of the amendments would have retroactive effect if applied in those cases,and we conclude that the amendments likewise would have retroactive effect if applied in this case.see baldwin city of greensboro,cir retroactivity inquiry looks to whether the new statute would have retroactive effect as applied to the particular case internal quotation marks omitted gordon pete auto serv.of denbigh,cir th e retroactivity inquiry is narrow,for it asks not whether the statute may possibly have an impermissible retroactive effect in any case,but specifically whether applying the statute to the person objecting would have a retroactive consequence in the disfavored sense.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
