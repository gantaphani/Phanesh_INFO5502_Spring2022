background 
because this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to faiola,the nonmovant,and resolve all reasonable inferences in her favor.stonkus city of brockton sch.dep t,cir.
apco is a commercial headquartered in atlanta,georgia.it maintains a regional office in franklin,massachusetts,serving the new england territory.from november to february,when faiola was terminated,faiola worked as a sales representative and manager of apco franklin office.she was responsible for meeting or exceeding sales quotas making periodic factory visits managing her sales assistant and maintaining the office by,for example,dumping the trash and keeping up a good appearance in the showroom.faiola reported to teresa cox,apco vice president of sales and marketing.
in,faiola work performance at apco began to decline.from to,faiola met only forty to percent of her annual sales quotas and performed as one of apco lowest grossing sales representatives.in,cox informed faiola that the new england territory had the lowest sales volume and that faiola needed to improve her performance.in march,cox requested that faiola take an aptitude test because her sales were in a slump.
the summary judgment record indicates that during periods of her employment,faiola suffered from ongoing mental health conditions and a bout of high blood pressure.karen dempsey,a psychotherapist,treated faiola from may until september.during her first visit with faiola,she recorded that faiola was sad,low energy,disorganized,anxious,and forgetful.she diagnosed faiola with dysthymia,a low level depression that is not incapacitating,and over the course of treatment,she prescribed various medications for faiola,including prozac and klonopin.
faiola dysthymia went into remission in april and reappeared by april.dempsey found that although faiola experienced stress and anxiety in early january,due to the breakup of a relationship and concern over her father ailing health,there were no signs of depression.at no point did dempsey diagnose faiola with classic depression or an anxiety disorder.additionally,dempsey never found that faiola was prevented from engaging in any of life typical activities,nor did she ever place work limitations or physical restrictions on faiola.
barbara gray,a clinical social worker,began counseling faiola in.she noted that in january,faiola presented herself with low energy and was mentally exhausted from her relationship troubles and concern for her father.again,however,the record indicates that despite these events,faiola was stable and able to go about her life.
faiola began treatment with edward levitan in september after she tested her blood pressure at a cvs pharmacy and found the reading high.levitan prescribed medication for faiola,and,by early march,faiola blood pressure returned to normal range.at no point did levitan instruct faiola to limit her daily activities or avoid travel by airplane.
faiola testified in her deposition that throughout her tenure at apco and despite her various mental and physical health conditions,she was always able to perform her work activities and roles and all the essential aspects of her job.she walked three miles a day,traveled by airplane both for work and pleasure,and in,she took a second job selling insurance.since her termination,faiola has made business trips to orlando,florida and atlantic city,new jersey.
faiola wrongful termination allegations stem from events that occurred in february.on february,faiola received an from apco employee andrea blackwood regarding logistics for an upcoming annual sales conference in atlanta.faiola reported to blackwood that she was going through a personal crisis and was not sure if she was going to be up to the conference,and she specifically informed cox that she was going through a rough time.faiola did not reference any health conditions that prevented her from attending the conference,nor did she reference the conference itself when she cox.
on february,cox traveled to the franklin regional office for a scheduled visit.during the visit,cox and faiola met with customers around the territory.in conversation with cox during the day,faiola raised some issues that she experienced with certain apco products.that night at dinner,faiola and cox discussed faiola personal problems and her medical conditions.faiola told cox that levitan had instructed her to avoid stress.at no point did faiola and cox discuss the upcoming sales conference,nor did faiola explain that her conditions prevented her from flying to or attending the upcoming conference.the next morning,before cox left to return to atlanta,she terminated faiola purportedly due to her poor sales performance.
subsequently,faiola brought suit alleging disability discrimination the district court granted apco motion for summary judgment.it found that faiola failed to establish that she was disabled because her alleged impairments did not substantially limit a major life activity.specifically,it found that flying was not a major life activity,and to the extent that flying implicated the major life activity of travel,faiola was not substantially limited.faiola timely appealed.

we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.lockridge of me,cir.we may affirm a district court ruling on any grounds supported by the record.carreras sajo,garc√≠a partners,cir quoting assocs.of north,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby.once the moving party makes a sufficient preliminary showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists,the nonmovant must show a factual dispute without relying on improbable inferences,conclusory allegations,or rank speculation.ingram brink,cir.
faiola appears to assert two theories of disability discrimination she was terminated because of her disabilities,and apco failed to provide a reasonable accommodation because it did not excuse faiola from flying to and attending the sales conference.we find that both theories of liability fail because faiola did not make the required threshold showing of disability under the statutory schemes at issue.
to prove disparate treatment under both title i of the ada and chapter a plaintiff must first show that she suffers from a disability as defined by the ada and chapter she was nevertheless able to perform the essential functions of her job,with or without reasonable accommodation and her employer took an adverse employment action against her because of her protected disability.see carroll xerox,cir.to make out a reasonable accommodation claim,a plaintiff must establish the first two prongs set forth above and also that the employer knew of her disability but did not reasonably accommodate it upon a request.id.at see also reed lepage bakeries,cir 
faiola sought to prove that she suffered from a disability by demonstrating a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited one or more of her major life activities.carreras,at.in assessing this standard,we use a test whether the plaintiff suffered a mental or physical impairment,whether the life activity limited by the impairment qualifies as major,and whether the impairment substantially limited the major life activity.id.the inquiry is individualized.id.at.
