on november,cape wind associates,cape wind submitted an application to the army corps of engineers corps for a navigability permit under section of the rivers and harbors act of section,to construct and operate an offshore data tower in an area of nantucket sound known as horseshoe shoals.horseshoe shoals is located on the outer continental shelf ocs,land subject to federal jurisdiction and control under the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla.
the proposed tower was to consist of a platform and a fixed monopole approximately feet high,supported by three steel piles driven into the ocean floor.various instrumentation was to be attached to the data tower in order to gather data for use in determining the feasibility of locating a wind energy plant on horseshoe shoals.a separate permit application for the wind energy complex originally proposed to include wind turbines with blade rotors rising feet above mean sea level,occupying square miles of horseshoe submitted to the corps in november.that application is not at issue in the instant appeal,and we therefore will not engage in any analysis of the corps authority to permit construction of the wind energy plant.
on december,the corps announced that it was considering cape wind application for the data tower,and invited the public to submit comments during a period that included two public hearings and ended on may.on august,the corps issued a section permit authorizing cape wind to construct and maintain the data tower,subject to the imposition of sixteen special conditions,including that cape wind remove the data tower within five years,that it post a bond for emergency repairs or removal,and that it share the data collected with,and permit the installation of additional equipment by,government agencies,research institutions,and others.department of the army permit.the permit was accompanied by an environmental assessment ea and finding of no significant impact fonsi,as required by the national environmental policy act nepa.
appellants subsequently filed an action against the corps in the district of massachusetts,arguing that the corps lacked authority to issue a section permit for the data tower the corps acted arbitrarily and capriciously,in violation of the administrative procedure act apa,a,by granting cape wind permit application in spite of cape wind lack of property rights on the ocs and the corps failed to comply with nepa requirements for evaluating the data tower environmental impacts.upon the receipt of cross motions for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the corps and intervenor cape wind.we review that decision de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellants.see straughn delta air lines,cir.we will uphold the grant of summary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact and appellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we affirm the decision of the district court.
discussion 
corps jurisdiction 
the reach of the corps section permitting authority on the ocs turns on a question of statutory interpretation.congress passed ocsla in to assert federal jurisdiction over the ocs and to establish a regulatory framework for the extraction of minerals therefrom.see see also ten taxpayer citizens group cape wind,cir a major purpose of the ocsla was to specify that federal law governs on the ocs internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,ocsla extended the corps section regulatory authority to prevent obstruction to navigation in the navigable waters of the united states to artificial islands and fixed structures located on the ocs.f.in,this grant of authority was amended to apply instead to the artificial islands,installations,and other devices referred to in subsection a of this section.e.subsection a,in turn,extends federal jurisdiction to 
all artificial islands,and all installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed,which may be erected thereon for the purpose of exploring for,developing,or producing resources therefrom,or any such installation or other device other than a ship or vessel for the purpose of transporting such resources.
id.at a emphasis supplied.appellants argue that the clause which may be erected thereon for the purpose of exploring for,developing,or producing resources therefrom,is restrictive,and limits the corps permitting authority on the ocs to structures related to the extraction of mineral resources thus,they argue,the corps lacked authority to grant a section permit for construction of cape wind data tower.the corps,on the other hand,has determined that its section authority was extended to artificial islands,installations,and other devices located on the seabed,to the seaward limit of the ocs,by section f of ocsla as amended.b internal citation omitted.
the district court determined that the which may be clause of subsection a was not restrictive.see alliance to protect nantucket sound,united states dep t of the army,d,finding that ocsla text supports the corps position that section jurisdiction extends to all ocs structures including,but not limited to,those that may be used to explore for,develop,or produce resources quoting a emphasis supplied by district court.thus,the district court held,the corps has authority to grant a section permit for all structures on the ocs,regardless of their function.
we find the statutory text in question ambiguous.it is not apparent whether the reference to subsection a inserted into subsection e in refers to all artificial islands,and all installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed,a,or only to all such installations used to explore,develop or produce resources.in light of this ambiguity,the corps and cape wind invite us to defer to the corps interpretation of its authority,see b,under the chevron doctrine.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.in this case,however,we find it unnecessary to reach the question of chevron deference because legislative history reveals,with exceptional clarity,congress intent that section authority under ocsla not be restricted to structures related to mineral extraction see id.at.if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.strickland comm r,me.of human,cir evaluating legislative history to determine whether congressional intent was unambiguously expressed.
in the conference report for the oscla amendments,congress explained that the changes to subsection e 
were technical only and there was no intent to change present law.the existing authority of the corps of engineers applies to all artificial islands and fixed structures on the ocs,whether or not they are erected for the purpose of exploring for,developing,removing and transporting resources therefrom.the amendment is not intended to change the scope of this authority,but merely to conform the description of the types of structures,no matter what their purpose,to the types of structures listed in subsection a,namely all installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed.it is not the intention of the conferees to limit the authority of the corps as to structures used for the exploration,development,removal,and transportation of resources.
conf.conference report at,reprinted in,emphasis supplied appellants suggest that the intent expressed in the language was not that corps authority be unlimited with regard to the purpose of the structure in question,but rather with regard to different types of structures within the subset of structures related to exploring for,developing,removing or transporting minerals.this interpretation strains the conference report language well beyond the meaning it can bear,especially in light of congress awareness when it amended ocsla that the corps had issued section permits for ocs structures unrelated to mineral extraction on several occasions between and,implying its approval of the exercise of such jurisdiction.see conference report at the corps existing authority has been used to regulate the construction and location of artificial fishing reefs,radio towers,and a proposed gambling casino which was to be constructed on reefs.it also applies to structures erected for the purpose of exploring for and transporting resources emphasis supplied.appellants efforts to counter this legislative history with language from the senate report from the original ocsla that could be read to imply a limitation of corps permitting authority to structures intended for mineral resource development is unavailing.the corps current authority is determined by ocsla as amended in,and the conference report addresses congress intent at that time.see also united states commonwealth energy subsidiary,cir the most dispositive indicator of congressional intent is the conference report.
congress made clear that t he existing authority of the corps applies to all artificial islands and fixed structures on the ocs,whether or not they are erected for the purpose of exploring for,developing,removing,and transporting resources therefrom.conference report at.this express legislative intent is determinative of the scope of the corps authority.accordingly,we hold that the corps had jurisdiction to issue a section permit for cape wind data tower.
property interest 
appellants argue that the corps failed to properly consider cape wind lack of a property interest in the ocs land on which it sought to build the data tower when it granted the section permit.
agency regulations 
appellants first argue that the corps has a regulation,d,that requires that the applicant actually have necessary property rights in the area of the project and make an affirmation to that effect.the regulation states the application must be signed by the person who desires to undertake the proposed activity the signature of the applicant will be an affirmation that the applicant possesses or will possess the requisite property interest to undertake the activity proposed in the application id.of course,the regulation does not say that the applicant must actually possess,or possess in the future,the requisite property rights,but only that the applicant must make an affirmation to that effect.
the corps responds to appellants argument by referring to another of its regulations,which provides that 
a corps permit does not convey any property rights or any exclusive privileges.furthermore a corps permit does not authorize any injury to property or invasion of rights or any infringement of federal,state or local laws or regulations.the applicant signature on an application is an affirmation that the applicant possesses or will possess the requisite property interest to undertake the activity proposed in the application.the corps will not enter into disputes but will remind the applicant of the above.the dispute over property ownership will not be a factor in the corps public interest decision.
g emphasis supplied see also environmental assessment and statement of findings at,paraphrasing g in response to comments about cape wind lack of property interest.
the corps indicated in its response to comments about cape wind lack of a property interest,and articulated more fully during the course of this litigation,that it deems g to require only that it remind applicants of their need to possess all requisite property interests.in the corps view,g requirement that a dispute over property ownership will not be a factor in the corps public interest decision applies to preclude consideration of a dispute over the adequacy of an applicant property interests in the project site.see environmental assessment at.
appellants argued before the district court that the requirement that applicants affirm possession of the requisite property interests for the proposed activity,g,means that such property interests must,in fact,be possessed by the applicant.because cape wind had no property interest in the proposed data tower site,nor could it obtain such an interest under current law,its section permit application ought to have been denied.the district court rejected this argument,deferring instead to the corps interpretation that g requires only an affirmation from the applicant,which cape wind provided.according to the district court,g,as interpreted by the corps,fit in as part of a regulatory scheme designed to keep the corps out of property disputes.alliance,d at.accordingly,not only did the regulation relieve the corps of any obligation to consider the sufficiency of cape wind property interests,but it precluded such consideration altogether.id.at.
the face of g evidences the corps intent not to be involved in private property disputes.and as to disputes over public land,g,by its own terms,says that a permit does not convey any property rights or any exclusive privileges.thus,the regulation does not purport to address disputes over public property,but rather attempts to insulate the corps from addressing those disputes.appellants argument that the regulations impose an obligation on the corps in a section case to resolve disputes over the ownership of public or private property is simply wrong.
even if the regulation did not clearly support the corps interpretation on its face,the corps interpretation would nonetheless be entitled to deference.see thomas jefferson shalala,d holding that agency interpretation during administrative adjudication of its own regulations must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation internal quotation marks omitted south shore,thompson,cir deference appropriate where language of regulations admits of differing interpretations,and the agency chooses reasonably among them.deference would be appropriate even though the interpretation was offered in a less formal session than the interpretation in thomas jefferson.see auer robbins,d deferring to agency interpretation contained in amicus brief submitted in dispute between private parties see also christensen harris county,d limiting auer deference to ambiguous regulations united states hoyts cinemas,cir affording some weight to justice department interpretation of its regulation even though the department gloss is offered only in a brief rather than in some more formal manner 
we find that the corps reading of g is a reasonable one the regulation text states first that an applicant must affirm possession of the requisite property interests,then that the corps will not enter into disputes but will remind the applicant of the above that is,the corps will remind the applicant of its need to possess the requisite property interest.the regulation next states that t he dispute over property ownership will not be a factor in the corps public interest decision.the dispute refers back to the category of disputes that result in a reminder of the need to obtain all required property interests.it is reasonable,in this context,to determine that the dispute over property ownership into which the corps may not enter includes a dispute over whether the applicant has acquired all requisite property is,a dispute over the sufficiency of the applicant property interests.further,the goal of preventing the corps from expending its resources on evaluating the legal question of the sufficiency of property interests is a reasonable one.this is so whether the dispute is over the sufficiency of the applicant interests as opposed to those of other private property holders in the area,or as opposed to those of the federal government,especially since the corps is permitted to consider the potential impact of the project on others property interests during its public interest review.see a listing considerations of property ownership as factor to consider in determining whether,and under what conditions,to grant permit.accordingly,we find that the district court did not err in deferring to the corps interpretation of its regulations and its decision not to evaluate the sufficiency of cape wind property interests in the ocs.
public interest review 
appellants also argue that the corps duty to act in the public interest required it to consider the effect that granting cape wind application would have on
