the commonwealth of massachusetts,by the administrator of masshealth,its state medicaid program,appeals from a dismissal of its lawsuit against federal officials for failure to state a claim under.b.the commonwealth claims that the federal centers for medicare medicaid services cms and associated entities violated the federal medicaid statute when they refused to allow the commonwealth to recover reimbursement directly from cms in four cases of retroactive dual eligibility.
in each of these four cases,an individual who received massachusetts medicaid funds to pay for medical services was later deemed retroactively eligible for federal medicare funds for the period in which the individual received those services.the state is trying to secure reimbursement for its past medicaid payments by directly petitioning the federal government for reimbursement rather than going back to the providers of services,whom the medicare program clearly recognizes as appropriate claimants.this dispute is not over whether the commonwealth should ultimately be reimbursed by medicare,but whether it has chosen a permissible mechanism to recover reimbursement.massachusetts united states,cir.
the commonwealth,for understandable reasons,argues that its obligations under the federal medicaid statute,as stated in a b and d,require that it seek and recover reimbursement directly from cms in these cases of retroactive dual eligibility,and that this is the commonwealth exclusive avenue.secretary sebelius and the defendant administrators of cms and associated entities deny this and reply that the commonwealth must instead seek reimbursement from providers,who then in turn must obtain payment from medicare.
the federal defendants argue this is so because a and only allow providers to receive payments from medicare,and the commonwealth is,as it admits,not a provider.defendants argue that to meet its obligations to recover reimbursement under the medicaid statute,the commonwealth must request reimbursement from individual providers,who then must obtain payment from the federal medicare agency.the federal defendants say that this is the procedure used by other states to recover reimbursement,that they have been consistent in their interpretation,and that massachusetts is simply wrong when it asserts this interpretation leaves it with no way to recover reimbursement in accordance with the medicaid statute.
in this matter of statutory interpretation,the district court held that the medicare statute unambiguously forbids the commonwealth from recovering reimbursement directly from cms.in the alternative,it held that even if the medicare statute were ambiguous,cms interpretation must be sustained under chevron,u.natural resources defense council,and auer robbins.
we requested at oral argument,and subsequently received,additional briefing on what mechanisms would be available for the commonwealth to obtain reimbursement if its position were not accepted.we affirm the district court judgment,albeit on different reasoning.
the federal medicare and medicaid statutes,which compose title xviii and title xix of the social security act,interact.medicare is a health insurance program for those who are over age or have certain disabilities et.by contrast,medicaid is a health insurance program for individuals it is funded by both the federal government and state governments et.
medicaid is generally supposed to be a payer of last resort.dep t of health human servs.ahlborn,quoting,at.this means that when an individual is entitled to medicare and eligible for medicaid,medicare,like any other third party,is the primary payor,and medicaid may only pay a claim to the extent that payment allowed under the applicable payment schedule exceeds the amount of medicare payment.medicaid program state plan requirements and other provisions relating to state third party liability programs.state medicaid agencies must take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services that would otherwise be paid by medicaid.a a.it is not disputed that medicare is a third party under this provision 
under the federal medicaid statute and its accompanying regulations,state medicaid agencies must follow two sets of requirements when addressing liability first,if probable liability is established at the time a claim is filed with the state agency,the agency must reject the claim and return it to the service provider.b a a.second,if a state medicaid agency only learns of the existence of a liable third party or benefits become available from a third party after medicaid has paid the claim,the medicaid agency must seek recovery of reimbursement.d see also a b.the commonwealth relies on the second statute and regulation,arguing they require that it seek and obtain reimbursement directly from cms when the liable third party is medicare 
the defendants argue that several provisions of the federal medicare statute,particularly a,forbid the commonwealth from recovering reimbursement directly from cms.with some exceptions not relevant here,payment for services may be made only to providers of services if filed in such manner,and by such person or persons as the secretary may by regulation prescribe.a.by regulation,in,the secretary has prescribed that claims for services of providers must be f iled by the provider.the commonwealth argues,and the defendants agree,that it is not a provider.the defendants argue that while the commonwealth may not recover reimbursement directly from cms,it may fulfill its obligation under the medicaid statute by asking providers to obtain payment from medicare.
the defendants argue that providers must comply with such requests by filing a demand bill with medicare.the medicare statute requires that providers agree to make adequate provision for return of money incorrectly collected from individuals.a c.cms regulations state that a payment properly made to a provider by an individual not considered entitled to medicare benefits will be deemed to be an incorrect collection when the individual is found to be retroactively entitled to benefits.b.cms argues that this regulation,though it refers to payments made by individuals rather than state medicaid agencies,requires that providers return state medicaid funds in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.it argues that providers that do not comply with this requirement face sanctions,including termination of participation in medicare.see b a a.
one reason the commonwealth takes the position that it may recover reimbursement directly from medicare is its interpretation of a decision of the massachusetts supreme judicial court,atlanticare medical center commissioner of the division of medical assistance.in that case,a group of private healthcare providers challenged a massachusetts regulation that required healthcare providers to return state medicaid payments when a liable insurer was identified after payment.the providers argued that massachusetts placed an undue burden on providers by making them responsible for recovering payment from third parties.id.the supreme judicial court struck down the state regulation.in the course of its ruling it reasoned that the state regulation was inconsistent with the federal medicaid statute,namely a b,and that state medicaid agencies must seek reimbursement directly from liable third parties.id.at.
some of the reimbursement claims at issue in atlanticare belonged to individuals who were retroactively deemed eligible for medicare.we stress that neither the parties nor the issues before this court are the parties or issues that were before the supreme judicial court.in atlanticare,the issue was the validity of a state regulation further,the regulation governed reimbursement from all types of third parties,not merely instances involving medicare.as cms has noted,the state regulation did not make allowances for the fact that medicare and medicaid are not coextensive in coverage it required providers to return medicaid funds before medicare made a determination that it was liable for the particular services for which those funds had been paid.federal medicare and medicaid officials were not parties to the action and the supreme judicial court never heard their views on the issue before us,as it noted in its decision.id.at.apparently,the commonwealth did not ask cms to submit a brief to the court expressing its views.chase bank usa,mccoy.
the parties in atlanticare initially agreed that the commonwealth could not recover costs directly from medicare.the commonwealth argued that under,medicare may only pay directly to providers.at oral argument,however,both parties conceded that it might be possible for the commonwealth to recover directly from medicare.atlanticare,at.the court stated that the commonwealth had cited no authority demonstrating that it could not obtain reimbursement directly from medicare and that there was nothing in the record to suggest that the commonwealth had ever attempted to obtain reimbursement in this fashion.id.at.the decision did not address either a or,or how cms administers these provisions.
both before and after the atlanticare decision,the federal medicare and medicaid agency has taken the position that only providers may petition medicare for payment absent an express allowance to the contrary.in a letter to the commonwealth,cms wrote that a state medicaid agency may not submit initial claims for part a medicare services,as these claims must be filed by the provider.the letter distinguished initial claims from appeals arising from denials of claims.it stated that a dually eligible beneficiary may certainly appoint the state medicaid agency to act as his or her representative to pursue appeal of an individual denied medicare claim but without such appointment,the state medicaid agency may not act on its own behalf,with an exception not relevant here.
in april,shortly after the decision in atlanticare,cms issued a state medicaid director letter stating that when an individual receives payment for health services from medicaid and is later deemed retroactively eligible for medicare,the state medicaid agency should ask the provider of services to file a claim with medicare.the letter was sent to all state medicaid directors,not just the massachusetts medicaid director.in may,the commonwealth sought clarification of this letter in light of atlanticare.in september,it also sought to establish itself as a qualified billing entity that could submit claims to medicare on behalf of medicaid recipients and the facilities that provide services to those recipients.
cms denied the commonwealth request that it be established as a qualified billing entity and reiterated that only providers may file claims with medicare.in an october letter denying the commonwealth request,cms wrote that its interpretation of the regulations prohibits medicare intermediaries from paying benefits due to a provider to other than the provider of services.in a december letter clarifying the april guidance letter,cms wrote that there is no statutory authority under medicare to allow a state to seek recovery and be paid directly from medicare because medicare allows only providers to bill and be paid by medicare.it repeated that when medicare liability is not known until after a state medicaid agency has paid a claim,the state should ask the provider to bill medicare.
in light of cms statements,the commonwealth sought a modification of the declaratory judgment entered in atlanticare on the ground that new information demonstrated it could not recover reimbursement directly from medicare.in support of this motion,the commonwealth submitted copies of the april guidance letter and the ensuing correspondence between it and cms.a massachusetts superior court denied this motion.atlanticare med.ctr.reynolds,slip op.at.july.the superior court stated that it found the supreme judicial court decision in atlanticare more persuasive than the april guidance letter,and that the letter had merely restated arguments the commonwealth advanced in atlanticare.id.at.again,no federal medicare or medicaid official was involved in the suit or asked to submit the agency views.the commonwealth did not,apparently,pursue the matter to the supreme judicial court.
in later communications with the commonwealth,cms continued to reiterate its position that a state medicaid agency can not recover reimbursement directly from medicare.the commonwealth,correctly or not,believed itself between a rock and a hard place.in december,the commonwealth submitted four test claims to cms,seeking reimbursement from medicare for medicaid funds paid on behalf of individuals later deemed retroactively eligible for medicare.cms rejected these claims on the ground that the commonwealth is not a provider,consistent with the agency position stated earlier that may not receive payments from medicare.the commonwealth then filed this lawsuit it is undisputed that the commonwealth has exhausted its administrative remedies.
the commonwealth seeks an injunction ordering cms to accept,process,approve,and pay the four reimbursement claims it submitted in,as well as a declaration that the defendants must accept and process reimbursement claims submitted by the commonwealth in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss under.b,and dismissed the commonwealth for summary judgment as moot.it held that a unambiguously prohibits the commonwealth from recovering reimbursement directly from cms.the district court held in the alternative that even assuming the statute was ambiguous,must receive deference because it was promulgated pursuant to an express delegation of authority and is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.
we review de novo a district court grant of a motion to dismiss,taking as true all facts and making all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.boroian mueller,cir.this case does not involve any factual disputes,only a pure question of law whether the federal medicaid statute requires that cms allow the commonwealth to recover reimbursement directly from cms in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.this does not involve review of whether there is a valid claim for reimbursement in these four test cases it involves review of the appropriate mechanism to obtain such reimbursement.we agree with the defendants that as a matter of federal law,the commonwealth may not recover reimbursement directly from cms in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.this does not mean,however,that the state has no mechanism to receive reimbursement.it does.
agency deference under chevron 
this question of statutory interpretation must be treated within the familiar framework set forth in chevron.the secretary of health and human services administers the federal medicare and medicaid statutes,as well as a number of other statutory provisions within the social security act.the secretary has delegated administrative responsibilities for medicare and medicaid to cms.see.in assessing the requirements of this statutory scheme,we must be mindful of any deference to which cms may be entitled.
under chevron,when a court reviews an agency construction of the statute it administers,the court must first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if the intent of congress is unambiguous,the court must follow that intent.id.at.if the intent of congress is ambiguous,the agency interpretation is entitled to chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.united states mead.under chevron,such agency interpretations must be upheld if they are based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.

chevron step one 
our first holding begins and ends with step one of the chevron analysis the statutory scheme forecloses the interpretation advanced by the commonwealth.to determine whether a statute exhibits ambiguity courts look at both the most natural reading of the language and the consistency of the interpretive clues congress provided.succar ashcroft,cir quoting dynamics land,cline.this analysis looks to the text,structure,and,when permissible,legislative history of the statute.id.at.we look first to text and structure we note that neither party introduces legislative history and we are unaware of any on point 
both parties contend that the plain language of the statutory scheme unambiguously supports their position.the commonwealth points to a b,which states that when third party liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available,with an exception not relevant here,the state medicaid agency must seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability.the defendants point to a,which states that,with exceptions again not relevant here,payment for services furnished an individual may be made only to providers of services as defined in the medicare statute.
neither of these provisions,read in isolation,speak to whether the commonwealth,which is not a provider,may recover reimbursement directly from medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.although a b plainly requires that state medicaid agencies seek reimbursement in such cases,it does not create a right to receive reimbursement directly from cms.this provision does not identify from whom the state agency should seek this reimbursement.the federal medicare agency could be a candidate,but the providers that received the initial payment are more plausible.the fact that a refers to payment for services furnished an individual,moreover,permits the commonwealth to argue that its claim is instead for reimbursement for past payments made for such services.
although no statutory provision explicitly resolves the question presented here,the statutory scheme does not allow the interpretation advanced by the commonwealth.the medicare statute equates reimbursement and payment and does not allow to receive payments from medicare.the commonwealth is not included among any of the express allowances in the medicare statute for to receive payments.the medicare statute thus forecloses the commonwealth from receiving reimbursement directly from medicare this result is consistent with both the medicaid statute requirement that state medicaid agencies seek recovery of reimbursement and congress intent that medicaid generally be the payer of last resort.
we look first to the meaning of reimbursement in the statutory scheme.neither the medicare statute nor the medicaid statute supports a distinction between payment and reimbursement relevant to the test claims in this case.as to the medicare statute,a discusses claims for reimbursement within its provisions governing payment for services.the statute does not define reimbursement,nor does it express parameters for reimbursement claims as if they were different from the parameters for payment claims.as to the medicaid statute,a b neither defines reimbursement nor distinguishes between it and other forms of payment for our purposes.in this statutory context,it is most natural to read reimbursement as a particular type of payment.see succar,at.
the commonwealth challenges this reading on two grounds.first,it argues that the medicare statute allows to recover reimbursement despite its limitations on who may recover payments for services.second,it argues that this interpretation of the statutory scheme contravenes congressional intent that medicaid generally be the payer of last resort.
as to the first argument,the commonwealth has not identified any statutory language that would allow state medicaid agencies to recover reimbursement from cms under these circumstances.the commonwealth has identified only one instance in which the statute allows payment for reimbursement to an express exception to a involving emergency services.see d b.we are aware of only one other instance in which the statute allows a to receive reimbursement when an individual has made payments for certain hospital services furnished outside the united states.see f.these provisions do not allow all to receive reimbursement,and they do not make any specific allowance for the commonwealth reimbursement claims.rather,they are express exceptions to the general rule we have noted.
as to the second argument,our reading of the statute is not in tension with congress intent that medicaid generally be a payer of last resort.the statute does not preclude state medicaid agencies from receiving reimbursement in cases of retroactive dual eligibility through a mechanism other than direct application to medicare.as the commonwealth argues,t he choice between two federal statutes requires an analysis of both,to see if they are indeed incompatible or if they can be harmonized.boston maine.bay transp,cir quoting coker trans world airlines,cir.here,the medicare and medicaid statutes can be harmonized with one another in a manner that preserves the purpose of the statutory scheme recognized in ahlborn state medicaid agencies may seek and recover reimbursement by asking providers to return state medicaid funds.
the commonwealth advances a functional argument that,whatever the medicare statute says,the commonwealth can not reasonably expect to receive reimbursement from providers and that therefore the statute should be construed to allow it to recover reimbursement directly from medicare.the first of these propositions is doubtful,and the second does not follow from it.the commonwealth has never employed the demand bill procedure that the secretary describes as an available alternative,and so it can not say that the procedure will not work.nor does the commonwealth cite any statutory language that prohibits state medicaid agencies from recovering reimbursement from medicare by asking providers to employ this demand bill procedure 
chevron step two and auer 
our alternative holding is under the second step of chevron,under which we look to the agency regulations.even if the statutory scheme did not speak unambiguously as to whether the commonwealth may obtain reimbursement directly from medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility,cms interpretation of its regulations resolves this question and is entitled to deference.the commonwealth does not dispute the validity of the regulation upon which cms relies.nor does it challenge cms regulation concerning the obligations of state medicaid agencies seeking reimbursement as required by the medicaid statute,d.the commonwealth only challenges the agency interpretation of.this challenge fails under auer.see mccoy.at.
on their face,the agency regulations do not expressly speak to whether the commonwealth may recover reimbursement directly from medicare in cases of retroactive dual eligibility.under the medicare statute,the secretary has provided that a ll claims for services of providers must be f iled by the provider.a.under the medicaid statue,the secretary has only provided that an agency that seeks reimbursement must seek recovery of reimbursement subject to certain time constraints.d.these provisions do not address whether reimbursement claims are claims for services of providers.nor does the broader regulatory structure cast light on this question.these regulations do resolve whether the commonwealth may file claims for services of providers directly with medicare it may not.
the secretary has interpreted such that state medicaid agencies may not recover reimbursement
