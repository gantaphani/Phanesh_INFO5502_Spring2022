plaintiff ira madison,a virginia state prisoner,sued the commonwealth of virginia and various virginia department of corrections officials claiming,inter alia,that his requests for kosher meals were denied in violation of section of the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of,a rluipa.on an earlier appeal,we held that rluipa did not impermissibly advance religion in violation of the establishment clause.madison riter,cir hereinafter madison i.virginia now argues that rluipa is unconstitutional because it exceeds congress authority under the spending and commerce clauses and also that sovereign immunity bars its application against the states.the district court upheld rluipa under the spending clause and found that virginia had waived its immunity.
we hold that rluipa is a valid exercise of congress spending power and that,because virginia voluntarily accepted federal correctional funds,it can not avoid the substantive requirements of rluipa.with respect to sovereign immunity,we find that congress unambiguously conditioned federal funds on a state consent to suit.because that condition does not clearly and unequivocally indicate that the waiver extends to money damages,however,the eleventh amendment bars madison claim for monetary relief against the state.accordingly,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
plaintiff madison is an inmate at a virginia state correctional facility.he is a hebrew israelite and member of the church of god and saints of christ headquartered at temple beth el in suffolk,virginia.members of temple beth el are required to eat a kosher diet and to celebrate passover.
in july and again in march,plaintiff informed virginia correctional officials that his religious beliefs directed him to eat a kosher or common fare diet.local prison officials approved both requests,but central classifications services ccs,a agency of the virginia department of corrections,overturned the approval.ccs denied plaintiff request because it found that the daily regular,vegetarian,and prison menus afforded plaintiff adequate dietary alternatives.ccs administrators also questioned the sincerity of madison religious beliefs and considered madison history of disciplinary problems.
in august,madison brought suit in federal district court claiming that he was being denied kosher meals in violation of section of rluipa.this section prohibits prison officials from substantially burdening an inmate religious exercise unless doing so is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.a.virginia argued that rluipa was unconstitutional because it violated the establishment clause and because it exceeded congress authority under the spending and commerce clauses.madison riter,d.the district court ruled that rluipa impermissibly advanced religion in violation of the establishment clause and dismissed plaintiff rluipa claims.id.at.we reversed,finding that congress can accommodate religion in section of rluipa without violating the establishment clause,and remanded for consideration of virginia other arguments.madison i,at.
on remand,the district court ruled that rluipa is a valid exercise of congress spending clause power.madison riter,d.accordingly,the court declined to reach virginia commerce clause challenge.id.at.finally,the district court concluded that,by accepting federal funds,virginia had waived its sovereign immunity for rluipa damages claims.id.at.
pursuant to b,the district court certified its rulings on the constitutionality of rluipa for interlocutory appeal.id.at.virginia requested and we granted discretionary interlocutory review.see b.virginia also appeals the district court ruling that virginia waived its sovereign immunity from rluipa damages claims,a final order appealable under the collateral order doctrine.see puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d.
rluipa prohibits the states from imposing substantial and unjustified burdens on the religious liberty of state prisoners.a.congress enacted this statute in the wake of the supreme court decision in city of boerne flores,d.in that case,the court ruled that the religious protections mandated by the religious freedom restoration act of,et.rfra,exceeded congress remedial power under section of the fourteenth amendment.boerne,at.accordingly,rfra could not be enforced against the states.see id.following boerne,congress made findings on the burdens placed on inmates religious exercise,and attempted to reinstate rfra religious liberty protections,titling the new statute rluipa.madison i,at.this time,congress relied on its spending and commerce clause authority.id.
the spending clause provision at issue in this case,section b,applies rluipa religious liberty provisions whenever a substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives federal financial assistance.b.the term program or activity includes all of the operations of a department,agency,special purpose district,or other instrumentality of a state or of a local government.id.a.the virginia department of corrections is a state agency that receives federal financial assistance.virginia insists,however,that rluipa can not be applied to this case because the statute exceeds congress spending clause authority.
the spending clause is a permissible method of encouraging a state to conform to federal policy choices,because the ultimate decision of whether to conform is retained by the can always decline the federal grant.new york united states,d.congress has broad power to set the terms on which it disburses federal money to the states.arlington cent.sch.dist.bd.of educ.murphy,d citation omitted.this power is,of course,not unlimited.see,pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.because even those congressional directives imposed by spending clause inducement shift the balance,the supreme court in south dakota dole,d,placed several restrictions upon congress authority to persuade.
to be valid,spending clause legislation must meet several requirements the exercise of the spending power must be for the general welfare,the conditions must be stated unambiguously,the conditions must bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal spending,the conditions must not violate some other constitutional command,and the financial inducement offered by congress must not be so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.constantine rectors visitors of george mason,cir quoting litman george mason,cir.we join four of our sister circuits and hold that,because rluipa satisfies each of the dole requirements,it fits comfortably within congress spending clause authority.see cutter wilkinson,cir benning georgia,cir charles verhagen,cir mayweathers newland,cir.
the first dole restriction is derived from the plain text of the constitution an exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit of the general welfare.const.art.i,cl.in considering whether a particular expenditure is intended to serve general public purposes,courts should defer substantially to the judgment of congress.dole,at.citation omitted.here,congress sought to protect prisoners religious liberty from unjustified and substantial burdens,see cutter wilkinson,d,and we have no trouble concluding that rluipa attempt to protect prisoners religious rights and to promote the rehabilitation of prisoners falls squarely within congress pursuit of the general welfare.charles,at.
the second restriction placed on congress spending federally imposed conditions be stated from the very structure of our system of governance.it is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that where congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between the states and the federal government,it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.will.dep t of state police,d quoting atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d see also gregory ashcroft,d.the clear statement rule is particularly appropriate here because spending clause legislation is much in the nature of a contract.arlington.at quoting pennhurst,at.t o be bound by federally imposed conditions,recipients of federal funds must accept them voluntarily and knowingly.id.states can not,of course,knowingly accept conditions of which they are unaware or can not reasonably ascertain.id.accordingly,it is congress burden to affirmatively impos e a condition in clear and unmistakable statutory terms.dep t of educ.riley,cir en banc.
to determine whether rluipa obligations apply to the states,we must therefore ask whether the statute furnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue in this case.arlington.at.see also riley,at.here,the plain language of section provides clear notice of rluipa religious liberty protections,stating 
no government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
a.congress provided equally clear notice that these conditions apply to state entities that accept federal prison funds.the statutory definition of government includes states and their agencies and departments.id.a.and section applies to any case in which the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives federal financial assistance.id.b.because rluipa furnishes clear notice regarding the liability at issue here,arlington.at,there is nothing unfair about holding virginia to its side of the bargain.should the conditions prove overly onerous,virginia need only decline federal correctional funds.
the third spending clause restriction requires that conditions on federal grants bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal spending.new york,at.see also dole,at.this requirement is met here because section conditions are not triggered by the acceptance of education,highway,or other similarly unrelated funds.instead,the section applies where a state chooses to accept federal prison funding.see b.
the commonwealth nonetheless maintains that rluipa fails the relatedness test because there is no apparent federal interest at stake in the operations of state prisons.we disagree.prisoner rehabilitation and protection of religious liberties are legitimate congressional aims related to federal funding of state prisons.see,cutter,at benning,at charles,at mayweathers,at.for s incere faith and worship can be an indispensable part of rehabilitation.cutter,at quoting cong.rec,statement of kennedy.at bottom,rluipa religious liberty protections not only bear some relationship to the federal government interest in prisoner rehabilitation,but are also an important part of that process.id.
virginia takes a narrow view of relatedness.it asserts that while congress might direc t how a specific appropriation is spent,by,for example,appropriating money for prison construction and then dictating the size of each individual cell,congress may not impose restrictions.the spending clause,however,has never required congress to impose conditions on a basis.see oklahoma civil serv.comm n.see also dole,at.needless to say,money is fungible,and since federal funds may directly finance a proscribed substantial and unnecessary burdens on religious exercise in state simply make that activity possible by freeing up other funds,restraints are permissible.see sabri united states,d.indeed,we recently rejected a similar spending clause challenge to the ada blanket condition on disability discrimination even though the ada also applies on a basis.see constantine,at.
dole fourth limitation recognizes that other constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds.at.virginia argues that rluipa religious liberty protections are an unconstitutional condition because congress may not impose rluipa requirements on the states directly it is well settled,however,that objectives not thought to be within article i enumerated legislative fields,may nevertheless be attained through the use of the spending power and the conditional grant of federal funds.dole,at.internal citation and quotation omitted new york,at.the unconstitutional conditions doctrine is not a prohibition on the indirect achievement of objectives which congress is not empowered to achieve directly.dole,at.instead,that bar stands for the unexceptionable proposition that the spending clause may not be used to induce the states to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional.id.because rluipa does not induce the states to engage in unconstitutional activities,it does not impose an unconstitutional condition.see charles,at.
virginia tries to avoid this long line of precedent by asserting that the supreme court recent opinion in rumsfeld forum for academic institutional rights,d,adopted the madisonian,rather than the hamiltonian,view of the spending clause.as we explained in litman george mason university,n cir,alexander hamilton and james madison took very different views of the scope of the spending clause.hamilton believed that the clause embraced a vast variety of particulars,which are susceptible neither of specification nor of definition,id.at n citing alexander hamilton,report on manufacturers,reprinted in the founders constitution,philip kurland ralph lerner,while madison understood it to vest congress with no additional authority,id.citing letter from james madison to andrew stevenson,reprinted in the founders constitution.virginia argues,in effect,that rumsfeld fair adopted madison view that the framers intended to limit the scope of congress spending clause power to those powers otherwise bestowed by the constitutional charter.id.
but rumsfeld fair can not be read to work such a sea change in existing law.the case rejected a spending clause challenge.plaintiff law schools argued that,because the solomon amendment that military recruiters be provided with campus access equal to that provided other the schools first amendment rights,it was an unconstitutional condition.id.at.the court disagreed,finding that the equal access condition did not violate the first amendment and that,because congress was free to impose the solomon amendment directly pursuant to its article i powers,it necessarily could impose the condition under the spending clause.id.at.the court,far from limiting congress spending authority,confirmed the hamiltonian view that this power is arguably greater than congress power to achieve its goals directly.id.at.in any event,we may not overlook decades of clear directives in response to virginia claim that the supreme court has overruled sub silentio its prior precedents.see tenet doe,d state oil khan,d.
in somewhat the same vein,virginia argues that rluipa is unconstitutional because it requires the states to provide prisoners with religious accommodations that are not compelled by the constitution.nothing in the spending clause,however,forecloses congress from placing conditions on federal funds that reach beyond what the constitution requires.see dole,at.in dole,for example,the court rejected a spending clause challenge to a statute that required the states to adopt a minimum drinking age of age limit wholly absent from constitutional text.id.
dole final restriction bars coercive financial inducements.of course,every financial incentive is in some measure a temptation.dole,at.quoting steward mach.davis.but hard choices do not alone amount to coercion.rather,the coercion analysis seeks to differentiate between those choices that are truly voluntary and those that are illusory,passing the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.id.internal quotation omitted.
virginia claims that rluipa is unconstitutionally coercive because it conditions one hundred percent of federal funding for state prisons on compliance with rluipa.but the virginia department of corrections received a mere of prison funding from the federal government in.it is difficult to see how even one hundred percent of this tiny fraction could leave the state without a real choice regarding the funds and their conditions.indeed,virginia does not even argue that it can not operate its prisons without the federal monies instead,it argues a funding statute that threatens to withhold the entirety of a federal grant is per se coercive.
to be sure,a spending clause statute that conditions an entire block of federal funds on a state compliance with a federal directive raises coercion concerns.f ederal statutes that threaten the loss of an entire block of federal funds upon a relatively minor failing by a state are constitutionally suspect.west virginia dep t of health human,cir.at its most basic,however,the coercion inquiry focuses on the financial inducement offered by congress.constantine,at quoting dole,at.a small carrot does not,in other words,become a club merely because the entire modest amount is at stake.see,oklahoma schweiker,internal quotation omitted.where,as here,congress has offered relatively mild encouragement to the states,the choice to accept or reject federal funds remains the prerogative of the states.dole,at.we are,therefore,hard pressed to find that the commonwealth capacity for free choice was overcome by the prospect of such limited financial assistance.see constantine,at.
our discussion of the various dole criteria should not obscure the fact that resolution of virginia spending clause challenge is straightforward.congress has a legitimate interest in seeing how federal funds are spent.congress also has a legitimate interest in protecting the religious freedoms of inmates and in not funding systems that violate them.congress has made it clear that states accepting its money must conform to rluipa requirements.and,for their part,states are perfectly free to decline funds that amount in their totality to a small fraction of their corrections budgets.
much of the commonwealth argument is devoted to its sovereign authority to operate state prisons and to set religious policies within its borders to the extent not forbidden by the constitution.that may be true as a general matter,but the argument ignores the fact that one attribute of state sovereignty is the ability to waive it in pursuit of other objectives,in this case pursuit of federal funding.taken to its logical extreme,the commonwealth argument would have us pronounce that state sovereignty is so absolute as to be unwaivable and that the federal government,notwithstanding the absence of a waiver,must keep the funds flowing.this goes well beyond what we can accept.in short,the spending program at issue here leaves intact both the legitimate interests of the federal and state governments.to strike rluipa down on spending clause grounds would be an extraordinary assertion of judicial authority.
virginia next argues that the district court erred by holding that virginia knowingly consented to damages actions against the state.although the conditions of compliance are clearly stated in rluipa text,see supra part,this fact in no way implies that a state has consented to each and every remedy to which it conceivably could be subjected.it is a fundamental construct of our federal system that t he eleventh amendment restricts the judicial power under article iii,and also that article i can not generally circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon federal jurisdiction.seminole tribe of florida,d see also fed.maritime comm state ports,d indeed,the constitution split the atom of sovereignty into federal and state governments,term limits,thornton,d kennedy,concurring,thus ensuring that,p ower being almost always the rival of power,the federalist,at alexander hamilton clinton rossiter,t he different governments will control each other,at the same time that each will be controlled by itself,the federalist,at james madison.firmly embedded within the framers design is the principle that a private party may not file suit against an unconsenting state.fed.maritime comm n,at.
although principles of dual sovereignty limit congress authority to abrogate state immunity,a state may consent to suit.beers arkansas,how.this unremarkable proposition,seminole tribe,at,reflects an exercise,rather than a limitation of,state sovereignty.thus,a state may waive its immunity by voluntarily participating in a federal spending program provided that congress has expressed a clear intent to condition participation on a state consent to waive its constitutional immunity.litman,at quoting atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d.
nevertheless,state sovereign immunity is among the constitution most foundational principles,see,brown div.of motor vehicles,cir,and we may not infer that a state immunity from suit in the federal courts has been negated,pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.t here can be no consent by implication or by use of ambiguous language.library of congress shaw,d quoting united states rayon importing.a waiver must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text.see lane pena,d.for this reason,general participation in a federal program or the receipt of federal funds is insufficient to waive sovereign immunity.see atascadero,at.rather,congress must make its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.hoffman.dep t of income maintenance,d plurality internal quotation omitted.in this case we must determine whether congress,in enacting rluipa,expressly and unequivocally conditioned federal prison funds on virginia consent to suit,and,if so,whether that waiver of sovereign immunity unambiguously includes damages suits 
we begin with the text of the statute.see,arlington.at.section a of rluipa provides that any person may assert a violation of this chapter as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.a.the statute defines government to include states,state agencies,and state departments.id.on its face,rluipa thus creates a private cause of action against the state,madison i,at,and virginia can not be heard to claim that it was unaware of this condition.by voluntarily accepting federal correctional funds,it consented to federal jurisdiction for at least some form of relief.see benning,at state was on clear notice that by accepting federal funds for its prisons,it waived its immunity from suit under rluipa.because appropriate relief ordinarily includes injunctive and declaratory relief,see,shea county of rockland,cir,madison claims for equitable relief are not barred by the eleventh amendment.
that rluipa unambiguously conditions federal prison funds on a state consent to suit,however,does not end our inquiry.congress is,of course,free to condition funds upon a waiver of sovereign immunity against liability without waiving a state immunity from monetary damages awards.see lane,at.united states nordic,d.see also administrative procedure act,waiving federal sovereign immunity for relief other than money damages.and a waiver of sovereign immunity for some type of remedy does not necessarily extend to suits for damages.webman fed.bureau of prisons.
in analyzing whether a sovereign has waived its immunity,we strictly construe the scope of any alleged waiver in favor of the sovereign.lane,at.we may not enlarge the waiver beyond what the language requires.shaw,at.internal citations and quotations omitted.consent to suit is never implied.see atascadero,at.and ambiguities are construed in favor of immunity.nordic,at.in short,t o sustain a claim that the government is liable for awards of monetary damages,the waiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims.lane,at.see also nordic,at.it is of no moment that some of the cases in this area involve the question of whether congress has waived federal sovereign immunity,because i n considering whether the eleventh amendment applies cases involving the sovereign immunity of the federal government provide guidance.california deep sea research,d.
