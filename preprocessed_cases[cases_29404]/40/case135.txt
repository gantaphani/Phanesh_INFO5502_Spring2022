a federal jury awarded appellant michael fortin in damages against a wells,maine police officer after finding that the officer negligently used force in arresting fortin in.in a ruling,the district court reduced the award to the maximum set by the maine tort claims act mtca or act for the personal liability of government employees.see.ann.tit,on appeal,fortin argues that the mtca cap is inapplicable here because the officer was covered by an insurance policy that triggered a higher limit under the act.
after carefully examining the statutory scheme,cases interpreting the mtca,and the insurance policy,we have determined that the appeal turns on two unresolved questions of maine law.specifically,whether fortin is limited to recovery of a award depends on the unexplored relationship among several provisions of the mtca governing damage awards against government employees.our analysis may also require determining what interpretive rule should be applied to ambiguous insurance policies providing mtca liability coverage.we have found no clear controlling precedents in maine law to guide us on these issues,which require policy choices we believe are properly reserved for the state courts.ann.tit.hence,we certify the two questions identified below to the maine supreme judicial court the law court.see me.a.
background 
the facts surrounding fortin arrest are immaterial to the legal issues,and we thus recite only the procedural background of the case.fortin filed this action in may against appellee jacob titcomb,a wells police officer,and six other defendants,asserting federal and state civil rights violations and a negligence cause of action stemming from the alleged use of excessive force to arrest him two years earlier in september,at the end of a trial,the jury rejected the civil rights claims but found titcomb liable under state negligence law for injuring fortin.the court had instructed the jury that an arrest is a discretionary act for which police officers are entitled to immunity under maine tort law unless the officer conduct was so egregious that it clearly exceeded the scope of any discretion an officer could have possessed in his or her capacity as a police officer.see richards town of eliot,me polley atwell,me.the jury judgment thus incorporated a finding that titcomb was not entitled to immunity the jury assessed in damages against him.
titcomb subsequently filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure e asking the court to amend the judgment to conform to d of the mtca,which expressly limits the personal liability of government employees for negligence to although insurance coverage may affect the availability and amount of damages under the mtca,see.ann.tit,titcomb argued that the town insurance policy,which provided coverage for the officer,did not affect the applicability of titcomb further asserted that,even if the policy limits governed the damages award,fortin recovery was limited to by the policy express terms.
the district court granted the motion to amend.it sidestepped fortin contention that titcomb had not submitted proper evidence of insurance coverage showing eligibility for the statutory cap holding that the officer was entitled to an amended judgment under d whether or not the insurance policy was considered.the court stated that fortin bore,and failed to meet,the burden to proffer evidence showing that the statutory cap on the officer liability was superseded by an insurance policy providing greater coverage.moreover,the court read the policy excerpts that the defendant submitted to expressly retain the d cap.thus,in the district court view,the result was the same,a statutory limitation of was placed on fortin recovery whether or not the court relied on the defendants policy evidence.
on appeal,fortin argues that the district court misapprehended both the mtca and the insurance policy.he asserts that,under maine case law,titcomb bore the burden to show a lack of coverage for damages exceeding the limit of d and that the officer failed to satisfy that obligation.fortin contends that,in fact,the town of wells policy endorsement expressly provides coverage in excess of that cap.
we begin our discussion with a review of the relevant provisions of the mtca before examining whether the statute commands a particular outcome here.because that examination raises significant and difficult issues of maine law on which there is no controlling precedent,we have decided to certify a question concerning the mtca construction to the law court.we have recognized that certification may be an appropriate option even where,as here,the parties have not requested it.see real estate bar ass for,real estate info,cir holding that t his court has discretion to certify questions to the sjc when a party fails to move for certification in the district court,or to do so sua sponte me.drilling blasting,ins.of,cir noting that the court on occasion certifies questions to a state highest court upon our own motion.
if the law court determines that fortin right to recover the full jury award is not limited by the mtca,the coverage provided by the town insurance policy will become the centerpiece of the parties dispute.we thus describe the parties debate over the policy language and explain why the policy interpretation also raises a question of state law requiring guidance from the law court.
ii.the maine tort claims act 
limitation of liability under the mtca 
the mtca contains several provisions that speak to the amount of damages available to a plaintiff who brings a successful claim against a governmental entity or its employees.the provision at the core of this case,d,is titled personal liability of employees of a governmental entity,and it limits the exposure of a government employee to for any claims arising out of a single occurrence.ann.tit,d see supra note.another provision of the act,titled limitation on damages,sets a cap on the award of damages that may be obtained against either a governmental entity or its employees,or both for any and all claims arising out of a single occurrence.ann.tit.the limit is explicitly superseded in certain instances,however,when a governmental entity procures liability insurance if the insurance provides protection in excess of the limit of liability imposed by section,then the limits provided in the insurance policy shall replace the limit imposed by section.id.
personal liability limitation of damages 
appellee titcomb argues that this case is easily resolved by reference to the terms of d,which he reads to impose a ceiling whenever damages are awarded against a government employee in his personal capacity.he argues that,which allows damages up to against a governmental entity or an employee,must apply only to employees in their official capacity because that provision otherwise would be inconsistent with d much lower cap.he points out that suits are,in essence,suits against the employing governmental entities.hence,narrowly construing the word employee in retains the distinction between the government liability capped at under and the individual liability capped at under 
no maine cases address the relationship between d and,and titcomb depiction of the statutory scheme presents one plausible interpretation of the mtca.section d explicitly caps the recovery of damages from individual employees at,and that clear limitation would be inconsistent with if the latter provision were construed to allow up to in damages against such individuals.arguably,then,the reference in to employees can not refer to the category of employees covered by d,those sued in their personal capacity.
that construction is reinforced by the language of,which allows governmental bodies to procure insurance coverage against liability for any claim against it or its employees for which immunity is waived.ann.tit.section makes no reference to rather,it states if the insurance provides protection in excess of the limit of liability imposed by section,then the limits provided in the insurance policy shall replace the limit imposed by section.a fair reading of,in the context of d and,could lead to the conclusion that d is a provision that applies to claims against governmental employees,while and apply to all other types of claims involving governments and their employees.under that construction of the mtca,the district court would have properly reduced fortin award to the limit set by 
titcomb construction has some support in the maine law court requirement to strictly construe the mtca.darling augusta mental health,me see also mueller penobscot valley,me rejecting a broad reading of the act.the law court appears to be particularly strict in construing the provisions of the mtca that govern suits against government employees.in darling,for example,the court explained that the tort claims act,both by the limits it places on personal liability of employees and by the discretionary authority it grants an immune entity to defend and indemnify a nonimmune employee,articulates the significant state interest in regulating the conditions under which suit can be prosecuted against government employees.see darling,at.
as one example of that interest,the court emphasized that the act limits to the amount that a plaintiff can recover in a personal suit against a nonimmune employee.id.at emphasis added.although this statement is dicta,and does not consider the possible impact of insurance coverage on the d cap,it reflects an assumption by the law court that a plaintiff recovery in a personal suit against a government employee is limited to.
similarly,in moore city of lewiston,me,the law court concluded that operates differently as to government entities than as to government employees sued in their personal capacity.in moore,the court noted that,under,the city of lewiston could have waived its statutory immunities in its liability insurance policy it thus held that summary judgment on the basis of those immunities,without a copy of the city liability insurance policy in evidence,was premature.see id.at.the court went on to hold,however,that the city could not override the personal immunity of its employees by purchasing insurance,contrasting the explicit waiver in of governmental immunity with the absence of any such explicit waiver for individual employees.see id.concluding that regardless of whether the city insurance coverage extended to the defense or indemnity of the police officers,their personal immunity from liability could not have been waived by the city purchase of insurance.
although moore addressed the issue of immunity rather than damages,titcomb argues that its reasoning applies to him.moore,he says,recognizes that gives different effect to the availability of insurance for an employee sued in his personal capacity than for a government entity or an employee sued in his official capacity.he claims that it follows from moore discussion of employee immunity that an employee liability also is unaffected by insurance coverage and,hence,remains subject to the limit established by 
titcomb construction is not,however,the only plausible reading of the statutory scheme.as an initial matter,refers to employees without qualification.reading the statute to contain an restriction would be a significant departure from its plain thus an approach at odds with basic principles of statutory interpretation under maine law.see anastos town of brunswick,me in interpreting a statute,we first consider the plain language and will consider other indicia of legislative intent if the language is silent or ambiguous.jusseaume ducatt,me in interpreting a statute,we look first to the plain meaning expressed in the statute language to discern the legislature intent.indeed,the law court has previously construed the term employee in another section of the mtca to include a government employee in his or her personal capacity.see mueller,at rejecting plaintiff argument that the notice requirement of.ann.tit,referring to a governmental entity or employee,does not apply to claims against employee as an individual.
it may also be significant that d and by their terms address different matters the former relates to personal liability,while the latter imposes a limit on damages.hence,there arguably would be no consistency problem if a plaintiff were awarded more than in damages against a government employee in his individual capacity,so long as the employee personal exposure is capped at.in fact,the possibility of a damages judgment beyond the employee cap appears to be contemplated by the language of d,which implicitly recognizes that the award may include an amount in excess of th e limit.ann.tit,thus,it is possible to conclude that,under the terms of and d,a plaintiff may obtain an award of damages against a government employee in his individual capacity up to but any amount over is not recoverable from the employee himself.
the question would then be what alternative source of funding exists for the balance of such an award.one possible answer,again requiring our attention to,is that the maine legislature contemplated the availability of insurance coverage for that purpose as noted above,states that,where a governmental entity procures liability insurance,the policy limits will replace the statutory cap if the insurance provides coverage in excess of the limit of liability imposed by section.id.although we gave significance above to the absence of any reference in to the d cap,that omission does not necessarily reflect a legislative intent to strictly limit recoveries in claims to.it also is plausible to conclude that does not reference d simply because an employee personal liability would be unaffected by insurance coverage.
rather,in allowing a government to procure insurance for any claim against it or its employees,may have been designed at least in part with the victims of government actors in,to provide a source of funds for payment of damages that could not be satisfied against the offending actor because the total award was in excess of the d cap.because the insurance coverage would not override the limit of personal liability set by d,there would be no reason to refer to that cap.the pertinent limit on damages would instead be the ceiling imposed by for damages against governments and their employees.hence,could have been intended to apply to claims as it would to any other tort claim against a government or governmental employee where insurance coverage provides protection in excess of the limit of liability imposed by section,see id,a plaintiff may recover up to the policy limit.
the legislative history of the mtca provisions could be read to support the view that d does not remove claims from the scope of and.when first enacted in,the mtca contained no statutory cap on damages against employees other than in,which at that time imposed a limitation for damages against a governmental entity and its employees.ann.tit.early on,however,the mtca was amended to include a limit on the personal liability of not in instances in which the state is immune.id.see me.pub.laws,chap.in the same amending legislation,the language of was modified so that it closely tracked the current version allowing governmental entities to purchase insurance for claim s against it or its employees and providing that the policy limit would replace the limit of liability imposed by section.ann.tit,see me.pub.laws,chap.not until was the personal liability cap extended to all government employees,me.pub.laws,ch,and the next year it was broadened to cover claims without regard to the employing entity immunity.see pub.laws,ch.later,the personal liability provision was recodified and became see me.pub.laws,ch.
thus,it is reasonable to conclude that the mtca always reflected legislative intent to permit successful plaintiffs to obtain compensatory damage awards up to later,based on the harmful actions of governmental employees performed as part of their employment.over time,the legislature also demonstrated its concern that employees at all levels of government be protected from personally bearing the burden of such large judgments.both of these concerns arguably are addressed by the combined effect of d,and no individual employee will be saddled with responsibility beyond,but the plaintiff will be entitled to a more complete recovery up to the statutory or policy limits when the offending employee liability is covered by insurance.reading d to supersede the liability limit in every instance,without regard to the availability of insurance,would defeat the balance the legislature may have intended to establish between remedying injuries caused by government employees and protecting those employees from financial ruin.
the law court existing precedent on the mtca does not provide guidance on the issue we face here.most of the cases address the relationship between insurance coverage and immunity,without discussing the interaction of the various statutory limitations on damages.one such example is moore,described above,in which the court held that access to insurance does not waive the personal immunity of employees,as it does under for insured governmental entities.see moore,at see also grossman richards,me section only affects the liability of governmental entities,and does not waive the immunity of the individual insured employees.doucette city of lewiston,me holding that both police dispatcher and city possessed immunity,and that city immunity was not waived under the terms of its insurance policy.
here,however,immunity is not the issue.the jury found that titcomb was not entitled to immunity,which paved the way for an award of damages against him.the sole question is whether the damages ceiling is set by d there is insurance and.appellee invokes rodriguez town of moose river,me,where the court held that d limited the damages recoverable in an action against a government employee in her personal capacity.id.at.in rodriguez,however,there was no insurance policy available to supplement the prescribed by the statute.id.at.
the two competing constructions of the mtca that we have described each have policy rationales to justify them.the act effects a limited waiver of the government sovereign immunity,and even explicit waivers are construed narrowly.knowlton att y,me see also reid town of mount vernon,me statutory exceptions to the doctrine of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed.sanford town of shapleigh,me s overeign immunity is the rule,and liability for governmental entities is the statutorily created,narrowly construed exception.quoting clockedile me.dep t of,me alterations in original.hence,we could not lightly conclude that the maine legislature intended to permit recoveries beyond the limit of d via governmental insurance policies.even if government coffers would not be directly affected by payment of the additional amount the possible indirect cost of higher insurance premiums is enough to give us pause.indeed,the mtca legislative history indicates particular concern for local fiscs and the cost of insurance the areas open ed to liability were those where it appeared likely that an insurance program could be arranged within the reach of the pocketbooks of maine communities and the state.rodriguez,at quoting legis.rec.remarks of collins.
at the same time,however,the mtca itself is a policy statement that,in certain circumstances,the governmental immunity from suit should give way to the objective of compensating individuals who have been harmed by government actors the legislature apparent assumption was that governmental entities would acquire insurance to cover liability for claims outside immunity protection,and explicitly authorizes governments to obtain such coverage for employees,as well as for the entities themselves.with designated by as the appropriate cap on recoveries against either a governmental entity or its employees,or both,the legislature purpose to compensate victims of injury arguably would be suitably met by allowing insurance coverage for the amount in excess of d cap.
we deem the choice between these two paths a matter of state policy best left to the state courts.see in re hundley,cir noting that resolution of a certified question may require policy judgments about the applicability of state law that the sjc is in the best position to make trull volkswagen of,cir noting that certified question in that case was quintessentially a policy judgment appropriately made for the state by its own courts see also real estate bar ass n,at noting strong federalism interests that are furthered by providing the state courts with the opportunity to decide on underlying unsettled questions of state law.moreover,the statutory construction could easily matter in future cases not involving these parties.boston gas.century indem,cir.we therefore will certify the following question to the law court where an insurance policy procured by a governmental entity is available to cover a judgment against a government employee sued in his personal capacity,is the applicable limit on the award of damages set by d,or by the combination of and,or the policy limit 
iii.the insurance policy 
there is no dispute that the town of wells purchased insurance that covers appellee titcomb.the parties do dispute,however,the scope of the policy coverage.thus,if the law court concludes that and apply,we will need to consider whether the town policy in fact provides coverage for more than.as we shall explain,that determination implicates another significant issue of maine law.

the endorsement submitted with titcomb rule motion to amend consisted of several introductory lines and two substantive paragraphs that we reproduce in their entirety

app.at emphasis added.
construction of the policy 
we emphasize at the threshold of our analysis of the policy language that we are not asking the law court to construe the policy provisions.that is not an appropriate issue for certification.we present our reading of the policy to give context for the legal question we will pose.
the district court focused on the second full sentence of paragraph,highlighted above,in concluding that the policy incorporated the limitation of liability contained in fortin counters that paragraph is entirely inapplicable in this case.he asserts that,pursuant to the preceding sentence describing coverage,paragraph applies only to instances in which governmental immunity has been expressly waived by here,the officer loss of immunity does not derive from a statutory waiver,but from the jury finding that he behaved egregiously.hence,fortin argues,this case is governed by paragraph of the endorsement,which he construes to provide up to million in liability coverage if there is either no statutory immunity or no statutory limitation of damages.because titcomb lacks statutory immunity,fortin maintains that the policy provides up to million in coverage for damages awarded against the officer.
not surprisingly,titcomb urges the district court interpretation of the policy and asserts that paragraph explicitly limits fortin recovery to the allowed by d.he further argues that the maximum would apply even if paragraph rather than paragraph governed this case because,in the words of the policy,that limitation of damages is provided by the provisions of the maine tort claims act.
the structure,with each paragraph beginning with a sta
