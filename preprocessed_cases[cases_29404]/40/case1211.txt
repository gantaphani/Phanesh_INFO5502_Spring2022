opinion of the court 
paul killion,chief counsel of the commonwealth of pennsylvania office of disciplinary counsel office of disciplinary counsel,appeals from the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania order granting summary judgment to robert surrick in this declaratory judgment action.the district court declared that surrick,an attorney authorized to practice before the eastern district of pennsylvania but suspended by the bar of the supreme court of pennsylvania pennsylvania bar,is permitted to maintain a law office in the commonwealth of pennsylvania for the sole purpose of supporting his practice before the federal court,subject to certain conditions.the office of disciplinary counsel raises two challenges to our jurisdiction.first,it contends that this appeal has been rendered moot by surrick alleged failure to comply with the conditions imposed by the district court.second,it argues,as it did before the district court,that this case is not ripe for adjudication.as to the merits,the office of disciplinary counsel argues that the district court erred in determining that surrick is permitted to maintain a law office in pennsylvania to support his federal practice,and urges us to adopt the supreme court of pennsylvania analysis in office of disciplinary counsel marcone.
although we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal and will affirm the judgment for the reasons stated below,we believe that surrick has not complied with the conditions imposed by the district court.specifically,the district court ordered surrick to commence an application for reinstatement to the bar of the supreme court by april,later extended to may,emphasizing that 
the requirement that plaintiff apply for reinstatement to the bar of the supreme court of pennsylvania while being permitted to maintain an office for its practice before the eastern district,reflects this court understanding that by reinstating the plaintiff to practice before the eastern district before his suspension from practice in the courts of pennsylvania expires,plaintiff was given a temporary pass to resume his federal law practice and not a permanent absolution from requirements and oversight of the commonwealth.
op.at emphasis in original.
surrick has not complied in good faith with this order and has ignored the district court admonition that he was only granted a temporary pass.although surrick went through the motions of reapplying to the pennsylvania bar,he has thus far refused to comply with the requirements for reinstatement,to wit,paying the costs of the disciplinary proceedings and enrolling in required continuing legal education cle courses.nonetheless,surrick has asserted to this court that he will pay the costs and enroll in the courses if he prevails on appeal.although we do not excuse his dilatory conduct,we decline to impose the draconian punishment of vacating the district court carefully crafted order and determining the question of federal preemption to be moot.instead,as detailed in part vi,we will direct surrick to satisfy forthwith the requirements for reinstatement to the pennsylvania bar.
surrick was admitted to the pennsylvania bar in and to the bar of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania eastern district of pennsylvania bar in.on march,following disciplinary proceedings,surrick was suspended from the pennsylvania bar for five years.the eastern district of pennsylvania ordered a reciprocal suspension of thirty months.in re surrick,wl,june,aff,cir.
the offense that led to suspensions in the two jurisdictions was the determination that he acted with reckless disregard of the truth when he leveled accusations of case fixing against certain jurists in a pleading filed in the superior court of pennsylvania.office of disciplinary counsel surrick.in its order imposing the suspension,the pennsylvania supreme court noted 
the respondent uses his role as a crusader for justice as a shield from any liability for his actions while simultaneously arguing that any judicial decision in contravention of his position proves that he is a victim of a judicial conspiracy.respondent personal views on judicial reform can not excuse his reckless conduct in bringing unsubstantiated claims against individual members of the judiciary.
respondent predilection to unprovoked character assassination whenever he receives an adverse ruling exhibits conduct that calls into question his ability to continue practicing law in a fit manner.
when a lawyer holds the truth to be of so little value that it can be recklessly disregarded when his temper and personal paranoia dictate,that lawyer should not be permitted to represent the public before the courts of this commonwealth.
surrick was readmitted to the eastern district of pennsylvania bar on may.on august,the pennsylvania supreme court issued its decision in marcone,which involved disciplinary proceedings against another pennsylvania attorney.therein,the pennsylvania supreme court held that an attorney suspended from practice in the pennsylvania courts but readmitted to the federal district court could not maintain a law office in the commonwealth so long as he remains unauthorized to practice in the pennsylvania state courts.marcone,at.
on december,surrick initiated this declaratory judgment action against paul killion,chief disciplinary counsel of the office of disciplinary counsel,and the named justices of the pennsylvania supreme court,alleging that the decision in marcone was contrary to federal law and that he reasonably feared that the office of disciplinary counsel would administer sanctions if he were to open a law office.surrick sought a declaration that he is permitted to open a law office in pennsylvania for the exclusive purpose of supporting his practice before the eastern district of pennsylvania and a preliminary injunction enjoining the office of disciplinary counsel and the named justices from disciplining him for maintaining such an office.surrick claims were predicated on the supremacy clause of the united states constitution and the first amendment.the office of disciplinary counsel subsequently moved to dismiss surrick complaint,arguing,inter alia,that his claims were not ripe and that his complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
the district court held hearings on january and march.at those hearings,surrick testified that he intends to open and maintain an office to support his practice before the federal courts.he testified that he intends to practice in the medical malpractice field,suing those who bring frivolous malpractice lawsuits against doctors.he testified that such lawsuits would be brought in federal court pursuant to federal diversity jurisdiction.the office of disciplinary counsel responded by presenting expert testimony that,using modern technology,attorneys are now able to practice law without a traditional law office.
on april,the district court granted limited declaratory relief in surrick favor,declaring that surrick may open a legal office for the practice of law before the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania subject to eight conditions 
a plaintiff is authorized by the eastern district reinstatement order to open and maintain a law office located at ritter street in philadelphia,pa solely for the practice of law before this court 
b plaintiff shall commence an application for reinstatement to the bar of the supreme court of pennsylvania by april,sic 
c there shall not be any signs on the outside of plaintiff office building reflecting his federal practice and plaintiff shall not advertise his practice by way of outdoor advertisement or posters 
d plaintiff shall provide an inscription on all stationary sic,business cards,files,websites or other documents or correspondence clearly delineating that his practice of law is strictly limited to cases or controversies within the jurisdiction of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
e plaintiff shall not provide legal advice or consultation on state law matters and where appropriate will refer to other attorneys any state court cases or inquiries 
f pursuant to his status as an admitted attorney before the eastern district,plaintiff is authorized to represent clients on all matters within the jurisdiction of this court 
g plaintiff shall promptly inform all persons seeking his legal services that he is only admitted to practice before the district court of the eastern district of pennsylvania and is under suspension from practice in,and respecting legal matters to be filed in,the state courts of pennsylvania.
h plaintiff shall advise clients that if they have a complaint regarding the ethics of his legal representation they may contact the chief judge for the eastern district as well as the office of disciplinary counsel.
the district court denied surrick request for injunctive relief,and declined to reach his first amendment arguments.
on may,surrick submitted an application for reinstatement to the pennsylvania bar.the application was subsequently returned for being incomplete and defective.according to the office of disciplinary counsel,surrick refused to pay the costs of his underlying disciplinary proceedings and to apply for the requisite hours of cle courses.surrick disputes the costs of the proceedings and contends that he does not need to enroll in cle courses until the resolution of this matter on appeal.
on may,the office of disciplinary counsel filed a motion seeking relief from judgment under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure or,alternatively,a stay of the order pending appeal.on may,the district court denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction in light of the appeal.the district court also stated that even if it had jurisdiction,the motion would be denied as premature because surrick had not been given adequate opportunity to cure any defects in his application.
as an initial matter,the office of disciplinary counsel argues that surrick has failed to comply with the conditions imposed by the district court order and that his noncompliance renders this appeal moot.specifically,it contends that although the period of surrick suspension from the pennsylvania bar expired on march,and he was eligible to reapply eight months in advance of that date,to wit,june,surrick has failed to comply in good faith with the critical requirement that he commence an application for reinstatement to the bar of the supreme court of pennsylvania by may.according to the office of disciplinary counsel,surrick has yet to pay the costs of the disciplinary proceedings and has failed to enroll in the required cle courses.the office of disciplinary counsel contends that surrick the amount of costs is in dispute and that he is awaiting the outcome on not valid and that he should have contested the amount of costs before the pennsylvania supreme court.
the starting point for our mootness analysis is the familiar proposition that federal courts are without power to decide questions that can not affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.defunis odegaard,d quoting north carolina rice,d.article iii requires that an actual,live controversy be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.steffel thompson,d see also defunis,at.the inability of the federal judiciary to review moot cases derives from the requirement of art.iii of the constitution under which the exercise of judicial power depends upon the existence of a case or controversy.quotation omitted.a central question in determining mootness is whether a change in circumstances since the beginning of the litigation precludes any occasion for meaningful relief.old bridge owners.twp.of old bridge,cir see also wright,et,federal practice and procedure,at.the burden of demonstrating mootness is a heavy one.county of los angeles davis,d quoting united states grant.
as discussed in more detail in part vi,we agree with the office of disciplinary counsel that surrick has not complied in good faith with the district court order.nonetheless,we conclude that this case is not moot at this stage.what determines mootness here is whether the district court order is still in effect and whether surrick is still maintaining a law office without having been reinstated by the pennsylvania bar.both of these conditions are met.the district court order is now before this court,and we have jurisdiction to decide not only the legal issues presented in the briefs,but the appropriate courses of action for the parties.although we do not excuse surrick dilatory conduct,it is not sufficiently egregious to merit voiding the district court carefully crafted judgment at this stage.rather,to insure total compliance with the district court order,we will require that surrick pay the disputed costs and enroll in the required cle courses within days of the date of this judgment.in light of this resolution,we are satisfied that the parties still have a concrete interest in the outcome of this case.see ellis brotherhood of,airline and clerks,d a s long as the parties have a concrete interest,however small,in the outcome of the litigation,the case is not moot.
the office of disciplinary counsel next contends that surrick complaint failed to assert a justiciable case or controversy as required by article iii of the united states constitution and the federal declaratory judgment act.specifically,it argues that this case is not ripe for adjudication because the office of disciplinary counsel has never threatened surrick with discipline.the district court disagreed,concluding that the threat of potential contempt sanctions against surrick is clear given any reasonable reading of the marcone decision and that surrick has presented sufficient evidence that the threat of contempt sanctions has caused him to forego his intended plans to open a law office within the commonwealth of pennsylvania.our review of the district court ripeness analysis is plenary.taylor inv.upper darby,cir.
ripeness prevents courts from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.abbott labs.gardner,d.ultimately,a case must involve a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.rice,at.quotation omitted.in determining whether a case is ripe,we generally examine the fitness of the issues for judicial decision,and the hardship of the parties of withholding court consideration.khodara env t,blakey,cir quoting abbott,at.in data systems,wyse technology,cir,however,we established a more refined test to determine whether we will engage in review in the context of a declaratory judgment action the parties must have adverse legal interests the facts must be sufficiently concrete to allow for a conclusive legal judgment,and the judgment must be useful to the parties.id.at.with these three factors in mind,we turn to our analysis of whether the district court erred in concluding that this case is ripe for adjudication.
in assessing the adversity of the parties interest,courts look to w hether the claim involves uncertain and contingent events,or presents a real and substantial threat of harm.ne hub partners,cng transmission,cir.it is not necessary for the party seeking review to have suffered a completed harm in order to establish adversity of interest so long as there is a substantial threat of real harm that remains throughout the course of the litigation.presbytery,at.
the district court was correct in determining that the adversity of interest prong is satisfied here.in marcone,the stated issue was whether an attorney who has been suspended from the practice of law by the pennsylvania supreme court may nevertheless maintain a law office in the commonwealth of pennsylvania for purposes of practicing before the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.at.answering this question in the negative,the supreme court of pennsylvania concluded that maintaining an office would constitute engag ing in activities in the commonwealth in violation of rule j of the pennsylvania rules of disciplinary enforcement,and rejected the argument that any federal law preempts rule j 
although,as with any case,the holding of marcone is necessarily limited to the specific facts and arguments presented there,we agree with the district court that surrick faces a substantial threat of sanctions under any reasonable reading of marcone.like the attorney in marcone,surrick is a lawyer suspended from the pennsylvania bar who desires to open a legal office for the sole purpose of supporting his practice before the eastern district of pennsylvania.in the words of the district court,surrick fits the prescription.moreover,the district court made a factual determination that surrick fear of sanctions has actually deterred him from opening an office,and we perceive no reason to disturb this finding.finally,we find it significant that the office of disciplinary counsel has repeatedly refused to assure either the district court or this court that surrick will not be subject to the same penalties as the attorney in marcone should he open a law office within the commonwealth for the purpose of representing clients before the eastern district of pennsylvania see presbytery,at finding significant that the state expressly refused to offer any assurances that it would not prosecute plaintiff.
accordingly,we conclude that the threat of sanctions is sufficiently real and substantial to satisfy the first prong of the inquiry.as the supreme court has repeatedly stated,one does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventative relief.if the injury is certainly impending,that is enough.babbitt united farm workers union,d quoting pennsylvania west virginia.
the second factor requires us to consider the fitness of the issue for adjudication to ensure that the declaratory judgment would in fact determine the parties rights,as distinguished from an advisory opinion based on a hypothetical set of facts.presbytery,at.cases presenting predominantly legal questions are particularly amenable to a conclusive determination in a preenforcement context,and generally require less factual development.id.as the district court observed,we have previously found federal preemption to be predominantly legal for purposes of the conclusiveness prong of the analysis.see armstrong world,by wolfson adams,cir w here the question presented is predominantly legal,such as one of federal preemption,the need for factual development is not as great.see also ne hub partners,at a determination of whether there is preemption primarily raises a legal issue,a circumstance which facilitates entry of declaratory judgment.nonetheless,a plaintiff raising a predominantly legal claim must still meet the minimum requirements for article iii jurisdiction.armstrong,at.
here,we perceive no reason why disposition of this case could not conclusively determine the legal issues in dispute.surrick sole legal contention is that the office of disciplinary counsel policy and practice of disciplining attorneys conflicts with the eastern district of pennsylvania exclusive authority to regulate its own attorney admissions in violation of the supremacy clause of the united states constitution.see const.art.vi,cl.the question presented is therefore one of federal preemption,which is predominantly legal.see armstrong,at.
as to the factual record,surrick testified as to the specific parameters he would follow were he to open a law office.he assured the district court that he would not place a sign or other advertisement outside his office,that any stationary would specifically indicate that he is only licensed to practice in the eastern district of pennsylvania,and that he would not provide any legal advice on state law matters.moreover,the district court made these assurances conditions of its order.we fail to see how any further factual development,short of waiting for surrick to open an office and the office of disciplinary counsel to then take action,could aid our resolution of the preemption question.we therefore conclude that the second prong is satisfied.
the final prong requires us to consider whether a declaratory judgment will affect the parties plans of actions by alleviating legal uncertainty,at see also ne hub partners,at.this prong is undoubtedly satisfied here.the district court found that fear of sanctions has effectively deterred surrick from opening a law office.a declaration of rights would permit surrick to open a law office within the commonwealth without fear of governmental sanctions,and also inform him of any guidelines he must follow in operating his practice.a grant or denial of relief would therefore materially affect the parties and serve the purpose of the declaratory judgment act clarify ing legal relationships so that plaintiffs can make responsible decisions about the future.see,at.
all three factors have been met in this case.surrick faces a real and substantial threat of sanctions in light of marcone,further factual development would not be helpful in resolving the predominantly legal question presented here,and a declaratory judgment will materially affect the actions of the parties.we therefore agree with the district court that this case is ripe for adjudication.we turn now to the merits.
although federal courts have traditionally used admission to the bar of a state court as a standard for initial admission to their bars,admission to practice law before a state courts and admission to practice before the federal courts in that state are separate,independent privileges.see theard united states,d the two judicial systems of courts,the state judicatures and the federal judiciary,have autonomous control over the conduct of their officers,among whom lawyers are included.consistent with this settled proposition,the united states supreme court has repeatedly emphasized that disqualification from membership from a state bar does not necessarily lead to disqualification from a federal bar.frazier heebe,d see theard,at.d isbarment by federal courts does not automatically flow from disbarment from state courts.selling radford.
although the federal courts are empowered with absolute authority to grant privileges and impose restrictions on their members,the dictates of comity must never be ignored.accordingly,we acknowledge the pennsylvania supreme court conclusion in marcone and the commonwealth compelling interest in regulating the practice of law within its borders.nonetheless,we believe that under the unique circumstances presented pennsylvania period of suspension was coming to a close and surrick was permitted to maintain an office for an extremely limited solution arrived at by the district court,although bottomed on a federal court undeniable right to impose privileges and restrictions on its members,is not unduly offensive to a sister sovereign absolute prohibition of maintaining an office under the facts and circumstances in marcone.
the question in this case is whether a state may prohibit an attorney admitted to the bar of a federal district court,but suspended from the state bar,from maintaining a legal office for the sole purpose of supporting a practice before the federal court.the starting point for our analysis is the seminal case of sperry state of florida,in which the united states supreme court held that the state of florida could not enjoin a local patent practitioner,who was not admitted to the state bar of florida,from preparing patent applications and other legal instruments that are filed solely in the united states patent and trademark office,d.the supreme court began its analysis by recognizing that the state had a substantial interest in regulating the practice of law within its borders and that,in the absence of federal legislation,it could validly prohibit from preparing and filing patent applications.id.at.under the supremacy clause,however,the law of the state,though enacted in the exercise of powers uncontroverted,must yield when incompatible with federal legislation.id.at.quoting gibbons ogden,wheat.the court reasoned that if the state were permitted to enforce licensing requirements contrary to federal law,the state would then have the power of review over federal licensing requirements 
a state may not enforce licensing requirements which,though valid in the absence of federal regulation,give the state licensing board a virtual power of review over the federal determination that a person or agency is qualified and entitled to perform certain functions,or which impose upon the performance of activity sanctioned by federal license additional conditions not contemplated by congress.no state law can hinder or obstruct the free use of a license granted under an act of congress.
id.at.citations and footnotes omitted.
sperry therefore stands for the general proposition that where federal law authorizes an agent to practice before a federal tribunal,the federal law preempts a state licensing requirements to the extent that those requirements hinder or obstruct the goals of federal law.see also in re desilets,cir when state licensing laws purport to prohibit lawyers from doing that which federal law entitles them to do,the state law must give way.
the office of disciplinary counsel contends that sperry is distinguishable for two reasons.first,the enabling congressional statute in sperry expressly allowed for the prosecution of patents by,whereas here no congressional statute expressly permits surrick to maintain a law office.second,that because surrick intends to litigate federal diversity actions,he is for all practical matters practicing state law.marcone,at state law concerns are the foundation of federal diversity actions thus,to suggest that because maintenance of an office is limited to federal practice,it does not constitute the practice of law within the borders of a state,is to ignore the realities of current legal practice.we reject these arguments.
under the supremacy clause,when state law conflicts or is incompatible with federal law,the federal law preempts the state law.preemption generally occurs in three ways where congress has expressly preempted state law where congress has legislated so comprehensively that federal law occupies an entire field of regulation and leaves no room for state law or where federal law conflicts with state law.see barnett bank of marion county nelson,d.this case indisputably involves conflict preemption,which arises when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d internal quotations and citations omitted.
as discussed above,it is well established that a federal court has the power to control admission to its bar and to discipline attorneys who appear before it.chambers nasco,d in re poole,cir a s nearly a century of supreme court precedent makes clear,practice before federal courts is not governed by state court rules.this power is rooted in both statute,see a the supreme court and all courts established by act of congress may from time to time prescribe rules for the conduct of their business.in all courts of the united states the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel,as,by the rules of such courts,respectively,are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein.rule,federal rules of civil procedure,and the inherent authority of the federal courts,chambers,at.using federal courts control over admission to their bars as an example of an inherent power governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases citation and quotation omitted.pursuant to its exclusive authority over members of its bar,poole,at,the eastern district of pennsylvania promulgated rule vii i of the eastern district rules of civil procedure,which expressly permits attorneys suspended from a state bar to practice before the eastern district of pennsylvania it is therefore beyond the office of disciplinary counsel does not question this the commonwealth lacks the authority to prohibit surrick from practicing law before the eastern district of pennsylvania.see in re desilets,at observing that although the enabling congressional statute in sperry expressly authorized federal authorities to determine who may practice law and do not,this is a distinction without a difference united states hvass,d holding that rules and regulations promulgated by a district court that have been lawfully authorized and have a clear legislative base qualify as a law of the united states,as that phrase is used in a perjury statute.
the more difficult question is whether a state law prohibiting surrick from maintaining a law office is preempted by this exclusive authority of the eastern district of pennsylvania to determine who may practice law before it.the office of disciplinary counsel argues that conflict preemption does not apply here because,unlike in sperry,where the federal statute specifically authorized to prepare and prosecute patents,there is no federal statute or local rule expressly setting forth the right of federal courts to determine who may maintain an office in a state.
this argument is based on both a misreading of sperry and a misapprehension of the preemption doctrine.federal law preempts not only state laws that expressly prohibit the very act the federal law allows,but those that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of federal law.silkwood,d.thus,federal and state law need not be contradictory on their faces for preemption to apply.it is sufficient that the state law impose s additional conditions not contemplated by congress.sperry,at.
in sperry,for example,the state bar of florida argued that the federal license to practice before the patent office was a narrow one,only conferring the right to practice in the physical presence of the patent and trademark office and the district of columbia.id.the supreme court rejected this contention,stating that sperry had to be permitted to perform tasks incident to the preparation and prosecution of patent applications.id.at.although the court expressly declined to determine what functions are reasonably within the scope of the practice authorized by federal law,it noted that a practitioner must of course render opinions as to the patentability of the inventions brought to him,and it is entirely reasonable for a practitioner to hold himself out as qualified to perform his specialized work,so long as he does not misrepresent the scope of his license.id.at.
the reasons for the broad construction of the supremacy clause are plain.if preemption only applied to state laws that directly contradict federal laws,federal laws could be effectively nullified by state laws prohibiting those acts that are incident to,but not specifically authorized by,federal law.under such a regime,state officials would have a virtual power of review over federal laws.see id.at.quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the question here is not whether any federal law expressly confers the right to maintain an office,but whether the maintenance of an office is reasonably within the scope of the license to practice law.id.at.
we agree with the district court that maintaining a law office is reasonably within the scope of the practice authorized by and the local rules and that the state regulation of such conduct hinders surrick federal license to practice law.we recognize that the pennsylvania supreme court reached a contrary conclusion in marcone.see at while regulation of the maintenance of a law office through which one holds himself out to the public and counsels clients may place some burden on one who has been suspended from the practice of law in a particular state but who is nevertheless admitted before a federal court,our regulation of those who maintain a law office within our borders simply does not,without more,result in conflict.in all candor,we have extreme difficulty in accepting the notion that maintaining an office constitutes engaging in the practice of law but prohibiting one from maintaining an office does not burden the right to practice law.perhaps the explanation lies in the difference in the record before us and that which was before our colleagues on the pennsylvania supreme court.here,the d
