factual and procedural background 
statutory background the program integrity regulation 
lsc is a private nonprofit corporation established by the united states for the purpose of providing financial support to individuals who would otherwise be unable to afford legal assistance.a.to accomplish this purpose,lsc provides federal funds to local legal assistance programs throughout the united states.id.a.see generally legal services corporation act of lsc act,stat.codified as amended at.
by regulation,lsc places certain restrictions on the use of its funds.id.b.these restrictions include,for example,a prohibition on the use of lsc funding for such activities as lobbying,participating in class action lawsuits,and advocating for the redistricting of political districts.additionally,lsc requires its recipients to maintain objective integrity and independence from any organization that engages in restricted activities.id.a requirements for this objective integrity are codified in what is now denominated the program integrity rule or regulation.the requirements include legal separation of the recipient from the unrestricted organizations no transfer of lsc funds between the recipient and the unrestricted organization and the recipient physical and financial separation from the unrestricted organization id.
whether an lsc fund recipient is sufficiently physically and financially separated from legal services providers is determined on a basis,based upon the totality of the circumstances.id.a.the program integrity regulation specifies that mere bookkeeping separation of lsc funds from other funds is not sufficient.id.other factors,such as having separate personnel,separate accounting and timekeeping records,separate facilities,and distinguishing forms of identification are relevant but not.id.fund recipients must annually certify to the lsc that they comply with the program integrity regulation.id.b.
in this appeal,oregon contends that the program integrity regulation violates its tenth amendment rights.
ii.factual and procedural history conflict with oregon guidelines 
in april,the oregon state bar amended its guidelines for oregon legal services program,directing service providers to integrate their operations and staff in places where separate organizations provide services to the same geographic area.while some of oregon service providers are lsc fund recipients,others are not and engage in restricted activities.legal aid services of oregon laso,a legal services provider,is a recipient of lsc funds,which account for approximately of its million annual budget.oregon law center olc,another large legal services provider,is not an lsc fund recipient and engages in activities.
in response to the state bar amended guidelines,laso submitted a configuration proposal to lsc that would combine the laso and olc corporations into one corporation.under the proposal,the newly constituted corporation would have two divisions,one of which would be subject to the lsc restrictions and the other of which would not.the two divisions would also maintain separate financial books and records,and would notify the public of their distinct functions in letterheads,business cards,and signage.however,the two divisions of the proposed new entity would share personnel and equipment,and would operate in the same physical premises.lsc office of legal affairs reviewed the proposal and concluded that it would not comply with lsc requirements for program integrity.
in september,laso and olc filed a complaint against lsc in district court,alleging that the lsc restrictions violated their first amendment rights.on the same day and in the same court,oregon filed this action against lsc alleging that the program integrity regulation effectively thwarted oregon policies governing its legal services program,in violation of the tenth amendment.oregon sought to enjoin lsc from enforcing the program integrity regulation in oregon.the two suits were consolidated and assigned to a magistrate judge.
the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant lsc motion to dismiss as to all of laso claims except its challenge to the program integrity rule.the magistrate judge also recommended granting lsc motion to dismiss oregon complaint,because the state itself was not regulated by the lsc and because oregon claims of coercion did not meet the high standard required under ninth circuit precedents.see california united states,cir nevada skinner,cir.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendations and the lawsuits.oregon appealed its claims to this court.
jurisdiction 
the jurisdiction of the federal courts is limited to cases and controversies,art.iii.whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter,the court shall dismiss the action.fed.civ.h.an objection that a federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time,even after trial and the entry of judgment.arbaugh y h,d.the objection,made under federal rule of civil procedure b,may be raised by a party or by the court on its own initiative id.while we have jurisdiction over this appeal under,we found reason to question whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case.as analyzed in this opinion,we conclude that oregon lacks standing to bring a claim under the tenth amendment or the spending clause because it has not alleged a sufficiently concrete and particularized injury.we therefore vacate the district court judgment and remand for an entry of dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
discussion 
standing requirements 
a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief sought.daimlerchrysler cuno,d quoting friends of the earth,laidlaw envt l,d see also allen wright,d the standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a complaint allegations to ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claims asserted.the plaintiff bears the burden of proof to establish standing with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.when,as here,the plaintiff defends against a motion to dismiss at the pleading stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice,because we presume that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.id.quoting lujan wildlife fed n,d.
the irreducible constitutional minimum requirements for standing were described in lujan as follows 
first,the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,whitmore arkansas,d quoting los angeles lyons,d.second,there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.simon eastern.welfare rights organization,d.third,it must be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at.
at.footnote and some internal citations omitted.before applying these requirements to the facts of this case,however,we must first consider what impact,if any,oregon status as a state as opposed to a private party has on the standing inquiry.
state standing interests 
the supreme court has recognized that states are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,and have interests and capabilities beyond those of an individual by virtue of their sovereignty.massachusetts epa,d.the court in massachusetts focused principally on the state sovereign interest in its territory and its ability to preserve clean air for its citizens.id.the court has elsewhere characterized a state unique prerogatives as a parens patriae action stemming from a interest defined rather vaguely as a set of interests that the state has in the of its populace.alfred snapp son,puerto rico,d.
however,the supreme court has also recognized that the concept of special state standing due to the interest risks being too vague to survive the standing requirements therefore,a interest must be sufficiently concrete to create an actual controversy between the state and the defendant.id.at.furthermore,i nterests of private parties are obviously not in themselves sovereign interests,and they do not become such simply by virtue of the state aiding in their achievement.in such situations,the state is no more than a nominal party.id.if a state is only a nominal party without a real interest of its it will not have standing under the parens patriae doctrine.id.at.
generally,a state has been granted standing under the parens patriae doctrine in situations involving the abatement of public nuisances,such as global warming,flooding,or noxious gases.see massachusetts.massachusetts had standing to sue the epa for failing to issue rules regarding the emission of greenhouse gases north dakota minnesota.north dakota had standing to sue minnesota for allegedly creating conditions leading to flooding of farmland georgia.copper.georgia had standing to sue for an injunction to prevent the defendant copper companies from discharging noxious gases over georgia territory.in other cases,states have been granted standing to represent the economic interests of their residents.see snapp.puerto rico had standing to sue defendant apple farmers for subjecting its workers to conditions more burdensome than those established for temporary foreign workers in violation of the act georgia.georgia had standing to bring suit against railroads for conspiracy to fix freight rates in a manner that discriminated against georgia shippers in violation of federal antitrust law pennsylvania west virginia.pennsylvania had standing to sue for an injunction preventing west virginia from giving other states a preferential right of purchase and curtailing the supply of gas carried to pennsylvania.
as the supreme court noted in snapp,the common thread among these cases is each state interest in the health and of its residents and a interest in not being discriminatorily denied its rightful status within the federal system.at.in contrast,the court has expressly found that a state does not have standing to protect her citizens from the operation of federal statutes.massachusetts.at referencing massachusetts mellon.massachusetts lacked standing to enjoin a congressional act authorizing appropriations on a voluntary basis.
prudential principles no reliance on the claims of third parties 
in recognizing that a state may have standing by virtue of its interest in its citizens,the supreme court has been careful to note that a state interest must be in some way distinguishable from that of its citizens in order to maintain such an action,the state must articulate an interest apart from the interests of particular private parties.snapp,at.the doctrine that a plaintiff must have an independent means of standing is one of a set of prudential principles adopted by the supreme court to augment the requirements of article iii.these judicially limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction function to further limit the role of the courts,but they can be modified or abrogated by congress.allen,at.see also warth seldin,d noting that without the prudential requirements,the courts would be called upon to decide abstract questions of wide public significance even though other governmental institutions may be more competent to address the questions,and that congress may grant an express right of action to persons who otherwise would be barred by prudential standing rules.
in addition to the requirement that the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties,the supreme court has disapproved of considering abstract questions of wide public significance amounting to generalized grievances.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church state,d quoting warth,at.
ii.oregon alleged injury 
oregon alleges that lsc restrictions effectively infringe on oregon sovereignty in violation of the tenth amendment and principles of federalism established in the structure of the united states constitution,and exceed federal authority under the spending clause.although we do not address the merits of oregon claim for the purpose of determining standing,lujan,at,we do analyze the characterization of the injury itself to determine whether or not it is concrete and particularized,actual or imminent,and fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant.id.at.citations omitted.oregon need only allege general factual allegations of injury resulting from lsc conduct to resist a motion to dismiss for lack of standing.id.at.because oregon factual allegations do not rise to the level of a concrete,particularized,actual or imminent injury against the state itself,that is independent from alleged harm to private parties,we hold that the action must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
oregon alleges that lsc restrictions fall outside congress spending authority.in addition,oregon alleges that lsc uses its restrictions to coerce laso into complying with federal regulations over state regulations because laso can not survive as an organization without federal funding.
oregon further alleges that lsc restrictions limit oregon ability to regulate laso and its other legal services providers.oregon can not require laso to combine its facilities with ols because that would make laso ineligible for federal funding,and would lead to laso dissolution.oregon paints this situation as a restriction on its ability to make policy,and alleges that such a restriction violates the tenth amendment.
however,oregon acknowledges that it is not regulated by lsc,and that it is completely free to make or change its policy in the face of lsc regulations.oregon does not receive lsc funding,and so is unaffected by its existence or aside from the fact that parties within oregon are recipients.oregon would be in the same position it now occupies if the federal government,for whatever reason,decided to cease further lsc funding.therefore,oregon only alleged injury is on behalf of its legal services providers.as pleaded,oregon injury is indistinguishable from laso.
oregon has no independent injury 
tenth amendment coercion claim 
although oregon claims an injury under the tenth amendment separate from laso,it has not alleged general facts sufficient to establish such a claim.the tenth amendment reserves any power not expressly delegated to the federal government to the states.only states have standing to pursue claims alleging violations of the tenth amendment by the federal government.power.valley.see also brooklyn legal servs.b legal servs,cir.however,to bring a claim under the tenth amendment,a state must first allege facts relating to a relevant injury.in this case,we hold there is no such injury.
the supreme court made a similar ruling in mellon,a case in which massachusetts sought to enjoin congress from enacting the maternity act,cong.
