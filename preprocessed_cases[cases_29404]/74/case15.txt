appellants linda jacobs,wendy slaughter,kenneth brown,and the remainder of the class are former employees employees of the foster and boarding home programs operated by appellee new york foundling hospital foundling.all allege that they were not compensated properly for overtime work,in violation of the fair labor standards act of flsa or act,and appeal from an april,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york azrack,granting foundling motion for summary judgment and dismissing the employees claim for premium pay.
on appeal,the employees contend that foundling,a private,independent contractor,is an enterprise under r because its contractual and regulatory relations with the new york city administration for children services acs render its activities in connection with the activities of a public agency pursuant to r c and thus performed for a business purpose.accordingly,the employees claim,foundling owes them overtime pay under the act.because we conclude that the act definition of enterprise does not extend to a private,independent contractor associated by regulation and contract with a public agency,foundling is not obligated to pay overtime under the act.we therefore affirm.
background 
new york foundling hospital 
new york foundling hospital is a private,charitable provider of social services to children and families in the new york city area.founded in by a catholic religious order as a home for abandoned children,today its services include foster care,adoption,and physical and mental health initiatives.
all of the children served through foundling foster home and boarding home programs are referred by acs,which is responsible for administering new york city child welfare services and is authorized to contract with private providers like foundling under new york social services law.the foster home program deals with approximately abused or neglected children without special needs who have been removed from their biological families and placed with foster parents.the boarding home program serves the same category of children who could not have or have not yet been placed with foster parents.foundling funding is derived exclusively from charitable grants and other federal,state,and local government sources.almost half of its total revenue originates as payments from acs.
the relationship between acs and foundling is set forth in a number of agreements premised upon foundling status as an independent contractor and,in turn,the entity operational independence.the contracts provide that foundling executive staff shall manage its affairs and programs and shall have the responsibility for the provision of services to and for each child placed with it.foundling alone is responsible for the work,direction,compensation and personal conduct of its employees,as well as for their recruiting,screening,and training.foundling can unilaterally terminate the agreements,in whole or in part,with thirty days notice.
acs exercises no control over foundling board of directors,structure,finances and governance,except to the extent that it retains some degree of oversight over foundling programs and client relations.the foster care agreement,for instance,requires foundling to recruit a sufficient number and variety of prospective foster parents to meet the level acs calculates is appropriate for a targeted area.foundling must generally accept all children,establish grievance procedures for its service recipients with decisions appealable to acs,and allow acs to monitor and review all of its program activities,procedures and records as acs deems necessary including,at reasonable times,unannounced and unscheduled visits to foundling offices and to its clients.
ii.procedural history

discussion 
the flsa requires that employers pay a premium or overtime wage of not less than one and times the regular rate for hours worked in excess of forty hours in a single if an employee either is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,or is employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.a emphasis added.the two categories are commonly referred to as individual and enterprise coverage,respectively.see tony susan alamo found.sec y of labor,d prior to the introduction of enterprise coverage in,the only individuals covered under the act were those engaged directly in interstate commerce enterprise coverage substantially broadened the scope of the act to include any employee of an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce,as defined by the act.
the flsa defines an enterprise,inter alia,as the related activities performed by any person or persons for a common business purpose excluding the related activities performed for such an enterprise by an independent contractor.r generally,organizations that do not engage in ordinary commercial activities,tony susan alamo,at.quoting,or serve the general public in competition with ordinary commercial enterprises,id.at,operate without a business purpose and therefore are not enterprises.see r.see also department of labor,wage and hour division,opinion letter,wl,private nonprofit children care facility not a flsa enterprise department of labor,wage and hour division,opinion letter,wl,private nonprofit foster home not a flsa enterprise.the flsa,however,ensures that certain types of entities that might otherwise be held to operate with a business purpose under the act are nevertheless brought within its ambit.for example,under r a and b,congress expressly included within the definition of enterprise the activities performed in connection with hospitals,institutions providing residential care to the sick,aged,or mentally ill,certain types of schools,and certain types of railway or other transportation providers.congress deemed all of these entities operated for a business purpose whether they were public or private,or operated for profit or not for profit.see r 
moreover,through a series of amendments dating back to,congress broadened the flsa scope to extend its coverage to nearly all federal,state,and local government employees.see league of cities usery,d detailing the history of the flsa amendments overruled on other grounds by garcia san antonio metro.transit,d.the amendments changed the act definition of a public agency,x,clarified which persons working for a public agency are covered,id.e,and included public agencies in the act definition of an employer,id.d.see fair labor standards amendments of,d,e,and x,stat.further,the amendments deemed activities performed by any person
