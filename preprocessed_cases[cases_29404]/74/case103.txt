this case involves an environmental law challenge to actions by various federal agencies regarding changes in winter recreational access to an area,known as the molas pass area,near highway in colorado.the district court ruled in favor of the agencies on all claims.
more particularly,plaintiffs silverton snowmobile club ssc,the colorado snowmobile association csa and the colorado vehicle coalition cohvco appeal an order of the united states district court for the district of colorado affirming a decision notice and finding of no significant impact decision,and accompanying final environmental assessment ea,issued by the united states forest service forest service and the united states bureau of land management blm.ssc alleges that the decision was issued in violation of the national environmental policy act nepa,the national forest management act of nfma,and the federal land policy and management act of flpma.the san juan citizens alliance sjca and the colorado mountain club cmc were granted permission by the district court to intervene in this action and they participate on appeal as.we affirm the district court decision.
background 
the molas pass area consists of approximately square miles of public land,with elevations ranging from to more than feet,located miles north of durango,colorado.ea at,administrative record ar at.it includes both sides of a stretch of highway.it lies partly within the san juan national forest,which is managed by the forest service and partly within public lands that are managed by the blm.id.
prior to the decision challenged in this appeal,the area was used by both motorized and nonmotorized recreationists.the san juan national forest land and resource management plan forest plan of,as amended in,designated a zone of up to miles on each side of highway as management area prescription.the prescription states that activities such as snowmobiling are possible.ar at.the blm san juan resource area management plan rmp limited motorized use to certain roads and trails in the silverton special recreation management area.in april the ssc entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the san juan national forest for the purpose of setting out the responsibilities of both parties with regard to maintenance and grooming of trails in the forest.under the mou,the ssc agreed,inter alia,to groom and maintain certain trails,and the forest service agreed,inter alia,to m ake selected areas available for snowmobiling activities and facilities.mou,appellant app.at.
during the winters of and,a lack of snow at lower elevations in colorado caused an increased concentration of motorized and recreation in the molas pass area.decision at,ar at.conflicts between these two groups of recreationists led to letters to the editor of a local newspaper and complaints to federal land managers and the san juan county commissioners.this in turn prompted the forest service and the blm to initiate a public process to evaluate whether changes were necessary in the winter recreation management protocols applicable to the molas pass area.the agencies accordingly held two open houses and a workshop in early and formed an interdisciplinary team it,whose mission was to review the public input develop alternatives to address the issues and analyze the environmental,social,and economic effects of all alternatives.decision at,id.at.during the open houses and through comments the agencies received from the public,the nonmotorized users of the area expressed their desire to recreate safely in an area free of noise,fumes,and intrusion of motorized vehicles,ea at,id.at,while motorized users expressed their desire not to lose any areas currently available for motorized use,and to expand motorized use in the area near silverton.
the agencies developed the following goal for management of the molas pass area to provide visitors with an opportunity for a quality motorized and nonmotorized winter recreational experience,where both user groups have safe highway access to their sport of choice,and where both private and commercial uses are appropriately balanced.decision at,id.at.the it held a public workshop in june in which participants broke into three small working groups and assessed various alternatives.in july and august the agencies mailed summaries of the workshop results and a timeline for a draft environmental assessment to everyone who had attended the open houses and workshops or who had indicated some interest in the matter.numerous articles,editorials and letters from interested citizens appeared in local newspapers.
in november,the agencies issued a draft environmental assessment draft ea,which presented four alternatives for winter use management of the molas pass area no action,which would leave winter management of the area unchanged maintaining the area west of highway for motorized winter use and making the area east of the highway a strictly nonmotorized area maintaining the area east of the highway for motorized use and making the area west of the highway a strictly nonmotorized area and expanding by acres the motorized area west of the highway,designating the area east of the highway and south of the top of molas pass a strictly nonmotorized area,and permitting grooming from the top of molas pass north and west of the highway.
the agencies provided a period for comments on the draft ea.they received comment letters,of which favored alternative,favored alternative,favored alternative,favored alternative,and expressed no preference.additionally,of the comments favored some sort of segregation of motorized and nonmotorized uses.
the agencies also consulted with the united states fish and wildlife service fws about what effects the alternatives might have on the species listed as sensitive,threatened,or endangered under the endangered species act.in november,the fws issued a biological evaluation and biological assessment addressing those effects.the concluded that the proposed alternatives m ay affect the canada lynx,but is not likely to adversely affect the continued existence of the species or result in destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.ea at,ar at.the explained that the molas pass area contains potential foraging,denning,and travel habitat for the canada lynx,especially the ecosystem surrounding the large open meadows of the area.ea at,id.at.a map included in the indicates that acres out of a total of acres in the relevant area provide a suitable habitat for lynx.ea at,id.at.as discussed more fully infra,there was an ongoing effort to lynx into the area.
in assessing the impact of the proposed alternatives on the lynx,the noted that s now compaction may cause a direct effect on lynx by potentially increasing predator competition but that because lynx seldom venture more than feet into open areas,the area that is being considered for motorized use will have very little,if any,additional effect on any individual lynx than what currently exists.ea at,id.at.the also noted that the prohibition of nighttime commercial activities would permit the lynx nocturnal periods of foraging without disruption by human activities.ea at,id.at.
operating under the principle that if there is potential habitat,we assume the species is present the listed mitigation measures.ea at,id.at.the two mitigation measures relevant to this case are a prohibition on grooming and the prohibition of groomed tracks within feet of.ea at,id.at.
in june,the agencies released their decision,final ea and finding of no significant impact fonsi,which discussed the same four alternatives and considered their direct,indirect and cumulative effects.the decision blended alternatives and as follows it prohibited motorized activity on acres in the andrews lake area,leaving motorized users with acres of the acreage previously open for that use it prohibited trail grooming and commercial motorized uses on national forest system lands from the molas pass overlook south to lime creek on the east side of highway it converted the mou to a permit with annual approvals by the forest service it eliminated the prohibition on motorized use off of designated roads and trails on certain blm lands and the blm agreed to revise its rmp through a maintenance document to reflect that change and it prohibited motorized activities in the bear creek drainage in order to protect silverton water source.additionally,the decision implemented mitigation measures,including prohibiting motorized operations and prohibiting new groomed trails with feet of forests.
tracy beck,the acting district ranger who signed the decision,explained his reasons for the decision as follows 
in designing the selected alternative,i tried to address the needs of both motorized and nonmotorized user groups.the motorized users did not want to lose many acres to nonmotorized users,while the nonmotorized users wanted the andrews lake area free of motorized use.
i believe that the blending of alternatives and with mitigation measures from the ea is the most responsive of all alternatives to the purpose of and need for this analysis.
decision at,ar at.he further explained that the problem the decision addressed was primarily a social issue,not an environmental one.id.
plaintiffs,organizations whose members enjoy engaging in winter motorized activities,including snowmobiling,in the molas pass area,appealed the decision to both the forest service,through the regional forester,and the blm,through the interior board of land appeals ibla.on september,the forest service upheld the decision.on april,the ibla upheld the decision.
meanwhile,on february,the plaintiffs filed suit in the federal district court in colorado they alleged that the agencies had violated the administrative procedure act,apa,by taking actions,making findings and reaching conclusions that were arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with applicable law nepa,and its supporting regulations,by reaching a predetermined result,failing to take the requisite hard look at the environmental consequences of their actions,and failing to prepare an environmental impact statement eis nfma,and its supporting regulations,by failing to follow the requirements for compliance with and amendment of the forest plan and flpma,and its supporting regulations,by failing to follow the requirements for compliance with and amendment of the rmp.they requested declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent implementation of the decision.
on april,the sjca and the cmc filed a motion to intervene as defendants,which the district court granted on december.on july,the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction,which the district court denied on october.on december,the parties filed a joint motion to have the court dispose of the case on its merits.the court heard oral argument on march,and issued an order upholding the decision on november.plaintiffs appeal,alleging that the court erred in holding that the agencies did not violate the apa or nepa,that it further erred in holding that,although the agencies did violate the nfma by failing to conform to or amend the forest plan,that violation was harmless error,and by dismissing their flpma claim for failure to exhaust their administrative remedies.
the agencies and the sjca and the cmc have filed a motion to strike the portion of the plaintiffs reply brief which argues that the molas pass decision restrictions fail arbitrary and capricious review under the apa.mot.to strike at quoting appellants reply br.at.we address this motion infra,in connection with our analysis of the decision discussion about lynx.
discussion 
we review the agencies compliance with nepa,nfma and flpma pursuant to the apa,which empowers a reviewing court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.greater yellowstone coal.flowers,cir quoting utahns for better transp.dep t of,cir,modified on reh g,cir.in reviewing the agencies action,we apply the same deferential standard to the administrative record as did the district court.id.we may set aside agency action only for substantial procedural or substantive reasons.id.further citation omitted.

the agencies in this case issued an ea and a fonsi.the plaintiffs argue that,in doing so,the agencies violated the apa and nepa because the outcome was predetermined the agencies failed to take the requisite hard look at the potential environmental consequences of the proposed action and the agencies failed to prepare an eis.
predetermined result 
the plaintiffs argue that the agencies violated nepa in issuing the decision because they structured the analysis and framed the issues to ensure that additional restrictions on the use of snowmobiles in the area would be an inevitable result of the analysis.appellants opening br.at.we disagree.
the agencies articulated the goal for their review of winter use in the molas pass area as being t o provide visitors with an opportunity for a quality motorized and nonmotorized winter recreational experience,where both user groups have safe highway access to their sport of choice.decision at,ar at emphasis added.nonmotorized users defined a quality experience for them to be the ability to recreate safely in an area free of noise,fumes,and intrusion of motorized vehicles.id.motorized users indicated they did not want to lose any areas currently designated as motorized,and also they would like additional terrain in the silverton area.id.the decision explained the difficulty in accommodating the desires of both groups 
we would rather have had people work together to solve their joint social issues,while being sensitive to each other needs.both motorized and nonmotorized recreationists should strive to show more tolerance for one another and more inclination to work in a spirit of cooperation.
when user groups do not want to give up what they feel is theirs,and become polarized,the fairest solution becomes compromise and all users inevitably give up something.given the diversity of public opinions regarding winter recreation at molas pass,the selected alternative became the compromise alternative.
decision at,id.at.far from ignoring motorized users wishes,one of the project guidelines stated that the project would address the need for additional suitable terrain for motorized recreation.ea at,id.at.
in the end,the alternative selected took away acres from motorized of the total available for motorized opened up additional terrain for motorized use by allowing such use in the blm silverton special recreation management area.the agencies rejected alternatives which would have resulted in greater reductions in the acreage available to motorized users.in short,the agencies were faced with the difficult task of trying to accommodate different groups of users who were reluctant to give up what they had become accustomed to using.after hearing input from the public and considering a number of alternatives,the agencies reached a compromise solution,not one that was predetermined by their method of analysis 
the plaintiffs further argue that the agencies failed to take a hard look at the potential environmental consequences of the alternatives,as nepa requires.as we have previously stated,documents prepared as part of nepa hard look requirement must not only reflect the agency thoughtful and probing reflection of the possible impacts associated with the proposed project,but also provide a reviewing court with the necessary factual specificity to conduct its review.comm.to preserve boomer lake park,at.plaintiffs allege that t he ea for molas pass winter recreation management is inadequate because it neither reflects the required thoughtful and probing analysis nor provides the necessary factual specificity to permit a proper review by this court.appellants opening br.at quoting comm.to preserve boomer lake park,at.in particular,plaintiffs allege that the ea made the unsubstantiated assumption that the molas pass area included canada lynx habitat and that snowmobile use and trail grooming adversely affect the lynx.
the contained in the ea did,in fact,proceed upon the following assumption with respect to the lynx and all other species identified as relevant to the decision t here have been no structured inventories completed,specifically for this proposal,in the area because the forest has taken the position that if there is potential habitat,then we assume the species is present.ea at,ar at.plaintiffs in essence argue that this assumption violates nepa hard look requirement.we disagree.
as we have stated many times,nepa mandates procedural steps,not particular substantive results or outcomes.
a disagreement among experts or in the methodologies employed is generally not sufficient to invalidate an ea courts are not in a position to decide the propriety of competing methodologies but instead,should determine simply whether the challenged method had a rational basis and took into consideration the relevant factors.
comm.to preserve boomer lake park,at.the lynx was listed in march as a threatened species under the endangered species act.the agencies concluded that t he area contains potential foraging,denning,and travel habitat for lynx,especially the ecosystem surrounding the large open meadows of the area.ea at,ar at.the agencies further noted that in,the colorado division of wildlife conducted extensive field surveys to determine if there are enough snowshoe hares on whom lynx prey to support a reintroduction of lynx during the winters of and.id.the determination was positive enough throughout southwest colorado to support the process.id.accordingly,lynx were reintroduced into the area and were being tracked.of the lynx,were known to have died as of february.ar at.the tracking showed that one of the transplanted lynx is known to occupy an area some ten miles from the molas pass area.ea at,id.at.
the ea further indicated that,among the reasons for minimizing snow compacting in potential lynx habitat is the desire not to preclude the ability to lynx in the area.ea at,id.at.the ea noted that i t is unclear from the literature the degree of tolerance lynx have to human uses.ea at,id.at.it further noted that r ecreational use of the area is currently considered moderate,but will probably increase dramatically in the next years.id.given all of this there was an ongoing effort to lynx,a threatened species,into the area,that there was potential lynx habitat in the area,that the effect of human activity on lynx was uncertain,but that human activity in the area was expected to increase dramatically in the next decade,and that at least one lynx had been sighted near the can not say that the agencies determination to treat at least part of the area as lynx habitat and adopt appropriate mitigation measures did not have a rational basis or consider relevant factors.it satisfied nepa hard look requirement.
in their reply brief,plaintiffs,represented by different counsel,raise a different argument concerning the agencies treatment of the lynx.they argue that the decision to impose restrictions fail s arbitrary and capricious review under the apa.appellants reply br.at.citing for the first time a ninth circuit decision.cattle growers ass fish wildlife,cir,they argue that this management strategy is illegal as a matter of law.appellants reply br.at.
the agencies and intervenors have filed a joint motion to strike this portion of the reply brief,arguing that plaintiffs failed to make this argument in their administrative appeal,complaint,district court briefing,or opening appeal brief.joint mot.to strike at.we agree with the agencies and intervenors that plaintiffs have not made this argument before their reply brief.there are accordingly multiple reasons why we will not address it.persons challenging an agency compliance with nepa must structure their participation so that it alerts the agency to the parties position and contentions,in order to allow the agency to give the issue meaningful consideration.dep t of transp.pub.citizen,d quoting.yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d.the supreme court held in pub.citizen that,
b ecause respondents did not raise these particular objections to the ea,the agency was not given the opportunity to examine any proposed alternatives to determine if they were reasonably available.respondents have therefore forfeited any objection to the ea on the ground that it failed adequately to discuss potential alternatives to the proposed action.

furthermore,we have held that t he failure to raise an issue in an opening brief waives that issue.anderson dep t of labor,cir citing state farm fire cas.mhoon,cir.consistent with these principles is the general rule that appellate courts will not entertain issues raised for the first time on appeal in an appellant reply brief.id.quoting headrick rockwell int l,cir.
it is clear that,throughout the administrative proceedings,before the district court,and in their opening brief,plaintiffs argument about the absence of lynx in the molas pass area was confined to an allegation that the agencies alleged failure to substantiate the existence of lynx in the area was a violation of nepa procedural obligation to take a hard look at the potential environmental effects of the proposed action.thus,plaintiffs administrative appeal frames the issue as follows 
all of these references to lynx and lynx habitat are irrelevant because the forest service has not provided the specific factual prerequisite to their relevance that lynx do,in fact,inhabit the analysis area.this is precisely the type of factual defect that the tenth c ircuit has held renders an environmental analysis fatally flawed for failure to take a hard look.
