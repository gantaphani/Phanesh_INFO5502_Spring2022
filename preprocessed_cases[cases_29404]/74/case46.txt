background 
hughes worked as a program coordinator at region vii beginning in january until her termination on august.hughes region vii area agency on aging,d,hughes br.at.in,three private individuals incorporated region vii as a michigan corporation in,however,the articles of incorporation were amended,providing for organization on a membership basis.region vii receives almost all of its funding from the state and federal governments,and the agency is responsible for distributing those funds to service providers for the elderly in a region of michigan,which consists of the following counties bay,clare,gladwin,gratiot,huron,isabela,midland,saginaw,sanilac,and tuscola.the amendment to the articles of incorporation made those ten counties the sole members of the membership corporation a further amendment to the articles in made the city of saginaw a member of region vii as well.the of region vii pay a yearly membership fee to region vii,which totaled approximately in the fiscal year.at king aff.the board of directors for region vii consists of twelve voting board members each of the eleven governmental bodies appoints a representative to the board of directors for region vii,and those eleven board members then select one additional member of the board.hughes,d at at at.
region vii designated hughes as an exempt administrative employee under flsa.at king aff.hughes primary responsibility was to assess and audit service providers to determine their compliance with the service agreements and the regulations connected to state and federal funding.at king aff.hughes earned a yearly salary of approximately,and she had no direct,daily supervision and received broad discretion on how to accomplish her duties.at,king aff.
in early,steve neavling neavling,a reporter for the bay city times newspaper,began covering region vii as part of his beat covering bay county.at neavling dep.at.in may,neavling asked diane brady brady,an employee at region vii,to inquire whether hughes would speak to him regarding a sexual harassment lawsuit that had been filed against king,the executive director of region vii,by shelly mott mott,a region vii employee and registered nurse.at hughes dep.at.neavling and hughes had several conversations on the telephone and met twice in person to discuss events at region vii.at hughes dep.at.at her deposition,hughes stated that her conversations with neavling concerned a number of incidents relating to king,including observing king miss a meeting after receiving a call from mott and observing king and mott leave together from an evening event.at hughes dep.at.hughes stated that she told neavling that mott eventually became concerned and asked other employees to walk her to her car when she left the building.at hughes dep.at.hughes also stated that she had discussion with neavling regarding king sons involvement.at hughes dep.at.
hughes stated in her deposition that,in late june,hughes talked with kerry williams,a fellow region vii employee,after hughes attended a public meeting,and that their conversation related to possible future cuts to the region vii budget.at hughes dep.at.hughes believed that the possible cuts would affect jobs in the program on which kerry williams worked,and hughes stated that she was looking for input on how we were going to try to look at promotions again,and if there was,you know,any state push that was being formed again because,you know,previously there was a whole big campaign that was put out to keep that funding in place.at hughes dep.at.hughes also stated that she spoke to a region vii employee about a recent project rfp,or request for proposal,telling the employee that it was out for rebidding again because hughes believed that was public information at that point because hughes had sent an announcement back out to the newspapers to be published.at hughes dep.at.
on june,kerry williams wrote a note to orvosh in which williams stated that o n friday june,denise hughes informed me that she heard information at the advisory council that due to the budget may be consolidating jobs.at williams note at orvosh dep.at.williams note to orvosh also included the claim that williams was approached this day by kara perez another region vii employee regarding the vnss contracted services.she was told by denise hughes that vnss did bid on the services because that was the direction they wanted to go.i advised her at that time that i was at liberty to discuss that with her.at at orvosh dep.at.
at his deposition,orvosh discussed meeting with kerry williams about her note.at orvosh dep.at.orvosh stated that williams informed him that kara perez was upset about comments that hughes made to perez regarding the possible consolidation of jobs.at orvosh dep.at.on june,the day after receiving williams note,orvosh,region vii assistant director,reprimanded hughes for her conversations with her.hughes,d at at june,written reprimand.orvosh conceded that,prior to issuing the reprimand,he did not talk to hughes to hear her account of the conversation,nor did he even talk to kara perez.at,orvosh dep.at.orvosh reprimand stated that hughes discussion of the possible budget cuts with williams and the rfp status with perez demonstrated inappropriate conduct and performance.at reprimand.the reprimand letter also claimed that hughes had not ensured that parties contracting with region vii had met certain criteria.at reprimand.based on the reprimand,king and orvosh imposed a unpaid suspension on july,against hughes.at suspension notice.
in her deposition,hughes described seeing a list on king desk that had six names written on it underneath the words bay city times.at hughes dep.at.hughes could not remember exactly when she saw the list on king desk.at hughes dep.at.hughes believed that the list was of persons whom king suspected of talking to the bay city times about events at region vii.id.hughes recalled that her name,as well as mott and brady names,appeared on the list.id.hughes described a conversation on july,that she had at work at region vii with brady,after a discussion at a board meeting about the michigan freedom of information act and region vii policy for responding to media requests.at hughes dep.at.hughes stated that she and brady joked about how someone must be asking questions or they would have to be drafting a policy.id.although neither she nor brady said that they had talked to bay city times,hughes stated that others might have overhead their conversation and suspected them of talking to the bay city times.id.
on july,region vii fired brady,who had earlier requested that the region vii board of directors investigate king due to mott allegations.at,bay city times article.by this time,region vii had agreed to a confidential settlement with mott regarding her lawsuit against king and had recently paid mott the amount of her settlement.id.at her deposition,hughes stated that she spoke to neavling about brady termination,giving her opinion that brady termination was related to the fact that she had wanted shelly mott case to be investigated and that hughes did not think there was any basis for brady termination.at hughes dep.at.
neavling stated at his deposition that he recalled telling king that he had been speaking to hughes about region vii.at neavling dep.at.he remembered king asking who my sources were and then then he said,we know it denise hughes or something like that and i said well,she not the only person talking to me.at neavling dep.at.neavling could not recall exactly when this conversation took place,but he was certain that hughes was still employed by region vii when he confirmed to king that hughes was one of his sources.at neavling dep.at.
hughes employment at region vii ended on august,when orvosh notified hughes during a telephone conversation that she was fired.hughes,d at at hughes personnel file document.the bay city times published several articles regarding region vii in august and september,detailing the turmoil at the agency.at bay city times articles.one article noted that employees from a staff either have quit or were fired or laid off and an editorial asserted that a probe would help clear the air at the agency.at bay city times articles.the editorial noted that king,the executive director of region vii,had settled a suit,that several employees had departed or been fired,that king sons received for some work and computer parts from the agency,and described region vii conduct as revealing a cavalier attitude among those entrusted with taxpayer money to help our oldest citizens.at bay city times editorial.the editorial questioned whether it is time for state and local leaders to question whether these area agencies on aging are necessary given that t hey exist only as a means of passing along state and federal money to local programs,and the editorial concluded that it time once again for federal and state investigators to take a close look at how the agency has been run recently.id.

ii.analysis 
whether region vii is subject to suit under.legal standards

defendants appeal the district court march ruling,in which the district court held that region vii is subject to suit under because,under brentwood,region vii acts under color of state law due to the pervasive entwinement of governmental entities in the management and control of region vii.we conclude that defendants arguments lack merit.
we begin by providing an overview of the extensive statutory and regulatory framework that governs area agencies on aging such as region vii.in,congress passed the older americans act,which established an administration on aging to carry out the mandate of the act and which require d each state to create a state agency to be responsible for determining the intrastate distribution of funds given to the state by the federal government.hughes,d at citing.in,michigan passed the older michiganians act,which established a commission on services to the aging.id.citing.comp.laws et.the commission was established within the executive office of the governor and consist s of members appointed by the governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate.comp.laws.the older michiganians act oma requires that the commission d esignate planning and service areas and an agency which shall be recognized as an area agency on services to the aging within each planning and service area.comp.laws i.the oma permits four types of organizations to act as an area agency on aging aaa,including a public or nonprofit private agency,except a regional or local agency of the state,that is under the supervision or direction of the state agency.comp.laws d emphasis added.the oma then lists the duties and powers of the aaa,which include administering an area plan,entering into contracts,and serving as an advocate for older persons.hughes,d at citing.comp.laws.
the oma also created the office of services to the aging osa in the department of management and budget,and the oma provided that t he governor shall appoint a director of the office by and with the advice and consent of the senate and that t he director shall receive compensation as provided by the legislature.comp.laws.the osa must s upervise,monitor,assess,evaluate,and provide technical assistance to area agencies on aging,such as region vii.comp.laws k.
the oma authorized the osa and the commission to promulgate rules to implement the oma.comp.laws.as the district court noted,the osa rules are very specific about what aaas may and may not do.hughes,d at citing.admin.code.for instance,the regulations establish that a grantee such as region vii shall not consummate a contract using funds made available,in whole or in part,through the office until an area plan has been approved by the commission and that a grantee such as region vii shall contract for only those services enumerated in the area plan or other document detailing the proposed use of funds which has been approved by the commission.admin.code.under the regulations,grantees such as region vii must also establish various appeals mechanisms and procedures for contractors to appeal a contract that has been suspended,terminated,or not renewed and must ensure that the appeals procedures contain sufficient notice of various rights.admin.code.
the regulations further provide that a rea agencies such as region vii shall develop a comprehensive and coordinated area plan for the delivery of nutrition and supportive services to older persons for their respective regions and that aaas must have written procedures for the conduct of public hearings regarding the adoption of t he area plan.admin.code.the regulations require that a rea agencies,as part of the area plan,shall describe the rationale for allocating funds made available through grants within their respective regions and also require that a rea agencies shall adopt written procedures to govern the aaa board of directors,their handling of administrative complaints generated by service providers,and their a ssessment of contractors.admin.code.finally,the regulations state that such written procedures shall be officially adopted by action of the entity governing body and that before adopting the procedures there must be an opportunity for comment on the proposed operating procedures by local governments,contractors,and affected agencies and that n otice of opportunity for comment shall be published in a newspaper at least fourteen days prior to the aaa adoption of the procedures.admin.code.
as the michigan court of appeals has observed,these numerous statutory and regulatory provisions clearly establish that the fourteen aaas are subordinate to,and subject to the supervision of,the commission.detroit area agency on aging office of services to the aging.and the commission,of course,is the body created by the oma within the executive office of the governor and staffed by members appointed by the governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate.comp.laws.
as stated above,in brentwood the supreme court noted that a challenged activity may be state action when it is entwined with governmental policies or when government is entwined in its management or control.at.quoting evans newton,d alteration in original.the extensive statutory and regulatory provisions detailed above show that government is deeply entwined in the management or control of region vii government entities are the sole members of region vii and they appoint eleven members of region vii board of directors,with their chosen representatives appointing the final member of the board.furthermore,virtually every act that region vii performs must receive approval from a state agency,and the very existence of region vii as a designated area agency on aging depends upon region vii being under the supervision or direction of the state agency.comp.laws emphasis added.the entwinement of government in the management and control of region vii is thus a matter of statutory policy,in addition to the fact that the membership of region vii consists entirely of governmental entities.
in brentwood,the challenged entity,which the court held was properly subject to suit under,was the tennessee secondary school athletic association,a membership corporation organized to regulate interscholastic sport among the public and private high schools in tennessee that belong to it.brentwood,at.as the district court observed in this case,the facts in brentwood remarkably parallel the present case.hughes,d at.indeed,the facts in this case present an even stronger case for finding that region vii acts under color of law.in brentwood,public high schools constituted of the association voting membership,brentwood,at,whereas governmental michigan counties and the city of percent of the members of region vii.those eleven governmental entities each appoint a member to the board of directors for region vii,and their appointed representatives select the twelfth member.
certainly we recognize that the supreme court has stated that t he mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the state.jackson metro.edison,d.unlike the utility company in jackson,not only is region vii subject to a host of state that,as mentioned above,govern region vii operating procedures,its ability to make,cancel,or renew contracts,and the manner in which it formulates the area plan for distributing the state and federal governments also region vii is a,membership corporation whose sole members are governmental entities.thus,in addition to being regulated by the state,region vii is composed of state entities and is permitted by statute to act as a designated area agency on aging only because region vii is under the supervision or direction of the state agency.comp.laws.
as the supreme court concluded in brentwood,we conclude in this case that t he nominally private character of region vii is overborne by the pervasive entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its composition and workings,and there is no substantial reason to claim unfairness in applying constitutional standards to it.at.indeed,we note that defendants appellate brief included several references to region vii responses to state freedom of information act foia requests for information filed by the bay city times.br.at.according to the michigan attorney general,however,the scope of michigan foia,which applies only to public bodies,does not include private corporations.summary of michigan freedom of information act,office of the attorney general,http www.michigan.gov ag.html last visited,emphasis added see also opinion,michigan attorney general,wl,at,available at.state.mi.us opinion datafiles s op.htm stating that i t is my opinion,in answer to your final question,that the freedom of information act does not apply to a private nonprofit corporation.in responding to state foia requests,region vii acted as though it were a public body.in view of the pervasive entwinement of governmental entities and representatives in the supervision and management of region vii,as well as region vii own conduct manifesting an acceptance that it is a public body,we affirm the district court ruling that region vii acted under color of law and is subject to suit under.
hughes first amendment claim 
legal standards 
we review a district court decision granting summary judgment de novo.burchett kiefer,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in conducting the summary judgment analysis,we must view all inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,which is hughes in this case.burchett,at.
i n determining whether a public employer has violated the first amendment by firing a public employee for engaging in speech,the supreme court has instructed courts to engage in a inquiry.first,a court must ascertain whether the relevant speech addressed a matter of public concern.rodgers banks,cir citing connick myers,d.whether the speech at issue involves a matter of public concern is a question of law for the court,although there may be some factual questions for a jury if it is disputed whether the expression occurred or what words were specifically stated.farhat jopke,cir internal citations omitted.in conducting our inquiry,we must assess the content,form,and context of a given statement,as revealed by the whole record.connick,at.our review of the lower court decision on this issue is de novo.farhat,at.
according to the supreme court decision in garcetti ceballos,d,we also must determine whether the employee expressions were made pursuant to his or her official responsibilities or whether the statements or complaints were made outside the duties of employment.id.at.in garcetti,the supreme court held that the first amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employee expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities and thus concluded that the plaintiff first amendment retaliation claim failed given that the parties in this case do not dispute that ceballos wrote his disposition memo pursuant to his employment duties.id.
second,if we conclude that an employee speech involved a matter of public concern and was not made pursuant to the employee official duties,we then must balance the interests of the public employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.rodgers,at quoting pickering bd.of,d.defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that legitimate grounds existed justifying the termination.id.at citing connick,at.in waters churchill,d,a plurality of the supreme court stated that i t is necessary that the decisionmaker reach its conclusion about what was said in good faith,rather than as a pretext,explaining that i f an employment action is based on what an employee supposedly said,and a reasonable supervisor would recognize that there is a substantial likelihood that what was actually said was protected,the manager must tread with the care that a reasonable manager would use before making an employment,suspension,reprimand,or whatever the sort involved in the particular case.waters,at.plurality.the plurality reasoned that such care is necessary to avoid the possibility of inadvertently punishing someone for exercising her first amendment rights.id.at.plurality.as with the inquiry,the a pplication of the pickering balancing test is a matter of law for the court to decide.farhat,at.
finally,we must determine whether the employee speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the employer decision to take the adverse employment action against the employee.rodgers,at citing healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d,and perry mcginnis,cir.
whether hughes conversations with a reporter for the bay city times involved a matter of public concern 
as an initial matter,we note the district court observation that t he parties do not dispute that adverse employment actions did occur,that defendant region vii terminated hughes and suspended her prior to that.at op.at.the district court also concluded that the evidence in this case presented genuine disputes of material fact regarding the element of causation and whether region vii might have terminated hughes employment regardless of her speech.at noting region vii contention that hughes was tardy in attendance and in completing her work,and devoted substantial time to gossiping as well as hughes rebuttal argument that her april performance evaluation contained no negative marks.on these issues,we agree with the district court.
the crucial issue in this appeal is thus whether hughes speech touched a matter of public concern.at her deposition,hughes testified about her numerous conversations with a newspaper reporter,in which she primarily discussed allegations of sexual harassment against king,the executive director of region vii,and hughes opinion that region vii terminated brady because brady recommended that king be investigated in connection with the allegations.the district court concluded that hughes failed to show that her speech involved a matter of public concern we disagree.
the evidence in this case shows that a newspaper reporter specifically sought out hughes as a source regarding allegations of sexual harassment against the executive director of region vii,an area agency on aging that is responsible for distributing a substantial amount of funds entrusted to the agency by the state of michigan and the federal government.further,the reporter testified in his deposition that,while hughes was still an employee of region vii,the reporter confirmed to king,the executive director,that hughes was serving as a source for the reporter critical articles regarding region vii.in light of this evidence and the case law,we conclude that hughes,in speaking to a reporter about allegations of sexual harassment against a public official,engaged in a constitutionally protected activity.
matters of public concern include speech that relat es to any matter of political,social,or other concern to the community.rodgers,at quoting connick,at.in connick,the supreme court offered examples of speech that would involve matters of public concern,such as statements inform ing the public that a governmental entity was not discharging its governmental responsibilities or statements seek ing to bring to light actual or potential wrongdoing or breach of public trust on the part of government employees.connick,at.rodgers,at.the court in connick also described an individual right to protest racial discrimination as a matter inherently of public concern.id.at.emphasis added.likewise,we have stated that it is that allegations of sexual harassment,like allegations of racial harassment,are matters of public concern.bonnell lorenzo,cir.finally,in matulin village of lodi,cir,we observed that our finding of public concern is here strengthened by the fact that the plaintiff did not solicit the attention of the media,but simply responded to questions regarding an existing controversy.in matulin,we described the third circuit decision in rode dellarciprete,cir,as holding that statements relating to charges of discrimination leveled at public employers and reported upon by newspapers clearly involved matters of public concern.matulin,at emphasis added.
at her deposition,hughes testified that,like the plaintiff in matulin,the reporter solicited her views.at hughes dep.at.hughes also testified that she provided information to neavling about specific instances of king conduct toward mott,the individual who had filed and settled a lawsuit against king and region vii.at hughes dep.at.for instance,hughes recounted telling neavling about king missing a meeting after receiving a call from mott and about witnessing bruce king leave with shelly mott from an evening event.at hughes dep.at.hughes also stated that she told neavling that mott eventually became concerned and that mott asked other staff members to walk her to her car when she left the building.at hughes dep.at.further,hughes informed neavling that mott lawsuit against king and region vii had been settled,at hughes dep.at,which hughes asserts led to neavling and the bay city times submitting state foia requests to confirm the information that he had received from hughes.resp.reply br.at see also br.at discussing the numerous foia requests filed by neavling.hughes also recalled that she told neavling that she supported diane brady position that the director king should have been investigated regarding mott claims of sexual harassment,that she felt that brady termination was related to the fact that brady had wanted shelly mott case against king to be investigated,and that hughes did not think that there was any basis for brady termination.at hughes dep.at.under the case law discussed above,such statements clearly address matters of public concern.
the district court,however,concluded that hughes deposition testimony contained only generalized assertions that left the court to guess at the contours of her speech and that i n the absence of more concrete content,it borders on impossible to test whether that speech reached a matter of public concern.at op.at see also at op.at stating that hughes has provided only vacuous and generic claims about the topics she discussed with neavling.the quotes above,taken from hughes deposition,refute the district court characterization of hughes evidence.hughes testified that,in her conversations with neavling,she described specific events that pertained to mott lawsuit against king,informed neavling that mott had reached a confidential settlement with region vii regarding her lawsuit,and informed neavling of her opinion that region vii had terminated brady in retaliation for brady advocacy of an investigation into king conduct in light of mott allegations.such evidence is more than sufficient to ascertain that hughes speech involved a matter of public concern.
in concluding that hughes speech did not touch a matter of public concern,the district court also erred in distinguishing hughes case from bonnell,which the district court recognized as establishing that claims of sexual harassment are a matter of public concern.at op.at citing bonnell,at.the district court characterized hughes statements as mere personal opinions about the prudence of decisions made by her employer and supervisors because her alleged communications only recite the fact of another person complaint and hughes assessment of her employer response to that complaint.at op.at.
the district court reasoning on this point and its treatment of bonnell is troubling for several reasons.first,in characterizing hughes statements about mott claim as mere personal opinions about the prudence of decisions made by her employer and supervisors,the district court reasoning would seemingly apply with equal force to the individual complaining of or exposing sexual or racial discrimination in the first instance,a position clearly contrary to bonnell and the proposition that claims of discrimination by government officials and employers are matters of public concern.second,the district court view that hughes observations lack constitutional protection directly conflicts with our opinion in chappel montgomery county fire protection district,cir.in chappel,we soundly rejected the argument that speech which addresses public corruption,but does not disclose it in the first instance,is not protected.id.at emphasis in original.indeed,we explained that the defendants suggestion that such speech is not protected,by virtue of its status,is absurd.id.certainly,we acknowledged that speech that breaks a story may be of greater concern to the public,but we emphasized that it should be clear that a public employee speech need not be fresh and enlightening to be considered speech on a matter of public concern.id.at.third,the district court overlooked that the evidence did in fact suggest that hughes speech offered new information regarding this matter of public concern hughes informed neavling that mott lawsuit had been settled,a fact that neavling then confirmed pursuant to a state foia request.
defendants advance several other arguments in support of the district court conclusion that hughes speech did not involve a matter of public concern,but their arguments lack support in the record and are unpersuasive.first,defendants repeatedly argue from the premise that hughes speaking to neavling was not published or known until after hughes termination.br.at see also id.at how can an employer punish an employee based upon the content of a statement if the employer does not know what the statement is.defendants assertion that they had no knowledge of hughes speaking to neavling simply ignores the record.both hughes and neavling testified at their depositions that neavling had informed king that hughes,while still a region vii employee,was a source for the bay city times.at hughes dep.at at neavling dep.at.indeed,as the district court recognized,hughes also offered evidence to show that a might have overheard her conversation with brady regarding foia and that defendant king had a list with six names,including hers,on his desk under a heading like bay city times.at op.at.
defendants advance a related argument that hughes conduct in speaking to a reporter about region vii is unprotected because no published article quoted her prior to her termination.br.at arguing that because the bay city times never attributed information to hughes prior to her termination hughes conduct is simply not the kind of speech or expressive conduct protected by pickering.this argument lacks any merit as well.answering a reporter questions about a matter of public concern obviously constitutes expressive conduct,and the supreme court has explicitly held that an employee speech need not be public to receive constitutional protection.givhan western line consol.sch,d disagreeing with the court of appeals that private expression of one views is beyond constitutional protection.moreover,as mentioned above,hughes offered additional evidence suggesting that king knew she had spoken to a reporter about events at region vii.
we also note that in this case defendants do not rely upon the supreme court holding in garcetti that the first amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employee expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities.garcetti,at.emphasis added.defendants do cite garcetti in the course of characterizing hughes alleged statements to her fellow employees in late june as mere workplace grumble s that do not rise to the level of a constitutional issue,br.at,but this argument overlooks the supreme court statement in garcetti recognizing that e mployees in some cases may receive first amendment protection for expressions made at work and emphasizing that t he controlling factor in ceballos case is that his expressions were made pursuant to his duties as a calendar deputy.garcetti,at.emphasis added.most importantly,defendants do not advance any argument that hughes to the reporter or to her made pursuant to her official duties.garcetti thus does not bar hughes claims.
whether hughes alleged statements to her in june involved a matter of public concern 
having concluded that hughes conversations with neavling about region vii touched a matter of public concern,we turn to the matter of hughes alleged statements to her in late june following a public meeting.first,we address some confusion regarding whether these alleged statements are the basis of an additional first amendment retaliation claim separate from hughes claim stemming from her conversations with neavling,or whether her alleged statements and the disciplinary sanction pertain instead to the causation analysis of a single first amendment claim arising out of hughes conversations with neavling.
