in this appeal we examine whether the city of silvis may tax the gross receipts from the sale of admission tickets to a charitable golf tournament,a tournament sanctioned by the professional golfers association pga,and operated by quad cities open,open.the illinois municipal code permits municipal corporate authorities to license,tax,and regulate all athletic contests and exhibitions carried on for gain.ilcs west.the appellate court held that the charitable golf tournament was not conducted for gain and,consequently,was exempt from tax.d.accordingly,at issue in this appeal is the meaning of for gain under the municipal code and whether the tournament is carried on for gain and therefore subject to taxation.
background 
the open,first incorporated in as an illinois corporation,has been granted federal status under the internal revenue code c.the open articles of incorporation state the purpose of the corporation 
to sponsor a professional golf tournament and to operate same,with the specific purpose that all profits in excess of a operating contingency fund which shall not include the tournament prize be used in promoting the common good and general welfare of the people of the quad cities area or be given to organizations which qualify for a tax exemption under c of the internal revenue code.
no part of the net earning of the corporation shall inure to the benefit of any director of the corporation,officer of the corporation,or any private individual except that reasonable compensation may be paid for services rendered to or for the corporation affecting one or more of its purposes,and no director or officer of the corporation,or any private individual shall be entitled to share in the distribution of any of the corporate assets on dissolution of the corporation.
to achieve this purpose,the open has operated an annual pga tour sponsored golf tournament in the quad cities area.for years the tournament varied in location and name depending on the title sponsor.each year,the open contributes excess revenue from the tournament to quad cities area charities such as the american red cross,junior achievement,the easter seals foundation,the boy scouts,special olympics,the ymca of the quad cities,the march of dimes,and the foundation.in deere company became the event title sponsor and it was thereafter named the john deere classic golf tournament the tournament.in,the open moved the tournament to the tournament players club tpc at deere run golf course,a newly constructed golf course in silvis,illinois.the open also moved its operations and offices to the city of silvis.
soon afterwards,silvis enacted an ordinance imposing a tax upon gross receipts from the sale of admission tickets at for gain professional tournaments or other for gain professional athletic events.city of silvis ordinance eff.january.silvis enacted the ordinance pursuant to section of the illinois enabling statute,which authorizes municipalities to regulate and tax athletic contests carried on for gain.ilcs west.on april,the open sought a declaratory judgment against silvis.in its complaint,the open alleged that the tournament is not subject to taxation under the ordinance because the tournament is not carried on for gain within the meaning of the enabling statute 
discovery revealed the following undisputed facts.the open is operated and directed by volunteers who offer their time and expertise in both the planning of and execution of the actual event.no net earnings are paid to either officers or directors,with the exception of the tournament director,who is paid an annual salary.for the fiscal years to,the tournament gross revenues totaled.the open paid in purses to golfers,distributed to legitimate charities,set aside a portion to the operating reserve fund,and devoted the remainder to the tournament operating expenses.examples of operating expenditures include for road and cart path work required to repair damage caused by heavy equipment used to construct grandstands,television stands,and skyboxes for electrical and wiring upgrades required for scoreboards,media facilities,grandstands,concessions and other services and approximately for water well construction requested by the silvis health department.the record further reveals that in and the open unrestricted revenue exceeded total expenses.in,the unrestricted revenue was less than expenses,and the open suffered a loss.in both and the open drew assets from its operating reserve fund for payment of tournament expenses,and following the conclusion of the tournament in the reserve fund totaled.during the year the tournament operated at a loss,the open continued to donate to quad cities area charities.
in addition,the open makes possible the birdies for charity program.operated by the john deere classic charitable corporation,a nonparty to this appeal,birdies for charity solicits individual pledges and donations for each birdie scored during the tournament.the open pays all overhead for the program,and in return the program donates to charity of the revenue.during the years to,the program raised and donated to charity.
following discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.the open attached the affidavit of kay hegarty,a certified public accountant,who stated in her affidavit 
e ach expense of the tournament,including the prize purse,appears necessary to effectuate the purpose of the open as stated in its articles.an expense is considered to violate the private inurement doctrine if it is substantially more than similar expenses based on appropriate comparability data.that is,expenses must be similar in amount to corresponding expenses of comparable organizations or events.none of the documentation i have reviewed suggest expenditures by the open that are unreasonable in their amount.
none of the terms and obligations found in the contract between the open and the pga support a suggestion that the open operates for gain.the testimony is based upon the fact that the provisions in the contract are necessary in order to define the rights and obligation of the parties the open and the pga.moreover,since the activities conducted pursuant to the contract,to sponsor a professional golf tournament,constitute the basis for the open tax exempt status,no portion of revenue from the tournament is subject to federal income tax as an unrelated trade or business.
silvis filed a counteraffidavit of its expert witness,james nepple 
the open operates its business as a enterprise as evidenced by the following facts set forth as indicated in the open pga contract i under section it sells media rights to television for profit ii under section it sells media rights to radio for profit iii under section it sells computer broadcasting media rights for profit iv section of the contract entitles the open to receive revenues from the pga television rights fund v section of the contract requires the open to maintain financial responsibility and liquidity independent of its charitable operations vi under section of the contract the open purchases the right to use of pga intellectual property and the right to resell same for a profit.
during its most recent fiscal year,the open expended the following sums of money i for new and improved access roads and cart paths at tpc deere run golf course,a privately owned facility ii for electrical and wiring upgrades at tpc deere run golf course,a privately owned facility and iii for water wells and office rehabilitation for the open.
the trial court deemed that the open,like much of professional sports,is a major business enterprise.the proceeds paid to the professional participants exceeds the amount of charitable contributions and is evidence that the open charitable purpose is incidental.the trial court concluded that the open was more like a typical business,and that like many businesses it was charitable but clearly carried on for gain.specifically,the trial court held that,t he open has characterized its primary purpose as charitable.however,purely charitable organizations such as the red cross or the united way presumably do spend three to six million dollars per year so that they can raise per year for charity.the trial court denied the open motion for summary judgment,and granted silvis for summary judgment and dismissal of the open complaint with prejudice.
the appellate court reversed the trial court.d.the appellate court construed the meaning of the term for gain and concluded we do not believe our general assembly adopted the enabling statute to tax events organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes.illinois has traditionally recognized the exemption of charitable organizations from taxation.d at.accordingly,the appellate court held,because the record demonstrated that the open distributes most of the net proceeds to bona fide charities,and neither the open nor any of its officers operated for a profit to themselves,the tournament did not operate for gain within the meaning of the enabling statute and was exempt from taxation.d at.
we granted silvis petition for leave to appeal.we now affirm the appellate court.
silvis is a unit of local government and,therefore,may exercise only those powers granted to it by law and the illinois constitution.const,art.vii.the silvis ordinance city of silvis ordinance eff.january,was enacted pursuant to section of the illinois municipal code,which provides that 
the corporate authorities of each municipality may license,tax,and regulate all athletic contests and exhibitions carried on for gain.this tax shall be based on the gross receipts derived from the sale of admission tickets,but the tax shall not exceed of the gross receipts.ilcs west.
the term for gain is not defined in any part of the illinois municipal code.the open argues that for gain was meant to include events that distribute excess revenue to private individuals organizations but not to events that distribute excess revenue only to legitimate,recognized charities.therefore,the open maintains that entities like itself that distribute excess revenue to charities are not operating for gain and can not be subject to taxation under the enabling statute.
silvis argues that the disposition of the net proceeds after the event is irrelevant and that our assessment of whether the tournament is carried on for gain should be based upon the general character of the event.particularly,silvis argues that the tournament is for gain because the athletic contestants are paid,and the event is carried on for a purpose other than losing money the event is a major professional golf tournament in which the participants are paid millions,and in which the revenue far exceeds expenses.according to silvis,our analysis of this matter could end at the fact that this was a professional golf tournament conducted for prize money.
in order to determine whether the tournament is carried on for gain,the trial court examined the operation of the tournament to ascertain its primary purpose.section of article ix of the illinois constitution provides,inter alia,that to be exempt from taxation property must be used exclusively for charitable purposes.const,art.ix,the general assembly may exempt from taxation property used exclusively for agricultural and horticultural societies,and for school,religious,cemetery and charitable purposes.our legislature has codified this exemption in various enactments,such as the illinois use tax act.see,ilcs west entitled exemptions and,in part,exempting property purchased by an institution organized and operated exclusively for charitable purposes.in order to ascertain whether property is exclusively used for charitable purposes we have held that exclusively used means the primary purpose for which property is used and not any secondary or incidental purpose.methodist old peoples home korzen,see also wyndemere retirement community department of revenue,d.this analysis,however,applies to claims for tax exemption.a statute providing an exemption is strictly construed in favor of taxation and against exemption the party seeking exemption must prove entitlement.wyndemere retirement community,d at,yale club of chicago department of revenue,d,the burden of proving entitlement to an exemption is upon the entity seeking exemption,and all questions are resolved in favor of taxation.in the instant matter,exemption is not the issue.
rather,the issue is whether the statute,by the phrase for gain,applies to a particular organizations that organize and operate an athletic event with the specific purpose of promoting the common good and general welfare.the open does not seek an exemption they maintain that the enabling statute simply does not apply.thus,under this circumstance,the following principle applies t axing laws are to be strictly construed and they are not to be extended beyond the clear import of the language used.if there is any doubt in their application they will be construed most strongly against the government and in favor of the taxpayer.getto city of chicago,quoting oscar paris lyons,citing people gas light coke ames,see also gem electronics of monmouth,department of revenue,statutes imposing a tax are strictly construed against the government and in favor of the taxpayer.
our initial task in this appeal is to consider the meaning of the statutory language for gain.the construction of a statute is a question of law,and our standard of review is de novo.michigan avenue national bank county of cook.principles of statutory construction dictate that we give effect to the intention of the legislature.people ex rel.devine united states currency.when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous,a court must give effect to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language without resort to other tools of statutory construction.people glisson.we must construe the statute so that each word,clause,or sentence is given reasonable meaning and not deemed superfluous or void.glisson,at.
the plain meaning of the term for gain as it is used in the enabling statute is not clear or unambiguous.rather,as demonstrated by the trial and appellate courts in this case,the term is susceptible to two reasonable and conflicting interpretations.silvis is correct when it argues that gain is generally defined as the difference between receipts and expenditures,profits,or winnings.see black law dictionary ed.for gain,however,has another commonly understood meaning.that is,for gain or for profit is also understood as the opposite of charitable or.people young men christian ass of chicago,charitable nature of an organization depends upon whether its object is to carry out a purpose recognized in law as charitable,or whether it is maintained for gain,profit or private advantage.reading for gain in this manner tends to support the open position.
in resolving this statutory ambiguity,we must assume that the legislature did not intend absurdity to result from the legislation.glisson,at.silvis interpretation of for gain excludes one type of event from taxation under the carried on to lose money.common sense dictates that the legislature must have intended another meaning.furthermore,we can conceive of no events which would fit this characterization and silvis has identified none.under silvis reading of the statute,all athletic contests and exhibitions could be taxed,thereby rendering the phrase superfluous.see glisson,at,we must construe statutes in a manner that does not render a word superfluous or void.
rather,like the appellate court,we believe the legislature did not intend for gain to include events organized and operated for charitable purposes.the exclusion of such events from for gain is consistent with this state preference to exclude charitable organizations from taxation.in people young men christian ass hereinafter ymca,we observed that favorable treatment toward charitable organizations advances governmental interests because charities lessen the burdens of government.ymca,at,quoting crerar williams.legislative enactments extend preferential treatment in order to promote the creation of charitable organizations for the betterment of our citizens in need.ymca,at,see,ilcs west retailers occupation tax act ilcs west use tax act ilcs b west property tax code.if this court were to conclude that the legislature meant to include events organized f
