the petitioner,lapham foundation,appeals from a tax court judgment classifying it as a private foundation under a.the tax court based its decision on a finding that the foundation did not meet the integral part test set forth in a i.on appeal,the foundation argues that it does meet the requisite test and is therefore a supporting organization,rather than a private organization.the commissioner of internal revenue,in response,claims that the tax court was correct in holding that the foundation did not meet the integral part test and that,even if the foundation does meet that test,the tax court decision should be affirmed because the foundation has not shown that it is not controlled by disqualified persons,as required by a c in order to be classified as a supporting organization.the tax court did not address the latter question and,because we conclude that the tax court ruling on the foundation failure to meet the integral part test was correct,we likewise find it unnecessary to address the issue raised under a c.
factual and procedural background 
lapham foundation,the foundation,is a michigan corporation,organized under its articles to operate exclusively for the benefit of the american endowment foundation in a manner intended to enable it to qualify as a supporting organization of the american endowment foundation within the meaning of section a of the code.in turn,the american endowment foundation aef is an ohio corporation that the irs has recognized both as as an organization described in c and as a publicly supported entity under a.aef runs a fund program through which the donors have the right to advise aef on how they wish their contributions to be distributed,but aef is not obligated to follow the recommendations and retains control over the timing,manner,and recipients of the distributions.
the foundation sole asset was a promissory note,payable to charles and maxine lapham,in a face amount of.the maker of the note was estate storage,a corporation owned by the laphams,and it was collateralized with real estate owned by estate storage.the principal amount was due in full no later than december.the interest rate on the note was,to be paid in equal quarterly payments of.in exchange for the note,the laphams received a gift annuity,under which the foundation agreed to pay them annually over their joint lives.
in july,the foundation filed form with the irs,seeking to be recognized as a organization under c and as a supporting organization under a.the application indicated that the foundation would support aef by receiving and administering funds for the benefit of aef and listed its sources of financial support as d onations from the lapham family and its friends,including individuals and businesses,and interest on investments.on a financial disclosure form,the foundation noted that it had received in the promissory note and that it expected to receive a year in gifts,grants,and contributions in and.the form also noted that the entity anticipated receipt of in gross investment income in and in,and that it had a gift annuity obligation of per year.the foundation thus expected an excess of revenue over expenses of per year for and.because it intended to give at least percent of its income to the supported organization,the application estimated a donation of annually to aef.
during the administrative process,the foundation reported that it would receive outright testamentary gifts of approximately at the death of the laphams,which it estimated would occur in years,and that it was the beneficiary of a charitable lead trust under the revocable living trusts of charles and maxine lapham,which,if certain assumptions proved to be true,would distribute annually for years after the laphams deaths.the report also indicated that the laphams had pledged an additional to the foundation contingent upon the approval of its status under c and a.
in a later communication to the irs,the foundation stated that it would recommend that aef use of the support provided through the fund to expand its representation in southeastern michigan,and the remaining to support charities in northville,michigan.it also estimated that aef total annual income was,although the tax court later determined that,in,aef received total contributions in the amount of but had income of only.
on april,the irs recognized the foundation as exempt from taxation as a c organization but determined that it was a private foundation,rather than a supporting organization under a.in response,the foundation offered to make various changes in its organizational structure in order to achieve supporting organization status.the tax court found it unclear from the administrative record whether any of the proposed changes were actually made,although it appears that the foundation did amend its concerning the of the board of directors.the foundation nonetheless received an adverse ruling as to its request for a supporting organization classification under a.the irs explained that the foundation had failed to meet the attentiveness test under the integral part test found in section a i iii of the income tax regulations,and that it had also failed to meet the test for control by disqualified persons set forth in section a j of the regulations.the irs further explained,as to the control test,that the foundation primary asset was a promissory note payable by a corporation controlled by disqualified persons and secured by assets of that corporation.it found,therefore,that d isqualified persons are in a position to control the foundation by means of the power they exercise,through their corporation,with respect to the foundation primary asset.
dissatisfied with this ruling,the foundation filed a petition for declaratory judgment in the tax court,seeking a determination that it was a supporting organization as described in a,rather than a private foundation.the case was submitted for a decision on the basis of the pleadings and the administrative record.the tax court found that the foundation did not meet the integral part test and,because that decision was fatal to the foundation claim that it was a supporting organization,did not reach the issue of whether the foundation was controlled by disqualified persons.
the foundation now appeals the tax court determination.in response,the commissioner argues that if the tax court decision is not upheld on the ground that the foundation does not meet the integral part test,it should be upheld on the ground that the foundation has not shown that it is not controlled by disqualified persons.
standard of review 
under rules,we review the tax court factual findings for clear error and legal questions de novo.see kenco,comm r,cir.the line between the two is not always obvious,however.in this case,for example,the parties dispute whether the issues to be resolved are factual or legal in nature.the foundation asserts that the facts are undisputed and that the case therefore presents a pure question of law,whereas the commissioner contends that whether the foundation is operated in connection with aef,a dispositive question in this case,is a question of fact.
we have held that the determination that an organization is not organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes,for purposes of c,is a question of fact.see ohio teamsters educ.and safety training trust fund comm r,cir.it could be argued that the question of whether an organization is operated in connection with another organization is similar in kind to the question of whether it is operated exclusively for certain purposes.on the other hand,what is being reviewed here is not actually the existence of a fact,but the application of the law to the facts,a situation requiring de novo review.see.employee health plan trust comm r,cir.although the question is an interesting one,in the end we conclude that we need not decide it here,because the standard of review is not in this case.regardless of which standard is employed,the decision of the tax court must be affirmed for the reasons detailed below.
