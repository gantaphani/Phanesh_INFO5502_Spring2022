the employee retirement income security act of erisa generally obligates private employers offering pension plans to adhere to an array of rules designed to ensure plan solvency and protect plan participants.c hurch plan s,however,are exempt from those regulations.b.from the beginning,erisa has defined a church plan as a plan established and maintained for its employees by a church.a.congress then amended the statute to expand that definition,adding the provision whose effect is at issue here a plan established and maintained for its employees by a church includes a plan maintained by an organization the principal purpose of which is the administration or funding of such plan for the employees of a church,if such organization is controlled by or associated with a church.c i.this opinion refers to the organizations described in that provision as organizations.
petitioners,who identify themselves as three nonprofits that run hospitals and other healthcare facilities collectively,hospitals,offer their employees pension plans.those plans were established by the hospitals themselves,and are managed by internal committees.respondents,current and former hospital employees,filed class actions alleging that the hospitals pension plans do not fall within erisa exemption because they were not established by a church.the district courts,agreeing with the employees,held that a plan must be established by a church to qualify as a church plan.the courts of appeals affirmed.
held a plan maintained by a organization qualifies as a church plan,regardless of who established it.
a the term church plan initially mean t only a plan established and maintained by a church.but subparagraph c i provides that the original definitional phrase will now include another a plan maintained by a organization.that use of the word include is not literal,but tells readers that a different type of plan should receive the same treatment,an exemption as the type described in the old definition.in other words,because congress deemed the category of plans established and maintained by a church to include plans maintained by organizations,those plans and all those plans are exempt from erisa requirements.
had congress wanted,as the employees contend,to alter only the maintenance requirement,it could have provided in subparagraph c i that a plan maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by a organization removing established and from the first part of the sentence.but congress did not adopt that ready alternative.instead,it added language whose most natural reading is to enable a plan maintained by a organization to substitute for a plan both established and maintained by a church.and as a corollary to that point,the employees construction runs aground on the surplusage canon the presumption that each word congress uses is there for a reason.the employees read subparagraph c i as if it were missing the two words established and.this court,however,give s effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.williams taylor.
b both parties accounts of congress purpose in enacting subparagraph c i tend to confirm this court reading that plans maintained by organizations are eligible for the exemption,whatever their origins.according to the hospitals,congress wanted to ensure that churches and organizations received comparable treatment under erisa.if that is so,this court construction of the text fits congress objective to a t,as a requirement would necessarily disfavor plans created by church affiliates.the employees,by contrast,claim that subparagraph c i main goal was to bring within the exemption plans managed by local pension boards organizations often used by congregational denominations so as to ensure parity between congregational and hierarchical churches.but that account cuts against,not in favor of,their position.keeping the requirement would have prevented some plans run by pension boards the very entities the employees say congress most wanted to benefit from qualifying as church plans under erisa.

justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
the employee retirement income security act of erisa exempts church plan s from its regulation of employee benefit plans.stat,as amended,b.under the statute,certain plans for the employees of churches or nonprofits count as church plans even though not actually administered by a church.see c i.the question presented here is whether a church must have originally established such a plan for it to so qualify.erisa,we hold,does not impose that requirement.
petitioners identify themselves as three nonprofits that run hospitals and other healthcare facilities collectively,hospitals they offer pension plans to their employees.those plans were established by the hospitals themselves not by a church and are managed by internal committees.
erisa generally obligates private employers offering pension plans to adhere to an array of rules designed to ensure plan solvency and protect plan participants.see generally new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,cataloguing erisa reporting and disclosure mandates,participation and vesting requirements,and funding standards but in enacting the statute,congress made an important exception.c hurch plan s have never had to comply with erisa requirements.b.
the statutory definition of church plan came in two distinct phases.from the beginning,erisa provided that t he term church plan means a plan established and maintained for its employees by a church or by a convention or association of churches.a.then,in,congress amended the statute to expand that definition by deeming additional plans to fall within it.the amendment specified that for purposes of the definition,an employee of a church would include an employee of a organization like the hospitals here.c ii ii.and it added the provision whose effect is at issue in these cases 
a plan established and maintained for its employees by a church or by a convention or association of churches includes a plan maintained by an organization the principal purpose or function of which is the administration or funding of a plan or program for the provision of retirement benefits or welfare benefits,or both,for the employees of a church or a convention or association of churches,if such organization is controlled by or associated with a church or a convention or association of churches.c i.
that is a mouthful,for lawyers and alike to digest it more easily,note that everything after the word organization in the third line is just a description of a particular kind of entity which this opinion will call a organization.the main job of such an entity,as the statute explains,is to fund or manage a benefit plan for the employees of churches or per the amendment other part of church affiliates.
the three federal agencies responsible for administering erisa have long read those provisions,when taken together,to exempt plans like the hospitals from the statute mandates.the relevant agencies are the internal revenue service,department of labor,and pension benefit guaranty corporation.the original definitional provision a,or paragraph a for short defines a church plan as one established and maintained by a church not by a nonprofit.but according to the agencies,the later provision c i,or just subparagraph c i expands that definition to include any plan maintained by a organization,regardless of whether a church initially established the plan.and,the agencies believe,the internal benefits committee of a nonprofit counts as such an organization.see,irs general counsel memorandum,app.that interpretation has appeared in hundreds of private letter rulings and opinion letters issued since,including several provided to the hospitals here.see app.
the three cases before us are part of a recent wave of litigation challenging the agencies view.respondents,current and former employees of the hospitals,filed class actions alleging that their employers pension plans do not fall within erisa exemption and thus must satisfy the statute requirements.that is so,the employees claim,because those plans were not established by a church and erisa,even as amended,demands that all church plans have such an origin.according to the employees,the addition of subparagraph c i allowed organizations to maintain such plans in lieu of churches but that provision kept paragraph a insistence that churches themselves establish church plans.see,at.the district courts handling the cases agreed with the employees position,and therefore held that the hospitals plans must comply with erisa 
the courts of appeals for the third,seventh,and ninth circuits affirmed those decisions.the third circuit ruled first,concluding that erisa plain text requires that a pension plan be established by a church to qualify for the exemption.kaplan saint peter healthcare system.in the court view,paragraph a set out two requirements for the exemption establishment and maintenance and only the latter is expanded by the use of includes in subparagraph c i,at.the seventh and ninth circuits relied on similar reasoning to decide in the employees favor.see stapleton advocate health care network,rollins dignity health.
in light of the importance of the issue,this court granted certiorari.
the dispute in these cases about what counts as a church plan hinges on the combined meaning of paragraph a and subparagraph c i.interpretive purists may refer back as needed to the provisions as quoted above.see supra,at.but for those who prefer their statutes in comparatively form,those provisions go as follows 
under paragraph a,a church plan means a plan established and maintained by a church.
under subparagraph c i,a plan established and maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by a organization.
the parties agree that under those provisions,a church plan need not be maintained by a church it may instead be maintained by a organization.but the parties differ as to whether a plan maintained by that kind of organization must still have been established by a church to qualify for the exemption.the hospitals say no the effect of subparagraph c i was to bring within the definition all pension plans maintained by a organization,regardless of who first established them.the employees say yes subparagraph c i altered only the requirement that a pension plan be maintained by a church,while leaving intact the condition.we conclude that the hospitals have the better of the argument.
start,as we always do,with the statutory language here,a new definitional phrase on the one already existing.the term church plan,as just stated,initially mean t only a plan established and maintained by a church.but subparagraph c i provides that the original definitional phrase will now include another a plan maintained by a organization.that use of the word include is not literal any more than when congress says something like a state includes puerto rico and the district of columbia.see,rather,it tells readers that a different type of plan should receive the same treatment,an exemption as the type described in the old definition.and those newly favored plans,once again,are simply those maintained by a organization irrespective of their origins.in effect,congress provided that the new phrase can stand in for the old one as follows the term church plan means a plan established and maintained by a church a plan maintained by a organization.the condition thus drops out of the picture.
consider the same point in the form of a simple logic problem,with paragraph a and subparagraph c i as its first two steps 
premise a plan established and maintained by a church is an exempt church plan.
premise a plan established and maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by a organization.
deduction a plan maintained by a organization is an exempt church plan.
or,as one court put the point without any of the erisa terminology i f a is exempt,and a includes c,then c is exempt.overall ascension,supp,ed.just so.because congress deemed the category of plans established and maintained by a church to include plans maintained by organizations,those plans and all those plans are exempt from erisa requirements.
had congress wanted,as the employees contend,to alter only the maintenance requirement,it had an easy way to do so differing by only two words from the language it chose,but with an altogether different meaning.suppose congress had provided that a plan maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by a organization,leaving out the words established and from the first part of the sentence.that amendment would have accomplished exactly what the employees argue congress intended the language,that is,would have enabled a organization to take on the maintenance of a church plan,but left untouched the requirement that a church establish the plan in the first place.but congress did not adopt that ready alternative.instead,it added language whose most natural reading is to enable a plan maintained by a organization to substitute for a plan both established and maintained by a church.that drafting decision indicates that congress did not in fact want what the employees claim.see,lozano montoya alvarez,slip,at when legislators did not adopt obvious alternative language,the natural implication is that they did not intend the alternative.
a corollary to this point is that the employees construction runs aground on the surplusage canon the presumption that each word congress uses is there for a reason.see generally scalia garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts.as just explained,the employees urge us to read subparagraph c i as if it were missing the two words established and.the employees themselves do not contest that point they offer no account of what function that language would serve on their proposed interpretation.see brief for respondents.in essence,the employees ask us to treat those words as stray marks on a page notations that congress regrettably made but did not really intend.our practice,however,is to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.williams taylor,internal quotation marks omitted.and here,that means construing the words established and in subparagraph c i as removing,for plans run by organizations,paragraph a condition.
the employees primary argument to the contrary takes the form of a supposed interpretive principle i f a definition or rule has two criteria,and a further provision expressly modifies only one of them,that provision is understood to affect only the criterion it expands or modifies.brief for respondents.applied here,the employees explain,that principle requires us to read subparagraph c i as modify ing only the criterion in paragraph a that it expressly expands maintained,while leaving the other criterion established unchanged.at.the employees cite no precedent or other authority to back up their proposed rule of construction,but they offer a hypothetical to demonstrate its good sense,at.imagine,they say,that a statute provides free insurance to a person who is disabled and a veteran,and an amendment then states that a person who is disabled and a veteran includes a person who served in the national guard.ibid.quoting,at.would a member of the national guard be entitled to the insurance benefit surely not,the employees answer all of us would understand the includes provision to expand or clarify only the meaning of veteran leaving unchanged the requirement of a disability.and the same goes here,th
