bill wickersham and maureen doyle brought this action against the city of columbia and a nonprofit corporation known as the memorial day weekend salute to veterans corporation salute,seeking an injunction that would permit them to engage in expressive activities at salute memorial day air show at the municipal airport.the district court concluded that enforcement of the air show rules,which is carried out by city police on behalf of salute,violated the first amendment.it issued a permanent injunction against the city and salute requiring them to permit certain expressive activities at the annual event.the city does not appeal but salute does,arguing that it is not liable as a state actor for its speech restrictions and that the injunction violates its own first amendment right to be free from compelled speech.we affirm.
since salute has staged its annual memorial day weekend salute to veterans air show at the columbia regional airport.although the airport is owned by the city,the city gives salute control over the tarmac for the show.the two day event is free and open to the public,and tens of thousands of people attend each year.in addition to feats of aerial acrobatics performed by military planes,the event features static airplane displays,exhibits by military recruiters,and food on the airport secured tarmac.during the noontime hour each day there is a ceremony to honor fallen veterans at which the national anthem is played,the names of fallen boone county service members are read aloud,and the air show honored guests are introduced to the crowd.the stated purpose of the air show is to honor and remember service members,past and present.
a resolution passed by the columbia city council authorizes the city manager to execute a contract with salute for exclusive control of the airport during the event,subject to the city right to retake control in the event of an emergency salute does not pay for this use.during the remainder of the year the airport is controlled by the city,and the tarmac is not open to general public access.at the time the city began leasing the airport to salute for its annual event,the columbia city code provided that the city could make no lease or contract with any person that will impair the city control of the airport and its facilities.that ordinance was repealed in after commencement of this litigation.
salute is responsible for deciding on the content of the air show,including the schedule of events,the list of honored guests,and the exhibits that will be displayed.salute pays for liability insurance,the sound system,and the fees and incidental costs associated with the use of the military air craft.city personnel are responsible for operating the airport during salute air show,and salute president mary posner conceded that airport manager bill boston,a city employee,is absolutely essential to the event success.in the past few years,he has borne primary responsibility for developing the ground operations plan for the air show and has coordinated with the federal aviation administration to facilitate the air show compliance with federal regulations.numerous city officials participate in briefings in preparation for the air show.while salute receives a variety of services from the city at no charge,as authorized by the city council,it does not receive direct payment of public funds.
salute must apply to the department of defense dod to secure the involvement of the federal military aircraft that are displayed at the air show.on its application salute attests each year that the event is officially supported by local government,one of the requirements for access to the planes.it also states that the event will be open to the public,another dod condition for use of its planes.city manager raymond beck signs the application forms on behalf of the city.in the city listed the air show on its website under sections entitled guide to city services and public works provided for residents and businesses.salute includes a disclaimer in its media releases,stating that the air show is presented solely by salute and should not be referred to as the columbia air show or any other designation that would imply it is hosted,organized,or in any way sponsored by the city of columbia.the city contract with salute also states in no event shall the city and the corporation be deemed or construed to be joint venturers or partners.
salute imposes a number of restrictions on behavior at the air show,including limits on expressive activities.although the list of prohibited conduct differs slightly from time to time in its precise wording,it has included prohibitions against soliciting,petitioning,leafleting,political campaigning,and unauthorized signs.these rules are widely publicized and often appear on salute media releases about the air show.salute restrictions apply within the fenced tarmac area which is accessed through several gates.
columbia police officers provide security at the air show,and it is coordinated by captain michael martin.salute provides no reimbursement to the city for the officers time.captain martin has developed a security plan for the event each year which incorporates salute restrictions on expressive activity.posner testified in her deposition that she had no personal role in developing the security plan,but that salute gave directions to the police department about which activities were to be prohibited.the version of martin security plan stated that n o protests are permitted inside the tarmac fence.an interoffice memorandum was also circulated in to instruct police officers about their role in enforcing salute speech restrictions.it included the following 
protesters are likely at the show should protesters attempt to enter the premises,officers will immediately advise the command center and will stop their forward progress.officers will advise them of the area being private property and of the restrictions related to carrying signs,seeking signatures to petitions,or demonstrating.any person who persists in entering will be given a trespass warning prior to arrest.keep in mind that persons are not restricted from entering,only those who intend to conduct a protest once entry is made.
police officers are instructed to have their police identification badges visible at all times during the event.
captain martin stated in his deposition that the air show was the only event for which he could recall being asked to enforce a private organization speech restrictions.he stated that salute president mary posner was the final arbiter of what constituted unwanted protest at the event.he testified further that if she were ever to ask him to remove someone on account of that person race,he would readily comply.
in appellee maureen doyle attempted to distribute antiwar fliers inside the secured tarmac.a columbia police officer confronted her and stated that she would be arrested if she continued to hand out leaflets.soon more officers arrived,and one grabbed leaflets out of her hands.doyle then left the air show.at that same air show,appellee bill wickersham attempted to collect signatures inside the fenced tarmac area on an initiative advocating renewable energy.he was approached by a police officer and advised to cease petitioning.when he refused,the police officer took him to the department command post at the air show and issued him a trespass warning.after posner directed that he be arrested for first degree trespassing,the police arrested him at the show but he was never prosecuted.
wickersham and doyle brought this action against salute and the city of columbia under,seeking injunctive relief permitting them to distribute leaflets,circulate petitions,and engage in other expressive activities at future air shows.they alleged violations of their first amendment rights to free expression,characterizing the air show as a public forum.they argued that although salute was a private corporation,it was a state actor in its imposition of restrictions on free speech given the degree of joint participation between salute and the city in staging the air show and enforcing the restrictions.they also claimed that by granting salute complete discretion to determine who was arrested at the air show,the city had ceded a public function to salute.
during discovery plaintiffs produced evidence about the joint activity of salute and the city in staging the air show.among the depositions they took were those of mary posner of salute and captain martin.captain martin testified that the police department was responsible for enforcing salute speech restrictions as part of the city agreement to lease salute the property,and posner testified that the police discharged this enforcement responsibility on salute behalf.
on may,the district court granted a temporary injunction permitting plaintiffs to distribute leaflets and wear expressive clothing at the air show,but not allowing them to circulate petitions or engage in other forms of solicitation.it found that salute was a state actor because of the degree to which the city and salute were intertwined in the staging of the air show.the court also found that the city had delegated a public function to salute by giving posner control over the police during the air show.subsequent to the court order and prior to the air show,salute wrote to the police department disavowing any delegation of police authority and stating that salute will play no role in the exercise of authority and discretion by the city police 
at the air show,leafleting and expressive clothing were permitted as required by the temporary injunction sign carrying was also allowed even though it had not been specifically addressed in the order.at a subsequent deposition,captain martin testified that no one had tried to circulate petitions at the event but that he would have stopped anyone who did,not because such activity violated a city ordinance,but because salute disapproved it and it was not protected by the temporary injunction.a handful of individuals were present inside the secured tarmac at the event to hand out leaflets or carry signs.martin observed no disturbances caused by their presence at the air show.several members of the public did submit written complaints to salute about the presence of protestors on the tarmac.one individual handed out commercial leaflets advertising a nearby restaurant,and posner later testified that she was concerned that there would be more commercial leafleting at future shows.
on march,after additional depositions and hearings had occurred and evidence about the air show had been produced,the district court issued a permanent injunction.the injunction incorporated its earlier may,order by reference.as a predicate to its first amendment analysis,the district court once again found salute to be a state actor when it enforced its speech restrictions against plaintiffs,because it was entangled with the city in planning the air show and monitoring unwanted expressive activities.it also held the city accountable for the direct role of the police in enforcing the speech restrictions.
the court concluded that the air show was a non public forum in which salute as a state actor could impose reasonable and neutral regulations without offending the first amendment,but that a blanket prohibition on leafleting and sign carrying was neither reasonable nor viewpoint neutral.it found that salute prohibition on petitioning was permissible,however,because it was both reasonable and uniformly enforced.the district court ordered salute and the city to permit leafleting,sign carrying,and the wearing of expressive clothing at future air shows subject to reasonable restrictions on time,place,and manner.the court also gave special consideration to salute noontime ceremony at the show,ordering that salute could restrict expressive activities at that daily event and the city could lawfully remove individuals who did not respect those restrictions.the court rejected salute argument that it had a first amendment right to exclude all unwanted forms of expression at its air show,questioning whether a state actor like salute had first amendment rights.even if it did,the court reasoned,the presence of other messages on the tarmac would not interfere with such rights.
salute appeals from the final judgment,contesting the district court conclusion that it was a state actor and arguing that the injunction violates its own first amendment rights by forcing it to provide a forum for messages it does not support.although the city of columbia is also subject to the court injunction,it has not appealed.
generally a district court conclusions of law are reviewed de novo and its findings of fact,for clear error.see doe pulaski county special sch,cir en banc.where the first amendment is implicated,however,we make an independent examination of the whole record in assessing the factual predicates of the free speech claim.id.quoting new york times sullivan,d.we nevertheless continue to apply a clear error standard to facts not directly related to the first amendment issue,see doe,at,including the factual predicates to the state action inquiry.see howerton gabica,cir.
the first amendment guarantee of free speech guards against abridgment through state action alone.it does not inhibit private restrictions on speech.hudgens nlrb,d.in certain circumstances the government may become so entangled in private conduct that the deed of an ostensibly private organization or individual is to be treated as if a state had caused it to be performed.brentwood acad.secondary sch.ath.ass n,d.
to ascertain whether there is state action in a case,we examine the record to determine whether the conduct at issue is fairly attributable to the state.montano hedgepeth,cir quoting lugar edmondson oil,d.we are guided in this inquiry by two additional queries whether the claimed deprivation resulted from the exercise of a right or privilege having its source in state authority and whether the party engaging in the deprivation may be appropriately characterized as a state actor.see lugar,at.internal quotations omitted.since salute authority to impose speech restrictions at its air show derives from the city grant to it of temporary control over the airport,lugar first prerequisite for state action is met.see united auto workers gaston festivals,cir grant of permit to hold festival satisfies first lugar inquiry.the key issue is whether salute may appropriately be considered a state actor in the circumstances presented.if a party conduct meets the requirements for state action,the same acts also qualify as actions taken under color of state law for purposes of.lugar,at.
the supreme court has recognized a number of circumstances in which a private party may be characterized as a state actor,such as where the state has delegated to a private party a power traditionally exclusively reserved to the state,see jackson metro.edison,d,where a private actor is a willful participant in joint activity with the state or its agents,see adickes kress,d,and where there is pervasive entwinement between the private entity and the state,see brentwood,at.these particular circumstances are merely examples and not intended to be exclusive.see id.at.
our ultimate conclusion must turn on the particular facts of the case,since o nly by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the nonobvious involvement of the state in private conduct be attributed its true significance.burton wilmington parking,d.the one unyielding requirement is that there be a close nexus not merely between the state and the private party,but between the state and the alleged deprivation itself.see brentwood,at.no such nexus exists where a private party acts with the mere approval or acquiescence of the state,see blum yaretsky,d,but a private entity may be considered a state actor if it has acted together with or has obtained significant aid from state officials in furtherance of the challenged action.lugar,at.
salute argues that this case is governed by our decision in reinhart city of brookings,cir.in reinhart,we held that the actions of a private organization in restricting political campaigning at its arts festival could not be attributed to the city,even though the festival took place in a public park.the fact that a city allows a privat
