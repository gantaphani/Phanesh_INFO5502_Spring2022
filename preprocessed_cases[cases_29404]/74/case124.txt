introduction 
in this case we must determine whether code of civil procedure section the statutory provision authorizing limited discovery of a defendant insurance coverage information,authorizes pretrial discovery of a nonparty liability insurer reinsurance agreements for purposes of facilitating settlement of an underlying tort action.we conclude that it does not.
as will further be explained,there may be unusual circumstances in which a reinsurance agreement is functioning in the same way as a liability policy fronting arrangement,or where the reinsurance agreement is itself the subject matter of the litigation at hand,coverage action between liability insurer and its reinsurer.in such instances,discovery of such agreements would be appropriate.in this matter,however,there is no evidence that any reinsurance agreements for which pretrial discovery was being sought fall within those narrow exceptions.
the judgment of the court of appeal,which interpreted section consistently with the views expressed herein,shall accordingly be affirmed.
facts and procedural background 
the roman catholic archdiocese of san diego is the principal defendant in an action brought by approximately persons plaintiffs for alleged childhood abuse by certain priests.those cases,along with others involving the san bernardino archdiocese,are known collectively as clergy cases ii,and were coordinated within the los angeles county superior court with claims against dioceses from other parts of california.
in september,pursuant to a stipulated order regarding settlement and mediation proceedings,the trial court issued an initial case management order which,among other things,directed the roman catholic archdiocese of san diego church to turn over copies of all insurance policies that might provide coverage for plaintiffs claims.petitioner catholic mutual relief society is a nonprofit corporation that administers a fund for more than three hundred archdioceses and other catholic church entities in the united states and canada,including the san diego archdiocese.the catholic mutual relief society is not an insurance company,but its wholly owned subsidiary,petitioner catholic relief insurance company of america,is the church liability insurer 
in compliance with the case management order,the church produced copies of its liability insurance policies issued by petitioners.plaintiffs contended this information was insufficient.according to plaintiffs,they also need to know whether petitioners were financially sound enough to cover their policy obligations.in april,in an attempt to resolve the matter informally,the trial court allowed plaintiffs to serve on petitioners a series of interrogatories aimed at obtaining the desired information petitioners objected to those questions on grounds that the questions sought information concerning their financial condition,reserves,and reinsurance agreements,none of which was relevant for discovery purposes or was otherwise nondiscoverable that much of the material sought was privileged that the requests were overbroad and ambiguous and that the trial court lacked authority to require interrogatory responses from nonparty insurers.
on may,the settlement judge issued an order permitting plaintiffs to serve deposition subpoenas on petitioners in an attempt to secure the information requested by plaintiffs interrogatories.the subpoenas sought broad categories of financial documents,including a request for all writings reflecting the total amount of funds available from reinsurance to satisfy any defense expenses or indemnify losses in connection with sexual abuse claims against the church.
petitioners moved to quash the subpoenas,arguing that to the extent the document requests sought information about the overall strength of petitioners financial condition,they were not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and were therefore beyond the permissible scope of discovery.the settlement judge denied the motions to quash,finding that the subpoena at determining whether petitioners were financially able to pay any judgment that might be entered against their clearly relevant and discoverable to inform and facilitate settlement.
petitioners sought a writ of mandate from the court of appeal to vacate the settlement judge order.the court of appeal granted relief,concluding the documents and information sought were not discoverable under either the general statutory discovery provision or the specific provision authorizing limited discovery of insurance information as a matter of right.the court found that section was intended to reach only a defendant direct insurer,not that insurer reinsurance agreements.
we granted review of the issue framed by plaintiffs as follows whether the california rule that has permitted discovery of the existence and extent of liability insurance laddon superior court d,allows discovery of reinsurance information that is critical to determine the nature and limits of coverage that may be available to satisfy a judgment as set forth in california code of civil procedure section.
discussion 
plaintiffs sought broad pretrial discovery of financial information regarding the assets and overall financial health of petitioners insurance operations.petitioners are not parties to the consolidated actions below.the information requested included total funds and reserves available to settle claims,satisfy judgments,and indemnify defense expenses in connection with sexual abuse claims brought against the catholic church and its numerous dioceses nationwide.the information was sought for the exclusive purpose of informing and facilitating pretrial settlement of the such claims brought against the roman catholic archdiocese of san diego in the consolidated litigation.
in this state pretrial discovery in a civil action is governed by the civil discovery act.code of civ,et former et.as a general matter,information is discoverable if it is relevant to the subject matter of an action and,additionally,is either admissible in evidence or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.the court of appeal concluded none of the broad financial information sought from these nonparty insurers in connection with potential settlement of the underlying sexual abuse claims was relevant or discoverable on a showing of good cause under section.plaintiffs have not challenged that aspect of the court of appeal holding on review.instead,plaintiffs sought review only of the specific question whether section,which authorizes limited discovery of a defendant liability insurance coverage as a matter of right,likewise authorizes discovery of the nonparty liability insurer reinsurance agreements,assertedly for purposes of facilitating pretrial settlement of underlying tort claims.
evidence of a tort defendant liability insurance is generally unrelated to a party claims or defenses at trial hence the common law rule has long been that such insurance coverage evidence is inadmissible at trial.laddon superior court,supra,d,laddon pettie superior court d.pettie.the rule is codified in evidence code section,which provides that e vidence that a person was,at the time a harm was suffered by another,insured wholly or partially against loss arising from liability for that harm is inadmissible to prove negligence or other wrongdoing.
section nonetheless creates a statutory exception that allows limited discovery of a defendant liability insurance coverage as a matter of right that is to say,without the need for a threshold showing of relevancy and admissibility as is required under the general discovery statute,section.under section,a party is entitled to discover the existence and contents of any agreement under which any insurance carrier may be liable to satisfy in whole or in part a judgment that may be entered in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.this discovery may include the identity of the carrier and the nature and limits of the coverage.a party may also obtain discovery as to whether that insurance carrier is disputing the agreement coverage of the claim involved in the action,but not as to the nature and substance of that dispute.
plaintiffs argue that the plain language of section authorizes discovery of reinsurance agreements.they point out that the section specifically permits discovery of any agreement under which any insurance carrier may be liable to satisfy a judgment or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.
before examining the controlling language of section,it will be helpful to briefly consider some fundamental differences between liability insurance and reinsurance.
as defined by statute,insurance is a contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another against loss,damage,or liability arising from a contingent or unknown event.the purpose of liability insurance is to protect the insured against losses from contingent or unknown risks of harm.waller truck ins.exchange cal th,d.
one distinguishing characteristic of liability insurance derives from insurance code section,which requires every policy of liability insurance to expressly state that a plaintiff who obtains a judgment against a defendant insured under such a policy is then entitled to bring an action directly against the liability insurer to recover the policy benefits.section effectively makes an injured plaintiff who obtains a final judgment against a tort defendant a third party beneficiary of the defendant liability insurance policy.shafer berger,kahn,shafton,moss,figler,simon gladstone th,d.as a result of the statute,a potential contractual relationship arises between the liability insurer and any third party who might be injured by its insured under the terms of coverage of the liability policy,which the common law in turn has long recognized gives the injured party a discoverable interest in the existence and terms of the defendant liability insurance coverage.superior ins.superior court cal d,pettie,supra,d at.laddon,supra,d at.section does not list reinsurance,or any other form of insurance other than liability insurance,as coming within its purview,subd.a.nor is there any corresponding california common law rule extending this limited right of discovery to reinsurance agreements 
in contrast to liability insurance,a contract of reinsurance is one by which an insurer procures a third person to insure him against loss or liability by reason of such original insurance,added.a reinsurance is presumed to be a contract of indemnity against liability,and not merely against damage.because a contract of reinsurance is defined by statute as a contract of indemnity made for the benefit of the liability insurer,as a general matter it has no relevance in an underlying tort action brought against an insured under the policy of liability insurance.indeed,the insurance code expressly provides that t he original insured has no interest in a contract of reinsurance,italics added.
reinsurance is a special form of insurance obtained by insurance companies to help spread the burden of indemnification.a reinsurance company typically contracts with an insurance company to cover a specified portion of the insurance company obligation to indemnify a policyholder this excess insurance enables the insurance companies to write more policies than their reserves would otherwise sustain since it guarantees the ability to pay a part of all claims.the reinsurance contract is not with the.when a valid claim is made,the insurance company pays the first level insured,and the reinsurance company pays the insurance company.the reinsurance company obligation is to the insurance company,and the insurance company the reinsurer is thus the insured,or more appropriately,the reinsured.ascherman general reinsurance d,fn,quoting excess cas.reinsurance ass insurance com r,cir.
an essential feature of reinsurance is that it does not alter the terms,conditions or provisions of the contract of liability insurance between the direct liability insurer and its insured the tort defendant.lipton,supra,th at,d.the amounts of policy limits directly available to respond to the underlying judgment are not increased by the existence of reinsurance agreements.in other words,a reinsurance agreement does not answer to liability for the underlying third party tort claim.there is no privity of contract between a reinsurer and the insured under the liability policy or the plaintiff who obtains a final judgment and becomes a judgment creditor under the the reinsurer becomes a direct party to a bad faith or similar action.whereas primary liability insurers have a duty to investigate claims and defend lawsuits tendered to them by their insureds see transport indem.cal th,d,reinsurers have no comparable duties to investigate or defend claims between third parties and the underlying liability insurers or their insureds,nor do they owe any duty of good faith and fair dealing to the original insureds,unless the reinsurance agreement somehow specifically so provides.see,american ins.comm of the state of.
with these distinctions between liability insurance and reinsurance in mind,we turn to plaintiffs argument that the plain language of section is broad enough to encompass discovery of reinsurance agreements.in seeking to ascertain the legislature intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law in re cal th,d,we start with the statutory language.wilcox birtwhistle cal th,d.if the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature ibid.
as noted,section provides,in pertinent part,a party may obtain discovery of the existence and contents of any agreement under which any insurance carrier may be liable to satisfy in whole or in part a judgment that may be entered in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.this discovery may include the identity of the carrier and the nature and limits of the coverage.a party may also obtain discovery as to whether that insurance carrier is disputing the agreement coverage of the claim involved in the action,but not as to the nature and substance of that dispute 
reinsurance arguably falls within this language because it is an agreement whereby the reinsurer agrees to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.nonetheless,considering the language of section as a whole,we find the statute ambiguous on the point.
the term any insurance carrier in section is qualified by the circumstance that the carrier may be liable to satisfy in whole or in part a judgment that may be entered in the action.a liability carrier,as explained,may become contractually to its insured defendant and to the injured plaintiff who obtains a final judgment against the defendant and thereby becomes a third party beneficiary under the defendant liability insurance satisfy a judgment entered in the action.ibid.a reinsurance carrier,on the other hand,is not directly liable to satisfy a judgment entered in the action,and makes no payments to either the insured defendant or the successful plaintiff,although the reinsurer may ultimately make payments to the liability insurer to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.ibid.put differently,the liability insurer is directly liable to satisfy the judgment in the underlying action with respect to the parties,whereas a reinsurer is only derivatively liable to indemnify or reimburse ibid.the liability insurer for payments made in satisfaction of the underlying judgment.we find the statute use of the terminology satisfy the judgment ibid.ambiguous in this regard.
there is further ambiguity created by the statutory language of section to the extent it provides,a party may also obtain discovery as to whether that insurance carrier is disputing the agreement coverage of the claim involved in the action,but not as to the nature and substance of that dispute.italics added.the only insurance carrier in a position to dispute its insurance agreement coverage of the claim involved in the action ibid.is the liability insurance carrier that issued a policy or policies of liability insurance intended to provide third party liability coverage to the insured defendant,waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.reinsurance contracts and agreements,in contrast,do not serve that are defined by statute as contracts of indemnity made for the benefit of the direct insurer,and in which t he original insured,the tort plaintiff has no interest.hence,to the extent the term that insurance carrier in the quoted passage refers to the same insurance carrier referenced elsewhere in the language of section,all such references must be to liability insurance carriers.when used in a statute words must be construed in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.citations.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.
in sum,section neither expressly includes nor expressly excludes reinsurance agreements.moreover,the statutory language is ambiguous because it leaves unclear whether the section is intended to authorize only discovery of liability insurance coverage.to the extent a statutory text is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we will consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.wilcox birtwhistle,supra,cal th at,d,quoting people woodhead cal d.elsner uveges cal th,d,fn.omitted.accordingly,we turn to the legislative history of section to assist us in ascertaining the legislature intent.
the text of section was originally enacted as part of the civil discovery act of.former et the committee analyses of the civil discovery act uniformly reflect an intent to authorize limited discovery of liability insurance coverage,but evince no similar intent with respect to a nonparty insurer reinsurance agreements.see off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,the bill would generally permit discovery of any unprivileged matter relevant to the subject matter of the action.it would specifically permit discovery of liability insurance without expressly precluding discovery of the application for insurance,italics added com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended july,same assem d reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,same assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,same.

the legislative history,context,and purpose of section all suggest the section was specifically intended to authorize limited discovery of a defendant liability insurance coverage.such was the rule at the time section predecessor,former section b,was adopted.under the common law,plaintiffs were afforded limited discovery of a defendant liability insurance coverage as a result of a plaintiff right,under insurance code section,to proceed directly against the liability insurer as a judgment creditor to satisfy his or her judgment.superior ins.superior court,supra,cal d at,see also pettie,supra,d at.laddon,supra,d at.
as a general rule,u nless expressly provided,statutes should not be interpreted to alter the common law,and should be construed to avoid conflict with common law rules.citation.a statute will be construed in light of common law decisions,unless its language clearly and unequivocally discloses an intention to depart from,alter,or abrogate the rule concerning the particular subject matter california of health facilities department of health services cal th,d.nothing in the language or legislative history of former section b now discloses an intention to extend the scope of the limited discovery right beyond primary liability insurance policies to reinsurance agreements.
the availability and extent of a defendant liability insurance coverage is important information that plaintiffs are clearly entitled to discover under section.the presence or absence of liability insurance is frequently the controlling factor in determining the manner in which a case is prepared for trial.pettie,supra,d at.a nonparty insurer reinsurance information,in contrast,would not be of any relevance to plaintiffs in the vast majority of cases.as we have explained,an essential feature of the reinsurance contract is that it does not alter the terms,conditions or provisions of the contract of liability insurance between the direct liability insurer and its insured.lipton,supra,th at,d.the amounts of liability insurance policy limits directly available to respond to the underlying judgment are not increased by the existence of a liability insurer reinsurance agreements.
permitting discovery of nonparty insurers reinsurance agreements as a matter of course under section could also lead to burdensome discovery requests directed at entities that are not even parties to the litigation.amici curiae certain underwriters at lloyd,london,and certain london market insurance and reinsurance companies,explain that they have a direct interest in the outcome of this litigation insofar as certain of their members are reinsurers of petitioner catholic relief insurance company.they urge that,if section allows any plaintiff in a tort action to obtain not only insurance policies but also any and all reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance,second level reinsurance contracts,the burden on nonparty insurers would be enormous with respect to risks subscribed to by london market insurers,locating and producing every reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance agreement for hundreds of syndicates in any tort action would be an incredible burden to place even on a party,much less a nonparty.each syndicate may have a number of reinsurances and each reinsurance may have multiple subscribers.it seems highly unlikely the legislature intended such a result.as this court has observed,it is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.younger superior court cal d.
the language of section allows for discovery of the existence and contents of liability insurance policies that may be available to satisfy a judgment,not the assets of the insurance companies providing the insurance.reinsurance is an asset of a liability insurer,just as capital reserves are,and nothing in prior case law,legislative history,or the statutory language suggests that either the common law right to discover insurance information or section authorizes broad discovery of the financial health of the liability insurer or its ability to meet its contractual obligations under its policies.
we acknowledge there may be limited circumstances under which a liability insurer reinsurance agreements will be directly on the risk to satisfy a judgment in an underlying tort action in the same way as the defendant liability insurance coverage itself.one example is when a liability insurer is fronting for a reinsurer who is the defacto primary insurer.see venetsanos zucker,facher zucker.here,however,plaintiffs have not made a credible claim that a fronting arrangement exists.although insurance industry data that is public information reflects that petitioner catholic relief insurance company utilizes reinsurance agreements to manage its risks,there is no indication in the record that it has ceded control to its reinsurers of its functions as a primary liability insurer,including the investigation and settlement of claims under policies it has issued,and plaintiffs do not appear to contend otherwise.in those unusual circumstances in which a reinsurance agreement is functioning in the same way as a liability policy fronting arrangement,or where the reinsurance agreement is itself the subject matter of the litigation at hand,coverage action between the liability insurer and its reinsurer,discovery of such agreements would be appropriate.in this matter,however,there is no evidence that any reinsurance agreements for which pretrial discovery was being sought fall within those narrow exceptions.
in compliance with the case management order,defendant church furnished plaintiffs with copies of its liability insurance policies issued by petitioners,as required by section.the statute did not further require petitioners,as the church nonparty liability insurer and its corporate parent,to furnish plaintiffs additional discovery of all reinsurance agreements entered into by petitioners with nonparty reinsurers.
conclusion 
the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed,and the matter remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.
i respectfully dissent.code of civil procedure section unambiguously provides for discovery of reinsurance policies,by including any agreement under which any insurance carrier may be liable to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.the majority detects an ambiguity in the satisfy the judgment term,because a reinsurer is derivatively rather than directly liable,ante,at,d at,at.however,the legislature has chosen terminology that expressly includes derivative liability.the obligation to indemnify or reimburse easily encompasses the duty assumed by reinsurers.
the majority finds further ambiguity in the third sentence of section a party may also obtain discovery as to whether that insurance carrier is disputing the agreement coverage of the claim involved in the action,but not as to the nature and substance of that dispute.according to the majority,only the defendant liability insurer is in a position to dispute coverage,ante,at,d at,at.this is not the case reinsurers can and do argue that their policies do not cover the claim involved in the action.see,royal ins.of liverpool,england caledonian ins.of edinburgh,scotland cal,fireman fund ins.aachen munich fire ins,travelers cas.sur.gerling global reinsurance of america cir,national american ins.of california certain underwriters at lloyd london cir.and as a matter of logic,the additional statutory authorization for discovery of coverage disputes does not make the broad terms of the section opening sentence ambiguous.a ny agreement under which any insurance carrier may be liable includes reinsurance,whether or not coverage is contested.
