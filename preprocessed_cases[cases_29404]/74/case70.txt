nonprofit organizations americans for prosperity foundation and thomas more law center challenge the attorney general of california collection of internal revenue service irs form schedule b,which contains identifying information for their major donors.they argue the nonpublic disclosure requirement is unconstitutional as applied to them because it impermissibly burdens first amendment rights to free speech and association by deterring individuals from financially supporting them.the district court entered preliminary injunctions preventing the attorney general from demanding the plaintiffs schedule b forms pending a trial on the merits.we have jurisdiction under,and we vacate the injunctions with instructions to enter new orders preliminarily enjoining the attorney general from publicly disclosing,but not from collecting,the plaintiffs schedule b forms.
california supervision of trustees and fundraisers for charitable purposes act charitable purposes act requires the attorney general to maintain a registry of charitable trusts and authorizes her to obtain whatever information,copies of instruments,reports,and records are needed for the establishment and maintenance of the registry.cal.gov t code.an organization must maintain membership in the registry to solicit donations from california residents,see id,and as one condition of membership,the attorney general requires each organization to annually submit the complete irs form schedule b,see regs.tit.schedule b,which a charitable organization files with the irs,lists the names and addresses of persons who have given or more to the organization during the preceding year.
the attorney general schedule b disclosure requirement seeks only nonpublic disclosure of these forms,and she seeks them solely to assist her in enforcing charitable organization laws and ensuring that charities in the registry are not engaging in unfair business practices.see ctr.for competitive politics harris,cir.the attorney general does not assert any state interest in public disclosure of schedule b forms.to the contrary,her longstanding policy of treating schedule b forms as confidential,as well as her proposed regulation formalizing that policy,confirm that the state has no interest in public disclosure this regime is readily distinguishable from state requirements mandating public disclosure such as those often found in the regulation of elections that are intended to inform the public and promote transparency.see,john doe reed,buckley valeo,family pac mckenna,cir.
we are bound by our holding in center for competitive politics,at,that the attorney general nonpublic schedule b disclosure regime is facially constitutional.compelled disclosure requirements are evaluated under exacting scrutiny,which requires the strength of the governmental interest to reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on a plaintiff first amendment rights.see id.at.in that case,brought as a facial challenge,we held the attorney general authority to demand and collect charitable organizations schedule b forms falls within her general subpoena power and furthers california compelling interest in enforcing its laws.id.at.applying exacting scrutiny,we rejected the facial challenge to the disclosure requirement because the plaintiff failed to show it placed an actual burden on first amendment rights.see id.at.we left open the possibility,however,that a future litigant might show a reasonable probability that the compelled disclosure of its contributors names will subject them to threats,harassment,or reprisals from either government officials or private parties that would warrant relief on an challenge.id.at alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.
the plaintiffs here,two charitable organizations engaged in advocacy some may consider controversial,argue they have made such a showing.they contend disclosure to the state will infringe first amendment rights by deterring donors from associating with and financially supporting them,and therefore that the attorney general should be enjoined from collecting their schedule b forms,even for nonpublic use in enforcing the law.
the district court preliminarily enjoined the attorney general from demanding and enforcing her demand for irs form schedule b from the plaintiffs the attorney general has appealed these orders.
we review the district court grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion,reviewing findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.see id.at.reversal for clear error is warranted when the district court factual determination is illogical,implausible or lacks support in inferences that may be drawn from facts in the record.see united states hinkson,cir en banc.a court may grant a preliminary injunction when a party shows serious questions going to the merits of its claim,a balance of hardships that tips sharply in its favor,a likelihood of irreparable harm and that an injunction is in the public interest.see all.for the wild rockies cottrell,cir.
the plaintiffs argue the attorney general must be enjoined from demanding and collecting their schedule b forms on two theories.first,they argue confidential disclosure to her office itself chills protected conduct or would lead to persecution and harassment of their donors by the state or the public.second,they argue that,notwithstanding her voluntary policy against disclosing schedule b forms to the public,the attorney general may change her policy or be compelled to release the forms under california law,and that the resulting public disclosure will lead to harassment of their donors by members of the public,chilling protected conduct.we address these theories in turn.
a.the district court abused its discretion by enjoining the attorney general from collecting the plaintiffs schedule b forms for law enforcement use.
neither plaintiff has shown anything more than broad allegations or subjective fears that confidential disclosure to the attorney general will chill participation or result in harassment of its donors by the state or the public.dole serv.emps.union,local,cir quoting mclaughlin serv.emps.union,local,cir internal quotation mark omitted.the district court abused its discretion by enjoining the attorney general from demanding the plaintiffs schedule b forms given the absence of evidence showing confidential disclosure would cause actual harm.see ctr.for competitive politics,at n o case has ever held or implied that a disclosure requirement in and of itself constitutes first amendment injury.see also park vill.apartment tenants ass mortimer howard trust,cir explaining that an overbroad injunction is an abuse of discretion.to the extent the district court found actual chilling or a reasonable probability of harassment from confidential disclosure to the attorney general,those findings are clearly erroneous.
first,the plaintiffs have not shown the demand for nonpublic disclosure of their schedule b forms to the attorney general has actually chilled protected conduct or would be likely to do so.see ctr.for competitive politics,at finding no actual burden on first amendment rights.notably,neither plaintiff has alleged that annual disclosure of schedule b forms to the irs had any chilling effect.americans for prosperity foundation proffered a declaration from its vice president for development asserting its donors worry that disclosure to the attorney general will lead to their own persecution at the hands of state officials.the declaration,however,does not show that any donor has declined,or would decline,to support the foundation as a result of this worry.no evidence supports the district court conclusion that donors have expressed their unwillingness to continue to participate if such limited disclosure to the attorney general is made.
thomas more law center evidence similarly fails to show its donors have been or would be chilled from contributing by the attorney general mere collection of schedule b forms.the declaration from its president and chief counsel states only that donors would be deterred from donating if exposed to the type of harassment the law center incurs for its public activities,bu
