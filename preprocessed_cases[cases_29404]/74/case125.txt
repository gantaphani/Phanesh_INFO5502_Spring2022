the county of los angeles county appeals from the judgment in favor of jewish community centers development corporation jcc on its property tax refund action based on the welfare exemption set forth in revenue and taxation code section the county contends that the trial court erred by not deferring to an advisory rule of the state board of equalization sbe interpreting section to mean that both the owner and third party operator of a property used for charitable purposes must file claims for welfare exemptions which would trigger a requirement that both the owner and operator also seek and obtain organizational clearance certificates in the singular,occ before an owner can be exempt from property taxes.in the alternative,the county contends that the sbe advisory rules must be followed if they are reasonable and do not conflict with the governing statutes or regulations.according to the county,the trial court should have found against jcc because,even though it filed a claim for a welfare exemption and had an occ,the third party operator of its property did not possess an occ.switching to a separate matter,the county contends that the trial court should have determined that jcc waived its welfare exemption because it did not file its claims in a timely manner,and because it failed to check a certain box on the claim forms it filed with the county assessor.
we conclude that the sbe interpretation of section was clearly erroneous.while the statutory and regulatory scheme required jcc to file a claim for a welfare exemption as well as a claim for an occ,it imposed no other conditions,it did not require the third party operator of jcc property to also file a claim for a welfare exemption and obtain an occ.also,we conclude that the sbe advisory rule regarding who must file a welfare exemption is not binding and therefore should not be given independent legal effect.finally,we conclude that the county failed to establish that the trial court should have denied a tax refund because jcc claims were tardy and its claim forms were incomplete.
based on the foregoing,we find no error and affirm.
jcc is an entity qualifying for tax exempt status under section c of the internal revenue code and it is a california nonprofit public benefit corporation.no part of its earnings enured to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.at all relevant times,it owned the property located at burbank,sherman oaks,california property.the property was operated as valley cities jewish community center the community center.
in,for a year,jcc leased the property to friends of valley cities jewish community center friends.friends,a california nonprofit public benefit corporation,took over and operated the community center.
during,friends initiated the process of applying for an occ but did not submit the required documents.
the county issued tax bills to jcc,which it did not pay.on july,jcc sold the property and paid the outstanding taxes,penalties and interest.
in,jcc obtained an occ retroactive to and filed tax refund claims based on the welfare exemption in section for property that is owned and used for charitable purposes.in the claim forms for the fiscal years,and,jcc did not check the box indicating that t he property is used for the actual operation of the exempt activity.the county assessor denied the claims solely because friends did not have an occ.this ruling was based on an advisory rule in the assessor handbook handbook in which the sbe interpreted section and advised assessors that both an owner and operator of a property must file claims for welfare exemptions,and that any organization seeking a welfare exemption must file a claim for an occ.
jcc filed a complaint for a tax refund.
in the county trial brief,it argued that jcc was not entitled to an exemption because friends did not have an occ and that,in any event,jcc waived the exemption because the claim forms it filed with the county assessor failed to aver that the property is used for the actual operation of the exempt activity.
the matter proceeded to a bench trial.certain facts and exhibits were agreed to and set forth by stipulation.
after closing arguments,the trial court stated the main issue for the court is one of statutory interpretation.and it a fact that friends did not have an occ,is that conclusive regarding certain preliminary issues,i believe it undisputed,if not,the court finds that jcc is the claimant in the case.the parties have stipulated that the sole basis for the rejection of jcc claim for property tax reimbursement is that friends did not have an occ.therefore,in a real sense,whether or not friends or jcc is a charitable organization or otherwise falls under the requirements of section is really not an issue before the court.that was the basis for the rejection of the reimbursement.nonetheless,should it become an issue,the court does find that both jcc and friends are charitable organizations and so the property was operated and used for charitable purposes.
the trial court determined that the handbook was advisory and the statements contained in it did not have the force of law.it then concluded that jcc was a claimant under section and entitled to a refund.
judgment was entered for jcc.it stated,inter alia,jcc shall recover from the county the sum of,with interest thereon at the rate of per annum this amount is based on jcc only having an occ for the fiscal tax year and.despite a claim for refund and recovery dating to,jcc was not issued a valid occ for.
this timely appeal followed.

interpretation of section and other parts of the statutory scheme effect of the handbook.

a.the rules of statutory interpretation.
when interpreting a statute,a court aim is to ascertain the intent of the legislature and thereby effectuate the law purpose.if the language is clear and unambiguous,the court presumes that the legislature meant what it said and the inquiry ends.but if the statute is ambiguous,it is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,the court may use a variety of extrinsic aids.for example,it may consider the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.in addition,the court may consider the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.california ins.guarantee workers comp.appeals bd.th,in re social services payment cases th.
courts owe a degree of deference to the sbe interpretation of a statute.holland assessment appeals bd.cal th.such deference is warranted because the agency will often be interpreting a statute within its administrative jurisdiction and may possess special familiarity with satellite legal and regulatory issues.citation.the degree to which judicial deference to an agency interpretation is appropriate is fundamentally situational and will depend on the extent to which the agency expertise will provide it with a comparative interpretative advantage over the courts,and the degree to which it appears that the agency has carefully considered the issue.citations.ibid.of course,the courts owe no deference to an interpretation that is clearly erroneous.kelly methodist hospital of california cal th.
all property in this state,not exempt under the laws of the united states or of this state,is subject to taxation citations.property includes all matters and things,real,personal,and mixed,capable of private ownership.citation.seibold county of los angeles th.leases fall into a unique subcategory.a lease of private property is not taxable.rather,in effect,lessees pay property tax indirectly through increased rents.in contrast,a lease of public land represents a taxable possessory interest.ibid.as our supreme court explained,when a public entity leases its property,i t creates valuable possessory interests,and there is no reason why the owners of such interests should not pay taxes on them their use is not public,but private,and as such should carry its share of the tax burden.citation.id.at.
c.the welfare exemption.
the california constitution permits the legislature to establish a tax exemption,inter alia,for properties that are used exclusively for charitable purposes,and which are owned by specified entities that are organized and operating for those charitable purposes.cal,art.xiii,subd.b.
the legislature enacted section to establish the property tax exemption,otherwise known as the welfare exemption,for specified charitable entities.for the exemption to apply,the owner and operator need not be the same entity.christ the good shepherd lutheran church mathiesen d.this is because the lease of real property by one religious or charitable organization to another satisfies the legislature fundamental purpose behind the welfare exemption,which is to provide an incentive for religious,charitable or scientific uses of real property.id.at.the overriding consideration of whether the property qualifies for exemption is the use of the property,and not the control over it.honeywell information systems,d.section sets forth various preconditions for the exemption.for example,the property must be used for the actual operation of the exempt activity,which must not exceed an amount of property reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of the exempt purpose,subd.a.
per statute,claims for the welfare exemption shall be filed on or before february of each year with the assessor.the assessor may not approve a property tax exemption claim until the claimant has been issued a valid occ pursuant to section,subd.a.when reviewing a claim,an assessor shall consider,among other things,whether capital investment of the owner or operator for expansion of a physical plant is justified by the contemplated return thereon,and required to serve the interests of the community,subd.b a.the claim for the welfare exemption shall show that the property use requirements entitling the property to the exemption are met,and that the claimant has a valid occ issued pursuant to section.
an organization that intends to claim the welfare exemption shall file with the sbe a claim for an occ,subd.a.the sbe staff is charged with reviewing claims for an occ,and it must consider whether the services and expenses of the owner or operator including salaries are excessive,based upon like services and salaries in comparable public or private institutions.the operations of the owner or operator,either directly or indirectly,materially enhance the private gain of any individual or individuals,subds.b.
tax refunds are available even if a claim for a welfare exemption was not timely filed.section,subdivision a provides that percent of any tax shall be refunded if an appropriate application for exemption is filed on or before the lien date in the calendar year succeeding the calendar year in which the exemption was not claimed by a timely application.section,subdivision a provides if the application is filed after the date specified in paragraph,percent of any tax or penalty or interest thereon shall be canceled or refunded provided an appropriate application for exemption is filed and relief is not authorized under section or.all provisions of section,other than the specified dates for the filing of affidavits and other acts,are applicable to a claim for a refund under section,subd.c.

in,the sbe published section of the handbook regarding taxable possessory interests in real property.as to whether a tenant is subject to taxation,the introduction notes in the case of privately owned real property,both the tenant and the landlord interests are taxable,and typically both interests are valued and assessed in the aggregate to the landlord,or fee owner.it is not necessary,or administratively feasible,for the assessor to separately assess the value of the leasehold,possessory interest and the value of the leased fee,nonpossessory interest instead,the assessor typically makes a single assessment of the entire taxable interest in the real property.a taxable possessory interest is a possessory interest that is separately taxable to the possessor.for introductory purposes,a taxable possessory interest can be defined as the taxable interest held by a private possessor in publicly owned real property.sbe handbook,assessment of taxable possessory interests.the introduction also notes that if there is no taxable possessory interest,there is obviously nothing to assess.id.at.
in,the sbe published section of the handbook regarding,among other things,the welfare exemption.the foreword cautioned,while regulations adopted by the sbe are binding as law,manuals are advisory only.in chapter,under the heading multiple owners operators,section of the handbook states the property will not be exempt unless the owner and the operator meet the specific requirements of section.an operator is a user of the property on a regular basis,with or without a lease agreement.typically,the owner and operator are one and the same and the filing of one claim for exemption will suffice.however,it is not necessary that the owner and the operator of the property be the same legal entity.if the property is owned by one exempt organization and operated by another exempt organization,each must qualify and file a claim for exemption.elsewhere,section of the handbook provides instructions regarding the filing of a welfare exemption claim and states,in relevant part,an officer or duly authorized representative of the organization owning the property must sign the claim.an officer or duly authorized representative of the organization operating the property must sign and file a separate claim.if an organization both owns and operates the property,only one claim need be signed and filed with the assessor for each property location.bolding omitted.the instructions then go on to provide an organization that is seeking the welfare exemption shall file with the sbe a claim for an occ.
e.the welfare exemption claim filing requirement.
the county,in essence,argues that the statutory scheme the handbook requires both an owner and operator to file a claim for a welfare exemption.it asks us to simply defer to the sbe interpretation and authority.we decline.as we discuss below,the sbe interpretation of the statutory scheme is clearly erroneous,and its advisory rules are not binding.
because section does not state who must file a claim for a welfare exemption,and it does not establish a claim filing requirement of any kind,we conclude its scope does not cover claim filing.in other words,the language is clear,so we must give effect to section language.the statute that requires the filing of a claim for the welfare exemption,section,refers to a claimant not claimants,and it does not specify who the claimant must be.based on the plain language,the statute can not be read as requiring both an owner and operator to file claims for welfare exemptions in order for the owner to be eligible.section requires a claim for the welfare exemption to show that use requirements are met,and that the claimant has a valid occ.this statute does not define the claimant who is required to file a claim.and by referring to claimant and claim in the singular,the statute can not be read as signifying that when the owner and operator are separate entities that they are both required to file claims for an occ.we easily conclude that the statutory scheme is not susceptible to the sbe interpretation.
insofar as any of these statutes could be construed as ambiguous,they are still not amenable to the sbe interpretati
