appellant greenlee county,arizona greenlee county appeals from a decision of the united states court of federal claims dismissing its suit against the appellee united states government or united states for failure to state a claim.we affirm.
background 
the payment in lieu of taxes act pilt,et,was enacted to compensate local governments for the loss of tax revenues resulting from the status of federal lands located in their jurisdictions,and for the cost of providing services related to these lands.lawrence county sch.dist,d.under pilt,the secretary of the interior is required to make annual payments to each unit of general local government in which entitlement land is located.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also.entitlement lands include,inter alia,land that is part of the national forest system.a.a unit of general local government is defined as a local government unit that the secretary of the interior,in his discretion,determines to be the principal provider of governmental services within the state in the area of the entitlement land.a.the amount of payment a unit of local government is entitled to under is calculated based on the number of acres of entitlement land within its jurisdiction but limited to an amount determined by a formula based on its population.see.
section,the focus of the dispute in this case,provides that n ecessary amounts may be appropriated to the secretary of the interior to carry out this chapter.amounts are available only as provided in appropriation laws.under the current department of the interior regulation,i f congress appropriates insufficient monies to provide full payment to each local government during any fiscal year,the department will reduce proportionally all payments in that fiscal year.b.the question in this case is whether the government liability is capped by the amount appropriated by congress.
the secretary of the interior has determined that greenlee county,located in eastern arizona,is a unit of local general government.since the united states forest service owns over half of the land in the county,greenlee county is eligible for payments under pilt and received from the department of interior from through.however,during this period,greenlee county did not receive the full payment provided for by the statutory formula because the department of the interior found that congress did not appropriate sufficient funds to fully fund payments in the full amount of the formula.
in august,greenlee county filed a suit against the united states in the court of federal claims seeking in unpaid amounts it was allegedly due under pilt from fiscal years through,the difference between what it received from the department of the interior and the full amount to which it would have been entitled under the statutory formula.greenlee county also sought certification of a class comprising over allegedly similarly situated units of local government.
the government moved to dismiss greenlee county complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under rule b of the court of federal claims rcfc and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under rcfc b.on november,the court of federal claims granted the government motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.greenlee county,arizona united states.the court of federal claims concluded that under the government obligation was expressly conditioned on the availability of appropriations.id.at.it reasoned that the language necessary amounts may be appropriated in,like the phrases available only as provided in appropriation laws and subject to the availability of appropriations,does not require that the amounts be appropriated.id.at.the court of federal claims also concluded that p laintiff request that we certify a class of counties in similar circumstances as greenlee county is moot.id.at.

discussion 
at the outset,we consider the government claim that the court of federal claims lacked jurisdiction because pilt is not.see daimlerchrysler cuno,d.the tucker act both confers jurisdiction on the court of federal claims and waives the sovereign immunity of the united states for claims for money damages founded on,inter alia,acts of congress.see united states white mountain apache tribe,d fisher united states,en banc in relevant part.however,t he tucker act itself does not create a substantive cause of action in order to come within the jurisdictional reach and the waiver of the tucker act,a plaintiff must identify a separate source of substantive law that creates the right to money damages.fisher,at see also white mountain,at.
the government appears to argue that whether a statute is for purposes of tucker act jurisdiction depends on whether the plaintiff on the merits can make out a claim under the statute,and that the court of federal claims lacked jurisdiction here because the court properly concluded that greenlee county was not entitled to recover under the statute.this jurisdictional argument is foreclosed by the supreme court decision in white mountain and by our decision in fisher interpreting white mountain.
in white mountain,the court explained that a statute creates a right capable of grounding a claim within the waiver of sovereign immunity if,but only if,it can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the federal government for the damage sustained and is reasonably amenable to the reading that it mandates a right of recovery in damages.white mountain,at.emphases added and internal quotation marks omitted.clearly,determining whether a statute can fairly be interpreted to require the payment of damages or is reasonably amenable to a reading that mandates damages does not require a determination that the plaintiff has a claim on the merits.in fact,white mountain itself resolved the jurisdictional issue by concluding that a statute created a fiduciary trust relationship that made the government subject to duties as a trustee and liable in damages for breach.white mountain,at.the court then remanded the case to the court of federal claims to determine on the merits whether a breach occurred that would entitle the plaintiff to damages because the existence of this general fiduciary relationship does not mean that any and every claim necessarily states a proper claim for breach of the trust,a claim which must be fully tried in the court of federal claims,white mountain apache tribe united states,internal quotation marks omitted,aff at.thus,the supreme court clearly viewed the merits of a plaintiff,whether the plaintiff could make out a cause of action for damages based on a breach of the fiduciary a separate inquiry from the jurisdictional question of whether a source exists.
in support of its position,the government points to our discussion in fisher of a single step that determines both the question of whether the statute provides the predicate for the court jurisdiction,and lays to rest for purposes of the case before it the question of whether the statute on its merits provides a remedy,at.however,fisher considered three different grounds on which the government might file a motion to dismiss in a tucker act case lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the lack of a source failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted due to lack of a source and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the plaintiff is ultimately not entitled to recover money damages under the statute.at.fisher held that the first two grounds are resolved by a single step at the outset of the case and the determination that the source is shall be determinative both as to the question of the court jurisdiction and thereafter as to the question of whether,on the merits,plaintiff has a source on which to base his cause of action.at.however,we also clearly noted that the third ground remains a separate inquiry,stating 
assuming that the court of federal claims has taken jurisdiction over the cause as a result of the initial determination that plaintiff cause rests on a source,the consequence of a ruling by the court on the merits,that plaintiff case do
