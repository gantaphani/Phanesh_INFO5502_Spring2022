background 
a.the underlying controversy 
we detailed the facts underlying this controversy in disposing of the previous appeal of this case,tax analysts internal revenue service,tax analysts i.we incorporate that discussion by reference,and reiterate facts only as necessary for the purposes of resolving the matter now before us.
ta publishes tax materials.it sued the irs and cbn under foia and the internal revenue code both discussed below to obtain copies of a closing agreement regarding taxes due for previous taxable years.the closing agreement was reached in the same time period during which cbn secured status going forward.in our previous opinion,this court described the closing agreement as being reached in conjunction with cbn filing.
cbn had been a c organization since.in and,cbn allegedly engaged in political activities in support of presidential candidate and cbn founder pat robertson.the irs audited cbn regarding cbn past and continued eligibility for status.

on april,ta sent a foia request to the irs seeking the following a copy of the closing agreement mentioned in the press release any closing agreement relating to the issues noted in the press release any written correspondence or memoranda of conversations between cbn and the irs pertaining to those agreements and any renewal,revocation,or modification of any ruling granting status to cbn.

statutory and regulatory framework 
the freedom of information act sets forth a basic rule for disclosure of federal records,a,but includes a number of exceptions,including an exception for documents specifically exempted by statute,commonly referred to as foia exemption.id.b.the internal revenue code sets forth a basic rule regarding public disclosure of documents pertaining to application for status 
for organizations exempt under section c or d the application filed by the organization with respect to which the secretary made his determination that such organization was entitled to exemption,together with any papers submitted in support of such application or notice,and any letter or other document issued by the internal revenue service with respect to such application or notice shall be open to public inspection at the national office of the internal revenue service.
a a emphasis added.by contrast,section explicitly protects the confidentiality of such tax return information as closing agreements,so long as the return information is not subject to disclosure under section.tax analysts i,at characterizing section as an exception to the exception from the general disclosure rule offered by foia exemption and.this court has already held that the fact that section is a statute contemplated by foia exemption is beyond dispute.tax analysts irs.
the department of the treasury treasury implemented section with treasury regulation section a,a.section a of this rule essentially mirrors the statutory provision.section b defines l etters or documents issued by the internal revenue service with respect to an application for tax exemption.section c notes that no such documents will be made public until the applicant is determined,on the basis of the application,to be exempt from taxation for any taxable year.section d defines application for tax exemption.and section e defines supporting documents 
supporting documents defined.for purposes of this section,supporting documents,as used with respect to an application for tax exemption,means any statement or document not described in paragraph d of this section that is submitted by an organization in support of its application.for example,a legal brief submitted in support of an application for tax exemption is a supporting document.
reg.a e emphasis added.
finally,section i of the rule provides that certain documents are never subject to section disclosure,even when they relate to organizations.this list includes u nfavorable rulings or determination letters issued in response to applications for tax exemption,reg.a i,and a ny other letter or document filed with or issued by the internal revenue service which,although it relates to an organization tax exempt status as an organization described in section c or d,does not relate to that organization application for tax exemption,within the meaning of paragraph d.id.a i.
tax returns and return information remain confidential except where provided to the contrary.a.closing agreements contain such information,but it is at least theoretically possible that they may contain information subject to disclosure under section a a.we identified this intersection of the two sections in the previous appeal in this case,but noted that the parties agreed on that reading of the law and only disputed whether the closing agreement was subject to disclosure.tax analysts i,at.
c.the first round of litigation trial and appeal 
the district court did not examine any of the documents in question before dismissing ta complaint.the court concluded from the pleadings that requested information represented a closing agreement under a,and was therefore a tax return exempt from disclosure under section and foia exemption.it granted judgment under fed.civ.c.the court also concluded that section provides no private right of action against a applicant,and dismissed the claim against cbn under fed.civ.b.
this court affirmed the rule b dismissal of the claim against cbn,tax analysts i,at,but vacated the c dismissal and remanded,holding that section does not exclude all closing agreements and their documentary precursors.instead,that provision only excludes those agreements which are not any papers submitted or any letter or document issued subject to public disclosure under section a a.at emphasis added by the court.we concluded this analysis with the following instruction for the district court on remand 
at bottom,the case before us does not present a disagreement over the law to be applied,but the narrow and question of whether the closing agreement between the irs and cbn and any accompanying documentation represent material disclosable under a a,despite their apparent status as material exempt from disclosure under.as the present record is inadequate for such determination,further discovery is necessary.we therefore vacate th
