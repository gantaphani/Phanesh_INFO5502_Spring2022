this appeal requires us to determine the tax consequences of a complex financial transaction.bb t entered into a transaction,often called a lilo,hoping to reduce its tax liability,but the internal revenue service irs disallowed the deductions it claimed.after bb t sued for a refund,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government.
bb t now appeals,arguing that the district court misapplied the doctrine in determining that it could not claim deductions for rent and interest under a a west supp.specifically,bb t disputes the district court conclusion that although the form of the transaction involved a lease financed by a loan,bb t did not actually acquire a genuine leasehold interest or incur genuine indebtedness as a result of the transaction.for the following reasons,we affirm.
because this is an appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the government,we review the facts in the light most favorable to bb anderson liberty lobby,d.
background.
the parties agree that the structure of the transaction at issue matches that of a typical lilo,so we begin with a brief overview of this complex transactional form.
in a typical lilo,a taxpayer leases property from a entity and simultaneously leases that property back to the owner.the owner sublease has a shorter term than the taxpayer lease.upon expiration of the shorter sublease,the owner may exercise an option to buy back the remainder of the taxpayer lease.thus,in practical terms,the property owner continues to use the property during the sublease term just as it did before the transaction and bears no risk of losing control of its asset s.
the taxpayer,meanwhile,receives tax benefits by deducting the rental payments on its lease,amortizing certain transaction costs,and,depending on its financing arrangement,deducting interest payments.maxim shvedov,crs report for congress tax implications of silos,qtes,and other leasing transactions with entities.the tax benefits can be substantial and are achieved primarily by a ccelerating the deductions and delaying recognition of the corresponding revenues.id.at.this delayed recognition creates a tax deferral,which,in practice,will function as a tax reduction due to the time value of money.id.at.
generally,parties aim to structure a lilo in a way that essentially eliminates any risk of economic loss while maximizing the deductions that the taxpayer may claim.in this respect,the parties strive to strike a balance between limiting their exposure to risks on one hand,and making sure the provisions do not disqualify the transaction as a genuine lease for tax purposes on the other.id.at see also mark gergen,the logic of deterrence corporate tax shelters,tax,noting that lilos are often structured so that there is no risk to any party,other than the tax law risk.
the chief tax risk associated with entering into a lilo is the possibility that the irs will deem the transaction a sham.lilos have been harshly criticized as abusive tax shelters that serve only to transfer tax benefits associated with property ownership from entities,which have no use for them,to taxpayers.see david hariton,response to old brine in new bottles new brine in old bottles,tax,noting one commentator characterization of lilos as abusive tax shelters and agreeing that lilos purport to create tax benefits that congress did not intend to confer on anyone in respect of transactions that involve no business investment at all.in,the irs issued proposed regulations that largely eliminated the tax benefits associated with lilos these regulations became effective in.section rental agreements.proposed june,to.although the regulations did not apply to transactions entered into before,there remained a risk that the irs would invoke generally applicable tax law principles to disallow deductions.despite the risk,many large financial institutions executed lilo transactions between and.
b.the transaction.
bb t enters into the lilo.
bb t,a financial services company based in the southeast,entered into the lilo at issue in this appeal with sodra cell ab sodra,the business division of a swedish cooperative recognized as one of the world leading wood pulp manufacturers the property at issue in the transaction is a interest in the pulp manufacturing equipment at one of sodra mills hereinafter the equipment as explained more fully below,the transaction,which remains,involves a lease and simultaneous but,followed by a series of options.
a promoter,knight,tallman van tol capital partners,ktv,solicited bb t to participate in the transaction.ktv marketed the lilo to bb t as a tax driven structure that would provide significant t ax savings while eliminating economic risk through the use of defeased accounts at.
before entering into the lilo,bb t performed an independent evaluation of the transaction.this internal assessment described the transaction as a deal with an investment yield largely generated by tax benefits associated with accelerated tax deductions for rent.at.bb t chief financial officer cfo conceded that if there were no tax benefits bb t would p robably not have moved forward with the lilo.at.the cfo claimed,however,that bb t was intrigued by the transaction in part because it was looking to grow loans and diversify its loan portfolio.at.
as part of the process outlined in the ktv promotion,bb t had the equipment appraised.deloitte and touche,performed the appraisal and prepared a report estimating the equipment useful life and fair market value,as well as the value of the interest bb t would have in the equipment at different times.
then,on june,the closing date,bb t and sodra executed the transaction through a series of interrelated agreements.these agreements included,inter alia,a head lease,a sublease,a debt payment undertaking agreement debt pua,and an equity payment undertaking agreement equity pua.the head lease and sublease govern the parties interests in the equipment,while the debt pua and equity pua set forth fiscal obligations.
property leases.
pursuant to the head lease,bb t leased the equipment from sodra for a term.at the same time,under the terms of the sublease,sodra leased the equipment back from bb t for a period that the parties refer to as the basic lease term.in effect,the sublease retracted bb t rights and obligations under the head lease for the duration of the basic lease term,but provided bb t a right to make an annual inspection of the equipment sodra therefore continues to use and possess the equipment as it did prior to the transaction.between and,sodra made major improvements to the equipment at a cost in excess of million.after the closing date between and,sodra continued to make improvements to the equipment at a capital cost totaling million.
when the basic lease term expires on january,sodra has the option to buy back bb t remaining interest under the head lease.sodra exercise of this option would terminate the transaction in,following the close of the basic lease term.
if sodra declines this purchase option,bb t has options of its own.these options include requiring sodra to extend its sublease an additional years to april,meaning the sublease would then end years prior to the expiration of the head lease the renewal option leasing the equipment to a party other than sodra,subject to certain requirements concerning the terms of the replacement lease and the identity and creditworthiness of the replacement lessee the replacement lease option or taking possession of the equipment and using it at its own expense and for its own benefit for the remainder of the head lease term the return option.at.
financing obligations.
as we previously noted,supra note,bb t implemented the transaction through a trust,with fleet national bank fleet acting as trustee.the closing proved relatively straightforward bank abn,one of the world most secure financial institutions,assisted with the financing by depositing in bb t trust account at abn,while bb t contributed of its own funds to the trust account acting pursuant to the debt pua,fleet immediately transferred a sum equal to that furnished by abn,back to a defeased account at abn the debt pua account.as a result of this irrevocable transfer,those funds became an asset solely of abn,unreachable by sodra,bb t,or their respective creditors.of the remaining,fleet used to purchase treasury bonds,which were placed in an account at fleet.this purchase set in motion the equity pua.to complete the closing,fleet transferred to sodra as sodra incentive for doing the deal.at.
on paper,however,the closing proved far more complicated.the abn provided represented a loan from one of abn subsidiaries,hollandsche hbu the hbu loan,the proceeds of which abn was transferring to bb t trust account on behalf of hbu.once placed in the trust account,the hbu loan,coupled with bb t investment,became bb t advance head lease payment,the first and,as explained below,potentially the only rent payment due sodra under the head lease.only the incentive payment actually went to sodra because the debt pua obligated sodra to make a payment to abn,which was acting as debt pua issuer for the transaction,and the equity pua mandated a payment from sodra to fleet,which was serving as equity pua issuer.accordingly,these funds were transferred to abn and fleet on sodra behalf,rather than paid to sodra.
ii.basic lease term closing.
the head lease calls for bb t to pay rent to sodra in two installments.the advance head lease payment represents the first installment,and a second payment of million the deferred head lease payment is due in,five years after the head lease expires.bb t thus will not make any rental payments during the basic lease term.
moreover,although sodra is required to make annual rental payments during this term,sodra does not supply any additional funds to satisfy this obligation.instead,abn,in its capacity as debt pua issuer,makes the payments on sodra behalf from the funds it received at closing.bb t does not receive any of these rental payments because bb t assigned the right to receive rent from sodra to hbu as part of providing collateral for the hbu loan accordingly,abn,acting as debt pua issuer,makes the annual payments directly to hbu from the debt pua account.through,these annual payments exactly equal the remaining principal and interest due on the loan.because abn,not hbu,provided the funds for the loan,however,abn is actually paying itself from the the sum equal to the loan proceeds that it received at closing.the net result is that no funds change hands during this period only a circular intrabank transfer occurs.on its own books,therefore,abn treats the loan as an sheet transaction carrying zero risk.
in the meantime,the treasury bonds purchased by fleet as equity pua issuer remain in an account at fleet the equity pua account.
iii.january,to the transaction end.
purchase option.
if sodra exercises its purchase option,the purchase would be funded from the resources bb t supplied at closing.abn,as debt pua issuer,would fund part of the purchase price by making the final payment under the debt pua on january,thereby also retiring the hbu loan.fleet,as equity pua issuer,would pay the remaining balance of the purchase price on sodra behalf by dispersing the funds from the equity pua account to bb t in five payments made at specified times in because sodra would be buying back all of bb t interests and obligations under the head lease,including the obligation to make the deferred head lease payment,bb t would be relieved of the obligation to make that payment.the transaction would therefore end with fleet final payment to bb t in.
the practical effect of this scenario would be no different than if bb t had invested in the treasury bonds directly,except that bb t paid roughly million to sodra as incentive for participating in the transaction,as well as various transaction fees,and would have received tax deductions for rent,interest,and amortization of fees had the irs not audited its tax return.
bb t options.
if sodra declines the purchase option,and bb t elects to renew the sublease,abn,as debt pua issuer,will still make the final payment under the debt pua,retiring the hbu loan.this payment will still be considered made on sodra behalf,but as a rental payment.sodra will also make annual rental payments each year of the renewed sublease term,as well as additional payments at the beginning of certain years and a deferred payment at the end of the renewed sublease.meanwhile,the treasury bonds in the equity pua account will be reinvested and will serve as collateral for and will be available to apply to sodra rental payments.
the parties structured the transaction so that the rent from the renewed sublease would grow at a predetermined rate and ultimately equal the amount of the deferred head lease payment when it is due,thereby allowing bb t to fulfill that obligation without investing additional funds.moreover,even if interest rates are not as the parties assumed and the sums bb t has pledged as collateral for the deferred head lease payment do not total million in,sodra has no recourse against bb t for any deficiency.
if bb t does not exercise the renewal option,fleet will deliver the funds in the equity pua account to sodra.the last payment under the debt pua will also go to sodra,meaning that bb t would be responsible for the final payment to retire the hbu loan bb t would still be required to provide collateral for the deferred head lease the form of rents from the replacement sublease if it exercises that option,or an alternative such as a letter of credit or guarantee should it choose the return sodra would still have no recourse against bb t for any shortfall in the deferred head lease payment.
looking ahead bb t and sodra options.
sodra has professed uncertainty as to whether it will exercise its purchase option,and bb t maintains that as a result,any of the options made possible by the transaction could become a reality at the close of the basic lease term.bb t has conceded,however,that it entered into the transaction believing that the most likely thing is sodra would not walk away from the property,given that sodra had been in business for years,making the purchase option or the renewal option the most likely scenarios.at.of course,because the renewal option belongs to bb t,not sodra and the renewal lease would not encompass the full head lease term,sodra could ensure uninterrupted use and control of the equipment only by exercising the purchase option.an expert report commissioned by the government predicted this result,concluding that,for a number of reasons,including dislocation costs and cost of replacing lost manufacturing capacity,the purchase option represented the only economically viable scenario for sodra.deloitte touche appraisal,in contrast,deemed sodra unlikely to exercise the purchase option,reasoning that the purchase price exceeded the value of the head lease interest sodra would acquire apparently without taking into account that because the option was prefunded by bb t,sodra would pay nothing for its purchase 
the parties dispute whether bb t can profit from the transaction if it does not receive the tax benefits it hoped the lilo tax driven structure would generate.bb t contends that,under the purchase option,it stands to make a minimum net profit of,and under the renewal lease option,it could net a minimum profit of.the government disputes bb t methodology and has proffered an expert report concluding that in the absence of the tax benefits generated by the transaction,bb t has no realistic expectation of realizing an economic gain.
there is no dispute,however,that the transaction maximizes bb t protection from loss.sodra was required to set up a letter of credit for the protection of bb t in the event that something happened to cause the transaction to unwind early.and,the structure of the transaction ensures that bb t has the power to recoup the investment in government bonds from the equity pua account,if it so chooses.finally,bb t hbu loan and the deferred head lease obligations,with only proceeds and interests derived from the transaction itself pledged as collateral.
bb t tax return.
in its tax return,bb t reported rent from sodra sublease and amortization of an advisory fee as income.bb t claimed deductions for in rent paid to sodra on the head lease in interest on the hbu loan,and amortization of in fees an expenses made in connection with the transaction.when the irs audited bb t,it disregarded the reported income and disallowed the deductions,resulting in a increase in bb t taxable income for.
proceedings before the district court.
following the audit,on october,bb t filed a complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of north carolina,seeking a refund of taxes it claimed to have overpaid.thereafter,bb t and the government filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government.
with regard to the rental payment,the district court concluded that bb t was not entitled to a deduction because even though the form of the transaction was a lease and immediate sublease,in substance bb t had not acquired a genuine leasehold interest in the equipment.relying primarily on two cases from the united states tax court,alstores realty comm r,wl,and ashlock comm r,wl,the district court reasoned that w here a conveyance of property is accompanied by retention of the same interest in the property,only a future interest is conveyed.at.the district court further reasoned that the various obligations in the transaction were offsetting and that,when those offsetting obligations were collapsed against each other,all that remained was bb t payment of transaction costs in a complicated circle ending with an investment in government bonds.the court concluded that the investment could have proceeded in an identical manner without the additional shuffling of paper.
concerning the interest deduction,the district court concluded that w hen the intermediate payment steps are disregarded,which must be done in order to consider the substance of the loan transaction and not the form selected by the parties,it becomes clear that the loan transaction is only a circular transfer of funds in which the loan is paid from the proceeds of the loan itself.at.accordingly,it determined that the hbu loan did not constitute genuine indebtedness,and bb t was not entitled to an interest deduction.
bb t timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to west.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment to the government,applying the same standards that the district court was required to apply.see laber harvey,cir en banc.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c west.we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to bb t,the party,and draw all reasonable inferences in bb t favor.id.
we begin our discussion with a few familiar rules.a taxpayer,of course,has the legal right to decrease the amount of what otherwise would be his taxes,or altogether avoid them,by any means which the law permits.bridges comm r,cir.a taxpayer may not,however,claim tax benefits that congress did not intend to confer by setting up a sham transaction lacking any legitimate business purpose,or by affixing labels to its transactions that do not accurately reflect their true nature.accordingly,under the economic substance doctrine,a transaction may be disregarded as a sham for tax purposes if the taxpayer was motivated by no business purposes other than obtaining tax benefits and the transaction has no economic substance because no reasonable possibility of a profit exists.rice toyota world,comm r,cir.similarly,the doctrine of substance over form recognizes that the substance of a transaction,rather than its form,governs for tax purposes.see.comm r,cir it is well settled that in matters of taxation substance rather than form prevails and that the taxability of a transaction is determined by its true nature rather than by the name which the parties may use in describing it.because an income tax deduction is a matter of legislative grace the burden of clearly showing the right to the claimed deduction is on the taxpayer.interstate transit lines comm r.see also jack cookie united states,cir noting the settled principle that statutes authorizing deductions from income for federal tax purposes are to be strictly construed.
bb t claims that it has demonstrated its entitlement to deductions for rent and interest under a a by showing that the transaction has economic substance and a form that must be respected for tax purposes.thus,according to bb t,neither the economic substance doctrine nor the doctrine prohibits bb t from receiving the deductions it claimed.given the procedural posture of this case,we take bb t at its word that the transaction meets the criteria for economic substance set forth in rice toyota world accordingly,we direct our attention to bb t argument that the form of the transaction,as evidenced by the parties written agreements,accurately reflects its substance.we first address whether bb t has acquired a genuine leasehold interest giving rise to a rent deduction under a before turning to the question of whether bb t paid interest on indebtedness within the meaning of a.
in applying the doctrine of substance over form,we look to the objective economic realities of a transaction rather than to the particular form the parties employed,frank lyon united states,d.as the supreme court has repeatedly explained,the simple expedient of drawing up papers is not controlling for tax purposes when the objective economic realities are to the contrary.id.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the parties agree that to deduct payment on the head lease as a rental payment under a,bb t must establish that it acquired a genuine leasehold interest in the equipment.see a permitting a deduction for rentals or other payments required to be made as a condition to the continued use or possession,for purposes of the trade or business,of property to which the taxpayer has not taken or is not taking title or in which he has no equity.
in frank lyon,the supreme court provided guidance for determining when the form of a leasing transaction should be respected for tax purposes.in the course of analyzing a sale and arrangement,the frank lyon.court held that 
where there is a genuine transaction with economic substance which is compelled or encouraged by business or regulatory realities,is imbued with considerations,and is not shaped solely by features that have meaningless labels attached,the government should honor the allocation of rights and duties effectuated by the parties.expressed another way,so long as the lessor retains significant and genuine attributes of the traditional lessor status,the form of the transaction adopted by the parties governs for tax purposes.what those attributes are in any particular case will necessarily depend upon its facts.
at.emphasis added.
thus,establishing that the head lease is,in substance,a true lease for tax purposes requires a demonstration that the lessor retains significant and genuine attributes of the traditional lessor status.frank lyon,at.accord estate of thomas leven,wl t he parties characterization of the form of the transaction should be respected so long as the lessor retains significant and genuine attributes of a traditional lessor.we are not persuaded that bb t has made this showing with regard the leases at issue here.
first,each right and obligation bb t obtained under the head lease it simultaneously returned to sodra via the sublease for the duration of the basic lease term,leaving bb t only a right to make an annual inspection of the equipment.second,although the transaction ostensibly provides for the exchange of tens of millions of dollars in rental payments during the basic lease term,the only money that has and that may ever change hands between bb t and sodra is the bb t provided as sodra incentive for doing the deal.at.sodra has therefore not only continued to use the equipment just as it had before the transaction,it has done so without paying anything to bb third,sodra,through the purchase option,can unwind the transaction without ever losing dominion and control over the equipment or having surrendered any of its own funds to bb t,and has no economic incentive to do otherwise bb t therefore does not expect sodra to walk away from the equipment.at.finally,regardless of whether sodra bucks this expectation,the structure of the transaction insulates bb t from any risk of losing its initial investment in the government bonds or incurring the obligation to invest additional funds.
in sum,the transaction does not allocate bb t and sodra rights,obligations,and risks in a manner that resembles a traditional lease relationship.see alstores realty,at holding that because a agreement placed the two parties rights,obligations,and risks as they would be allocated in a typical lease arrangement,the arrangement was a lease in substance as well as in form swift dodge comm r,cir recharacterizing a lease as a conditional sales contract because the parties obligations,legal rights,and risks were no different than they would be in a conditional sale arrangement and swift dodge did not retain significant and genuine attributes of a lessor aderholt specialty comm r,cch holding that a lease arrangement was a sale for federal tax purposes because the transaction divested the lessor of any significant and genuine attributes of traditional lessor status and if the benefits,obligations,and rights of the putative lessor are essentially those of a secured seller,the substance of the arrangement must govern and it will be deemed a sale for tax purposes internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,unlike the taxpayer in frank lyon,bb t has failed to show any business or regulatory realities that compelled or encouraged,id.at,the structure of the transaction at issue here,nor has it established that its lilo is imbued with considerations,and is not shaped solely by features that have meaningless labels attached,id.at.to the contrary,bb t has offered no regulatory or economic reality driving the transaction simultaneous conveyance and retraction of rights and obligations,nor has it offered any related purpose for structuring the transaction in this manner.
in these respects,bb t stands in sharp contrast to the lessor in frank lyon.there,regulatory restrictions prevented the trust company worthen from financing the construction of a new bank and office building through a conventional mortgage.worthen therefore arranged an alternative solution a sale and arrangement with frank lyon would provide worthen with the use of the building,satisfy the state and federal regulators,and attract the necessary capital.frank lyon,at.the arrangement did not create any tax benefits that could not have been enjoyed had the transaction taken another form,but it did result in a situation in which neither party was the owner of the building in any simple sense.id.at.the supreme court concluded that frank lyon should be treated as the owner for tax purposes and not merely a lender of money and conduit for mortgage payments to a third party,as the government had argued because frank lyon was the only one whose capital was committed to,and genuinely at risk in,the building.id.at.we are thus unpersuaded by bb t insistence that the same factors causing the supreme court to respect the form of the transaction at issue in frank lyon are also present in this appeal.compare coleman comm r,cir distinguishing frank lyon and explaining that the existence of the benefits and burdens of ownership is dispositive of whether a taxpayer will be treated as the owner of leased property for tax purposes.
likewise,bb t argument that the district court violated the principle that the transaction in question must be viewed as a whole,appellant br.at quoting acm comm r,cir,rings hollow.this principle does not require courts to treat needless additional steps or features that have meaningless labels attached,frank lyon,at,as legitimate by virtue of their attachment to a substantive transaction,such as a purchase or sale.to the contrary,this aspect of the doctrine serves to prevent taxpayers from manipulating the tax code in that way.as the supreme court has explained,
the transaction must be viewed as a whole,and each step,from the commencement of negotiations to the consummation of the sale,is relevant.a sale by one person can not be transformed for tax purposes into a sale by another by using the latter as a conduit through which to pass title.to permit the true nature of a transaction to be disguised by mere formalisms,which exist solely to alter tax liabilities,would seriously impair the effective administration of the tax policies of congress.

accordingly,we,like the district court,conclude that in substance,the transaction is a financing arrangement,not a genuine lease and sublease.all that bb t has done is paid sodra approximately million dollars to sign documents meeting the formal requirements of a lease and sublease,arranged a circular transfer of funds from and then back to abn,and invested approximately million in government bonds.sodra,meanwhile,maintains uninterrupted possession and control of the equipment,and has no economic incentive to cede control to bb because the funds bb t provided as the advance head lease payment do not,in substance,constitute rental payments required to be made as a condition to the continued use or possession of the equipment,bb t is not entitled to a deduction under a,at upholding disallowance of rental deduction where an increase in rent was not in substance an ordinary and necessary business expense,but rather a device through which a third party purchased the company stock sun oil comm r,cir concluding that purported was in substance a financing arrangement between the parties and disallowing a claim for rent deductions under a.
we next consider bb t entitlement to deduct interest paid on the hbu loan from its taxable income.under a,t here shall be allowed as a deduction all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness.a.explaining that interest is to be given its usual,ordinary and everyday meaning,the supreme court has defined the term as compensation for the use or forbearance of money.halle comm r,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.generally,the underlying indebtedness is defined as an existing,unconditional,and legally enforceable obligation for the payment of a principal sum.id.at internal quotation marks omitted and,in keeping with principles of substance over form,deductible interest can only accrue on genuine indebtedness.halle,at,emphasis in original see also midkiff comm r,wl i ndebtedness must be indebtedness in substance and not merely in form.
bb t claims that it accrued deductible interest on the hbu loan because,pursuant to the loan and security agreement it signed with hbu,bb t has a legal obligation to repay the loan.according to bb t,the loan therefore necessarily constitutes genuine indebtedness,and the circularity of the parties obligations,the nature of the loan,and the other features of the transaction considered by the district court are irrelevant.we can not accept this contention.
as an initial matter,it is difficult to see how the interest bb t paid could represent compensation for the use or forbearance of money.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.at the transaction closing,abn supplied the for the loan on behalf of hbu,and bb t immediately returned to abn as debt pua issuer.accordingly,abn,which treated the loan as an sheet transaction,did not forbear any money during the time period in which bb t so
