in an earlier decision in this case,we ordered the secretary of the army to correct procedural errors he committed in disposing of excess military property,errors that deprived appellant,a organization,of an opportunity to compete for the property.for its work in securing that decision,appellant now seeks an award of attorneys fees pursuant to the equal access to justice act.because appellant has satisfied the statutory requirements for an award,we grant its application for fees.but because it has failed to justify the amount it seeks,we award significantly less than requested.
our previous opinion fully describes the background of this case,see role models,white,so we only summarize it here.appellant role models america,a educational organization,seeks to establish a magnet high school for troubled youth.in the,as part of its plan to locate the high school on a former military installation,role models attempted to acquire fort ritchie,a closed army base in maryland.when its efforts proved unsuccessful,role models filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia,claiming that the secretary of the army,one of the officials responsible for disposing of fort ritchie,had violated federal regulations by failing to provide adequate notice of the fort availability.in its complaint,role models asked the district court to declare that the secretary failure to provide adequate notice was unlawful to direct the secretary to comply with regulatory requirements,thus giving role models an opportunity to compete for the property and to enjoin any conveyance of fort ritchie until the secretary did,alternatively,to require the secretary to transfer the base to role models.
the district court denied role models motion for a preliminary injunction,role models,white,d,but we reversed,see.concluding that the secretary had violated the clear text of the relevant regulations by failing to provide adequate notice that surplus military property was available,we remanded the case to the district court with instructions to enter a permanent injunction against conveyance of the fort ritchie property until the government remedies the procedural errors it had committed.role models,at.
having secured the relief it sought,role models now requests,pursuant to the equal access to justice act,eaja,reimbursement for the attorneys fees that it incurred in bringing the appeal.the eaja provides that 
a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action other than cases sounding in tort,including proceedings for judicial review of agency action,brought by or against the united states,unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
id.d a.the government opposes any award of fees,contending that notwithstanding our merits opinion,role models is not a prevailing party.in any event,the government argues,its position was substantially justified.even if a fee award is warranted,the government insists,the amount that role models requests is excessive.we address each argument in turn.
the government contends that role models is not entitled to a fee award at this point because it has yet to obtain fort ritchie.in support,the government relies primarily on waterman steamship maritime subsidy board,in which we denied eaja fees to plaintiffs who,although they won a remand directing an agency to correct procedural errors it had made in awarding a contract,failed to obtain an order enjoining the provision of services under the contract.from a party viewpoint,we explained,correct procedures are largely if not entirely instruments to a desired change in someone primary conduct in the real world relief from a restriction,grant of a benefit,imposition of a restriction on others,id.at.we therefore concluded that an award of eaja fees for corrective efforts that yield no benefit would reduce the normal deterrent to litigative.id.
waterman is very different from this case.role models obtained not only a remand to correct procedural errors,but also an injunction barring the secretary from transferring fort ritchie until he complied with applicable regulations.in other words,role models obtained exactly what waterman found missing a change in someone primary conduct in the real world such as by the imposition of a restriction on others.id.
this case is much more like environmental defense fund,reilly,a case in which we held that the edf was a prevailing party because it had obtained an order vacating a rule that the epa promulgated after inadequate notice and comment.we rejected the epa argument that because the agency reissued the same rule after proper notice and comment,the edf did not qualify as a prevailing party.in the real world of the apa,we said,an opportunity for the edf did not to be denigrated.id.at.that statement applies here as well.whether or not role models eventually acquires fort ritchie,the opportunity to compete for it,which role models successfully achieved through the injunction that was the functional equivalent of vacating the rule in reilly is not to be denigrated.
similarly,in grano barry,we held that a plaintiff had prevailed by convincing the district court to enjoin the demolition of an historic building until a referendum on the demolition had occurred.although the building was ultimately demolished,that had no effect on our view of the issue because the injunction had the distinct external effect of postponing the razing of the tavern until the election could be held,and hence the victory represented a substantial part of what plaintiffs asked the court for in the first place.id.at.the injunction here had a comparable external effect postponing conveyance of fort ritchie until the secretary complies with the relevant likewise represents a substantial part of what plaintiff asked the court for in the first place.
nothing in thomas national science foundation,requires a different result.there we held that plaintiffs who had obtained a preliminary injunction were not prevailing parties because they had filed a lawsuit in order to obtain a refund from nsf,and the preliminary injunction did nothing to vindicate that claim.id.at.in adopting this reasoning,we distinguished grano,in which the injunction gave the plaintiffs the precise relief that they had sought.id.the injunction here similarly gave role models the precise relief it sought.
role models status as a prevailing party means that we must determine whether the government position was substantially justified.in pierce underwood,d,the supreme court held that a position is substantially justified if a reasonable person could think it correct,that is,if it has a reasonable basis in law and fact.id.at.at.pierce added that just because the government loses on the merits does not mean that its position lacked substantial justification.id.at.at.
arguing that its position was substantially justified,the government focuses largely on its litigation position,relying heavily on the fact that it prevailed in the district court.the government,however,must demonstrate the reasonableness not only of its litigation position,but also of the agency actions,halverson slater,see also d d providing that position of the united states means,in addition to the position taken by the united states in the civil action,the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based,and here we are convinced that the secretary actions were not substantially justified.as explained at greater length in our prior opinion,the applicable regulations provide that the relevant,the secretary of the army shall p ublish the time period during which it will receive notices of interest from representatives of the homeless and other interested parties.c emphasis added c emphasis added.the mandatory phrasing of these identically worded regulations leaves the secretary no discretion,while the use of the conjunction and indicates in no uncertain terms that the secretary must make clear that he will receive notices not only from representatives of the homeless,but also from other interested parties.despite the clarity of these regulations,the secretary chose to publish a notice entitled homeless assistance outreach initiative,and to say in the notice opening statement that he would receive notices of interest from representatives of agencies that seek to serve the needs of our community homeless population.the remainder of the notice only bolstered the impression that it was directed exclusively at advocates for the homeless,leaving nothing to indicate to role organization with an entirely different the secretary was soliciting notices from other interested parties as well.thus,as in vollmer magaw,the agency position lacked substantial justification because it was wholly unsupported by the text of the applicable regulations.id.at.
the government cites our decision in trahan brady,to support its argument that an agency actions may be substantially justified even though a court later concludes that the agency violated its regulations.we conclude here,however,not that the secretary violation of the regulations in and of itself demonstrates the absence of substantial justification,but rather that the regulations were so clear and the secretary failure to comply with them so obvious that his actions could not appear correct to a reasonable person.id.at.bearing in mind that the hallmark of the substantial justification test is reasonableness,we note,as we did in vollmer,that a lthough the merits panel did not use the word unreasonable,it highlighted the fundamental unreasonableness of the agency position.at.in our merits opinion in this case,we stated that w e can not imagine how role models,an organization devoted to establishing schools for minors,could possibly have interpreted this notice as an invitation to apply for the fort ritchie property.at.nor could can we how the secretary could have viewed this notice as satisfying his obligations under the regulations.that he could not reasonably have done so only underscores the fact that his position lacked substantial justification.our conclusion,then,rests primarily on our view,informed by an analysis of the merits panel opinion,that the case was easy and the secretary arguments worthy of little credence,as well as on the secretary failure to offer any convincing reasons for believing that his interpretation of the regulations was substantially justified.halverson,at.
this brings us to the amount of fees to be awarded.the eaja authorizes courts to award reasonable attorney fees.d a.role models seeks compensation for the work of two partners,one counsel,one associate,six legal assistants,one law clerk,two research librarians,and a legislative specialist.their hourly rates range from for the lead partner to for the associate to for the law clerk.according to role models,these fourteen individuals logged a total of hours in connection with the appeal and with the preparation of its fee petition.multiplying the appropriate rates and the number of hours,role models requests in legal fees.it also seeks for expenses,as well as leave to supplement its application to reflect the additional fees and expenses incurred while litigating its eaja application.appellant reply to appellees opp to appellant application for att ys fees and costs at.insisting that role models request is clearly unreasonable,the government urges us to reduce it drastically.appellees opp to appellant application for att ys fees and costs at.
to resolve this dispute,we consider first the hourly rate and then the number of hours requested.see murray weinberger,the starting point in under the statute is the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.throughout our analysis we will rely on eaja precedent as well as on case law arising under other statutes.see,indep.fed of flight attendants zipes,d noting that statutes similar language is a strong indication that they are to be interpreted alike internal quotation marks omitted.
hourly rates 
the eaja provides that attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor,such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved,justifies a higher fee.d a ii.role models seeks compensation at rates above the cap,claiming that higher rates are warranted because of both the presence of special factors and increases in the cost of living.
role models contends that a enhancement is justified by the quality of representation that its attorneys provided.see appellant application for att ys fees under the equal access to justice act at.specifically,it points to the effort,expertise,actual time expended by sidley in this case and the exceptional result obtained.id.role models also says the case involved a complex statutory and regulatory scheme,id.at,and that its attorneys had to prepare the appeal in a relatively short period of time because they did not take on the case until after the district court denied a preliminary injunction.finally,role models points out that its attorneys regular billing rates,which role models contends are consistent with those of other large washington law firms,far exceed the statutory cap.the government argues that none of these factors justifies a enhancement.
setting aside that there seems to be nothing particularly complex about this,it appears just the type of administrative law matter that large washington law firms handle supreme court in pierce explicitly rejected virtually all of the arguments for a enhancement that role models raises in this case.pierce explained that in order to preserve the intended effectiveness of the statutory cap,the other special factors envisioned by the exception must be such as are not of broad and general application.at.at.after giving examples of acceptable special factors,including knowledge of a foreign language or expertise in an identifiable practice specialty such as patent law,id.at.at,the court listed several factors that it deemed insufficient to merit an increase in the statutory cap.the court stated that t he novelty and difficulty of issues,the undesirability of the case,the work and ability of counsel,and the results obtained,are factors applicable to a broad spectrum of litigation they are little more than routine reasons why market rates are what they are.id.at.at citations omitted see also id.at.at we do not think congress meant that if the rates for all lawyers in the relevant city come to exceed per hour adjusted for inflation then that rate will govern instead of the statutory cap.
only one of role models justifications for a enhancement is not among those that pierce expressly rejected that its attorneys had to prepare the appeal in a relatively short period of time.but we think that pierce logic renders this consideration insufficient to support a statutory cap increase.pierce made clear that an increase in the cap is justified only by work requiring specialized skills or knowledge beyond what lawyers use on a regular basis.producing work on a short deadline hardly satisfies this standard.while we recognize that role models attorneys did a fine job in securing a favorable result,our experience with the work of many large firms convinces us that role models lawyers were far from the only ones who could have achieved that result under the same time pressure.
we agree,however,that a increase is warranted.as role models points out,the cost of living in the washington,area,as measured by the consumer price index,has risen approximately since congress imposed the cap.role models argues that the cap should be increased by the same percentage,to per hour.the government does not challenge this assertion.we have granted such adjustments in other cases,see,cooper united states ret,per curiam jones lujan,per curiam,and have found no case where we denied one.this is not surprising,as courts routinely approve adjustments.gregory sisk,the essentials of the equal access to justice act part two.accordingly,we will increase the cap to per hour.
most of the hourly rates for the,including the legal assistants and the law clerk,fall below this adjusted statutory cap.role models has the burden of justifying the rates at which these individuals billed for their time,see,blum stenson,d c ourts properly have required prevailing attorneys to justify the reasonableness of the requested rate or rates,but it has submitted no information about the prevailing market rate for law clerks and legal assistants in the washington area,nor has it referred to either of the two matrices that we have previously said litigants may rely upon when seeking fees,see covington district of columbia,p laintiffs may point to such evidence as an updated version of the laffey matrix laffey airlines.or the attorney office matrix,or their own survey of prevailing market rates in the community.role models has not even taken the basic step of submitting an affidavit detailing the experience and education.see in re north bush fee application,per curiam finding an affidavit insufficient to meet the petitioner burden of establishing the reasonableness of its attorneys hourly rates because the affiant failed to swear to any knowledge of the qualifications of the particular professionals involved covington,at finding the petitioners burden to justify its rates met where the petitioners submitted data demonstrating their attorneys experience in the legal profession and in litigating complex federal court cases,as well as information probative of their attorneys skill and reputation.because role models has justified neither the law clerk nor the legal assistants requested thus has failed to carry its will reduce those rates by percent.see united states ex rel.averback pastor medical,d,reducing two attorneys requested hourly rates because of the complete and utter lack of evidentiary support underlying their claimed hourly rate.although role models has likewise submitted nothing to justify its attorneys rates,since the adjusted statutory cap reduces those rates by well over percent we will make no further reductions.
number of hours 
role models,as mentioned,seeks reimbursement for hours of work.the government insists that hours is unreasonable,arguing that several of role models attorneys appear to have repeated each other work and adding that t his case involved no discovery,did not require any travel,did not require interview of witnesses,or involve multiple pleadings.appellees opp at.defending its request,role models argues essentially reiterating its justifications for a increase in the statutory cap that the substantial number of hours is reasonable g iven the time parameters and the complexity of the pertinent statutes and regulations.appellant reply at.it also states that the research and writing performed for the appeal was divided by factual legal areas among the attorneys,and that at no time were there parallel,work efforts.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
role models has the burden of establishing the reasonableness of its fee request,see,north,at,and s upporting documentation must be of sufficient detail and probative value to enable the court to determine with a high degree of certainty that such hours were actually and reasonably expended,in re olson,per curiam emphases omitted quoting united slate,tile composition roofers g m roofing sheet metal,cir.we agree with the government that the time records role models has offered permit no such certainty.
to begin with,many time records lump together multiple tasks,making it impossible to evaluate their reasonableness.see id.at w hen an attorney bill s for more than one task in a day,the court is left to approximate the amount of time which should be allocated to each task.with such inadequate descriptions the court can not determine with a high degree of certainty,as it must,that the billings are reasonable.footnote and internal quotation marks omitted.for example,one entry indicates that on september role models lead lawyer spent hours performing the following six tasks telecon ference with alexander conference with port,dodd,bonat regarding research review research draft brief review bankruptcy materials revise brief.another entry indicates that on october the associate spent hours on the following four tasks revise lis pendens filing call bankruptcy attorney johnson and leave message call circuit court regarding procedure for lis pendens filing finalize draft of lis pendens filing.not only do similarly lumped entries appear throughout the time records,but the two we have mentioned include time spent on bankruptcy matters,which have nothing to do with this appeal.although role models says it has deducted all time spent on bankruptcy matters,the lumping prevents us from verifying that it deducted the proper amount of time.
many time records also lack adequate detail.see in re sealed case,per curiam w e note numerous instances of documentation and specification that do not adequately describe the legal work for which the client is being billed.this makes it impossible for the court to verify the reasonableness of the billings,either as to the necessity of the particular service or the amount of time expended on a given legal task.the law clerk time records,for instance,give an identical entry,r esearch and writing for appellate brief,on eight consecutive weekdays the clerk billed,and hours on those days.such generic entries are inadequate to meet a fee applicant heavy obligation to present claims.kennecott epa,per curiam.similarly inadequate are the numerous entries in which attorneys billed simply for research and writing,or for time spent in teleconferences or one hundred in purposes of which are not provided.see in re meese,per curiam reducing an award because t he time records maintained by the attorneys,paralegals and law clerks are replete with instances where no mention is made of the subject matter of a meeting,telephone conference or the work performed during hours billed olson,at t here are multitudinous billing entries,included among other entries for a particular day,that wholly fail to state,or to make any reference to the subject discussed at a conference,meeting or telephone conference.
attorneys also billed for time spent dealing with individuals whose roles in the case are never explained.for example,on march one attorney charged over for time spent performing the following tasks emails with esters of cns telecons with alexander draft letter to bresee review public benefit conveyance regs.who are bresee and esters what is their connection to this case what is cns without answers to these questions,such time which there are many examples throughout the time manifestly inadequate.see in re donovan,per curiam w e are also compelled to deduct charges incurred when attorneys held conferences and teleconferences with persons referenced as geiser and wells.the application fails to document who these individuals are or the nature of their relationship to the investigation consequently,we can not evaluate whether such fees were reasonably incurred.
the shortcomings in the time records are particularly serious because we have no idea what it was about this case that required an investment of over six months worth of weeks.involving no discovery and presenting neither complex nor contested facts,the case presented a straightforward challenge to an agency failure to comply with its own regulations.although role models rightly observes that its attorneys had to spend time familiarizing themselves with the case,we fail to see how this justifies such a significant number of hours.we appreciate that the attorneys made substantial efforts to produce the most polished brief possible,and to be meticulously prepared to respond to the court questions at oral argument.appellant application at.but as we have said,there is a point at which thorough and diligent litigation efforts become overkill.aerotronics,united states.
duplication of effort is another basis on which the hours seem excessive.davis county solid waste mgmt.energy recovery special serv.dist.united states epa,per curiam.for example,on three separate occasions two individuals,one an associate charging over an hour,billed time for filing the same brief.similar unexplained
