we consider in this case the circumstances under which a bankruptcy court may approve nondebtor release,injunction,and exculpation provisions as part of a final plan of reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
we hold that equitable relief provisions of the type approved in this case are permissible in certain circumstances.a bankruptcy court must,however,find facts sufficient to support its legal conclusion that a particular debtor circumstances entitle it to such relief.because the bankruptcy court in this case failed to make such findings,the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court confirmation order.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
appellee national heritage foundation nhf is a public charity that administers and maintains donor advised funds dafs appellants john behrmann,nancy behrmann,the highbourne foundation,dolores anderson,and the dodie anderson foundation are among the more than donors that established dafs to be administered by nhf.
following a state court judgment of over six million dollars entered against nhf in texas,nhf filed a voluntary petition in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of virginia,seeking to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code.nhf notified its donors and other parties in interest,including appellants,of the deadline for filing proofs of claim in its bankruptcy proceeding.
as part of its reorganization plan,nhf proposed three categories of unsecured claims class iii a,consisting of a claim by the mancillas family,the holder of the texas state court judgment class iii b,consisting of claims held by nhf charitable gift annuitants and class iii c,consisting of all other general unsecured claims.although nhf contended that its donors were not creditors,it provided that a donor claim would be treated as an unsecured class iii c claim provided that the claim was allowed 
nhf proposed plan of reorganization also included certain release,injunction,and exculpation provisions collectively,the release provisions that prevented potential claimants from asserting claims against nhf,the official committee of unsecured creditors the committee,and other parties closely connected with nhf or the committee,such as nhf officers and directors,that accrued on or before the effective date of the reorganization plan.at a hearing before the bankruptcy court,nhf representative janet ridgely testified that the release provisions were essential to nhf successful reorganization as a going concern.specifically,ridgely asserted that nhf proposed plan of reorganization and bylaws required nhf to indemnify its officers and directors for costs,expenses,and liabilities arising out of lawsuits filed against them relating to acts taken in their official capacities nhf officers and directors were concerned about the possibility of protracted litigation against them relating to acts predating nhf petition for bankruptcy,and in particular litigation initiated by donors nhf officers and directors might be unwilling to continue to serve after confirmation of nhf proposed plan of reorganization if third parties could sue them for their conduct and retaining nhf officers and directors was essential to nhf success as a reorganized debtor.the bankruptcy court,however,declined to approve the release provisions,concluding that they were overly broad.
nhf counsel subsequently filed revisions to the release provisions that narrowed the definition of released parties to include only nhf,the committee,any designated representatives of the committee,and any officers,directors,or employees of nhf,the committee,or their successors and assigns the released parties exculpated the released parties only with respect to claims brought by parties in interest that had filed a proof of claim or were given notice of nhf bankruptcy proceeding,and then only for acts or omissions arising out of the operation of nhf business through the effective date of the reorganization plan and explicitly provided that no parties would be released from liability stemming from nhf failure to comply with its obligations under the reorganization plan.following argument,the bankruptcy court approved the release provisions as amended and confirmed nhf plan of reorganization hereafter,the confirmed plan.
in its written order,the bankruptcy court found that the release provisions were essential to nhf reorganization and appropriate given nhf unique circumstances an essential means of implementing the confirmed plan an integral element of the transactions contemplated in the confirmed plan a material benefit for nhf,its bankruptcy estate,and its creditors important to the confirmed plan overall objectives and consistent with applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code.
the bankruptcy court order also adopted all oral findings of fact made on the record during the two days of confirmation hearings.these findings included that nhf bankruptcy was quite a unique case,id.there were legitimate interests for approving the release provisions in the reorganization plan,id.the potential for mischief was very,very high for a dissatisfied party whose claim was disallowed in the bankruptcy proceeding to sue nhf officers and directors seriatim,id.nhf obligations to indemnify its officers and directors could cause it to incur substantial legal costs in defending such claims and the release provisions served the purpose of preventing an around the plan by not allowing dissatisfied claimants to attempt second and third bites at the apple in another forum,id.
appellants thereafter appealed to the district court and also moved for a stay of enforcement of the release provisions,which the bankruptcy court granted through the pendency of the first level of review before the district court.the district court affirmed the confirmation order.appellants timely appealed to this court,and moved before the bankruptcy court for a limited stay pending appeal,which the court denied because it no longer had jurisdiction.appellants then moved before the district court for a stay,which the district court also denied.
the parties articulate differing standards of review.appellants claim that whether the confirmed plan satisfies the requirements of the bankruptcy code to include whether the plan was proposed in good faith and whether the release provisions are permissible present questions of law that are reviewed de novo.nhf responds that,however framed by appellants,the ultimate issue in this case is the propriety of the bankruptcy court approval of the release provisions.nhf argues that such a decision implicates a bankruptcy court equitable powers,and that it is well established that a court grant or denial of equitable relief is reviewed for abuse of discretion.
as to appellants claim that the confirmed plan was not proposed in good faith,and thereby fails to satisfy the requirements of the bankruptcy code,the standard of review is well settled a court finding with respect to the good faith requirement imposed under a is reviewed for clear error.in re pws holding,cir accord schwarzmann first union bank in re schwarzmann,wl,at cir,stating that the factual findings of the bankruptcy court,including a finding of good faith under a,are subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.
we need not resolve the separate question of which standard of review governs the bankruptcy court approval of the release provisions.instead,we conclude that a remand is necessary because the bankruptcy court failure to make sufficient factual findings in support of its legal conclusions does not allow for meaningful appellate review under any standard.
before we address the deficiencies in the bankruptcy court confirmation order,we first consider and reject appellants broadside contention that the confirmed plan fails to satisfy the requirements of the bankruptcy code.
confirmation of a chapter plan of reorganization requires that the plan satisfy all of the confirmation criteria set forth in a.in re byrd foods.appellants argue that the confirmed plan fails this basic requirement because the plan was not proposed in good faith,in contravention of a,and e providing in pertinent part that discharge of a debt of the debtor does not affect the liability of any other entity on such debt forecloses approval of the release provisions.
on the question of nhf good faith in proposing the confirmed plan,appellants essentially contend that the chapter filing was a sham perpetrated by nhf officers and directors to secure immunity for their fraudulent and misleading conduct in soliciting donations for dafs and in administering those funds.appellants claim that the confirmed plan evidences a concentrated effort by the houk family whose members largely comprise nhf officers and directors to extend to itself comprehensive clemency in respect of reprehensible and tortious practices.appellants br.
here,however,the bankruptcy court specifically examined the totality of the circumstances surrounding the formulation of the plan and nhf negotiations with the committee and holders of claims against nhf,all objections filed and responses thereto,and all other evidence presented during the two days of confirmation hearings.the bankruptcy court concluded specifically that nhf was a debtor as that term is defined under the code and that it filed its case and proposed its plan with the legitimate and honest purpose of reorganizing and maximizing both the value of nhf estate and the recovery to claimants.because appellants have not shown that the bankruptcy court clearly erred with respect to this finding,we reject their contention that the confirmed plan fails to satisfy the good faith requirement.
as to appellants second broad challenge to the confirmed plan,we have rejected the notion that e forecloses bankruptcy courts from releasing and enjoining causes of action against nondebtors.see menard sanford mabey in re robins,cir hereinafter robins.robins involved a reorganization necessitated by a mass tort suit arising from the use of the dalkon shield intrauterine device.in that case,the appellants sought to sue the debtor directors and attorneys as joint tortfeasors,but we permitted the bankruptcy court to enjoin these suits on grounds of equity.we noted,a gives a bankruptcy court the power to issue any order,process or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title,and confers equitable powers upon the bankruptcy courts.id.at internal quotations omitted.
we declined to retreat from this holding in stuart first mount vernon indus.loan ass n,app x cir,stating as follows 
in robins,we determined that section e does not deny the bankruptcy court the power to release liabilities of a under the terms of a chapter plan when the creditors of the approved of and accepted the terms of the plan.we recognize that there are decisions to the contrary in other circuits,but we reject first mount vernon implication that we should abandon our precedent.
id.at citations and internal quotations omitted accord in re drexel burnham lambert,cir upholding an injunction against creditors from suing a third party,given that the injunction played an important part in the debtor reorganization in re railworks,holding that a release provision enjoining the commencement of actions against nondebtors was enforceable even though broad in nature.thus,appellants blanket assertion that equitable relief in the form of nondebtor releases is never permissible under the bankruptcy code is also without merit.
next,we address whether on this record the bankruptcy court erred in entering an order approving the release provisions as part of the confirmed plan,and the district court erred in affirming that order insofar as it included the release provisions.appellants contend that the release provisions far exceed the narrow limits that courts have drawn in this area.in support of that contention,appellants direct us first to our decision in robins,where we approved a bankruptcy court decision to enjoin third party suits in favor of a channeling injunction that required claimants to assert their tort claims against a million trust res established by the debtor insurers,at.
according to appellants,however,we did so only after finding that the parties who benefited from the injunction the debtor insurers had all contributed funds sufficient to fully satisfy all claims asserted against the debtor the reorganization plan afforded all parties,including those with claims,a chance to be paid in full from the trust res the injunction was necessary to prevent suits against parties whose contribution rights against the debtor would defeat the prospects of a successful reorganization and the affected class of claimants voted overwhelmingly in favor of the proposed reorganization plan.
in contrast,appellants contend that the beneficiaries of the release provisions,nhf officers and directors,have not contributed any funds to nhf reorganization the plan does not afford recovery for claims,as evidenced by nhf objection to the claim asserted by appellant anderson on the ground that it was filed four months after the bar date the release provisions do not promote the purpose of a successful reorganization because continuation of nhf operations is not necessary for a successful reorganization,especially because there is no evidence that the service of nhf present officers and directors is necessary to nhf continued operations and the affected class of claimants did not overwhelmingly favor the confirmed plan,as appellants and all other potential class iii c creditors were barred from voting on the plan because they were classified as unimpaired.
in our view,however,a bankruptcy court need not find a precise fit between the circumstances found in robins and the case before it as a precondition to granting equitable relief.rather,whether a court should lend its aid in equity to a chapter debtor will turn on the particular facts and circumstances of the case,and our decision in robins is not to the contrary.
appellants also look to decisions from other circuits holding that nondebtor releases are appropriate only in very limited circumstances.first,appellants note the second circuit observations that the only authority in the bankruptcy code for nondebtor releases is g,which is limited to channeling injunctions in asbestos cases,and that nondebtor releases pose a potential for abuse that is heightened when releases afford blanket immunity,deutsche bank ag metromedia fiber network,in re metromedia fiber network,cir.the appellants also cite alradigm commc ns,fcc in re alradigm commc ns,cir,in which the seventh circuit denounced nondebtor releases that provided blanket immunity for pre and conduct and omissions.finally,appellants cite various other circuit and bankruptcy court cases for the proposition that only unique or unusual circumstances can justify approval of nondebtor releases.appellants br.collecting cases.we have reviewed these cases and find nothing therein inconsistent with our conclusion that a bankruptcy court is authorized to approve equitable relief in the form of the release provisions where circumstances warrant.
appellants next direct our attention to the test found in class five.claimants dow corning in re dow corning,cir,arguing that bankruptcy courts frequently employ it to determine if nondebtor releases are necessary and fair.in pertinent part,the opinion states as follows 
we hold that when the following seven factors are present,the bankruptcy court may enjoin a creditor claims against a there is an identity of interests between the debtor and the third party,usually an indemnity relationship,such that a suit against the is,in essence,a suit against the debtor or will deplete the assets of the estate the has contributed substantial assets to the reorganization the injunction is essential to reorganization,namely,the reorganization hinges on the debtor being free from indirect suits against parties who would have indemnity or contribution claims against the debtor the impacted class,or classes,has overwhelmingly voted to accept the plan the plan provides a mechanism to pay for all,or substantially all,of the class or classes affected by the injunction the plan provide
