plaintiffs john roe and john roe appeal from the judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained without leave to amend the demurrers of various catholic church entities to their first amended complaint.because the statute of limitations on the plaintiffs claims expired years before they sued,and because they did not sue in during the legislature revival window for such claims,their claims again became and the trial court correctly sustained the demurrers on that ground.
introduction 
code of civil procedure section is an interpretive beast,a frankenstein monster of legislative parts stitched together over years.and like shelley literary counterpart,this legislative monster is easily misunderstood,especially when it comes to the amendments that both lengthened the limitations period for certain childhood sex abuse claims against third parties and revived for one year all such claims that had been barred under the previous versions of the statute.consistent with our earlier decisions,we hold once more that all such actions that were time barred before the amendments took effect were revived for the calendar year only,regardless of whether the plaintiffs had yet discovered the link between their abuse as children and their adult onset of psychological injuries.after a brief summary of the few relevant facts,we will dissect the statute parts.
facts and procedural history 
john roe and john roe alleged that they were sexually molested by father robert koerner when they were children who attended a roman catholic church at a parish in calipatria john roe alleged that the molestations began in,when he was years old,and ended in,when he was years old.john roe alleged that the molestations began in,when he was years old,and ended in,when he was years old.in april,appellants sued several catholic church entities as doe defendants,stating various causes of action based on allegations that even though the defendants knew koerner had molested children who attended his church,they continued to keep koerner in place as a parish priest john roe alleged that he repressed all memory of the sexual abuse until his memories began to return in december.john roe alleged that various psychological coping mechanisms prevented him from ascertaining his damages or understanding that the abuse he suffered had been wrongful.both alleged that they sued within three years of discovering that psychological injury occurring during adulthood was caused by the abuse 
under the statute of limitations then in effect,appellants claims became when each turned.based on their ages as alleged in the first amended complaint,john roe turned sometime in,and john roe turned sometime in.respondents demurrers were sustained without leave to amend because neither appellant sued during the calendar year,during which their claims had been revived by the legislature.
discussion 
relevant history of code of civil procedure section 
until,all sexual molestation claims were governed by the statute of limitations then applicable to most tort claims.see derose carswell d,suggesting delayed discovery may be available for repressed memory.if the victim was a minor,however,that period was tolled by section until the victim th birthday,meaning the victim had one year after his or her birthday to file suit.in,the legislature added section,which increased the limitations period to three years,but only for abuse of a child under age by a household or family member.hightower roman catholic bishop of sacramento th hightower.section was amended in to extend the limitations period to the later of either age or three years from the plaintiff discovery that psychological injury occurring after adulthood had been caused by the actual sexual abuse.former,subd.a.the amendment applied to only the perpetrator,meaning that claims against entities that employed or otherwise exercised control over the perpetrator were still subject to the limitations period and tolling until years old for victims who were minors when the abuse occurred.hightower,at.
in,the legislature amended section to include causes of action for sex abuse against nonabusers whose negligent or intentional acts were a legal cause of a child sexual abuse,subd.a,added by stats,ch.while subdivision a of section continued to state that the limitations period for actions based on childhood sexual abuse was the later of a plaintiff th birthday or three years from the discovery that psychological injury had been caused by the abuse,the subdivision b stated that no action against nonabusers could be commenced on or after the plaintiff th birthday.hightower,supra,th at.thus,some claims against nonabusers for sexual abuse were barred before the victim was even aware of his or her injuries once the victim turned 
in,the legislature again amended section to clarify that the amendment relating to the liability of nonabuser persons or entities applied only to actions begun on or after january,or,if filed before then,to actions still pending as of that date,including any action or causes of action which would have been barred by the laws in effect prior to january.cases that were final before that date were not revived,subd.u,added by stats,ch,shirk vista unified school dist.cal th,shirk.
in short,until january,child molestation victims had until they turned to sue nonabuser persons or entities.as of that date,the limitations period for claims against nonabusers expired on a victim th birthday.
the legislative amendment at issue here was passed in and took effect on january.it retained the limitations period for actions against childhood sex abuse perpetrators at the later of age or three years from discovery of the causal link between psychological injury and the molestation.the age cap from the amendment was retained against nonabuser entities or persons,subds.a,b,with an exception carved out for one category of such defendants.i f the person or entity knew or had reason to know,or was otherwise on notice,of any unlawful sexual conduct by an employee,volunteer,representative,or agent,and failed to take reasonable steps,and to implement reasonable safeguards,to avoid acts of unlawful sexual conduct in the future by that person,then the age did not apply,subd.b.in those cases,the statute of limitations therefore became three years from the date of discovery 
the legislature also amended section to revive for calendar year all nonabuser claims that fell within the description of section,subdivision b and would otherwise be barred because the limitations period had expired.that provision states notwithstanding any other provision of law,any claim for damages falling under subdivision b that would otherwise be barred as of january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired,is revived,and,in that case,a cause of action may be commenced within one year of january.nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to alter the applicable statute of limitations period of an action that is not time barred as of january,subd.c.
to sum up,effective,section established the limitations period for three groups of defendants in order of descending culpability for perpetrators,the later of the plaintiff th birthday or three years from discovery subd.a for nonabusers who did not take reasonable steps to safeguard minors from a known or suspected molester,three years from discovery subd.b and for all other nonabusers whose negligent,wrongful,or intentional conduct was a legal cause of the childhood sexual abuse,no later than the plaintiff th birthday subds.a,b 
the hightower decision 
in hightower,supra,th,the plaintiff alleged he was molested in the early,meaning his claims against the perpetrator and any nonabusers became when he turned in.after making a defective attempt to sue nonabusers during the revival period,the plaintiff finally filed a complaint in april.the plaintiff alleged he did not discover the cause of his psychological injuries until,claiming his action was timely under the expanded limitations period approved by the legislature in.this court rejected that contention because the legislature revival window for any subdivision b claims that had already lapsed drew a clear distinction between claims that were and those that were not.hightower interpretation would obliterate that distinction by allowing his claim to take advantage of the new limitations period,essentially sidestepping the revival period.id.at.therefore,we held,for subdivision b nonabuser claims like hightower that were barred by the statute of limitations,the only available opportunity to sue was during the revival window of.
appellants contend we were wrong in hightower because the plain language of the statute shows it was intended to allow claims like theirs the legislative history,combined with the legislature amendments to the limitations period,show that their claims were valid,especially when viewed in light of section remedial nature the legislature reenactment of section,subdivision u,which clarified the scope of the amendment that first allowed for actions against nonabuser entities up to a plaintiff th birthday,shows that subdivision b was designed to have retroactive effect under the common law equitable doctrine of delayed discovery,their causes of action did not accrue until and the longer,from discovery provision for claims against perpetrators is applicable under vicarious liability principles or because respondents were themselves perpetrators 
appellants claims are 
a.the plain language of subdivisions b and c bars the claims 
statutes are presumed to operate prospectively from the date they take effect unless they contain express language of retroactivity,or other sources provide a clear and unavoidable implication that the legislature intended a statute to apply retroactively.mcclung employment development cal th people ex rel.city of bellflower bellflower county water dist.d.this rule applies to new or amended statutes of limitation.andonagui v.the may stores th.if the new limitations period is not expressly made retroactive,it does not revive actions that are already.ibid.subdivision b,which enlarged the limitations period for a limited class of nonabusers,does not mention retroactivity and therefore by itself does not make the newly enlarged limitations period retroactive.gallo superior court d.
instead,subdivision b is made retroactive by subdivision c.as noted,subdivision c revives for the calendar year any subdivision b claims that would otherwise be barred as of january.as appellants point out,when the legislature amended section with revival provisions in subdivisions r and u,it referred to claims that were barred by the law in effect prior to the effective date of those amendments.because subdivision c does not use this language,and instead refers to claims that would otherwise be barred as of january,appellants contend the legislature intended subdivision c to apply to claims that were barred by the law existing on january,to those claims by individuals who discovered the cause of their injuries more than three years prior to the effective date of the amendment.those who had not yet made discovery were free to sue under the newly extended limitations period even if they had turned years earlier,they contend.
we disagree.instead,the plain language of the statute,along with decisions interpreting a nearly identical provision,compels a different result.we begin with section,a virtually identical statute passed in that took effect on january,in order to revive claims by property owners against their insurance companies arising from the northridge earthquake.it provides a notwithstanding any other provision of law or contract,any insurance claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake of which is barred as of the effective date of this section solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired is hereby revived and a cause of action thereon may be commenced provided that the action is commenced within one year of the effective date of this section.the statute also provides that n othing in this section shall be construed to alter the applicable limitations period of an action that is not time barred as of the effective date of this section,subd.c.
the court in th century ins.superior court th th century held that that the phrase law or contract in section,subdivision a was intended to reach the policy contractual limitations period for actions against the insurer that was mandated by insurance code section,and that the revival provision was not an unconstitutional impairment of the insurer contract rights.id.at.in discussing why section was designed to reach the contractual limitations period,the th century court said the legislative history made it clear that the legislature intended to remedy the harm caused by that provision.therefore,the term applicable statute of limitations was simply a generic reference to the limitations period that the legislature intended to reach by its enactment of section.such generic use of the term was no different than the lawyer shorthand utilized by th century itself when it demurred to the plaintiff pleadings on the ground that the statute of limitations contained in the insurance policy had expired.id.at,original italics,fn.omitted.
in another contract impairment case arising out of section,the court in rosenblum safeco ins.th,held that the provision did nothing more than reopen the filing window,for a period,to those otherwise viable cases that had become.original italics.
taken together,the rosenblum and th century decisions hold that section was designed to revive for one year only claims that,but for the limitations period,would be.section should be interpreted in the same way.when the legislature passed the amendments to section,it obviously intended to remedy the harm caused by the age date in the statute of limitations,but as to only the limited group of claims defined by subdivision b,the nonabuser who failed to take reasonable steps to guard against known or suspected child molesters.thus,the age of former subdivision b from the amendment that had been in place until the amendments took effect was the applicable statute of limitations by which subdivision b claims would otherwise be barred as of january.los angeles unified school dist.th,subdivision c has limited application to the revival of certain actions that were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations before the amendments to section became effective.
complementing this is subdivision c provision that notwithstanding any other provision of law,any claim covered by subdivision b that would otherwise be barred as of january,solely because the applicable limitations period had expired was revived and in that case,a cause of action may be commenced within one year of january.italics added.
the limitations period in place through december,for claims against all nonabuser entities was a victim th birthday.therefore,as of january,there were three groups of child molestation victims whose claims against nonabusers had already expired and were therefore otherwise barred under the limitations period those over age who had made discovery more than three years earlier those over age who had made their discovery less than three years earlier and those who had turned and had not made discovery at all.we believe the legislature meant what it said when it provided that any claim falling under subdivision b was revived by subdivision c,but for one year only.as a result,it must have included the appellants here,who fall into the third category.
appellants do not dispute that their claims were years before subdivisions b and c took effect.under subdivision c,therefore,their claims were revived,and,in that case,a cause of action may be commenced within one year of january,subd.c.the plain meaning of this language required appellants to bring their claims during the revival period.shirk,supra,cal th at subdivision b claims that were already time barred were revived by subdivision c for the year.in short,if any subdivision b cause of action was by january,and was not brought by january,it was thereafter barred again.
as for subdivision c statement that it shall not be construed to alter the applicable statute of limitations period of actions that were not as of january,it is the general rule that a new statute of limitations that enlarges a limitations period applies to actions that are not already barred by the original limitations period when the new law takes effect.andonagui v.the may stores,supra,th at.we conclude that this language was the legislature way of invoking that rule,and means only that subdivision b claims that january,and which were not already barred on that date under the previous limitations period were now subject to the newly enlarged limitations period.the language in its express terms does not apply to claims that were already barred.
after putting our statutory creature back together,we therefore conclude appellants causes of action were under the statute of limitations years before the amendments took effect on january,even though they allegedly had not yet made discovery,because appellants were or older as of january,subdivision c revived their claims as of january,but only for one year and their failure to sue during that period left their claims once more 
appellants misread the legislative history 
appellants rely on portions of the legislative history to support their interpretation of subdivision c.the first is an example found throughout the legislative history describing why the amendments are necessary after noting that many childhood sex abuse victims do not manifest trauma until well after their th birthday,the statement reads for example,a old man with a old son involved in many community and sporting events,may begin to relive his nightmare of being molested by an older authoritarian figure when he was years old and about to enter puberty.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.
appellants conclude that this example validates their interpretation of the retroactive scope of subdivision c.however,we read this as describing the prospective effect of the new limitations period.for instance,although the example mentions a childhood molestation victim who only makes discovery when he is,it does not also describe that hypothetical plaintiff as someone whose action was years before.instead,the bill analysis discusses retroactivity immediately after the cited example,with the report noting that the bill also provided that notwithstanding any other provision of law,any action for damages against a third party as provided above which is barred as of january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has expired,is revived and a cause of action thereupon may be brought if commenced within one year of january.this bill further would provide that its window period shall not alter the applicable limitations period of an action that is not as of january,and shall not apply to either claims made final after litigation on the merits or by settlement.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.
in sum,because this report discusses the retroactive effect of the amendments separately from the example that appellants rely upon,the example does not apply to the retroactivity analysis.
the next example cited by appellants comes from an analysis of the amendment prepared for the senate judiciary committee.under the subheading extending limitations period past age and reviving actions for window period has precedent,the report states in other words,this bill would provide those victims who discovered that adulthood trauma after age,whose action has been barred by the current statute of limitations,a window to bring a case against a third party that otherwise would be.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill,as amended may.appellants read this to mean that only victims who made discovery before january,were required to sue during the revival window.
however,this passage appears immediately after the following this bill would provide that,notwithstanding any other provision of law,any action for damages against a third party as provided above which is barred as of the effective date of this bill solely because the applicable statute of limitations has expired,is revived and a cause of action thereupon may be brought if commenced within one year of the effective date of this bill.as set forth above,among the claims barred by the previous limitations period were those of victims who had turned and had not yet made discovery.in fact,the plight of such victims was described as one of the key reasons the amendment was required.in the same report,under the heading stated need for legislation,the report notes that the version of section cut off all claims once a victim turned even though for many victims their adulthood trauma does not manifest itself until well after their th birthday com.on judiciary,analysis of bill,as amended may.
in short,the legislature knew that victims who had not yet made discovery were barred under the limitations period,but elected to revive for only one year any claim falling under subdivision b that had been barred by the previous statute of limitations.
the language quoted by appellants also appears elsewhere in the legislative history.a analysis by the assembly judiciary committee states this bill applies retroactively and provides victims of childhood sexual abuse a window to bring an action against a third party when that claim would otherwise be barred solely because the statute of limitations has or had expired and when the third party knew of prior claims of abuse but failed to act to prevent future abuse.under the measure,such a claim would be revived and a cause of action may be brought if commenced within one year of january,in other words,this bill would provide those victims who discovered their adulthood trauma after age,whose action has been barred by the current statute of limitations,a window to bring a case against a third party that otherwise would be.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june,italics added.when read in full,this portion of the legislative history simply mirrors the language of subdivision c claims that would otherwise be under the previous limitations period were revived for one year only.no exception is made for plaintiffs who had not yet discovered that psychological harm was linked to a childhood molestation incident.indeed the proximity of the word retroactively to the revival period demonstrates the limited nature of the retroactive effect of the legislation,not the broad retroactivity suggested by appellants.
the final piece of legislative history cited by appellants comes from an undated analysis that gives no indication by whom,or for whom,it was prepared,or that otherwise shows it is a proper subject of judicial notice.quintano mercury casualty cal th,views of individual legislators not judicially noticeable state compensation ins.fund.workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,fn.judicial notice improper if documents not properly identified kaufman broad communities,v performance plastering th.appearing under the heading who can sue after the bill passes,and when,the report states people who discover their adulthood trauma from the molestation after the effective date of the bill will have three years from the date the victim discovers or reasonably should have discovered that the adulthood trauma was caused by the childhood abuse.
according to appellants,this definitively shows that plaintiffs whose claims were under the old statute of limitations because they had turned,even though they had not yet made discovery,could bring their actions after the revival window closed.a full reading of the document shows otherwise.the quoted language is under the subheading prospective application,which falls under the general subject heading who can sue after the bill passes,and when.as mentioned earlier,amendments to statutes of limitation apply prospectively from the date they take effect.city of bellflower bellflower county water,supra,d at.therefore,the language appellants rely on does not concern the amendment retroactive effect.
instead,immediately under that general heading,and immediately before the subheading and discussion concerning prospective application,is the subheading retroactive application and revival of lawsuits.within that subheading,the document states like the northridge earthquake bill,this bill would create a window for victims to bring a lawsuit that would otherwise be barred by the age limitation.italics added.when both subsections are read together and in context,they also show that discovery made after the revival window closed would make timely only those actions that were not before the amendments took effect.as to those that were,if not brought during the revival period,they were thereafter precluded 
the reenactment of subdivision u did not restore appellants claims 
appellants contend the legislature reenactment of subdivision u as part of the amendments shows their claims could still be brought because they were filed after and because they did not make discovery until after the expanded limitations period took effect in january.in order to understand this argument,we must first recount the applicable statutory history.
as discussed,until the limitations period for childhood molestation claims against nonabuser entities was one year,extended to the victim th birthday by section.in,the legislature for the first time provided in section for an extended limitations period against nonabusers up until the plaintiff th birthday.this limitations period applied in two instances to negligent nonabusers and to intentional nonabusers,subd.a.the longer limitations period of the later of age or three years from discovery that applied to those who actually committed the molestation was set forth in subdivision a.
in,the legislature enacted subdivision s now subdivision u,which clarified that the amendments shall apply to any action commenced on or after january,and to any action filed prior to january,and still pending on that date,including any action or causes of action which would have been barred by the laws in effect prior to january.nothing in this subdivision is intended to revive actions or causes of action as to which there has been a final adjudication prior to january.
when the legislature passed the amendments at issue here,it did not repeal or delete subdivision s.instead,it retained that provision and reenacted it as subdivision u.appellants contend that because subdivision u conferred retroactive effect on subdivision a negligent nonabuser and a intentional nonabuser cases that were then pending,its reenactment in along with the subdivision b negligent nonabusers who knew of the perpetrator potential to molest and failed to take reasonable safeguards shows that the legislature intended subdivision u to apply to subdivision b cases filed after january.thus,according to appellants,the plain language of the entire statute shows their claims were timely.if not interpreted in this manner,they contend,subdivision u is surplusage because it serves no other purpose.
appellants overlook that the amendments imposed an age cap on all claims against nonabusers,without regard to when discovery occurred.if appellants are correct,then even though in,the legislature expressly revived all lapsed subdivision b claims for one year pursuant to subdivision c,it also chose to silently revive a limited subcategory of those claims where plaintiffs were over but had not yet discovered the link between the molestation and their adulthood emotional harm by way of reenacting a then provision that was designed to clarify the prospective reach of the amendments that set an age limit on claims against all nonabusers.we do not believe the legislature would take such a convoluted approach.
instead,the legislature has demonstrated that when it wants to make amendments to section retroactive,it will do so clearly and expressly.in,the legislature added what is now subdivision r,which states that the amendments applied to any action commenced on or after january,including any action otherwise barred by the period of limitations in effect prior to january,thereby reviving those causes of action which had lapsed or technically expired under the law existing prior to january.stats,ch.subdivision c is just as clear.
had the legislature intended to permit appellants claims,it should have,and we believe it would have,done so in equally clear and unmistakable terms.for instance,the legislature could have written subdivision c to state that any subdivision b claims of those plaintiffs or older who had not yet made discovery were revived and the new limitations period did not begin to run until discovery occurred.
appellants rely on bouley long beach memorial medical center th bouley to support their contention that the legislature retention of subdivision u shows that it intended to make the new limitations period of subdivision b retroactive.as set forth below,bouley is inapplicable.
at issue in bouley was a amendment to section that conferred standing in wrongful death actions to domestic partners of a decedent,subd.a bouley,supra,th at.after that amendment took effect,plaintiff sued for the wrongful death of his domestic partner.defendants demurrers were sustained,and the action was dismissed,when the trial court ruled the plaintiff lacked standing to sue under the law in effect when his partner died.the bouley court reversed,relying in part on a amendment to section that gave parents standing to sue for the wrongful death of their children,and which stated that this section applied to any cause of action arising on or after january,subd.d.when the legislature reenacted subdivision d along with the amendment giving standing to domestic partners,it must have intended to apply that retroactivity provision to the domestic partner amendment,the bouley court held.bouley,at.
based on this language from bouley,appellants contend the same should be true for subdivision u of section.we disagree.first,bouley relied on people bouzas cal d bouley,supra,th at,which only noted the rule that legislative reenactment of a statute that has been judicially construed without change is deemed to be legislative adoption of that construction.bouzas,at.that is not the issue raised as to subdivision u.
next,the statutory language involved in bouley is critically different.the amendment at issue in bouley was a blanket statement that section in its entirety applied to any cause of action arising on or after january,subd.d.as discussed above,subdivision u of section applies solely to the amendment that imposed an age cap on all claims against nonabuser entities without the distinction created four years later by subdivision b.because subdivision c is section lone express indicator of retroactive effect,subdivision u can not logically be read as plaintiffs contend 
common law equitable delayed discovery no longer applies 
because appellants allege they only recently came to recognize the wrongful nature of father koerner actions,they contend that their claims did not accrue until that time,pursuant to the common law doctrine of equitable delayed discovery.see norgart upjohn cal th.earlier versions of section expressly permitted the use of that doctrine.see former subdivision d of the version and former subdivision l of the version of section.in,however,those provisions were removed when the statute was amended and a statutory delayed discovery rule was first put in place as to perpetrators.see historical and statutory notes,west civ.proc.ed.foll.we therefore presume the legislature intended to supplant common law delayed discovery with the statutory rule it put in place as of.city of irvine southern california ass of governments th,when the legislature deletes an express provision in a later amendment related to the same subject matter,that deliberate omission indicates a different intention that may not be changed by judicial construction arcadia unified school dist.th,codified the delayed discovery rule.
appellants cite evans eckelman d,for the proposition that common law delayed discovery applies to sex abuse claims governed by section.because that decision concerned the version of the statute,which still expressly permitted use of that doctrine,it is inapplicable.likewise,appellants err by relying on california of health facilities department of health services cal th,and goodman zimmerman th,for the proposition that statutes should not be interpreted to alter the common law unless it is expressly provided.both decisions dealt with the interpretation of statutory language that was deemed to track or be consistent with common law principles.neither concerns the rule upon which we rely that when the legislature deletes a provision,we presume the legislature intended to change the existing law.
perpetrator liability theories 
finally,appellants contend they may take advantage of the longer three years from discovery limitations period provided by subdivision a because respondents are allegedly liable as perpetrators.they base this on two theories vicarious liability under the doctrine of respondeat superior and because respondents allegedly procured them as victims for koerner in violation of penal code section.see,subd e,which defines childhood sexual abuse to include violations of penal code section.
as to both contentions,the longer limitations period applicable to actions against direct perpetrators is expressly limited to actions against any person for committing an act of childhood sexual abuse,subd.a,italics added.because the liability of entities for wrongful or intentional acts is separately provided for by subdivision a and,we hold that appellants may not invoke the longer limitations period of subdivision a against respondents.
furthermore,respondeat superior liability is not available because the alleged abuse was committed outside the scope of koerner employment.farmers ins.group county of santa clara cal th,citing jeffrey central baptist church d,church not liable under respondeat superior theory for minor sexual abuse by religious school teacher mary city of los angeles cal d,fn.mark roman catholic archbishop th.
as to the procurement charge,even if the longer perpetrator limitations period of subdivision a applied to entities,and even if an entity could be subject to criminal liability for violating penal code section,appellants have not alleged a violation of that section.criminal procurement of a child occurs when someone intentionally gives,transports,provides,or makes available,or who offers to do so to another person,a child under the age of for the purpose of any lewd or lascivious act as defined in penal code section,or who causes,induces,or persuades a child under the age of to engage in such an act with another person appellants contend,without elaboration,that they alleged a violation of this statute.although they cite to the record for the location of their allegations,they do not recite their allegations or discuss and analyze how they might show a violation of penal code section.accordingly,the issue is waived.landry v,berryessa union school,supra,th at.
alternatively,we hold that their allegations are inadequate to state a violation of penal code section.the statute is violated when a defendant intentionally causes or induces a child to engage in sex acts with another,or when the defendant intentionally provides or makes a child available for those purposes.however,the first amended complaint does not allege that respondents acted with that intent.instead,it alleges that respondents created an environment where children were encouraged to trust koerner caused and induced appellants to take part in church activities with koerner and,despite their knowledge that koerner was molesting children,continued to foster that trust and encourage appellants and others to spend time alone with koerner.although such allegations,if true,show an inexcusable indifference to the safety of children attending koerner parish,they do not show that respondents actually intended for koerner to have sex with appellants.
disposition 
the judgment of dismissal is affirmed.respondents shall recover their appellate costs.
rubin,acting 
grimes,dissenting 
i respectfully dissent.
this case requires the court to construe the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse claims,specifically,claims against nonabuser entities who failed to take steps to safeguard minors from known or suspected molesters.the majority holds,as it did in hightower roman catholic bishop of sacramento th,that the delayed discovery provision of the statute does not apply to any victim who reached his birthday before january,and who did not sue during the revival period provided by the statute whether or not the victim had discovered or should have discovered the cause of his injuries.i can not agree with the majority and would hold that the statute bars only those claims of persons age or older who had discovered the cause of their injuries but did not sue during the revival period.
the majority has ably described the many permutations through which the statute reached its current state.but our concern here is only with the amendment and its application to claims against a third party nonabuser on notice of sexual abuse a defendant who knew or had reason to know of unlawful sexual conduct by an employee and who failed to take reasonable steps to avoid such conduct by that person in the future.code civ,subds.a b.before the amendment,which became effective on january,claims against such defendants to whom i will refer as nonabusers on notice were barred after a plaintiff birthday.but as of january,a plaintiff claiming damages against a nonabuser on notice must sue before his birthday or within three years of the date he discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological injury occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual abuse,whichever is later ibid.the amendment,to the details of which i now turn,also provided for the revival,for one year only,of claims against nonabusers on notice that would otherwise have been,subd.c.it is the construction of this provision that is at the heart of my disagreement with the majority.
the amendment 
the amendment is a remedial statute that the legislature intended to be construed broadly to effectuate the intent that illuminates section as a whole to expand the ability of victims of childhood sexual abuse to hold to account individuals and entities responsible for their injuries.doe city of los angeles cal th.the amendment,as relevant here,did two things.
first,as already noted,the amendment extended the statute of limitations in actions against a third party nonabuser beyond the plaintiff birthday,if the nonabuser knew or had reason to know,or was otherwise on notice,of any unlawful sexual conduct by an employee,volunteer,representative,or agent,and failed to take reasonable steps,and to implement reasonable safeguards,to avoid acts of unlawful sexual conduct in the future by that person,subd.b,added by stats,ch.as of january,claims against third party nonabusers on notice of unlawful sexual conduct by an employee may be brought within three years of the date the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual abuse,subd.a.
second,the amendment revived,for calendar year only,causes of action against such nonabusers on notice that would otherwise be barred as of january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired,subd.c,italics and boldface added the revival clause.the revival clause provides,in its entirety 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,any claim for damages against nonabusers on notice such as the doe entities that would otherwise be barred as of january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired,is revived,and,in that case,a cause of action may be commenced within one year of january.nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to alter the applicable statute of limitations period of an action that is not time barred as of january,subd.c,italics and boldface added.
thus the revival clause by its terms revives for one year claims that would otherwise be barred as of january,
the question in this case is the proper application of the amendment to actions filed after by plaintiffs who are or older.the doe entities say,and the majority agrees,that plaintiffs who were well over the age of on january,when the amendment became effective were required to bring their suit during the revival period,because their claims had lapsed under former statutes of limitations in effect through december.thus,the doe entities say,john roe claim lapsed forever in when he was,and john roe claim first lapsed in when he was and lapsed again and forever in when he was and did not take advantage of the expanded age limit enacted in.
i believe the majority misreads the plain language of the revival clause.i do not agree that under the language of that clause,a claim that has not yet been discovered may be considered to have been barred as of january,even though the new statute of limitations,effective on that date,expressly allows such undiscovered claims.undiscovered claims are governed by the statute of limitations in effect as of january,which allows such claims to be filed within three years of discovery.my conclusion flows from the plain language of the statute and is confirmed by the legislative history of the amendment.
a.the plain language of the statute 
the language of the revival clause quoted above is unambiguous it revives any claim for damages against nonabusers on notice that would otherwise be barred as of january,and the revival clause clearly states it is not to be interpreted to alter the applicable statute of limitations period of an action that is not time barred as of january,subd.c,italics and boldface added.this means that on and after january,the statute of limitations allows a plaintiff to file suit within three years of discovering that his adulthood injuries were caused by sexual abuse,no matter how old he is when he makes the discovery.the revival of actions that are as of january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired applies only to plaintiffs who do not meet the terms of the newly extended statute of limitations,specifically,people who on january,were or older and who discovered or reasonably should have discovered their injuries were caused by sexual abuse more than three years before filing suit.
in short,the amendment to the statute of limitations on its face extended the statute beyond age,for the first time,for plaintiffs who have not yet discovered their claims.the revival clause says in so many words it is not to be read to bar undiscovered claims,because it applies only to claims that are as of january,and as of january,undiscovered claims are not until three years after discovery.this,i believe,is the only reasonable interpretation of the amendment.it applies the extended statute of limitations according to its terms and it is congruent with the plain language of the revival clause in addition,my interpretation is consonant with the clearly expressed intent of the legislature.i briefly address the latter point.
b.the legislative history 
in my view the unambiguous language of the statute dictates the result in this case,but even so a court may look to legislative history for additional authority.barratt american,city of rancho cucamonga cal th.the legislative history of the amendment entirely dispels any ambiguity concerning the meaning of the words,any claim for damages that would otherwise be barred as of january.
the purpose of the amendment was to eliminate the absolute time bar of a victim birthday in a suit against a nonabuser on notice of a perpetrator previous sexual misconduct who took no action to protect children from future abuse by the perpetrator.the author of the amendment described the age time bar as an arbitrary limitation that unfairly deprives a victim from seeking redress,and unfairly and unjustifiably protects responsible third parties from being held accountable for their actions that caused injury to victims.com.on judiciary,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.further 
unfortunately for many victims,their adulthood trauma does not manifest itself until well after their birthday,when some event in their current life triggers remembrance of the past abuse and brings on new trauma.for example,a old man with a old son involved in many community and sporting events,may begin to relive his nightmare of being molested by an older authoritarian figure when he was years old and about to enter puberty.com.on judiciary,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.
the entire point of the amendment was to eliminate an arbitrary age bar that prevented abuse victims from recovering against highly culpable third who knew of previous misconduct and took no steps to protect other children from future abuse.the very example appears repeatedly in legislative reports on the that the legislature intended the amendments to apply to a old man who begin s to relive his nightmare yet under the majority reading of the statute,a person who was or older when the amendment went into effect,and who does not discover the cause of his injuries until he is,is by the very statute whose purpose was to eliminate the bar.in my view,this can not be,and is not,the case.
other documents in the legislative history are to like effect.the discussion in another report for the senate judiciary committee,after explaining that the bill would eliminate the age limitation and apply a broader statute of limitations to suits against third party nonabusers on notice,described the revival clause as follows in other words,this bill would provide those victims who discovered their adulthood trauma after age,whose action has been barred by the current statute of limitations,a window to bring a case against a third party that otherwise would be.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended may,italics and boldface added.this report makes clear the revival clause applied only to claims discovered before the new statute became effective 
in sum,i would hold that the claims of plaintiffs who were age or older as of january,but who had not yet discovered the causal link between their childhood abuse and their adulthood injuries,are not barred by the statute of limitations.

it is unclear whether the legislature intended that the three years from discovery rule of subdivision a continued to apply under the subdivision b age cap for subdivision a and cases against nonabusers.subdivision a states that the limitations period for childhood sex abuse claims is the later of age or three years from discovery,while subdivision b states that no actions against nonabusers can be brought after the plaintiff th birthday.does this mean that the three years from discovery rule has no application in that scenario,and the date is a plaintiff th birthday regardless of when or whether discovery occurred if so,then for clarity sake,subdivision b could have said so expressly.if the legislature intended that the three years from discovery rule would still apply to actions against nonabusers,how does it work is it the earlier of three years from discovery or a plaintiff th birthday if so,that would promote the policy of having victims who made discovery bring their claims sooner rather than later.and if it is not the earlier of three years from discovery or a plaintiff th birthday,what could it be it can not be the later of those two time periods because of the age date,leaving no way to reconcile the continued of the two alternate time makes no difference to our analysis,however,and for purposes of our discussion,we will assume that actions against nonabusers,except for those described in subdivision b,must be filed no later than a plaintiff th birthday.legislative clarification of this point would,however,be helpful.it is unclear whether the legislature intended that the three years from discovery rule of subdivision a continued to apply under the subdivision b age cap for subdivision a and cases against nonabusers.subdivision a states that the limitations period for childhood sex abuse claims is the later of age or three years from discovery,while subdivision b states that no actions against nonabusers can be brought after the plaintiff th birthday.does this mean that the three years from discovery rule has no application in that scenario,and the date is a plaintiff th birthday regardless of when or whether discovery occurred if so,then for clarity sake,subdivision b could have said so expressly.if the legislature intended that the three years from discovery rule would still apply to actions against nonabusers,how does it work is it the earlier of three years from discovery or a plaintiff th birthday if so,that would promote the policy of having victims who made discovery bring their claims sooner rather than later.and if it is not the earlier of three years from discovery or a plaintiff th birthday,what could it be it can not be the later of those two time periods because of the age date,leaving no way to reconcile the continued of the two alternate time makes no difference to our analysis,however,and for purposes of our discussion,we will assume that actions against nonabusers,except for those described in subdivision b,must be filed no later than a plaintiff th birthday.legislative clarification of this point would,however,be helpful.
