alicia pedreira,karen vance,and several kentucky appeal the district court dismissal of their claims against kentucky baptist homes for children,kbhc ishmun burks,secretary of the commonwealth of kentucky justice and public safety cabinet and janie miller,secretary of the commonwealth of kentucky cabinet for health and family services pedreira and vance brought suit against kbhc for its policy of firing and not hiring gay and lesbian employees,alleging discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii and the kentucky civil rights act,and the plaintiffs brought suit against all defendants for violations of the establishment clause of the first amendment.the united states district court for the western district of kentucky granted kbhc motion to dismiss the employment discrimination claims and,in a subsequent order,dismissed the plaintiffs first amendment claims against all defendants because it concluded that the plaintiffs did not have standing.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the dismissal of the plaintiffs employment discrimination claims,but we reverse the dismissal of the plaintiffs first amendment claims and remand them for further proceedings.
kbhc is funded by kentucky for its participation in the alternatives for children program,which provides placement resources for children who have been,or are at risk of being,abused or neglected.in,plaintiff alicia pedreira was terminated from her job as a family specialist at spring meadows children home,a facility owned and operated by kbhc,when members of kbhc management discovered a photograph at the kentucky state fair of pedreira and her female partner at an aids fundraiser.pedreira termination notice indicated that she was fired because her admitted homosexual lifestyle is contrary to kentucky baptist homes for children core values.after her termination,kbhc announced as official policy that i t is important that we stay true to our christian values.homosexuality is a lifestyle that would prohibit employment.
karen vance is a social worker from the louisville area.she would have applied for positions at kbhc,but because she is a lesbian,she felt that it was futile to apply due to kbhc formal and policy prohibiting gays and lesbians from employment.in,pedreira and vance brought suit against kbhc alleging violations of title vii and the kentucky civil rights act in terminating and refusing to hire gay and lesbian employees.
this employment discrimination suit was consolidated with an action brought by pedreira and vance,joined by six kentucky taxpayers against all defendants alleging violations of the establishment clause.the plaintiffs claimed that kbhc is a pervasively sectarian institution that uses state and federal funds for the religious indoctrination of children.according to the plaintiffs,kbhc has received more than million in state government funds since.kbhc acknowledges that it has received an average of million per year from kentucky over the last decade,bringing the amount to approximately million.drawing on legislative documents and budget reports,the plaintiffs contend that kentucky,in particular the secretaries of the justice and public safety department and the cabinet for health and family services,are aware that state money is funding religious indoctrination.
the plaintiffs presented the following evidence of kbhc sectarian mission.in its annual report,kbhc president announced we know that no child treatment plan is complete without opportunities for spiritual growth.the angels rejoiced last year as of our children made decisions about their relationships with jesus christ.he further committed resources to kbhc religious goals w e are committed to hiring youth ministers in each of our regions of service to direct religious activities and offer spiritual guidance to our children and families.in its news release,kbhc president said that kbhc mission is to provide care and hope for hurting families through ministries.i want this mission to permeate our agency like the very blood throughout our bodies.i want to provide christian support to every child,staff member,and foster parent.kbhc displays religious iconography throughout its facilities,leads group prayer before meals and during staff meetings,and requires its employees to incorporate its religious tenets in their behavior.kentucky contracted with a private company to conduct reviews of kbhc facilities.these reviews contain interview responses from youth describing kbhc religious practices as coercive.
the defendants filed a series of dispositive motions.the district court granted kbhc motion to dismiss pedreira and vance claims of employment discrimination,finding that sexual orientation is not a protected class under either title vii or the kentucky civil rights act and that pedreira and vance had failed to show that they had been discriminated against because of their refusal to comply with kbhc religion.pedreira.baptist homes for children,d,pedreira i.the district court denied the defendants motion for summary judgment on the first amendment allegations,finding that the plaintiffs had adequately asserted that funding to kbhc has the impermissible effect of advancing religion and therefore violates the establishment clause.id.at.the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.the plaintiffs filed interlocutory appeals for the dismissal of the employment discrimination claims,but the appeals were dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.pedreira.baptist homes for children,wl,at,pedreira ii.

the parties then filed a new round of motions.the defendants submitted,inter alia,two subsequent motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the plaintiffs submitted,inter alia,another motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and a motion for a hearing on the motions.pedreira.baptist homes for children,d,pedreira iv.the district court found that the supreme court recent opinion in hein freedom from religion foundation,d,narrowed taxpayer standing and granted the defendants motion to dismiss for lack of standing that was previously denied.pedreira iv,d at.

employment discrimination 
we review a district court grant of a motion to dismiss de novo.see mezibov allen,cir.we must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and accept all allegations as true.see rutter,cir.however,f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level and to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d.in considering a motion to dismiss,we generally look only to the plaintiffs complaint.see winget jp morgan chase bank,cir.
pedreira brought suit against kbhc pursuant to the kentucky civil rights act kcra.vance joined in the kcra suit against kbhc and additionally alleged violations of title vii.vance claims that there are positions open at kbhc for which she is qualified,but she has not applied due to kbhc policy against hiring gay and lesbian employees.however,vance has not applied for the job and thus has not shown that her failure to be hired is due to her sexual orientation.unlike pedreira,vance injury is purely speculative as she has not carried her burden of showing actions taken by the employer from which one can infer,if such actions remained unexplained,that it is more likely than not that such actions were based on a discriminatory criterion illegal under title vii or the kcra.furnco constr.waters,d quoting int l of teamsters united states,d.she has not established standing to bring a title vii or kcra claim against kbhc,and we therefore analyze the employment discrimination claims with respect to pedreira only.because pedreira brought a claim under the kcra only,we dismiss all title vii allegations against kbhc.
because the purpose of the kcra was t o provide for execution within the state of the policies embodied in title vii.a,we apply title vii precedent to assess pedreira claim under the kcra.see hamilton,cir smith leggett wire,cir.the parties do not dispute that the kcra does not prohibit discriminatory acts based on an employee sexual orientation.see.see also a vickers fairfield med,cir.the issue on appeal is whether the plaintiffs claim is covered by the kcra prohibition against employment discrimination on account of religion.see.see a.courts have interpreted the prohibition to preclude employers from discriminating against an employee because of the employee religion as well as because the employee fails to comply with the employer religion.see,hall baptist mem l health care,cir explaining that title vii scope include s the decision to terminate an employee whose conduct or religious beliefs are inconsistent with those of its employer blalock metals trades,cir.seizing on this latter interpretation,pedreira argues that living openly as a lesbian constitutes not complying with her employer religion.pedreira claims that she was terminated because she does not hold kbhc religious belief that homosexuality is sinful.
both parties extensively briefed the issue of whether pedreira established a prima facie case of discrimination.the defendants urge us to apply the traditional mcdonnell douglas framework to pedreira claim,while pedreira argues that we should treat this case as similar to reverse race and sex discrimination cases and view the protected class inquiry as inapposite.see noyes kelly,cir finding the protected class element inapplicable for reverse religious discrimination claims shapolia los alamos,cir where discrimination is not targeted against a particular religion,but against those who do not share a particular religious belief,the use of the protected class factor is inappropriate.on a motion to dismiss,however,these arguments are premature.the prima facie case under mcdonnell douglas is an evidentiary standard,not a pleading requirement.swierkiewicz sorema,d.thus,the ordinary rules for assessing the sufficiency of a complaint apply.id.at.see lindsay yates,cir noting swierkiewicz holding that an plaintiff satisfies her pleading burden by drafting a short and plain statement of the claim consistent with federal rule of civil procedure a.internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore look to see whether pedreira has sufficiently pled a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.twombly,at.
it is undisputed that kbhc fired pedreira on account of her sexuality.however,pedreira has not explained how this constitutes discrimination based on religion.pedreira has not alleged any particulars about her religion that would even allow an inference that she was discriminated against on account of her religion,or more particularly,her religious differences with kbhc.to show that the termination was based on her religion,the plaintiff must show that it was the religious aspect of her conduct that motivated her employer actions.hall,at.furthermore,pedreira does not allege that her sexual orientation is premised on her religious beliefs or lack thereof,nor does she state whether she accepts or rejects baptist beliefs.while there may be factual situations in which an employer equates an employee sexuality with her religious beliefs or lack thereof,in this case,pedreira has failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.amadasu christ,cir see vickers,at dismissing a complaint of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation for failure to state a claim under title vii.
we therefore affirm the dismissal of vance and pedreira claims for violations of the kcra.
establishment clause 
the threshold issue for the plaintiffs first amendment claims is whether they have standing,defined as whether they have allege d personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.hein,at.quoting allen wright,d.the plaintiffs have alleged standing as both federal and state taxpayers,both of which were denied by the district court.we review de novo a district court determination of standing.see schultz united states,cir.in reviewing a determination of standing,we consider the complaint and the materials submitted in connection with the issue of standing.see warth seldin,d.
the plaintiffs also appeal the district court denial of their motion for leave to submit a second amended complaint and urge us to consider the information in their second amended complaint in determining standing.to the extent that the plaintiffs second amended complaint contains new legal arguments and additional theories for recovery,the district court did not err in denying the plaintiffs motion.although district courts should freely give leave to a party to amend its pleadings when justice so requires.a,district courts can exercise their discretion to deny a motion for leave to amend based on undue delay,bad faith or dilatory motive or futility of amendment.prater ohio educ.ass n,cir quoting foman davis,d alterations in original.noting that the case had been pending in district court for almost seven years when the plaintiffs sought to file a second amended complaint,the district court found undue delay and denied their motion.we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiffs motion to the extent that it contained novel substantive arguments.see miller admin.office of courts,cir.
the district court also denied the plaintiffs amendments clarifying their standing arguments.in determining standing,the district court properly considered the proposed amendments to the complaint in order to ensure that it consider ed and addresse d fulsomely the standing arguments.pedreira iv,d at.finding that the proposed amendments still would not suffice to demonstrate standing,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for leave to amend their complaint.when a motion for leave is denied because the amended complaint would not withstand a motion to dismiss,we review the judgment of the district court de novo because the decision was based on a legal conclusion.see total benefits planning agency,anthem blue cross blue shield,cir.in determining whether the district court correctly found that the plaintiffs amendments were insufficient to establish standing,we will consider the plaintiffs amendments in the second amended complaint and the related exhibits as they relate to standing only.
federal taxpayer standing 
generally,individuals lack standing when their only interest in the matter is as a taxpayer.frothingham mellon.after years of an impenetrable barrier to taxpayer standing,the supreme court announced a narrow exception for the plaintiffs who could show that their alleged injury satisfies the following test 
first,the taxpayer must establish a logical link between that taxpayer status and the type of legislative enactment attacked.thus,a taxpayer will be a proper party to allege the unconstitutionality only of exercises of congressional power under the taxing and spending clause of art.i,of the constitution.it will not be sufficient to allege an incidental expenditure of tax funds in the administration of an essentially regulatory statute secondly,the taxpayer must establish a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.under this requirement,the taxpayer must show that the challenged enactment exceeds specific constitutiona
