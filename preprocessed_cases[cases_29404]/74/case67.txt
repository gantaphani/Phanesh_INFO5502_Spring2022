we consider two former ministers claims that the church of scientology forced them to provide labor in violation of the trafficking victims protection act.
this case centers around the church of scientology international the church and its component sea organization or sea org.the church exercises overall ecclesiastical management of the scientology religion.the sea org is an elite religious order of the church and acts as scientology evangelical wing.the sea org demands much of its members,renders strict discipline,imposes stringent ethical and lifestyle constraints,and goes to great efforts to retain clergy and to preserve the integrity of the ministry.these features of the sea org flow from the teachings and goals of the scientology religion.
scientology teaches that man is an immortal spiritual being that,over time,becomes distressed as his mind experiences moments of pain or lowered consciousness.scientology maintains,however,that man can overcome that distress he can become clear by using methods developed by scientology founder ron hubbard.scientology aims to disseminate hubbard teachings to clear the planet that is,to help enough people to overcome spiritual distress to free the planet of crime,war,and irrationality.that effort is entrusted largely to the sea org.
before embarking on that effort,each sea org member makes a symbolic commitment to serve the church.a member may make that commitment only after undergoing extensive training and study,passing a fitness exam,and obtaining a certification attesting that the applicant is qualified for sea org life.during their training,sea org members learn that the ministry will require them to work long hours without material compensation,to live communally,to adhere to strict ethical standards,and to be subject to firm discipline for ethical transgressions.the church,in turn,agrees to provide sea org members with all living necessities and a weekly allowance for incidental items.
the sea org lifestyle constraints include strict policies on outside communications,marriage,and children.sea org members mail is censored and phone calls are monitored as part of ministry discipline and policy.because sea org life may at any moment require a member indefinitely to serve anywhere in the world,the church prohibits sea org members from having children unless they leave the order.a sea org member who chooses to have a child must transfer out of the sea org but can still work for the church.and staff members in scientology religious technology center the center which promotes the orthodox practice of scientology are permitted to marry only other center staff.
sea org members learn that strict discipline is central to preserving the integrity of scientology ministry.if a member fails to meet scientology ethical standards,he may be disciplined with verbal warnings or rebukes,loss of privileges,removal from a post,diminution of responsibilities,manual labor,or expulsion.sea org members also participate in religious training and practices,including confessionals.in a confessional,a member confesses transgressions and may then be absolved or disciplined.
this demanding,ascetic life is not for everyone and is not even for many of those who go through the sea org extensive training and preparation.members thus often wish to leave the sea org for a more normal life.a member may formally withdraw his vows and leave the ministry through a process called routing out.routing out allows a member to remain a scientologist in good standing.the process involves filling out a form and normally includes participating in scientology ethics programs.routing out can take weeks or months.during that time members are excused from their posts but are expected to continue serving the church by performing chores.
some scientologists leave the sea org without routing out a practice known as blowing but the sea org discourages members from doing so.when a member leaves without routing out,other members may band together to try to locate that member and attempt to persuade him to return to the sea org.scientologists believe that such an effort known as a blow drill is integral to their efforts to clear the planet and to help their members even departed ones achieve salvation.so important is this to the church that a blown member may be disciplined if he returns or may be declared a suppressive person.being so declared is akin to being excommunicated or shunned,and can cause blown members to lose contact with scientologist family or friends.
marc and claire headley were raised in the scientology religion and joined the sea org in their teens marc in,claire in.they married in.like others who join the sea org,they knew that they would work long,hard hours without material compensation.despite this and the many other challenges of sea org life,marc and claire remained in the sea org until.they accept that they were ministers during their time with the sea org.throughout their ministerial service they repeatedly showed by word and deed that they enjoyed their work,performed it willingly,and were helping to further the sea org mission to clear the planet.
marc and claire served mostly at gold base known also as the base,the church acre international headquarters in gilman hot springs,california.they each worked more than hours a week,while the church paid their living expenses and provided them each with a weekly stipend.marc created and produced religious training films and films explaining scientology to the public.claire oversaw the center internal operations and supervised various aspects of church governance and scientology practice.she advanced to a senior ecclesiastical position.
in keeping with church disciplinary policy,the church censored the headleys mail,monitored their phone calls,and required them to obtain permission to access the internet.in addition to their normal work,marc and claire were at times assigned manual labor,sometimes as discipline.this labor was often yard or kitchen work,but some of it was more difficult or unpleasant.in,for example,marc along with hundreds of others was assigned to dried human excrement from a large aeration pond.this assignment was levied as discipline for problems in marc work.as another example,in a six to period in,claire was denied dining hall privileges,had to subsist on protein bars and water,and lost about thirty pounds.
marc and claire experienced and observed verbal reprimands and physical abuse while in the sea org.a senior scientology executive physically struck marc on two occasions and another official punched him on another occasion.a shoved claire once.marc and claire allege that they saw senior scientology leaders physically abuse other staff.
as noted above,sea org members may not have children while in the ministry.yet in the mid claire twice became pregnant.each time she had an abortion.she testified that she was told that she would be placed on manual labor and required to participate in confessionals if she did not have the first abortion.she testified further that she was told that she would face consequences if she did not have the second abortion.she says that other sea org women who became pregnant were assigned manual labor such as yard or kitchen work as tried to convince them to have abortions.
in keeping with the religious technology center restrictive marriage policy,claire was told in that she would either have to leave her position with the center and take a different position with the church or divorce marc.claire worked for the center but marc did not.claire testified that she plead ed for her position and considered divorcing marc.but the center stood by its policy and claire left the center or started the process of leaving the center late in.
throughout this period,marc and claire had innumerable opportunities to leave the church.they lived outside of the base and traveled freely to and from the base almost daily.marc traveled extensively throughout the united states and to europe,left the state to visit his father and other relatives,and traveled throughout los angeles to visit family and friends.claire similarly lived outside the base,flew on commercial jets,and traveled away from the base many times to visit family.each of them had access to vehicles and to phones and the internet.marc testified that,in his time with the sea org,hundreds of scientologists had left the sea org without even routing out.
despite the challenges of sea org life,marc and claire did not leave the sea org until.the only time marc had expressed a desire to leave was in.he was given a form and was told the risks of leaving.after thinking it over he as he later put it realized that he had made a few friends in high places and decided to stay.claire never asked to leave the sea org.
marc and claire contend that they did not leave the sea org because they believed that doing so would have been difficult or even risky due to the base extensive security,the sea org blow drills,and its approach to members who leave or wish to leave.
gold base security measures made it hard to leave unnoticed.the base which has faced security threats and which houses more than million in audiovisual equipment has security measures that include a perimeter fence,cameras,motion detectors,alarms,observation posts,and guards.
security guards monitored those thought to be disaffected with sea org life or who were suspected of wanting to leave the sea org.the headleys both testified that security or church personnel were at times posted where they lived to make sure that they did not leave.security cameras were installed over the headleys house in or.at times the headleys and other sea org members were even restricted to the base,and marc and claire each identify an occasion when they were assigned an escort when traveling away from the base.
even though they still had many opportunities to leave,the headleys contend that the sea org would have tried to get them to return.the sea org,as we have related,puts a premium on retaining its ministers and encouraging those who leave the ministry to do so through formal processes.to that end,the sea org tracks blown members,and has sent dozens of people to locate and to try to persuade members to return.in a few instances,sea org members have used physical force or restraint in blow drills even though the church directs them not to do so.in the vast majority of cases in which blown sea org members have returned,however,the record shows only that the member was located and persuaded to return not that the member was physically forced to return.one witness on which the headleys rely a former sea org member who went on every blow drill from to recalled only one instance of even arguable physical force during a blow drill.there,a member was touched on the shoulder and might have been pushed toward a car.
finally,because leaving the sea org is considered a transgression,members who returned to gold base after blowing were generally restricted to the base and assigned a job usually manual labor.claire testified,moreover,that it was considered a major transgression to want to leave the sea org and that those who discussed leaving faced discipline.a senior sea org leader told claire that she had foregone her right to leave the sea org and that,if she left,she would be brought back.
yet marc and claire each successfully left the ministry,without routing out,the first time either tried to do so.marc left in january after being told that he was under investigation for embezzlement and that he could be assigned to manual labor.claire left soon after that.though both were followed and approached by,neither was harmed,both continued on,and neither returned to the church.
looking back on his time with the sea org,marc testified thus i was saying to myself i being held against my will.i think subliminally,i think that i wanted to leave but whether or not i was being held against my will,i do think i had those thoughts.during his sea org service,marc repeatedly said that he enjoyed his experiences with the church,his promotions,and his work.on several occasions,he said,he stayed in the sea org only because of claire.
claire testified that,throughout her time with the sea org,she served the religion,believed that she was furthering its goals,believed in scientology,and thought that serving in the sea org was the right thing to do.she affirmed that she was a committed sea org member for many years,came to doubt her commitment,and left successfully the only time she tried to do so.while she was with the sea org,claire said that she enjoyed her work and she spoke well of the ministry.she encouraged her siblings to join the sea org.in her deposition,claire did not contest that she could have left the sea org earlier but said that she lacked outside contacts or financial support,did not know where to go,and did not want to lose contact with marc.she was in contact with the sea org for a month or two after she left to see if she could route out and maintain good standing with the church.she also considered returning to the sea org to route out.
in marc sued the church and claire sued the church and the center under the trafficking victims protection act.they also brought federal and state minimum wage claims,but they have abandoned those claims.enacted largely to combat the transnational crime of trafficking in persons,a,b,the act makes it a crime knowingly to provide or obtain the labor or services of a person by any one of,or by any combination of,the following means 
by means of force,threats of force,physical restraint,or threats of physical restraint to that person or another person 
by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm to that person or another person or 
by means of any scheme,plan,or pattern intended to cause the person to believe that,if that person did not perform such labor or services,that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint 
a.serious harm means 
any harm,whether physical or nonphysical,including psychological,financial,or reputational harm,that is sufficiently serious,under all the surrounding circumstances,to compel a reasonable person of the same background and in the same circumstances to perform or to continue performing labor or services in order to avoid incurring that harm.
id.c.a victim of a section a violation may sue the perpetrator for damages.id.a.
although they alleged isolated instances of physical force,marc and claire grounded their claims on the theory that the church and center psychologically coerced them to provide labor.specifically,they contended that the church and center violated the act by causing them to believe that they could not leave the ministry or that they would face serious harm in doing so.they cited evidence that it was difficult to leave the base unnoticed,that the sea org tries to get blown members to return,and that the sea org disciplines those who wish or try to leave.they also emphasized that sea org life was hard noting evidence about discipline,verbal reprimands,physical abuse,shunning,and the sea org policies regarding marriage and children.these features,they maintained,constituted psychological coercion sufficient to entitle them to recover.
the defendants contended that the headleys had not established a genuine issue of material fact on their claims and that,in any event,those claims were barred by the ministerial exception.that doctrine derived from the first amendment religion clauses provides religious employers with an affirmative defense to a claim by a minister when adjudicating the claim would infringe an employer religious liberty or would improperly entangle a court in religious matters.
the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.the court first held that marc allegations of three instances of physical force against him in years did not alone raise a triable issue of material fact on his claim.the court emphasized that,despite those assaults,the record was clear that marc was able to leave the church throughout that time and thus could have avoided providing labor.
the court then held that marc and claire claims of psychologically coerced labor were barred by the ministerial exception.the court explained that the other conduct identified to support marc and claire claim
