essie turner turner appeals the district court dismissal of her claims against richardson medical center foundation foundation and its grant of summary judgment in favor of richardson hospital authority rha on her title vii racial discrimination and retaliation claims against it.rha and the foundation collectively,appellees the district court denial of their motion for award of attorney fees.we affirm.
turner is an female.rha is a governmental subunit of the state of texas and operates a general hospital in richardson,texas.the foundation is a nonprofit texas corporation that coordinates fundraising activities for rha and publicizes the availability of the rha services to the community.the foundation board of directors and officers are not affiliated with rha and are members of the community who voluntarily serve without pay 
rha hired turner as a secretary in june.although turner was officially employed by rha,her secretarial services benefitted the foundation.turner was primarily responsible for preparing weekly reports on fundraising activity,which were distributed to several foundation officers.at no time during turner employment did more than two rha employees perform services for the foundation.
initially,turner was supervised by ed foulk,an rha employee who in turn reported to rha chief financial officer,ed berry.foulk was terminated in june,leaving turner as the only rha employee performing services for the foundation.from june to june,turner was nominally supervised by boring.turner work reviews from this period were generally positive and she received a raise and bonus.however,boring testified that some foundation board members complained about the timeliness and accuracy of her work.further,during this time turner was warned about the need to improve her organizational skills,cease excessive personal phone use,and learn to use microsoft excel spreadsheet software.
in january,rha hired mary colston,a caucasian female,to fill the position of foundation director and serve as turner direct supervisor.within several weeks,colston and turner working relationship began deteriorating.according to appellees,the difficulties arose and turner was ultimately dismissed because turner repeatedly failed to complete her work in an accurate and timely manner,was chronically tardy and otherwise failed to maintain her prescribed work schedule,engaged in excessive personal telephone and email use during business hours,and was insubordinate to colston.
turner denies appellees account of her work performance.instead,turner contends that the difficulties and her eventual discharge were a result of racial discrimination.turner alleges that colston made a series of racially insensitive or derogatory remarks to her during the course of her employment.specifically,colston allegedly discussed volunteer work she had done with children,repeatedly referring to them as ghetto children.when turner told colston that she did not want to hear these stories,colston stopped mentioning them.later,when turner mentioned to colston that she was considering taking college classes,colston allegedly told turner that she had previously worked at a university where students attended evening classes because they could not qualify for regular admission.turner also felt that colston exhibited surprise or disdain when she learned that turner shopped at an upscale shopping mall,drove a volvo,and had a son that bought and sold cars as a hobby.however,turner concedes that at no time during her employment did she complain to boring or other rha employees about racial discrimination or harassment.nor did she avail herself of rha eeoc procedure,anonymous hotline,or hospital grievance procedure for dealing with workplace discrimination.
in march,colston notified boring and rha human resources representative,connie wright,of her dissatisfaction with turner workplace behavior and performance.shortly thereafter,turner emailed boring and wright to complain about colston treatment of her during a dispute over a project,but did not mention race.after a meeting was held between colston,wright,and turner,turner was placed on administrative suspension.five days later,rha terminated turner.her position was filled by jenna holtz,a caucasian female from a agency.
turner later filed a charge of racial discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the eeoc issued turner a notice of right to sue.turner then filed suit against appellees in district court,alleging racially discriminatory discharge,creation of a hostile work environment,and retaliation in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of and.appellees moved for summary judgment on all claims.turner then filed a declaration with her response to appellees motion for summary judgment.appellees moved to strike turner declaration,arguing that it was introduced in bad faith and contradicted her prior deposition testimony.appellees also moved for an award of the attorney fees incurred in responding to turner declaration.
the district court dismissed all claims against the foundation as a matter of law and granted summary judgment in favor of rha on the remaining claims against it.the district court then denied appellees motion to strike as moot and denied the motion for award of attorney fees.turner appealed.appellees the denial of their motion for award of attorney fees.
we review de novo the district court ruling on a motion for summary judgment,applying the same legal standard as the district court in the first instance.wyatt hunt plywood,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c see also wyatt,at.when assessing whether a dispute to any material fact exists,we consider all of the evidence in the record but refrain from making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.instead,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.wyatt,at.however,a party can not defeat summary judgment with conclusory allegations,unsubstantiated assertions,or only a scintilla of evidence.little liquid air,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if a reasonable jury could not return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
turner first argues that the district court erred in dismissing her claims against the foundation as a matter of law.as title vii prohibits discrimination in the employment context,see a,generally only employers may be liable under title vii.see oden oktibbeha county,cir.in an attempt to bring her title vii claims against both the foundation and rha,turner argued in her response to appellees motion for summary judgment that the foundation and rha could be considered a single entity under an theory of enterprise liability.the district court held that the foundation and rha were not a single integrated enterprise and dismissed turner claims against the foundation as a matter of law in her motion for new trial,turner argued for the first time that the foundation and rha could be considered a single entity under a theory of liability.the district court held that this argument was waived due to turner failure to raise it prior to the entry of judgment.
on appeal,turner argues that the district court erred in finding that turner was not an employee of the foundation under either an or theory of enterprise liability appellees maintain that turner waived the argument,and,regardless,that turner was not an employee of the foundation under either theory of liability.
we generally evaluate title vii employer status under the trevino test,which involves consideration of interrelation of operations centralized control of labor relations common management and common ownership or financial control.see vance union planters,cir citing trevino celanese,cir.we place highest importance on the second factor,rephrasing and specifying it so as to boil down to an inquiry of what entity made the final decisions regarding employment matters related to the person claiming discrimination.chaiffetz robertson research holding,cir quoting odriozola superior cosmetic distributors.
in making her argument,turner implies that rha and the foundation shared common control over her employment.however,the record clearly belies this suggestion.turner was both hired and fired by rha.turner was never paid,supervised,or disciplined by the foundation.turner supervisor,colston,was an rha employee who reported to boring,rha ceo.rha,then,clearly made the final decisions regarding employment matters related to turner.see chaiffetz,at.further,turner has presented no evidence of centralized control of labor relations.the only evidence of common ownership or management between the foundation and rha is boring seat on the foundation board.although turner job activities may have benefitted the foundation,this fact does not overcome her inability to meet the trevino criteria.further,our prior case law suggests that a government employer,such as rha,may not be considered part of an integrated enterprise under the trevino framework.see trevino,at.accordingly,the district court did not err in finding that the foundation and rha were not an integrated enterprise under title vii.
the district court declined to consider turner argument,based on virgo riviera beach,cir,on the ground that it was waived because turner failed to raise it prior to the entry of judgment.motions for a new trial or to alter or amend a judgment must clearly establish either a manifest error of law or fact or must present newly discovered evidence.these motions can not be used to raise arguments which could,and should,have been made before the judgment issued.moreover,they can not be used to argue a case under a new legal theory.simon united states,cir quoting fed.deposit ins.meyer,cir.because turner did not raise the theory of liability until her motion for new trial,the district court did not err in deeming it waived.further,this argument clearly lacks merit,as turner has made no showing that the foundation retained for itself sufficient control of the terms and conditions of turner employment.virgo,at.
we therefore find that turner has not shown that she was an employee of the foundation.accordingly,the district court did not err in dismissing turner claims against the foundation as a matter of law.
turner also appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of rha on the racially discriminatory discharge,creation of a hostile work environment,and retaliation claims against it.
title vii provides that i t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge any individual,or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.a plaintiff can prove title vii discrimination through direct or circumstantial evidence.laxton gap,cir.where,as here,there is no evidence of direct discrimination,title vii discrimination claims based on circumstantial evidence are analyzed under the framework established in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see rutherford harris county,cir.under the mcdonnell douglas framework,a plaintiff must first present a prima facie case of discrimination.in order to show a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge,a plaintiff must first establish that she is a member of a protected class,was subjected to an adverse employment action,was qualified for her position,and was replaced by someone outside of the protected class.rutherford,at.
if a plaintiff is successful in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination,the employer must rebut a presumption of discrimination by articulating a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.auguster vermilion parish sch,cir.if the employer meets its burden,then it shifts back to the plaintiff to present substantial evidence that the employer reason was pretext for discrimination.id.if the plaintiff can show that the proffered explanation is merely pretextual,that showing,when coupled with the prima facie case,will usually be sufficient to survive summary judgment.reeves sanderson plumbing products,d.
for summary judgment purposes,rha concedes that turner has established a prima facie case.however,rha articulates a host of legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for her termination related to the quality and timeliness of her work,insubordination,chronic tardiness,and excessive personal telephone and email use during business hours.turner primarily relies upon her own declaration,which largely consists of conclusory assertions rebutting rha reasons,to establish pretext.conclusory statements are not competent evidence to defeat summary judgment.see topalian ehrman,cir.instead,turner must offer specific evidence refuting the factual allegations underlying rha reasons for her termination.see enplanar,marsh,cir.
as a threshold matter,turner attempts to establish pretext by pointing to the fact that rha failed to adhere to the disciplinary procedures set forth in its employee handbook.a defendant failure to follow its own policy is not probative of discriminatory animus in absence of proof that the plaintiff was treated differently than other employees because title vii does not protect employees from the arbitrary employment practices of their employer,only their discriminatory impact.upshaw dallas heart group.turner has introduced no evidence suggesting that rha adhered to its disciplinary policies differently in cases involving employees.therefore,rha alleged failure to follow its policy does not serve to establish pretext.
even if we assume that,through her declaration,turner has presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that some of rha reasons were pretextual,she has clearly failed to do so for others.rha contends that turner failed to complete a core part of her job,the preparation of weekly donor reports,in an accurate and timely manner.turner was responsible for creating weekly reports of donor activity using the excel software.this report was to be completed by every friday so that foundation officials could review it over the weekend.colston testified that turner repeatedly made formatting mistakes in the report and completed it late.in her declaration,turner states that she produced timely and accurate excel reports,that the errors found in the reports were due to colston failure to provide turner with complete data,and that she had mastered the excel program.however,in her own deposition testimony,turner admits to making formatting mistakes on multiple occasions,completing the report after the deadline had passed,and relying upon an employee from rha accounting department,theresa,to assist her in correcting the formatting errors.
the inconsistency between turner deposition and her declaration is clearest with respect to an incident that occurred on march.when turner gave the report to colston that morning,it was incorrect.turner declaration suggests that the problems were only,the result of colston failure to provide turner with a complete list of donor pledges.however,in her deposition,turner does not mention any problems with the report content.instead,turner admits that formatting corrections needed to be made to the report and that she relied upon theresa to assist her in that process,clearly evincing that at least some of the errors were not the result of insufficient information provided by colston.both the deposition and the declaration also concede that the report was not corrected by the deadline.
to the extent that turner declaration conflicts with her deposition testimony,it is not sufficient to rebut rha proffered nondiscriminatory reason for her dismissal.see erectors,infax,cir.turner has clearly failed to introduce evidence sufficient to rebut rha assertion that turner repeatedly made formatting mistakes in the excel reports and failed to complete them on a timely basis.therefore,turner has not made the required showing that her alleged firing for poor work performance is a pretext for discrimination.see auguster,at.
turner has also failed to rebut rha a
