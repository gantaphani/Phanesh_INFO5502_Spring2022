physicians committee for responsible medicine pcrm appeals from the trial court grant of summary judgment in favor of chain restaurant corporations.the trial court concluded that federal law preempted proposition warnings that grilled chicken contains a known carcinogen.we reverse.
in january,pcrm,a nonprofit organization as committed to promoting a safe and healthful diet and to protecting consumers from food and drink that are dangerous or unhealthful,filed a complaint in los angeles superior court against seven chain restaurant corporations restaurants seeking an injunction,civil penalties,and declaratory relief to prevent the restaurants from continuing to sell grilled chicken products to consumers without clear and reasonable warnings about the carcinogenic effects of those products.the complaint alleged that mcdonald,tgi friday,applebee,chili,and outback steakhouse each sold grilled chicken products to consumers in california,and that the cooking process used to grill the chicken created a chemical called phip the complaint alleged that warnings about the phip in grilled chicken were required under the california safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of,health and safety code sections et proposition,under which restaurants and other businesses must provide persons with a clear and reasonable warning before exposing consumers to carcinogenic chemicals in the food that they sell and serve.the complaint requested an injunction requiring each of the restaurants to provide warnings and pay statutory civil penalties of up to per violation and a declaratory judgment that each of the restaurants was in violation of proposition and was required to disclose that its grilled chicken contained a carcinogen.
pcrm provided responses to interrogatories in which it identified three warnings that might constitute a clear and reasonable warning under proposition,variably stating that well cooked chicken,thoroughly cooked chicken,or grilled chicken contained chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer 
warning well cooked chicken,including the chicken served in this restaurant,contains chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer.
warning thoroughly cooked chicken,including the chicken served in this restaurant,contains chemicals known to the state to cause cancer.
chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer,or birth defects or other reproductive harm may be present in foods or beverages sold or served here.some foods sold here may contain chemicals formed as a of cooking that are known to the state of california to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm.these chemicals include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phip pyridine in grilled chicken.
pcrm conceded that other warnings might satisfy the proposition requirement that any warning be clear and reasonable.
the restaurants filed a in october for a declaration that these potential proposition warnings were preempted by the federal poultry products inspection act et ppia,because they conflicted with federal policies promoting the thorough cooking of chicken to prevent the spread of foodborne illness.the described the ppia as enacted to protect consumers against poultry products that are unwholesome,adulterated or misbranded,and to this end the ppia establishes a comprehensive and uniform federal scheme regulating labeling,processing and inspection of poultry in a manner that ensures that all poultry sold to consumers is wholesome,not adulterated,and properly marked.the restaurants cited sections of the ppia prohibiting any person from selling adulterated or misbranded poultry products a and describing misbranded products as including those with false or misleading labeling.h.
the restaurants alleged that the federal food safety and inspection service fsis,a division of the united states department of agriculture usda,the agency charged with implementing the ppia,had determined that preventing foodborne illness is an important federal policy.usda had adopted safe handling instruction regulations,and had created programs to educate the public about the need to thoroughly cook meat and poultry products to avoid foodborne illness.the cited an october,letter from the usda to the california department of health services.the usda letter referenced pcrm proposition lawsuit and took the position that proposition warnings were preempted by federal policies implemented by fsis to prevent foodborne illness associated with the consumption of meat and poultry products,and the warnings therefore would cause poultry products to be misbranded under the ppia.the usda letter also stated that by implying that cooked poultry is somehow unsafe or unwholesome,proposition warnings provide a disincentive for consumers to thoroughly cook raw poultry products.
the alleged that as a result,the warnings requested by pcrm were in direct conflict with and are preempted by federal law because the warnings would have the effect of frightening consumers from properly cooking chicken,thus frustrating usda efforts to ensure that people consume thoroughly cooked chicken,and the warnings constitute labeling that would render the grilled chicken products misbranded under the ppia.the only warning not preempted was proposition safe harbor warning the safe harbor warning,which was posted in some of the restaurants during the statute of limitations period and which provides warning chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer,or birth defects or other reproductive harm may be present in foods or beverages sold here.see,tit,subd.a.the restaurants alleged an actual controversy has arisen and now exists in that pcrm contends that the safe harbor warning fails to provide clear and reasonable warning of alleged exposures to phip in grilled chicken products.
the restaurants filed a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication on the.the trial court heard the motion on november,and after orally granting the motion directed the restaurants to prepare a proposed order and judgment.the court issued an order on january,granting summary judgment for the restaurants.the trial court found that the three proposed warnings mentioning well cooked,thoroughly cooked and grilled chicken proposed by pcrm were barred by federal conflict preemption,because they would frustrate usda longstanding policy of promoting the safe cooking of chicken.the warnings also conflicted with the ppia purpose of ensuring that consumers have confidence in the wholesomeness of the chicken they consume,because if the warnings were posted regarding the chicken served in the restaurants,consumers may decide that the chicken is not wholesome and will stop eating chicken.for this reason alone,any proposition warning that pcrm is seeking would frustrate usda longstanding policy of promoting consumer confidence in the wholesomeness of chicken consumed by them.
the summary judgment order also concluded that the pcrm warnings,whether on posted signs or on packaging,would constitute labeling and would cause the chicken to be misbranded under the ppia.finally,the safe harbor warning was presumptively clear and reasonable,and pcrm could not obtain relief to require any different warning in any restaurant already providing the safe harbor warning.
the day before the filing of the order granting summary judgment,pcrm amended its discovery response to identify two more proposed warnings one stating that certain chicken products contained the carcinogen,and the proposition safe harbor warning.in february,the restaurants filed a second motion for summary judgment,again on the basis that federal law preempted the additional warnings suggested by pcrm.
the trial court granted the second summary judgment motion in an order filed on may,incorporating its january,order in full.the trial court stated that its january,order did not address the two new warnings proposed by pcrm and so did not dispose of all the causes of action in pcrm complaint.at the hearing on may,plaintiff counsel conceded that the first new warning concerning the presence of phip in certain unidentified chicken products is preempted based on the court prior summary adjudication rulings relating to the.the court took the matter under submission with respect to the safe harbor warning.the trial court noted some defendants may have posted safe harbor warnings in their restaurants prior to the case being filed or during the course of litigation.those warnings were not posted as a result of relief awarded in this lawsuit and,therefore,do not send a message about the carcinogenic content,if any,of defendants grilled chicken products.
the trial court concluded in granting summary adjudication of the,the court found that the three warnings there,if posted,would conflict directly with the united states department of agriculture longstanding polic ies of promoting the safe cooking of chicken and consumer confidence in the wholesomeness of chicken consumed by them.the court reasoned that the warnings would imply that,contrary to federal law and policy,properly cooked chicken is unsafe and unwholesome.
the court also found that the three warnings would render the chicken products misbranded under the poultry products inspection act ppia,et.
the situation here is somewhat different since the safe harbor warning says nothing about chicken,let alone grilled chicken,and does not mention phip.nevertheless,the court agrees with defendants that this is an inconsequential distinction.while the plain language of the safe harbor warning does not state that grilled chicken is unsafe and unwholesome,the context in which a safe harbor warning,or any other warning,would be posted can not be ignored.any order from this court ordering a warning to be posted would be supported by a finding that defendants grilled chicken products contain carcinogens in amounts sufficient to require warnings under proposition.such a finding would communicate a message that defendants grilled chicken products are unsafe and unwholesome even though federal law and policy hold that properly cooked chicken is safe and wholesome.indeed,an average reasonable customer probably would equate the presence of a carcinogen with unwholesomeness.for this reason,and based on the rationale in the court prior order,and based on the arguments made in defendants summary judgment papers,the court finds that the safe harbor warning,and any other possible warning pertaining to the carcinogenic contents of defendants grilled chicken products,conflict with federal law and policy,including,but not limited to,the ppia,and are preempted as a matter of law.footnotes omitted.the court granted the restaurants motion for summary judgment.
the trial court entered final judgment in favor of the restaurants on june,and pcrm filed this timely appeal.
background 
federal preemption 
the trial court granted summary judgment on the ground that providing the safe harbor warning,or any other possible proposition warnings regarding the presence of the carcinogen phip in grilled chicken,would communicate a message that the restaurants grilled chicken products were unwholesome,even though federal law and policy hold that properly cooked chicken is safe and wholesome.the court concluded that all the possible warnings under proposition regarding the presence of phip in grilled chicken conflict with federal law and policy,including,but not limited to,the ppia,and are preempted as a matter of law.the trial court finding is a finding of conflict preemption.

a.the ppia 
congress enacted the ppia,the federal statute that the restaurants claim preempts all proposition warnings for grilled chicken,in part to protect the health and welfare of consumers by assuring that poultry products distributed to them are wholesome,not adulterated,and properly marked,labeled,and packaged,rather than u nwholesome,adulterated,or misbranded.the statute states n o person shall sell,transport,offer for sale or transportation,or receive for transportation,in commerce,any poultry products which are capable of use as human food and are adulterated or misbranded at the time of such sale.a.
the statute defines person as any individual,partnership,corporation,association,or other business unit.j.a poultry product is any poultry carcass,or part thereof or any product which is made wholly or in part from any poultry carcass or part thereof,and the poultry product is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.f,h.l abeling means all labels and other written,printed,or graphic matter upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers,or accompanying such article.s.
the ppia contains an express preemption clause prohibiting states from imposing marking,labeling,or packaging requirements different from those in the federal statute with regard to articles prepared at any official establishment,which the statute defines as any establishment at which inspection of the slaughter of poultry,or the processing of poultry products,is maintained under the authority of this chapter.p.this express preemption clause does not apply to the restaurants,as the ppia exempts restaurants from its inspection requirements of the slaughter of poultry and the processing of chicken products.c.
the restaurants argue that the ppia misbranding provision prohibits them from selling in commerce any poultry product with misleading labeling,and that proposition warnings regarding phip in grilled chicken would be misleading,thus conflicting with the misbranding provision of the ppia.
proposition 
passed in by california voters to protect the health and safety of californians,proposition requires california to create and maintain a list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity,subd.a.the statute provides n o person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual,unless a specified exemption applies.proposition provides an exemption from the warning requirement for a n exposure for which federal law governs warning in a manner that preempts state authority,subd.a.
the state of california had listed phip in as a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.pcrm complaint alleged that after the grace following the listing of phip,the restaurants had not given proposition required clear and reasonable warnings to customers that grilled chicken contained the carcinogen.
the no significant risk exemption from the warning requirement 
proposition exempts from the warning requirement a n exposure for which the person responsible can show that the exposure poses no significant risk assuming lifetime exposure at the level in question for substances known to the state to cause cancer,subd.c.this exemption requires that the restaurants show that the exposure is below the level requiring a warning in any action brought to enforce section,the burden of showing that an exposure meets the criteria of this subdivision shall be on the defendant.ibid.the restaurants did not allege that the level of phip in their grilled chicken was below the level requiring a proposition warning,and there is no evidence in the record before the trial court on summary judgment regarding the actual level of phip in grilled chicken generally,or in grilled chicken sampled from any of the restaurants.
the safe harbor warning 
proposition requires that warnings be clear and reasonable.the implementing regulations provide whenever a clear and reasonable warning is required under section of the act,the method employed to transmit the warning must be reasonably calculated,considering the alternative methods available under the circumstances,to make the warning message available to the individual prior to exposure.the message must clearly communicate that the chemical in question is known to the state to cause cancer,tit.the regulations state that the warnings may be provided by using one or more methods,including product labeling,signs,or public advertising,tit,subds.a d.
the regulations also describe safe harbor warning messages,which are deemed to meet the clear and reasonable standard.see dowhal smithkline beecham consumer healthcare cal th.for food sold,served,or otherwise provided in food facilities which is intended for immediate consumption,the safe harbor warning is warning chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer,or birth defects or other reproductive harm may be present in foods or beverages sold or served here,tit,subd.a.this language is the safe harbor warning which the summary judgment order stated some of the restaurants may have posted before the case was filed or during the course of litigation.the trial court concluded that the safe harbor warning was preempted because the context under which the safe harbor warning or any other warning would be provided as a result of pcrm lawsuit would be in conflict with the federal policy under the ppia promoting the safe cooking of chicken and favoring consumer confidence in the wholesomeness of properly cooked chicken.

i.the safe harbor warning is not preempted 
a.the safe harbor warning does not create a conflict between proposition and the ppia 
even accepting all the restaurants arguments about the federal policies as shown by federal regulations and as described in the usda letter encourage the thorough cooking of chicken that the statute misbranding provision applies to grilled chicken sold in the restaurants and that the proposition warnings constitute labeling under the federal statute we do not agree that the language of the safe harbor warning creates any conflict between federal policy under the ppia and proposition.the safe harbor warning does not even mention chicken.the safe harbor warning therefore does not communicate any message about chicken of any description,whether well cooked,thoroughly cooked,or grilled.this court finds that the ppia does not preempt the safe harbor warning,because there is no conflict between the warning and any federal policy concerning chicken.there can be no conflict preemption where there is no conflict.c ourts wo seek out conflicts between state and federal regulation where none clearly exists.national meat brown,supra,at.
the restaurants assert that the conflict stems from the context in which the safe harbor warning would be viewed,if following a future determination that phip levels in grilled chicken required warnings pcrm were to obtain a declaratory judgment that phip levels required a proposition warning,and if the restaurants not already providing the safe harbor warning were required to provide it.we agree with the trial court that to the extent that the warnings are already displayed in the restaurants,the context of a court ruling is irrelevant to a preemption analysis.already existing safe harbor warnings do not come into conflict with federal law regarding poultry simply because grilled chicken may be one of multiple item categories in the restaurants that contain a chemical known to the state of california to cause cancer at a level requiring proposition warnings.
further,if some of the restaurants do not currently provide the safe harbor warning,a requirement that they do so on the basis of the phip levels in grilled chicken also does not create a conflict justifying preemption.once again,the language of the warning makes no specific reference to chicken thus,the safe harbor warning does not implicate any federal policies regarding the cooking of chicken.
at oral argument in this matter,the restaurants appeared to argue that if a court were to find that their grilled chicken products required the safe harbor warning,the safe harbor warning would be tainted by association,because pcrm could trumpet the dangers of grilled chicken by publicizing the ruling.in response to the publicity,consumers would conclude that chicken was not wholesome,would avoid buying chicken,and would avoid cooking chicken well at home,in conflict with usda policy.that scenario is not,however,a conflict between a proposition safe harbor warning and the ppia.undesirable publicity by a nonprofit organization does not create a conflict between state and federal law or policy.it is a far reach beyond traditional preemption analysis to hold that a warning otherwise not in conflict with federal law is preempted because of the possibility of accompanying publicity.further,nothing prevents pcrm from publicizing the results of its testing of grilled chicken for phip at any time.to the extent that all we fighting about here is a press release the trial court is no meaningful conflict between the safe harbor warning and the ppia.to invoke conflict preemption,the conflict must be of substance and not merely trivial or insubstantial.peatros bank of america,supra,cal th at.
b.the safe harbor warning language is presumptively clear and reasonable 
pcrm argues that the trial court erred in holding,in its first summary judgment ruling,that the safe harbor warning was clear and reasonable,because there was no evidence regarding where,how or when the safe harbor warning might be posted in the restaurants.at the time of the
