the amendment to the postal reorganization act of pra bars the use of the reduced nonprofit postage rate for mailings promoting any insurance policy if the coverage provided by the policy is generally otherwise commercially available.j b.in,appellant united states postal service postal service or usps issued regulations construing this statutory language to bar the use of the reduced rate for mailings promoting insurance of a general type,life,automobile,health that is commercially available.see,june.under the regulations,the postal service decided that appellees aid association for lutherans aal and american bar endowment abe,both nonprofit,organizations that offer insurance policies to their members and are eligible for the nonprofit postage rate,were no longer entitled to mail their material at the nonprofit rate to the extent that the insurance offered was of a general type that is otherwise commercially available.
appellees filed separate law suits in the district court,alleging that the postal service exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating the cited regulations.the district court granted judgment for appellees,finding that the regulations constitute an impermissible reading of the statute.aid ass for lutherans usps,mem.op.at,aal mem.op,reprinted in joint appendix ja,am.bar.endowment usps,mem.op.at,abe mem.op.finding the identical analysis to apply,reprinted in ja.the district court ordered the postage refund amounts due to aal and abe and entered final judgment in these cases on january,and february.see aal usps,order,abe usps,order.
appellant first contends that its regulations are not subject to judicial review,because a exempts the postal service from the judicial review provisions of the administrative procedure act apa.the postal service claims further that,if judicial review is proper,the court should defer to the agency statutory interpretation under chevron natural resources defense council,d,because the regulations reflect a permissible construction of j b.appellees,in turn,argue that,because the postal service acted in excess of its delegated authority under the statute,judicial review is available outside of the apa and the disputed regulations can not possibly survive scrutiny under any standard of review.
we affirm the judgments of the district court.judicial review is available in this case,because,as appellant concedes,appellees may challenge actions by the postal service that are outside of the scope of its statutory authority.appellees principal claim here is that the challenged regulations emanated from an ultra vires action by the postal service.we agree.therefore,it does not matter whether a precludes traditional apa review.on the merits,we hold that the postal service regulations exceed the agency delegated authority under the statute.the statute permits the agency to regulate solely with respect to coverage provided by an insurance policy.the agency ignored this limitation and focused instead on types of insurance.coverage under a policy does not mean the type of insurance offered.therefore,the regulations totally pervert the meaning of the statute.and,in so doing,the regulations effectively exclude nonprofit organizations from using the reduced nonprofit postage rate for mailings in markets in which they previously had access to the reduced rate.there is nothing in this record to indicate that this was the intention of congress in enacting j b.quite the contrary.both the clear terms of the statute and the legislative history suggest otherwise.
background 
in,congress enacted pra,et,which created the united states postal service.pra authorized the postal service to charge reduced postage rates to qualified nonprofit organizations,defined as religious,educational,scientific,philanthropic,agricultural,labor,veterans,or fraternal organizations or associations not organized for profit and none of the net income of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual,former d.id.b,c.
in,congress amended pra to place some restrictions on the use of mail.see j.one such restriction was on mailings promoting insurance policies.section j b bars the use of the reduced rate for 
mail which advertises,promotes,offers,or,for a fee or consideration,recommends,describes,or announces the availability of 
b any insurance policy,unless the organization which promotes the purchase of such policy is authorized to mail at the rates for mail under former section b or c of this title,the policy is designed for and primarily promoted to the members,donors,supporters,or beneficiaries of the organization,and the coverage provided by the policy is not generally otherwise commercially available.
id.j b.the third condition imposed by this section on the use of the reduced rates for mailings,that the coverage provided by the policy be not generally otherwise commercially available is the one at issue here.
in,pursuant to its authority to adopt,amend,and repeal such rules and regulations as it deems necessary to accomplish the objectives of this title,id,the postal service issued a final rule after notice and comment,amending its domestic mail manual and construing the language of j b.see,june.the rule,which is codified at domestic mail manual,states 
the term not generally otherwise commercially available applies to the actual coverage stated in the insurance policy,without regard to the amount of the premiums,the underwriting practices,and the financial condition of the insurer.when comparisons are made with other policies,consideration will be given to policy coverage benefits,limitations,and exclusions,and to the availability of coverage to the targeted category of recipients.when insurance policy coverages are compared for the purpose of determining whether coverage in a policy offered by an organization is not generally otherwise commercially available,the comparison will be based on the specific characteristics of the recipients of the piece in question,geographic location or demographic characteristics.
note the types of insurance considered to be generally commercially available include but are not limited to homeowner,property,casualty,marine,professional liability including malpractice,travel,health,life,airplane,automobile,truck,motorhome,motorbike,motorcycle,boat,accidental death and dismemberment,medicare supplement medigap,catastrophic care,nursing home,and hospital indemnity insurance.
id.in the preamble to the notice of proposed rulemaking,the postal service stated that the statute 
looks to the coverage provided by the policy,j b,without any indication that price or the financial conditions or practices of the insurer should modify this rule.the postal service also does not believe that the presence of unique elements in a type of policy which is otherwise commercially available is sufficient for a determination that the policy is not commercially available.in the example cited above,the primary focus of the policy was life insurance,rather than coverage to provide strike benefits.accordingly,in determining whether the policy is commercially available,the policy would be considered life insurance.
thus,to determine whether the coverage provided by the policy is not generally otherwise commercially available,j b,the postal service looks to whether the insurance policy fits into one of the broad types of insurance,life,health,automobile that are commercially available.it does not look to whether the specific terms,extent,elements,or details of the coverage provided in the insurance policy are commercially available.this sweeping regulatory exclusion is overcome only when a mailer demonstrates that an insurance policy that is within a broad type of insurance that is generally commercially available is not commercially available to the specific demographic or geographic group to whom the policy is being targeted and promoted.
appellee aal is a nonprofit,organization that offers,among other services,its own fraternal life,medical,disability,and care insurance to its members.appellee abe is a nonprofit,organization affiliated with the american bar association aba that gives charitable grants for legal research,funded through abe sponsorship of group insurance policies for aba members.the group insurance policies that abe offers to members are underwritten by major insurance carriers.aba large membership enables abe to negotiate coverage for members on more favorable terms than those available in the general insurance market.abe commonly receives annual dividends on group policies,and members,whose premiums fund the group policies,are entitled to their share of the return of the premium in the form of an insurance dividend,but most of abe insureds choose to donate those dividends to abe for its charitable purposes.both aal and abe are qualified nonprofit organizations eligible to mail qualifying matter at reduced nonprofit rates.
after the postal service issued the disputed regulations,aal submitted sample materials and requested written clarification regarding the eligibility of its mailings for the reduced rate.the postal service determined that aal mailings were mailings ineligible for the reduced rate under the new regulations.see letter from payne,msc,usps,to donna beyer,manager,record employee mail,aal,reprinted in ja.aal appealed and the postal service affirmed its decision,stating that aal offers insurance,life,health,longterm care,which are types of insurance that the postal service considers generally commercially available.also,your arguments that there are unusual benefits attached to some of these policies does not necessarily cause them to be considered not commercially available.see letter from patricia gibert,manager,customer serv.support,usps,to george miller,counsel for aal june,reprinted in ja.aal request for reconsideration was rejected.see letter from john ward,usps,to geoffrey peters,counsel for aal july,reprinted in ja.
in a separate administrative action,the postal service determined that abe mailings between march,and december,should not have been mailed at the reduced nonprofit rates,assessed a postage deficiency of against abe,and required abe to pay the regular rates for future mailings.see letter from ken britton,manager,customer serv.support,usps,to charles lynch,executive,abe,reprinted in ja.abe appealed the ruling and the postal service affirmed its decision,stating that abe 
offers insurance,life,health,death and dismemberment,which are types of insurance that the postal service considers generally commercially available.
also,your argument that the endowment insurance program is promoted solely as a vehicle for soliciting members to contribute money in the form of insurance dividends or experience credits to fund the endowment philanthropic endeavors does not necessarily cause them to be considered not commercially available.
letter from john sadler,manager,rates classification serv,usps,to richard littell,counsel for abe july,reprinted in ja.abe appealed again unsuccessfully,although the postal service subtracted from the postage deficiency the mailings made before the domestic mail manual was amended.see letter from anita bizzotto,manager,bus.mail acceptance,usps,to richard littell,counsel for abe,reprinted in ja.
aal and abe filed separate lawsuits in the district court challenging the postal service actions,alleging,inter alia,that the postal service exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating the postal regulations codified at of the domestic mail manual.aal alleged in its complaint 
the legislative history of the statute makes it clear that the intent of congress was not to include insurance such as that offered by fraternal benefit societies within the ambit of the new restrictions on the use of the nonprofit mail permit.the regulations promulgated exceed the scope of the authorizing legislation,contravene the preponderance of legislative history,were not reasonably tailored to accomplish congress objective and should therefore be set aside.
aal complaint,reprinted in ja.abe alleged in its complaint usps exceeded its authority as granted by the act because it adopted a regulation that imposed restrictions on mailings not contemplated or authorized by congress.abe complaint,reprinted in ja.
the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of aal,and granted summary judgment in favor of abe.see aal mem.op.at,ja abe mem.op.at,ja.in aal,the district court first held that a did not preclude judicial review in this case.aal mem.op.at,ja.on the merits,the district court held that the postal service regulations constitute an impermissible reading of the statute.id.at,ja.the district court noted that,under the postal service statutory interpretation,a fraternal organization would have to develop an entirely new,unique category of insurance to provide to its members different than any other insurance provided in the united states.id.at,ja.the district court reasoned that 
it is fairly apparent here that congress did not intend to restrict the type of insurance mailings to only those that would qualify under the exemption to the sort described by counsel.congress specifically noted that certain nonprofit organizations would continue to be able to qualify for this exemption if they met all of the requirements of a test.the court is puzzled by this fact,when it appears that no existing category of insurance policy that is provided by a fraternal benefit organization would meet the third part of the test.why did congress need the other two parts if it intended to disqualify all insurance policies under the third prong by considering the broad general nature of the policy life,home,auto when determining whether a similar type of insurance policy is not generally otherwise commercially available,defendant has not interpreted the exemption,it has eviscerated it.
id.at,ja.the district court declared invalid the provision of the domestic mail manual interpreting the statutory phrase at issue.see aal order,reprinted in ja.the district court found the identical analysis to apply in abe.see abe,mem.op.at,ja.
the instant appeals followed.this court ordered that oral arguments in the two cases be scheduled on the same day and that the parties coordinate briefing.in this court,there was a question as to whether the district court orders were final and appealable,since the trial court initial orders left the amounts owed by the postal service to aal and abe to be determined.see aal order,ja abe order,reprinted in ja.however,just before oral arguments in this court,the district court issued orders setting the refund amounts due to appellees and entered final judgment in both cases.see aal order,abe order.the postal service then promptly filed new notices of appeal and filed motions to consolidate the new and initial appeals in both cases.the motions were granted.thus,the disputed judgments before this court are indisputably final and appealable.
ii.analysis 
availability of judicial review 
the postal service first contends that a precludes judicial review here,because it explicitly exempts the postal service from the judicial review provisions of the apa.section a provides,in relevant part,that no federal law dealing with public or federal contracts,property,works,officers,employees,budgets,or funds,including the provisions of chapters and of title the apa,shall apply to the exercise of the powers of the postal service.a.the postal service claims that the presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action is overcome here by the explicit terms of a.we disagree.the postal service assumes that any right that appellees have to judicial review must arise under the apa.this assumption is mistaken.
there is no doubt that a exempts the postal service from the strictures of the apa in cases involving the apa procedural requirements.see,easter seal soc y for crippled children adults usps,holding that the postal service was not required to follow notice and comment rulemaking procedures.it is also established that,in pra,congress affirmatively intended to preclude judicial review of the postal service board of governors decisions to appoint and remove the postmaster general.see carlin mckean,declining to decide whether judicial review was available under the old administrative law principles when congress has explicitly exempted an agency from the apa coverage,because the court was quite certain that congress intended affirmatively to preclude judicial review of the governors decisions to appoint and remove the postmaster general.these strictures do not apply in this case,however.
in their complaints,both aal and abe allege that,in promulgating the postal regulations at issue,the postal service exceeded its statutory authority by imposing restrictions on the use of the nonprofit mail permit that were not authorized by congress.see aal complaint,ja abe complaint,ja.it does not matter,therefore,whether traditional apa review is foreclosed,because j udicial review is favored when an agency is charged with acting beyond its authority.dart united states.indeed,the postal service concedes that this court has found a narrow exception to preclusion of review,allowing a court to determine whether an agency was acting outside the scope of its statutory authority.appellant br.even where congress is understood generally to have precluded review,the supreme court has found an implicit but narrow exception,closely paralleling the historic origins of judicial review for agency actions in excess of jurisdiction.griffith flra,citing the leading case,leedom kyne,d finding judicial review proper despite statutory preclusion of judicial review,where the nlrb acted in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the nlra.
following the reasoning of american school of magnetic healing mcannulty,and its progeny,the case law in this circuit is clear that judicial review is available when an agency acts ultra vires.see,chamber of commerce reich.in other words,the apa stricture barring judicial review to the extent that statutes preclude judicial review,a,does not repeal the review of ultra vires actions that was recognized long before,in mcannulty when an executive acts ultra vires,courts are normally available to reestablish the limits on his authority.dart,at see also reich,at.appellees claims here,that the postal service exceeded its statutory authority in purporting to apply the statute,clearly admit of judicial review.
scope of review 
although there is little doubt about the availability of judicial review in this case,a question remains regarding the scope of review.as noted above,the postal service claims that,if judicial review is proper,the court should defer to the agency statutory interpretation under chevron natural resources defense council,d,because the agency interpretation of the statute reflects a reasonable construction of j b.in particular,the postal service contends that,in reviewing whether the agency exceeded its statutory authority in construing the statute,we must confine our inquiry to the question whether the regulation on its face violates j,and accordingly must limit our analysis to the first intent of congress is clear step of chevron and not venture into chevron second permissible construction step.appellant br.appellant contends that this is so because the appropriate scope of review is something akin to that appropriate in mandamus actions,ass of postal supervisors usps,national association.appellant br.
in national association,which was decided prior to chevron,we held that congress intent to vest in the postal service broad discretion in setting employee compensation and benefits and to limit judicial oversight of the exercise of that discretion did not mean that the postal service decisions were entirely insulated from judicial surveillance.courts can defer to the exercise of administrative discretion on internal management matters,but they can not abdicate their responsibility to insure compliance with congressional directives setting the limits on that discretion.national association,at.with respect to the matter at issue in this case the scope of review of postal service constructions of pra we held that t he judicial role is to determine the extent of the agency delegated authority and then determine whether the agency has acted within that authority.id.we owe a measure of deference to the agency own construction of its organic statute,but the ultimate responsibility for determining the bounds of administrative discretion is judicial.id.at citations omitted.national association thus appears almost as a harbinger of chevron.
under chevron,if the intent of congress is clear,the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.at.if congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,and the agency has acted pursuant to an express or implied delegation of authority,the agency statutory interpretation is entitled to deference,as long as it is reasonable.id.at.at.although an agency manual often may not purport to carry the force of law,see christensen harris county,d united states mead,d holding that chevron deference is due only when the agency acts pursuant to delegated authority and the agency action has the force of law,the postal service disputed regulations in this case were adopted pursuant to notice and comment rulemaking and undoubtedly were intended to carry the force of law.thus,the conditions for chevron review are clearly met.
it is unclear whether there is much of a disjunction between the tests enunciated in national association and chevron regarding the scope of review here.it is also unclear whether the scope of review in this case is,which is an odd moniker under existing law.these questions are abstractly interesting,but ultimately unimportant in the resolution of this matter.national association anticipated chevron framing of judicial review of agency statutory interpretation as an inquiry into an agency delegated authority and its action within that authority.chevron is principally concerned with whether an agency has authority to act under a statute.arent shalala.chevron analysis is focused on discerning the boundaries of congress delegation of authority to the agency and as long as the agency stays within that delegation,it is free to make policy choices in interpreting the statute,and such interpretations are entitled to deference.see also mead,at.at holding that chevron deference is due only when the agency acts pursuant to delegated authority.with these principles in mind,it is evident that the scope of review elaborated in national association is in all important respects perfectly consistent with chevron and mead.and appellant concedes that national association controls the scope of review in this case.
appellant suggestion that we must confine our inquiry to the question whether the regulation on its face violates j,and not venture into chevron second permissible construction step,makes little sense under either national association or chevron.an agency construction of a statute can not survive judicial review if a contested regulation reflects an action that exceeds the agency authority.it does not matter whether the unlawful action arises because the disputed regulation defies the plain language of a statute or because the agency construction is utterly unreasonable and thus impermissible.in this case,the postal service position seems to be that the disputed regulations are permissible because the statute does not expressly foreclose the construction advanced by the agency.we reject this position as entirely untenable under case law.see ry.labor executives ass mediation,en banc were courts to presume a delegation of power absent an express withholding of such power,agencies would enjoy virtually limitless hegemony,a result plainly out of keeping with chevron and quite likely with the constitution as well.emphasis in original see also halverson slater,quoting ry.labor executives,at oil,chem.atomic workers int l union nlrb,same ethyl epa,we refuse to presume a delegation of power merely because congress has not expressly withheld such power.natural res.def.council reilly,i t is only legislative intent to delegate such authority that entitles an agency to advance its own statutory construction for review under the deferential second prong of chevron.alteration in original quoting kansas city dep t of hous.urban.
