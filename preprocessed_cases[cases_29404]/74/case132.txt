and appellants appeal from a judgment after a court trial in favor of and respondents all claims but respondents claim for declaratory relief were dismissed before trial,and the court found in favor of respondents on that cause of action.in their timely appeal,appellants contend the trial court made three errors that warrant reversal.first,the court erroneously found in favor of respondents based on appellants excommunication from the holy hill community church church by the western california presbytery wcp.second,the court erroneously admitted evidence of events occurring after the was filed.third,the court erred when it prevented appellants counsel from a representative of the wcp whose testimony was sought by respondents.finding no prejudicial error,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in early,competing factions emerged within the church,with one group the bang faction,consisting of respondents and others initially in control.the wcp intervened,excommunicating the bang faction and placing the second group the faction,consisting of appellants and others in control of church operations.in april,the wcp and appellants initiated the litigation which is the subject of this appeal,and respondents filed a.
in the spring of,a separate dispute arose between appellants and the wcp,while around the same time,respondents repented for their past actions and sought reinstatement into the church.on may,the wcp excommunicated appellants and reinstated respondents.
in october,the court held a bench trial and granted respondents declaratory relief.appellants appealed.
b.the church and the presbytery 
the church is a nonprofit religious organization.it owns valuable real property located near downtown los angeles,on sunset boulevard property.the church governing documents are its articles of incorporation and bylaws.the church governing body is called the session,comprised of the pastor,acting as moderator,and church elders.
in,the church joined the wcp,which in turn is one of several presbyteries within the korean american presbytery church kapc.the wcp and its member churches are governed,in ascending hierarchical order,by the wcp bylaws and the kapc book of church order boco.it is undisputed that until april,the church was a member of the wcp and therefore was subject to the wcp bylaws and boco.
in late and early,reverend dong sub bang,who had been church pastor since,excommunicated the faction,consisting of members of the church,including appellants.the following events then occurred in quick succession the faction petitioned the wcp for reinstatement the bang faction purported to withdraw the church from the wcp and the wcp determined the bang faction purported withdrawal was ineffective and removed bang as pastor of the church.the wcp also removed respondents from their positions as church elders and reinstated appellants and the other excommunicated members of the faction.
on april,bang again attempted to withdraw from the wcp.he also engaged in discussions with another congregation,la sarang,about a possible merger.shortly thereafter,the bang faction and la sarang took physical control of the property and were holding worship services there.on april,the faction took back control of the property.
ongoing dispute over control of church property 
appellants and other members of the faction,with the wcp as a,filed a complaint on april,seeking declaratory relief,an injunction,and an audit and accounting from bang and respondents.bang and respondents filed a on april,claiming trespass and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,and seeking declaratory relief against appellants and the wcp as.as concisely described by the trial court in its final statement of decision,throughout the rest of the struggle for control over the property continued.the litigation in this case was heavy and several interim court orders were entered in addition and without authority,bang entered into financial arrangements with la sarang and other entities which had the effect of encumbering the property and led to other lawsuits which were filed in 
in august and january,the court denied preliminary injunctions sought by bang and respondents seeking possession and control over the property.the orders were upheld on appeal in november.
uncertainty over church leadership 
while litigation continued,the wcp appointed albert shin as the church interim moderator in september shin testified at trial that the wcp had authority to appoint an interim moderator,and that the church would need the wcp approval for him to be the church senior pastor the church did not seek the wcp approval to make shin a senior pastor until early in.instead of approving the church request,the wcp decided to remove shin as an interim moderator and send reverend jong chun suh to act as the church interim moderator.
after giving notice on april,appellants purported to conduct a congregational vote to secede from the wcp on april.the wcp,in turn,held a meeting on may,at which it concluded the church april,congregational meeting was illegal dismissed shin from the wcp for his role in the april,meeting excommunicated appellants and several others from the church and reinstated respondents into the wcp and gave them legal and administrative authority to protect church property.
the wcp withdrew as a plaintiff on may.trial was originally set for july,but was continued to october.on october,just days before the trial was scheduled to commence,respondents dismissed two causes of action from their and elected to proceed to trial on only their claim for declaratory relief.the following day,appellants dismissed their entire complaint,and bang withdrew from the lawsuit,dismissing his claims from the.
trial and final statement of decision 
judge fahey conducted a bench trial limited to the declaratory relief cause of action in the,and only against appellants.after posttrial briefing,the court issued a tentative statement of decision,considered objections,and then entered a final statement of decision finding in favor of respondents.
discussion 
to this appeal,like every other,we apply basic tenets prescribing the scope and limits of appellate review,starting with the most fundamental the presumption of correctness.an appealed judgment is presumed to be correct.we will indulge all intendments and presumptions to support the judgment on matters as to which the record is silent and prejudicial error must be affirmatively shown.citations.shaw county of santa cruz th.
article vi,section,of the california constitution provides that a judgment can not be set aside unless,after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.this fundamental restriction on the power of appellate courts is amplified by code of civil procedure section,which states that trial court error is reversible only where it affects the substantial rights of the parties,and the appellant sustained and suffered substantial injury,and that a different result would have been probable if such error had not occurred or existed.prejudice is not presumed,and the burden is on the appealing party to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.citations.waller tjd,th.
court deference to the wcp excommunication and reinstatement decisions 
appellants make four contentions regarding the trial court treatment of their purported secession from the wcp and the wcp actions in removing them from the church.they contend that,contrary to the trial court ruling there was no internal dispute permitting the wcp to intervene and assert control in because any remaining dispute did not involve church property,court intervention into matters of church membership was improper the wcp actions were a legal nullity because appellants secession vote complied with applicable procedures and the wcp lacked authority to excommunicate appellants because it violated its own procedures by acting in the absence of a petition.none of these contentions meet appellants burden of demonstrating reversible error.
standard of review 
to the extent the facts are undisputed,we review de novo the trial court conclusion that the ecclesiastical rule limits the court authority to intervene in disputes relating to ecclesiastical decisions made by the highest authority within a hierarchical religious institution.concord christian center open bible standard churches th,concord christian.to the extent our determination of this question depends on the judicial interpretation of the articles of incorporation,bylaws,and other governing documents,we must apply neutral principles of law de novo.citations.id.at.the court factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence,keeping in mind the standard applicable to any claim that a judgment or finding is not supported by the evidence in the record.under that standard,we must consider all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing parties,giving them the benefit of every reasonable inference,and resolving conflicts in support of the judgment.citations.id.at.
overview of law governing judicial deference to ecclesiastical decisions 
the first and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution apply to severely circumscribe the role of civil courts in litigation involving religious institutions.serbian eastern orthodox diocese milivojevich,milivojevich.w here resolution of the disputes can not be made without extensive inquiry by civil courts into religious law and polity,the first and fourteenth amendments mandate that civil courts shall not disturb the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical tribunal within a church of hierarchical polity,but must accept such decisions as binding on them,in their application to the religious issues of doctrine or polity before them.citation.ibid.the prohibition against civil court participation in sectarian disputes extends to issues involving membership,clergy credentials and discipline,as well as religious entity governance and administration.jones wolf,concord christian,supra,th at.new kroeger th.
by definition,a hierarchical church is one in which individual churches are organized as a body with other churches having similar faith and doctrine,and with a common ruling convocation or ecclesiastical head vested with ultimate ecclesiastical authority over the individual congregations and members of the entire organized church.citations.it has long been established that in such a hierarchical church,an individual local congregation that affiliates with the national church body becomes a member of a much larger and more important religious organization,under its government and control,and bound by its orders and judgments.citations.in contrast,a congregational church is defined as one strictly independent of other ecclesiastical associations,and one that so far as church government is concerned,owes no fealty or obligation to any higher authority.citation.concord christian,supra,th at.
in milivojevich,supra,at pages,the united states supreme court held a civil court could not constitutionally invalidate an ecclesiastical decision to defrock a bishop.the decision to defrock the bishop had been made by an ecclesiastical tribunal of a hierarchical church.the illinois supreme court held the defrocking decision could be invalidated by a court because the church action violated its own policies and rules.the united states supreme court concluded in short,under the guise of minimal review under the umbrella of arbitrariness,the illinois supreme court has unconstitutionally undertaken the resolution of quintessentially religious controversies whose resolution the first amendment commits exclusively to the highest ecclesiastical tribunals of this hierarchical church.id.at see also silo chw medical foundation cal th,selection and termination of clergy or ecclesiastical leadership should be essentially to courts.as originally stated by the united states supreme court,within a hierarchical religious entity whenever the questions of discipline,or of faith,or ecclesiastical rule,custom,or law have been decided by the highest of these church judicatories to which the matter has been carried,the legal tribunals must accept such decisions as final,and as binding on them,in their application to the case before them.watson jones.
there are limited exceptions to the general rule of judicial deference to ecclesiastical decisions.when a property dispute between two religious groups is susceptible to the application of neutral principles of law,it is proper for the civil courts to apply those principles to the dispute,rather than deferring to the adjudicatory bodies of the relevant ecclesiastical organizations.jones wolf,supra,at application of religiously neutral principles permits the court to examine religious documents for language purporting to create trusts in favor of the general church.as the california supreme court recently clarified,state courts must not decide questions of religious doctrine those are for the church to resolve.accordingly,if resolution of a property dispute involves a point of doctrine,the court must defer to the position of the highest ecclesiastical authority that has decided the point.but to the extent the court can resolve a property dispute without reference to church doctrine,it should apply neutral principles of law.the court should consider sources such as the deeds to the property in dispute,the local church articles of incorporation,the general church constitution,canons,and rules,and relevant statutes,including statutes specifically concerning religious property,such as corporations code section.in re episcopal church cases cal th.
substantial evidence of internal dispute 
we are not convinced that reversal is required based on appellants contention that there was no internal dispute to warrant the wcp intervention into church affairs in.their argument rests on language in boco,which states w hen an internal dispute arises in the local church that is within the jurisdiction of a presbytery,regarding membership in the presbytery and the ownership of church property,the right to manage the church property shall temporarily be placed within the hands of the presbytery until the dispute is resolved and the normal operation of the local church is restored.italics added.appellants acknowledge that an internal dispute led the wcp to intervene in early,excommunicating respondents,reinstating appellants,and participating as a plaintiff in filing the complaint in this case.they try to distinguish the wcp actions two years later by emphasizing that,in the interim,respondents had worshiped and participated in the management of an entirely different church,and that appellants continued to worship in and manage the affairs of the church.they claim that by the time of this court november,opinion affirming the trial court orders denying the bang faction motions for a preliminary injunction,the dispute between the two previously internal factions had ended because a t that point,respondents could no longer reclaim their membership or status in the church,reinstate bang as senior pastor,or otherwise prevail on their.once the church had resumed normal operations,there was no longer an internal dispute warranting the wcp intervention.
substantial evidence supports the trial court conclusion that there was an internal church dispute which exists to this day.when a trial court factual determination is attacked on the ground that there is no substantial evidence to sustain it,the power of an appellate court begins and ends with the determination as to whether,on the entire record,there is substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,which will support the determination jameson five feet restaurant,th.substantial evidence is evidence that a rational trier of fact could find to be reasonable,credible,and of solid value.under the substantial evidence standard of review,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment and accept as true all evidence tending to support the judgment,including all facts that reasonably can be deduced from the evidence,and must affirm the judgment if an examination of the entire record viewed in this light discloses substantial evidence to support the judgment.citations.mealy b mobile,th.
the mere fact that both factions appellants and respondents continued to participate in this case demonstrates that the dispute continued for at least as long as the case itself.after the trial court twice denied respondents motions for a preliminary injunction,the parties briefed the matter on appeal,in which the court affirmed the lower court decision.in march,appellants obtained an injunction against respondents,giving appellants control over the property.both the wcp former attorney carl sohn and its moderator reverend suh testified about a meeting in march concerning respondents ongoing efforts to get the complaint dismissed,as well as the option of settling the dispute.while the character of the dispute may have evolved over the two and a half years this case has been pending,there is no doubt the record contains substantial evidence of the continuing dispute between the two factions.the dispute about who should control church operations and church property that began in april continued up to and including the wcp decision to excommunicate appellants and reinstate respondents in april,and continues during the pendency of this appeal.
because there was no property dispute,the court correctly deferred to the decisions of the highest tribunal within a hierarchical church,here the wcp 
appellants next contend that to the extent a dispute existed,the court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the validity of the wcp actions because the questions at issue were purely ones of church governance,and doctrine and control of the church,and none related to title to the property or application of neutral principles of law to resolve a property dispute.appellants argument misconstrues the ecclesiastical rule,which requires courts to defer to the ecclesiastical decisions made by the highest authority within a hierarchical religious institution.milivojevich,supra,at under the first amendment,questions of religious polity are left exclusively to the highest ecclesiastical tribunals of a hierarchical church concord christian,supra,th at civil courts must defer to resolution of religious issues by the authoritative ecclesiastical body.the trial court properly deferred to the wcp determination that appellants attempted secession was invalid,and the church remained subject to the wcp bylaws as well as boco.thus,appellants can not show the court erred in its application of the ecclesiastical rule.
based on the ecclesiastical rule,we decline to entertain appellants arguments regarding the validity of the wcp actions 
appellants last two arguments seek to overturn the trial court ruling on the grounds that the wcp lacked authority to excommunicate them either because they validly seceded from the wcp or because no one from the church had petitioned for any action by the wcp.they argue their secession was valid even though the wcp had previously removed shin as interim moderator,because boco rules permitted a minister from the presbytery to act as a temporary moderator.however,in arguing the validity of their secession vote,they highlight the entire reason behind the ecclesiastical rule,which is that courts are to interpret ecclesiastical rules,particularly in hierarchical church organizations.no party disputes that the kapc is a hierarchical organization,consisting of various presbyteries,and that churches are subordinate to both the kapc and the presbytery to which they belong.see concord christian,supra th at explaining distinction between hierarchical and congregational church structures.
we have already determined that the court correctly deferred to the wcp decision as a higher ecclesiastical authority.similarly,the ecclesiastical rule of judicial deference to the highest authority within a hierarchical church on questions of church governance and church membership requires that we defer to the wcp decision that appellants vote to secede did not comply with boco,and that the wcp had authority to intervene.
admission of evidence post dating the cross complaint 
appellants contend the court erred when it admitted evidence regarding the wcp may decisions to excommunicate appellants and reinstate respondents to the church.they argue that evidence regarding events in was inadmissible because respondents never sought to amend the filed in april and appellants had no right to conduct discovery after the october,discovery cutoff.
broadly speaking,an appellate court applies the abuse of discretion standard of review to any ruling by a trial court on the admissibility of evidence.citations.people waidla cal th.a party challenging a trial court evidentiary rulings must demonstrate both an abuse of discretion and a consequent miscarriage of justice.pannu land rover north america,th.
we reject appellants argument that evidence the filing of the is inadmissible unless respondents filed a supplemental complaint under code of civil procedure section section permits,but does not require,a party to file a supplemental pleading in order to assert a new claim or defense.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading,a supplemental complaint or answer is permissive in the sense that no claims or defenses are lost by failure to file it.respondents never attempted to assert any new legal claim or defense.they instead simply sought to introduce evidence relevant to their existing claim for declaratory relief.the bench trial was limited to a single cause of action in respondents against appellants.the cause of action for declaratory relief described the competing contentions of the two groups as centering around whether the church is subject to the authority or control of respondents or any of them concerning the ownership,use and control of its property and whether respondents are the duly elected and presently acting members of the board of elders of the church.the nature of the relief sought in respondents already encompassed facts relevant to respondents membership status,and because that status remained in dispute as between appellants and respondents when the matter was tried before the court,there was no need to file a supplemental complaint.
appellants also argue that the court decision to admit evidence relating the wcp may actions amounted to a trial by ambush because appellants did not learn of the may events until july,two weeks before a scheduled july trial date.according to appellants,they were forced to proceed to trial,without any discovery or depositions of wcp or kapc members.however,appellants waived their ability to argue they suffered prejudice because the record does not contain evidence they requested additional discovery or asked the court for additional time to conduct discovery about the recent events.even taking as true appellants assertion they became aware of the new facts in july,the trial was continued to october,giving them sufficient time to conduct discovery if needed.instead,as the trial court pointed out in its opinion,appellants attorneys simply objected and failed to seek leave to conduct further discovery,if in fact they really wished to do so.the trial court also noted that appellants witnesses were permitted to testify about their version of events of early.if anything,counsel tactical decision against seeking permission to conduct additional discovery relating to may events waived any objection in that regard.lewinter genmar industries,th.

relevant facts 
before considering appellants arguments that it was prejudicial error to prevent their counsel from reverend suh,we summarize the relevant facts based on evidence in the record.although the wcp corporate status is unclear,appellants do not provide evidence to dispute the trial court understanding that the wcp is a corporation and reverend suh,as moderator of the wcp,was a member of its control group.nalian truck lines,nakano warehouse transportation th,a corporation control group includes officers,directors,and managing agents whose statements and actions may bind the corporation.the wcp and appellants were in the complaint that started the instant litigation,as well as named in respondents.the wcp and appellants were represented by attorney sohn from the time the complaint was filed until may,when sohn dismissed the wcp from the complaint.parker shumaker mills,llp parker mills also acted as counsel for the wcp and appellants as early as september,when parker mills attorney david yang issued a notice of expert deposition on behalf of the wcp and appellants.in addition,the court final statement of decision notes that parker mills appeared in court on october,to represent both the wcp and appellants.appellants cite to no evidence establishing when parker mills ceased acting as counsel for the wcp.
the interests of appellants and the wcp diverged in the spring of,when appellants purported to secede from the wcp,and the wcp,in turn,purported to excommunicate appellants from the church and reinstate respondents.in the meantime,the litigation between appellants and the wcp,on the one hand,and respondents and bang,on the other hand,proceeded towards a scheduled july,bench trial.on july,respondents filed a pre trial report identifying the potential for a mistrial if either of the wcp former counsel,parker mills or sohn,were permitted to reverend suh,a wcp representative respondents intended to call as a witness at trial.the trial was continued to october,and bang filed a document entitled,defendant dong bang trial brief in support of an order enjoining plaintiffs attorneys from cross examining members of the western california presbytery,their former client arguing that any of the wcp by its former attorneys would violate the attorneys duties of loyalty and confidentiality to the wcp as a former client.appellants filed an opposition,and also addressed the issue in their own trial brief.the issue then came up on the third day of trial,just before counsel for respondents called two representatives of the wcp chang woo lee and reverend suh to testify.the court deferred the issue until appellant counsel sought to reverend suh after he was called a second time as a rebuttal witness for respondents.
when appellant counsel sought to reverend suh after respondent counsel called him during his rebuttal case,the trial court heard appellant counsel argument for permitting.after confirming that counsel had represented the wcp earlier in the litigation,it rejected appellant arguments,stating,once you undertake that representation,the case law makes it pretty clear that you can not at a later time confront your own witnesses even if you delegated in part to sohn representation of the wcp a bright line has to be drawn about clients not being subjected to examination by their counsel or former counsel even at a time period after it alleged that the representation ceased.

actual conflict of interest 
each of appellants arguments about why there was no actual conflict that would trigger counsel ethical obligations under rule e center around an attorney duty to preserve confidential communications.appellants argue there was no actual conflict because no one at parker mills ever communicated directly with the wcp,and so there were no confidential communications.they also argue the agreement between the wcp and appellants eliminates any possibility that the wcp communicated information that was intended to be confidential as to appellants.finally,they argue that counsel continued representation of appellants can not be considered adverse because the wcp was no longer a party to the litigation,and any conflict in the wcp position and appellant position arose at or near the time the wcp was dismissed from the case.we examine and reject each argument below.

appellants argue there can not be a conflict between appellants and the wcp interests because the w
