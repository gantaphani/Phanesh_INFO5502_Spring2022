rosewood services,rosewood and tammy hammond,rosewood sole shareholder,brought suit under,alleging violations of constitutional rights guaranteed by the first and fourteenth amendments.sunflower diversified services,sunflower,a private corporation,and james johnson,sunflower president,moved for summary judgment arguing that qualified immunity precludes this suit.the district court held that the defendants are not entitled to assert qualified immunity because they are officials subject to the constraints of market forces.see richardson mcknight,d.the defendants bring an interlocutory appeal of the district court denial of qualified immunity we take jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
in,the kansas legislature reformed the way the state distributes funds to developmental disability service providers.see developmental disabilities reform act of.stat.ann.et.under the provisions of the act,the state department of social and rehabilitation services srs distributes state and federal funds for providing services to the developmentally disabled to community developmental disability organizations cddos.stat.ann.e.these cddos,which are private,organizations,then distribute the funds to the community services providers,who directly assist the state developmentally disabled residents.stat.ann.
when this case began,sunflower served as both the cddo and as a community service provider for five counties barton,rice,pawnee,rush,and stafford.in march,sunflower hired hammond to be a case manager.as a case manager,she worked with many of the disabled residents of these counties.while working for sunflower,hammond was approached by parents and guardians of sunflower clients who apparently were dissatisfied with the service they were receiving.hammond was asked if she would consider opening her own provider agency.in may,hammond quit her job at sunflower and formed rosewood.soon after hammond left sunflower,a number of sunflower clients switched to rosewood.
rosewood quickly became a serious competitor to sunflower for providing services to the developmentally disabled.because sunflower was also the area cddo,it was in charge of overseeing the distribution of funds to both rosewood and itself.this potential is the root of the problems between rosewood and sunflower that are the basis of this suit.eventually,hammond,in conjunction with a community group called the alliance,began lobbying to require independent cddos,a cddo that was not a service provider as well.this action apparently angered johnson.allegedly in retaliation,johnson filed baseless complaints with srs,rosewood licensing agency,and subjected rosewood to rigorous review that other service providers did not undergo.
on march,hammond and rosewood filed this suit against sunflower and johnson.the defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing,inter alia,that they were entitled to qualified immunity.because the defendants are private parties,and not government officials,the district court had to decide whether these defendants could even assert qualified immunity before determining whether qualified immunity was appropriate based on the facts of this case.
the district court concluded that a private corporation could never claim qualified immunity,and thus the court only considered johnson qualified immunity argument in detail.the district court noted that the sole argument made by the defendants was that public policy considerations warrant the extension of qualified immunity in this case.rosewood,sunflower diversified,wl at unpublished.the district court then considered the defendants arguments and held that under richardson mcknight,d,public policy considerations did not warrant permitting johnson to assert qualified immunity.the defendants timely appealed the district court decision that neither sunflower nor johnson can claim qualified immunity.we address these arguments below.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have limited jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals of denials of qualified immunity.our jurisdiction is limited to reviewing denials of summary judgment based on qualified immunity when we are present ed with neat abstract issues of law.clanton cooper,cir internal quotations omitted.we lack jurisdiction to review a denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity if the claim on appeal is based on disputed facts.see johnson jones,d.
because the issues raised on appeal do not rely on disputed facts,we have jurisdiction to decide this appeal.furthermore,the fact that the defendants are private entities does not prevent us from hearing this interlocutory appeal.see devargas mason mason,cir holding that private parties acting pursuant to contractual duties may bring interlocutory appeals from the denial of qualified immunity 
having determined that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal,we now review de novo the district court determination that the defendants can not assert qualified immunity.see bisbee bey,cir.
qualified immunity for a private corporation 
the district court held that qualified immunity only potentially shields johnson,not sunflower,from liability in this case.rosewood,wl at.the court cited cases stating that qualified immunity protected government officials and reasoned that when applied to private defendants,qualified immunity must only apply to individuals and not corporations.id.citing harlow fitzgerald,d baptiste penney,cir.the district court conclusion,however,is contrary to existing circuit precedent.
in devargas,this court stated that i n the area of immunities,the critical distinction is not between employer and individual defendants,but between defendants that are governmental bodies and other defendants.at.we further observed that the reasons for extending qualified immunity beyond government officials apply equally to all private defendants acting pursuant to contract,whether individuals or corporations.id.consequently,we held that when private parties act pursuant to contractual duties and perform governmental functions,they can claim qualified immunity.that a private party defendant is a corporation should not change this result.id.
under devargas,then,the fact that sunflower is a corporation does not preclude it from arguing that it is entitled to assert qualified immunity.we therefore hold that there is no bar against a private corporation claiming qualified immunity.
private defendants ability to assert qualified immunity 
on appeal,the defendants do not distinguish between sunflower as a corporate entity and johnson in his individual capacity in arguing that public policy concerns warrant permitting them to assert qualified immunity.as such,we consider the arguments for qualified immunity as applying to both defendants.the defendants provide two grounds to support the notion that they can assert qualified immunity qualified immunity may be asserted because sunflower is substantially overseen by srs and policy considerations warrant extending qualified immunity to them.these arguments must be addressed in light of the supreme court most recent decision on whether private parties can assert qualified immunity,richardson mcknight,d.
in richardson,the supreme court held that prison guards at a private,prison could not assert qualified immunity.the court held that a private individual is only entitled to qualified immunity if a claim of immunity is supported by historical practice or based on public policy considerations.id.at.in discussing the policy considerations,the court recognized three purposes served by qualified immunity.first,by reducing the threat of litigation,qualified immunity protect s the public from unwarranted timidity on the part of public officials.id.at.second,qualified immunity helps to ensure that talented candidates are not deterred by the threat of damages suits from entering public service.id.quoting wyatt cole,d.third,qualified immunity reduces the chance that lawsuits will distract officials from their governmental duties.id.the court determined that these considerations did not weigh in favor of permitting private prison guards to assert qualified immunity,and because there was no historical
