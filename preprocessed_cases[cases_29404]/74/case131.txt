a member of a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation requested inspection of the corporation membership list,and other books and records.the corporation refused,and the member brought a petition for writ of mandate to compel inspection.the trial court agreed with the corporation that the member sought the inspection for an improper purpose,unrelated to his interest as a member of the corporation.as a result,the court denied the petition with respect to the books and records.however,the court concluded the corporation did not timely challenge the request for the membership list as required by statute,and therefore ordered the list disclosed.both parties appeal.we conclude substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that the member sought the information for an improper purpose and the corporation challenge to disclosing the membership list was not barred by statute.we therefore reverse that part of the court judgment requiring disclosure of the membership list,and otherwise affirm.
factual and procedural background 
don parker is a member of tract association,a nonprofit homeowner association the hoa.this action arises out of his request for inspection of the hoa membership list and other records.as far as the hoa is concerned,though,the action also arises out of a dispute the hoa has with another entity known as fix the city.
parker used to be the treasurer of the hoa.when parker was treasurer,a man named michael eveloff was the president.eveloff created fix the city.according to the hoa,it had been granted the right to control a substantial amount of money.however,eveloff convinced the hoa board to transfer that money to fix the city,which used it for purposes which were of no use to the hoa.the hoa is now suing fix the city for usurping its corporate opportunity.the hoa believes that parker is aligned with eveloff and fix the city,and that he sought access to the membership list and other hoa records to use them against the hoa in the dispute with fix the city.
parker request 
on january,the same day that the hoa filed suit against fix the city the the city action,parker requested seven categories of corporate information from the hoa,including its membership list.he stated legitimate reasons for which he sought the information.for example,he stated that he wanted to inspect the hoa books to make certain the hoa was following generally accepted accounting principles.he explained that he sought the membership list for possible communications with the members to ascertain whether there have been corporate misdeeds.
parker sought the information under corporations code sections et requests under those sections may be made by a ny member of the corporation,subd.b or by the authorized number of members,subd.b.when the corporation has less than voting members,the authorized number is five percent of voting power.as we shall discuss,different procedures apply depending on whether a single member,or the authorized number of members,is making the request.parker made his request as the undersigned member,and signed it as homeowner tract.he did not state that he was acting for the authorized number of members,nor did he suggest that he had written authorizations from members holding sufficient voting power.
b.the hoa largely denies the request 
there is no serious dispute that the hoa did not fully comply with parker request.a representative of the hoa met with parker briefly and let him review certain of the documents he had sought but not all of them,and not the membership list.
parker files his petition 
on april,parker filed a petition for writ of mandate,seeking an order compelling the hoa to allow him to inspect and copy the membership list and the other books and records he had sought.as in his written request for inspection,parker asserted he had a right to inspect in his capacity as a member of the hoa.the hoa answered the petition,arguing that parker has no right to inspect,because he sought the information for an improper purpose.
d.the hoa fails to have the cases related 
on may,the hoa filed a notice of related case,in order to relate this case parker writ petition to the the city action.in its notice,the hoa argued that parker was seeking inspection in this case in order to give fix the city an unfair advantage in the the city case.parker opposed relation on both procedural and substantive grounds.on june,the court in the the city case denied relation,stating that the writ petition must be decided in a writ and receivers department,and would not be moved to the civil department in which the the city case was pending.
briefing on the writ petition 
the briefing on the merits of the writ petition turned to the issue of parker reasons for seeking inspection of the membership list and other documents.parker filed a declaration stating that he sought the information for legitimate reasons reasonably related to his interests as a member.he expressly represented that he did not make his demand for any reason related to the other lawsuit subsequently filed by the hoa after i made the demand.
the hoa presented evidence as to why it believed parker was,in fact,aligned with fix the city,and seeking the inspection in order to improperly assist fix the city in the the city action.this included evidence of the following facts parker had been aligned with eveloff in convincing the hoa to transfer the corporate opportunity to fix the city,which the hoa alleges parker accomplished by misrepresentation the hoa gave the hoa an opinion that the transfer to fix the city was lawful shortly after the transfer to fix the city was approved by the hoa board,parker and eveloff simultaneously resigned,effective april,on april,the last business day prior to his resignation,parker the hoa bank with an emergency request for a cashier check for nearly to the attorneys who had opined on the legality of the transfer the hoa current treasurer can conceive of no legitimate reason why it would be in the hoa interest to pay the attorneys with a cashier check or to speed such a payment through as a treasurer last official act that same law firm has since represented fix the city in other cases but not the the city case and parker counsel in the current writ case is the same firm that is presently representing fix the city in the the city case.
in short,the hoa painted the picture of a treasurer who,by misrepresentations and aided by a possibly biased legal opinion,convinced the board to transfer an opportunity to fix the city then quit the board,making certain that the lawyers were paid off and is now represented by the same firm that is defending fix the city against the hoa allegation that the transfer was improper.
f.the trial court grants the writ in part 
the trial court recognized that the law requires a member seeking membership lists and other corporate records to have a purpose related to his interests as a member.the court considered the facts and concluded that parker purpose was improper,stating,particularly since parker approved the transfer to fix the city and his lawyer is defending fix the city in the lawsuit,a reasonable conclusion is that parker is using his membership status to aid fix the city in defending the the city lawsuit.
based on this factual finding,the court denied parker request for corporate books and records under section.however,the court concluded the membership list must be disclosed.the court relied on section,subdivision i,which provides that,when a demand for membership lists is made by an authorized number of members,the corporation must seek an order setting aside the demand.if it does not do so,the requesting parties may seek mandamus and n o inquiry may be made in such proceeding into the use for which the authorized number seek the list.as the hoa did not timely seek a order,the court concluded,the hoa defense of improper purpose came too late insofar as the request involved the membership list.
further proceedings 
each party prepared a proposed judgment each party objected to the other proposed judgment.specifically,the hoa believed the trial court had erred in relying on section,subdivision i to allow parker to acces
