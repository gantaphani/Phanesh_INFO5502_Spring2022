trial court proceedings 
parents petition arises from a lawsuit they filed against camp and a former camp employee named keith edward woodhouse.as pleaded in the complaint,camp operated a summer camp for children in the first through sixth grades.the camp website stated we take the selection of our summer staff very seriously,so you can be confident that the staff that is chosen is whom we believe will best serve your family.woodhouse was employed by camp at various times between and.
woodhouse provided child care at a school run by camp in and but was terminated in by his supervisor for inappropriate interactions with young girls.during a camping trip at lake tahoe in approximately,the same supervisor reportedly observed woodhouse stroking a girl hair while she sat on woodhouse lap the incident was reported to child protective services but no official action was taken.later in,woodhouse was rehired by camp and began working at its summer camp,supervising young children.camp staff had further concerns about woodhouse behavior toward young girls at the summer camp,including showing inappropriate affection and allowing girls to sit on his lap.
minor began attending the summer camp in when she was eight years old.in,a camp lifeguard noticed minor sitting on woodhouse lap in the pool.woodhouse was kissing minor on the neck.the lifeguard then heard minor complain that something is poking me in the butt.at that point woodhouse left the pool with a noticeable erection and entered the bathroom.a male lifeguard followed woodhouse into the bathroom and heard sounds consistent with masturbation.despite being advised by the lifeguards upon his return from the bathroom not to hold children on his lap,woodhouse was seen with minor on his lap again and minor was later seen lying on woodhouse stomach.
two lifeguards provided written statements to camp management about the incident.a senior camp employee investigated the matter and determined there was no evidence of inappropriate touching.woodhouse was nonetheless terminated for failing to follow rules.camp never disclosed the incident to parents or the police.
parents learned about the incident in through the san jose police department investigation of allegations that woodhouse molested other children.the police interviewed minor in approximately january but the complaint alleges that parents were not told minor was a victim as opposed to a witness until april.
parents and minor with janice doe acting as minor guardian at litem filed the complaint in november after camp demurrer to their initial complaint was sustained with leave to amend.the complaint contains eight causes of action related to minor attendance at the summer camp assault and battery negligence negligence per se negligent hiring,training,supervision,and retention negligent infliction of emotional distress intentional infliction of emotional distress intentional concealment and negligent concealment.camp demurred to the complaint,asserting that the lawsuit was by the statute of limitations that the intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action was defective because it did not allege any conduct directed at parents and that the seventh and eighth causes of action regarding concealment were deficient because camp had no duty to disclose the incident to parents.
after a hearing,the trial court overruled the demurrer as to the statute of limitations and sustained the demurrer with leave to amend regarding the intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action.the trial court sustained camp demurrer to the seventh and eighth causes of action without leave to amend,reasoning that while camp may have had a special relationship with children who attended the summer camp sufficient to create a duty to prevent harm to them,a duty to prevent harm is not the same as a duty to disclose.parents sought writ relief from this court we stayed all trial court proceedings,issued an order to show cause to the trial court,and requested briefing from the parties.
ii.discussion 
we review an order sustaining a demurrer de novo,and we assume the truth of all properly pleaded facts unless contradicted by judicially noticed facts.cansino bank of america th,cansino.when the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend,we review the determination that no amendment could cure the defects for abuse of discretion.ibid.
the complaint seventh and eighth causes of action allege intentional concealment and negligent concealment,respectively.one who willfully deceives another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk,is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers.section,subdivision defines deceit for purposes of section as including suppression of a fact,by one who is bound to disclose it,or giving information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact,subd.judicial interpretations of section,subdivision state that to support a cause of action for fraud by concealment a plaintiff must show concealment of a material fact by the defendant the defendant had a duty to disclose that fact to the plaintiff the defendant concealed the fact with an intent to induce reliance by the plaintiff the plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he or she did with knowledge of the concealed fact and the plaintiff suffered injury.bank of america superior court th.camp based its demurrer to the concealment causes of action on the absence of a duty to disclose and the trial court found no such duty.we likewise limit our review to determining whether camp had a duty to disclose the suspected molestation to parents immediately after the incident.
while a duty to disclose information to prevent harm is a part of the duty to act reasonably in the context of negligence see tarasoff v.the regents of the university of california cal d,tarasoff,parents position is novel because they look to the same duty as a basis for their concealment causes of action.citing phyllis superior court d phyllis.fraud by concealment is typically alleged in cases regarding fraudulent business transactions,such as concealment of information by a defendant who has a fiduciary or similar relationship with the plaintiff here,based on camp special relationships with woodhouse as an employee and with parents and minor as customers of its summer camp business,we conclude that disclosure of the suspected molestation to parents was part of camp duty to act reasonably and prevent harm.
