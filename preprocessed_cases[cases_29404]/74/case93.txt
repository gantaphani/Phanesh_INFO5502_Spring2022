suzanne macdonald macdonald appeals the district court dismissal of her title vii claims against the defendant nonprofit religious organizations for sexual harassment and retaliation because she failed to file her charges with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc within days of the last alleged discriminatory act.she asserts that the longer filing deadline with which she complied applies because the washington state human rights commission washington commission had subject matter jurisdiction over her charges.she argues that even though the washington law against discrimination exempts nonprofit religious organizations from the definition of employer,the washington commission had subject matter jurisdiction because it is designated as a fair employment practice fep agency by the eeoc.she also contends that the washington commission had subject matter jurisdiction because the washington law against discrimination contains provisions that prohibit sex discrimination and retaliation by parties other than employers.
macdonald further argues,for the first time on appeal,that the exemption of nonprofit religious organizations from employment discrimination liability under the washington law against discrimination violates the establishment and equal protection clauses of the united states constitution.she contends that because the nonprofit religious organization exemption is unconstitutional,the defendants were not exempt from her charges,the washington commission had subject matter jurisdiction to consider her charges,and therefore the filing deadline applies.exercising our discretion,we decline to consider this constitutional argument raised for the first time in these appellate proceedings.
we have jurisdiction under and affirm the district court dismissal of macdonald title vii claims.the washington commission did not have subject matter jurisdiction over macdonald charges and therefore the deadline applies for the required filing with the eeoc.macdonald did not file her charges with the eeoc within the time limit,and as a result her title vii claims were properly dismissed.
background 
on february,macdonald filed a charge with the washington commission and the eeoc,alleging gender discrimination and retaliation under title vii of the civil rights act of,et,by defendants grace church seattle grace,the pacific northwest presbytery of the presbyterian church in america pnwp,and the presbyterian church in america pca macdonald,an office administrator for grace,alleged that she had been sexually harassed by grace pastor,who was her supervisor.macdonald alleged that the last discriminatory act occurred on april,when she was allegedly terminated from her employment by the defendants in retaliation for reporting the pastor sexual harassment.she filed her charges with the eeoc and with the washington commission more than days,but less than days,after the last act of alleged discrimination.on july,the eeoc dismissed macdonald charges.
macdonald then filed this action alleging gender discrimination and retaliation under title vii,wrongful discharge in violation of the public policy of the state of washington,and invasion of privacy under the common law of the state of washington.macdonald alleged that the defendants grace,pnwp and pca were all her employer as defined in title vii.macdonald did not plead any claims under the washington law against discrimination.
the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss,holding that macdonald title vii claims were untimely because she failed to file her charge with the eeoc within days of the last alleged discriminatory employment practice the district court held that the longer filing period was not available to macdonald because the washington commission,the relevant fep agency,did not have subject matter jurisdiction over her charges because religious organizations are exempt from the washington law against discrimination employment discrimination provisions.
macdonald filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied.macdonald argued that the washington commission had jurisdiction over her claims and thus she was entitled to the filing period because the eeoc regulations designated the washington commission as a fep agency to hear her discrimination claims without any exception for charges against a nonprofit religious organization.she also argued that the washington commission had subject matter jurisdiction over her retaliatory discharge claim on the ground that the defendants were persons,in addition to being her employers,under the retaliation provision of the washington law against discrimination.the district court disagreed,denied macdonald motion for reconsideration,and this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
in dismissing macdonald complaint,the district court mistakenly applied federal rule of civil procedure b.see elvig calvin presbyterian church,cir.a rule b motion must be made before the responsive pleading.id.citing.b.here,the d efendants filed their motion to dismiss after filing their answer.id.thus,the motion should have been treated as a motion for judgment on the pleadings,pursuant to rule c or h.id.accordingly,we treat the district court dismissal of macdonald title vii claims as a grant of a motion for judgment on the pleadings.see id.at.
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint by judgment on the pleadings.see id.at.we accept as true all allegations in macdonald complaint and treat as false those allegations in the answer that contradict macdonald allegations.see id.we review a district court denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion.see smith pacific props.dev,cir.
iii.discussion 
title vii time limits for filing charges with the eeoc 
title vii establishes two potential time limitations periods within which a plaintiff must file an administrative charge with the eeoc.see e generally,a title vii plaintiff must file an administrative charge with the eeoc within days of the last act of discrimination.see id.however,the limitations period is extended to days if the plaintiff first institutes proceedings with a state or local agency with authority to grant or seek relief from such practice.id.
the eeoc regulations provide that the time limit applies if the state or local fep agency lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a charge 
a jurisdiction having a fep agency without subject matter jurisdiction over a charge,an agency which does not cover sex discrimination or does not cover nonprofit organizations is equivalent to a jurisdiction having no fep agency.charges over which a fep agency has no subject matter jurisdiction are filed with the commission upon receipt and are timely filed if received by the commission within days from the date of the alleged violation.
macdonald filed her administrative charge with the eeoc more than days,but less than days,after the last alleged discriminatory act.she simultaneously filed an administrative charge with the washington commission,the relevant fep agency.
the parties dispute whether the or the time limit applies.macdonald contends that the time limit applies because the washington commission is a fep agency with subject matter jurisdiction over her charges.the defendants argue,and the district court held,that the time limit applies because the washington commission did not have subject matter jurisdiction over macdonald charges because the defendants,as nonprofit religious organizations,are exempt from employment discrimination charges under the washington law against discrimination.see.
b.the washington commission designation as a fep agency without exception 
macdonald contends that the washington commission is a fep agency with subject matter jurisdiction over all discrimination charges because of its designation as such an agency by the eeoc.pursuant to a,the eeoc may designate state and local agencies as fep agencies.if the eeoc determines that a state or local agency does not come within the definition of a fep agency for purposes of a particular ground of discrimination,the agency is deemed a notice agency as opposed to a fep agency.see b.the eeoc lists designate fep agencies at a for some charges,the eeoc has explicitly footnoted exceptions to an agency designation as a fep agency and has instead deemed it a notice agency for those types of charges see,a the arlington human rights commission has been designated as a fep agency for all charges except those alleging a violation of title vii by a government,government agency,or political subdivision of the state of virginia.for these types of charges it shall be deemed a notice agency,pursuant to b.the washington commission is designated as a fep agency without any exception for any particular charge.see a.macdonald argues that because the eeoc has explicitly footnoted exceptions for certain charges for other agencies,but not for the washington commission,the washington commission has subject matter jurisdiction over all discrimination charges.we disagree.
the eeoc footnotes in a are not the exclusive list of exceptions to a fep agency subject matter jurisdiction over particular charges.if they were,the distinction between fep agencies with and without subject matter jurisdiction in a would be superfluous in addition,none of the fep agency exceptions footnoted in a resembles the additional two examples of fep agencies without subject matter jurisdiction provided in a,an agency which does not cover sex discrimination or does not cover nonprofit organizations.see a.although the washington commission is not included in the footnotes in a,the exception for nonprofit religious organizations set forth in the washington law against discrimination is similar to the example of a fep agency lack of subject matter jurisdiction over a nonprofit organization set forth in a.further,decisions by other courts support the view that the footnotes in a do not provide the exclusive exceptions to a fep agency subject matter jurisdiction.see dezaio port,cir determining that the new york state division on human rights lacked subject matter jurisdiction over charge against port authority even though it is designated in a as a fep agency without exception vitug multistate tax comm n,determining that the illinois department of human rights lacked subject matter jurisdiction over charge against small employer even though it is designated in a as a fep agency without exception.
as a result,the eeoc designation in a of the washington commission as a fep agency without exception as to any charge is not determinative of whether the washington commission had subject matter jurisdiction over macdonald charges.to decide that question,we must examine washington state law to determine whether the washington law against discrimination precluded the washington commission consideration of macdonald charges.
permissibility of looking to state law to determine a fep agency subject matter jurisdiction 
macdonald argues that eeoc commercial office prod,d,prohibits engaging in an analysis of state law to determine whether the washington commission had subject matter jurisdiction over her charges.in commercial office,the supreme court held that a plaintiff who filed an administrative discrimination charge that was untimely under state law was nonetheless entitled to the time limit for filing with the eeoc.see id.at.the defendant employer had argued that the federal filing time limit was inapplicable in the absence of a timely filing under state law because the state agency lacked the requisite authority to grant or seek relief.see id.at.the supreme court rejected this argument,stating that the words authority to grant or seek relief refer merely to enabling legislation that establishes state or local agencies,not to state limitations requirements.id.at.in holding that state time limits for filing discrimination claims do not determine the applicable federal time limit,the supreme court reasoned that 
title vii also is a remedial scheme in which lay persons,rather than lawyers,are expected to initiate the process.the importation of state limitations periods into e e not only would confuse lay complainants,but also would embroil the eeoc in complicated issues of state law.in order for the eeoc to determine the timeliness of a charge filed with it between and days,it first would have to determine whether the charge had been timely filed under state law,because the answer to the latter question would establish which of the two federal limitations periods should apply.this determination is not a simple matter.the eeoc first would have to determine whether a state limitations period was jurisdictional or nonjurisdictional.and if the limitations period was nonjurisdictional,like colorado in this case,the eeoc would have to decide whether it was waived or equitably tolled.the eeoc has neither the time nor the expertise to make such determinations under the varying laws of the many deferral states and has accordingly construed the extended period to be available regardless of the state filing.
contrary to the position asserted by macdonald,the supreme court in commercial office indicated that it is permissible to look to enabling legislation that establishes state or local agencies to determine whether an agency has the authority to grant or seek relief.id.at.in the present case,the state of washington enabling statute is the washington law against discrimination and it specifies whether the washington commission has the authority to grant or seek relief regarding macdonald charges.the washington law against discrimination limits the jurisdiction of the washington commission t o receive,impartially investigate,and pass upon complaints alleging unfair practices as defined in this chapter.emphasis added.further,under,the washington commission jurisdiction is expressly limited to claims that would constitute an unfair practice under the washington law against discrimination t he powers which may be exercised by the commission under this subsection permit investigations and complaint dispositions only if the investigations are designed to reveal,or the complaint deals only with,allegations which,if proven,would constitute unfair practices under this chapter.emphasis added.because the washington law against discrimination,which is the enabling statute,limits the washington commission subject matter jurisdiction,we must analyze the scope of that state law.
in addition,a indicates that it is permissible to look to state law to determine whether a fep agency has subject matter jurisdiction over a charge.this regulation explicitly requires ascertaining whether or not a fep agency has subject matter jurisdiction in order to determine whether the or time limit applies.see a.commercial office did not consider a because it concerned state time limits as opposed to a state agency subject matter jurisdiction.
subsequent to commercial office,other courts have looked to state law to ascertain whether a state or local agency had subject matter jurisdiction over a discrimination charge to determine whether the or time limit applies.see dezaio,at looking to new york laws and compact creating port authority to determine that the new york state division on human rights lacked subject matter jurisdiction over charge against port authority vitug.at looking to illinois human rights act to determine that the illinois department of human rights lacked subject matter jurisdiction over employer with less than fifteen employees.
we conclude that it is appropriate to look to the washington law against discrimination to determine whether the washington commission had subject matter jurisdiction over macdonald charges.
d.the washington commission subject matter jurisdiction over macdonald charges 
the washington law against discrimination exempts nonprofit religious organizations,such as the defendants,from the definition of employer.see.employer does not include any religious or sectarian organization not organized for private profit.because macdonald alleges that the defendants were her employer,her charges against them as employers are exempt from the washington commission subject matter jurisdiction,and thus the time limit does not apply.
to avoid this result,macdonald argues for the first time on appeal that such
