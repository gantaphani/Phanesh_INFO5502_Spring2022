anne petter taxpayer or anne transferred membership units in a llc partly as a gift and partly by sale to two trusts and coupled the transfers with simultaneous gifts of llc units to two charitable foundations.the transfer documents include both a dollar formula clause which assigns to the trusts a number of llc units worth a specified dollar amount and assigns the remainder of the units to the foundations and a reallocation clause which obligates the trusts to transfer additional units to the foundations if the value of the units the trusts initially receive is finally determined for federal gift tax purposes to exceed the specified dollar amount.based on an initial appraisal of the llc units,each foundation received a particular number of units.but after an internal revenue service irs audit determined that the units had been undervalued,the foundations discovered they would receive additional units.everyone agrees that the taxpayer is entitled to a charitable deduction equal to the value of the units the foundations initially received.but is the taxpayer also entitled to a charitable deduction equal to the value of the additional units the foundations will receive the tax court answered that she was.we agree.
after inheriting a large amount of united parcel service ups stock,anne devised a complex estate plan designed to give some of her wealth to charity and as much of her stock as she could to two of her children,donna and terry,without having to pay gift tax.to accomplish these goals,the taxpayer first created the petter family llc pfllc,a washington limited liability company,and transferred approximately million worth of ups stock to it in exchange for membership units in the pfllc.then,the taxpayer created the donna moreland long term trust,which named donna as trustee,and the terrence petter long term trust,which named terry as trustee,and transferred pfllc units to these two trusts this appeal centers around these latter transfers,which are discussed in more detail below.
because anne did not want to pay gift tax in connection with the transfer of llc units to the trusts,the transfers were coupled with simultaneous donations of units to two taxexempt public and occurred in two phases first a gift,then a sale.on march,the taxpayer gave the trusts pfllc units equal in value to the unused portion of her unified tax exemption on the advice of her estate planner,richard lemaster,these units served as a baseline that limited the amount of units later sold to the trusts specifically,the units transferred as a gift were meant to make up of the trusts assets on march,anne sold the trusts additional pfllc units that,when added to the units already transferred as a gift,were worth of the trusts assets as consideration for the llc units,each trust executed a year promissory note,undertaking to pay at interest in quarterly installments of.the trusts have made regular quarterly payments since july.
as regards the march gifts,there were two sets of gift documents one for donna trust,which named it and the kitsap community foundation as transferees,and one for terry trust,which named it and the seattle foundation as transferees.the relevant sections of terry gift document recital c,the dollar formula clause section,and the reallocation clauses sections and provide 
transferor wishes to assign class t membership units in the company the units including all of the transferor right,title and interest in the economic,management and voting rights in the units as a gift to the transferees.
subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement,transferor 
assigns to the trust as a gift the number of units described in recital c above that equals the maximum dollar amount that can pass free of federal gift tax by reason of transferor applicable exclusion amount allowed by code section c.transferor currently understands her unused applicable exclusion amount to be,so that the amount of this gift should be and 
assigns to the seattle foundation as a gift the difference between the total number of units described in recital c above and the number of units assigned to the trust in section.
the trust agrees that,if the value of the units it initially receives is finally determined for federal gift tax purposes to exceed the amount described in section,trustee will,on behalf of the trust and as a condition of the gift to it,transfer the excess units to the seattle foundation as soon as practicable.
the seattle foundation agrees that,if the value of the units the trust initially receives is finally determined for federal gift tax purposes to be less than the amount described in section,the seattle foundation will,as a condition of the gift to it,transfer the excess units to the trust as soon as practicable.
donna gift document substitutes class d units for class t units and the kitsap community foundation for the seattle foundation,but is otherwise identical.
as regards the march sales,there were also two sets of sale documents one for donna trust,which named it and the seattle foundation as transferees,and one for terry trust,which named it and the seattle foundation as transferees.the relevant sections of terry sale document recital c,the dollar formula clause section,and the reallocation clauses sections and provide

assigns and sells to the trust the number of units described in recital c above that equals a value of as finally determined for federal gift tax purposes and 
assigns to the seattle foundation as a gift the difference between the total number of units described in recital c above and the number of units assigned and sold to the trust in section.
the trust agrees that,if the value of the units it initially receives is finally determined to exceed,trustee will,on behalf of the trust and as a condition of the sale to it,transfer the excess units to the seattle foundation as soon as practicable.
the seattle foundation agrees that,if the value of the units the trust initially receives is finally determined to be less than,the seattle foundation will,as a condition of the gift to it,transfer the excess units to the trust as soon as practicable.

shortly after these documents were executed,lemaster requested that moss adams advisory services,a seattle valuation firm,determine the fair market value of the membership units as of the transfer dates.moss adams concluded that the fair market value was per unit.based on this appraisal,the kitsap community foundation received units,the seattle foundation received units,and terry and donna trusts each received units.
the taxpayer filed a form gift tax return for,which reported no gift tax liability as a result of the transfers.the return listed gifts of each to donna trust and terry trust gifts worth,and to the seattle foundation and a gift worth to the kitsap community foundation.along with her return,anne included a disclosure statement and supporting documents detailing the nature of the gifts as transfers of llc units subject to allocations and reallocations if the value of the units transferred was later finally determined for federal gift tax purposes to differ from the estimated value as determined by the moss adams appraisal.the taxpayer further disclosed that the value of the limited liability company as reflected in the moss adams appraisal is based on the fair market value of the underlying assets with a nonmarketability discount and a net asset value adjustment applied.
the irs audited the return in and concluded that the llc units had been undervalued.specifically,the irs determined that the correct value was per unit.from the irs perspective,this higher valuation had two significant gift tax consequences.first,it meant that the taxpayer had underreported the value of the units transferred as gifts to the trusts and,accordingly,that the taxpayer gifts exceeded the unused portion of her lifetime unified tax exemption.second,it meant that the shares sold to the trusts were sold for less than full and adequate consideration,and thus were transferred partly by sale and partly by an additional gift to each trust,computed by deducting the price of the installment notes from the fair market value of the shares transferred.additionally,the irs concluded that the dollar formula clauses were void as against public policy and refused to allow the taxpayer to take an additional charitable deduction for the value of the additional units that would pass to the foundations following the upward valuation.as a result of its audit,the irs issued a notice of tax deficiency for.
the taxpayer petitioned the united states tax court for a redetermination of the deficiency.approximately two weeks before trial,anne and the irs settled the valuation issue by stipulating that the value of the llc units was per unit at the time of the transfer.as a result of the stipulated value and the reallocation clauses of the transfer agreements,the seattle foundation and the kitsap community foundation must receive an additional units and units,respectively,from the trusts.after a trial,the tax court determined that the taxpayer was entitled to a charitable deduction based on the value of the additional llc units the foundations will receive.specifically,the tax court held that the dollar formula clauses used to effect the additional transfers were not void as against public policy and that the foundations receipt of additional units was not subject to a condition precedent.petter comm r,cch,wl,at.the irs has timely appealed from the tax court decision to this court,though the irs now argues only that part of the gifts to the foundations were subject to a condition precedent an irs audit in violation of treasury regulation c b.
we review the tax court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.xilinx,comm r,cir.whether a gift is dependent upon a precedent event,reg.c b,is a question of law that we review de novo.
although gifts are generally taxable,taxpayers may deduct the amount of all gifts made to or for the use of a charitable organization from the total amount of taxable gifts made during the relevant calendar year.a.however,no charitable deduction is allowed i f,as of the date of the gift,a transfer for charitable purposes is dependent upon the performance of some act or of the happening of a precedent event in order that the transfer might become effective.reg.c b.here,the irs argues that t he adjustment feature of the clauses requiring the trusts to transfer additional llc units to the foundations,if the value of the units,as finally determined for federal gift tax purposes,exceeds a defined value make the additional charitable gifts subject to the occurrence of a condition precedent an irs audit that ultimately determines that the reported value of the llc units is too low.accordingly,the irs claims that treasury regulation c b disallows the additional charitable deduction at issue in this case the charitable deduction the taxpayer claims as a result of the reallocation of units between the foundations and the trusts.
a condition precedent is one that must occur before a transfer to a charity become s effective.reg.c b wien consol.airlines,comm r,cir stating that a condition precedent is,in contract law,one which must exist before a duty of immediate performance arises,or,in property law,one that is necessary for an estate to vest citations omitted.we do not think that the dollar formula clauses in the taxpayer transfer documents contain a condition precedent.contrary to the irs argument,the taxpayer transfer documents do not make the additional transfers of llc units to the foundations dependent upon the occurrence of an irs audit.rather,the taxpayer transfers became effective immediately upon the execution of the transfer documents and delivery of the units the only possible open question was the value of the units transferred,not the transfers themselves.
the dollar formula clauses of the gift documents assign to each of the two foundations the difference between units and the number of units that equals.thus,if x is the value of an llc unit,these clauses assign to each foundation x units.similarly,the two dollar formula clauses of the sale documents assign to one foundation the seattle foundation the difference between units and the number of units that equals a value of as finally determined for federal gift tax purposes.thus,each clause assigns to the seattle foundation x units.under the terms of all dollar formula clauses,the foundations receive a set number of llc units there are no contingencies that must be satisfied before the transfers to the foundations become effective.
the irs,however,points out that the transfer agreements impose an obligation on the trusts to transfer excess units to the foundations if the value of units the trusts receive by gift is finally determined for federal gift tax purposes to exceed or if the value of the units the trusts receive by sale is finally determined to exceed.in the irs view,these reallocation clauses which were triggered once the irs determined and the taxpayer agreed that the llc units had been undervalued establish that the gifts of the additional units to the foundations were dependent upon an irs audit and a successful challenge of the value of the units as too low because o nly then do the foundations have a right to the additional units.we disagree.although the reallocation clauses require the trusts to transfer excess units to the foundations if it is later determined that the units were undervalued,these clauses merely enforce the foundations rights to receive a number of units the difference between a specified number of units and the number of units worth a specified dollar amount.and that particular number of llc units was the same when the units were first appraised as when the irs conducted its audit because the fair market value of an llc unit at a particular time never changes.thus,the irs determination that the llc units had a greater fair market value than what the moss adams appraisal said they had in no way grants the foundations rights to receive additional units rather,it merely ensures that the foundations receive those units they were already entitled to receive.the number of llc units the foundations were entitled to was capable of mathematical determination from the outset,once the fair market value was known.
ultimately,the irs argues that because the foundations would not have received the additional units but for the irs audit,the additional transfer of units to the foundations was dependent upon a condition precedent.adopting the irs but for test would revolutionize the meaning of a condition precedent.in one sense,the irs is correct that but for its audit,the foundations would not have obtained additional llc units,but that is because the irs believed the estimated value was not the true fair market value.either of the trusts or either of the foundations could also have challenged the moss adams valuation of the llc units,although it was unlikely that they would have done so.but this practical reality does not mean that the foundations rights to additional llc units were contingent for their existence upon the irs audit.treasury regulation c b asks whether a transfer is dependent upon a precedent event in order that it might become effective,not whether a transfer is dependent upon the occurrence of an event so that the transferred assets actually change hands.an analogy to a simple contract illustrates this point.consider a contract between a and b,in which a agrees to pay b in exchange for b services.if a enters into this contract knowing that he has no intention to pay and if b then performs his side of the bargain,b will receive the only if he sues a in court.but for b lawsuit,b would not receive the money he deserves.but b filing of the lawsuit though an event that must occur for b to be paid is not a condition precedent to b receiving the.that is so because b entitlement to this sum is in no way dependent upon the filing of a lawsuit a duty to perform arose when b performed under the contract.
citing f,the irs further argues that a value as finally determined for gift tax purposes means the value shown on a taxpayer return,unless the irs conducts a timely audit and challenges that value.because the taxpayer used the term as finally determined for federal gift tax purposes,the irs claims that rather than transferring a particular number of units whose fair market value added up to the dollar amounts specified in the transfer agreements,the taxpayer actually transferred a particular number of units whose value per unit,the value reported on the taxpayer gift tax return added up to those dollar amounts.and at that value,the foundations had rights to and units,and no more.the additional and units that the foundations subsequently were to receive were the result of the audit and the parties agreement that the value of each unit was.
but the taxpayer transfer agreements do not specify the value of an individual llc unit.the gift documents assign to each of the two foundations the difference between units and the number of units that equals,while the sale documents assign to one foundation the difference between units and the number of units that equals a value of as finally determined for federal gift tax purposes.aside from the fact that only the dollar formula clause of the sale documents uses the phrase as finally determined for federal gift tax purposes,a taxpayer who files a return can not conjure up a value for federal gift tax purposes out of thin air rather,she must use federal gift tax valuation principles.under these principles,the value of an asset as finally determined for federal gift tax purposes is the fair market value of that asset.see reg.i f a gift is made in property,its value is the price at which such property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller,neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell,and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.succession of mccord comm r,cir there is no material difference between fair market value determined under federal gift tax valuation principles and fair market value as finally determined for federal gift tax puroses.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the taxpayer did not transfer to the foundations the number of units equal to a defined dollar amount divided by rather,she transferred the number of units equal to the defined dollar amount divided by the fair market value of a unit.the moss adams appraisal confirms this point it states,on the first page,that its purpose is to express an opinion of the fair market value of the units.
there are two additional problems with the government reliance on f.first,although this section does state that a value shall be treated as finally determined for purposes of the gift tax chapter if the value is shown on the return and such value is not contested by the secretary,id.f a,this definition applies f or purposes of paragraph,id.f.paragraph,in turn,addresses the valuation of gifts in a particular circumstance if the time has expired within which a tax may be assessed under the gift tax chapter.id.f.in such circumstance,it makes sense to treat the value of a gift as the value reported on the taxpayer return since,after all,the statute of limitations for assessing gift tax has passed.but f does not purport to specify what is meant by a value as finally determined for federal gift tax purposes where the irs may still assess tax.second,f also provides that a value shall be treated as finally determined for purposes of the gift tax chapter if the value is determined by a court.this language is broad enough to encompass the value of an llc unit determined by a washington court in an action by the foundations challenging the moss adams valuation as too low.see oman,at holding that the donee may enforce a completed gift.accordingly,we reject the irs assertion that a value as finally determined for gift tax purposes is necessarily the value a taxpayer reports on her return.
the result we reach that treasury regulation c b does not bar the charitable deduction at issue in this case is consistent with the eighth circuit decision in estate of christiansen comm r,cir,which involved an estate tax regulation similar to c b.in christiansen,the decedent will left her estate to her only child and provided that percent of any disclaimed amounts were to go to a charitable foundation.id.at.after the taxpayer death,her daughter disclaimed her interest in the estate as to all amounts over million as finally determined for federal estate tax purposes and the estate filed a tax return that indicated the estate had a particular value.id.after the irs challenged the amount reported as the estate overall value on the estate tax return,t he parties eventually settled regarding a substantially increased valuation for the estate.id.this higher valuation resulted in a corresponding increase in the valuation of the contribution to the charitable foundation,but the irs denied the estate an increased charitable deduction.id.the irs argued that because the overall value of the estate was not finally determined at the time of the decedent death,but only after the commissioner partially successful challenge,the transfer to the foundation was,ultimately,dependent upon the performance of some act or the happening of a precedent event in violation of treasury regulation b.id.accordingly,the irs sought to limit the estate charitable deduction to the amount originally claimed on the estate tax return.
the eighth circuit held that treasury regulation b is clear and unambiguous and it does not speak in terms of the existence or finality of an accounting valuation at the date of death or disclaimer.rather,it speaks in terms of the existence of a transfer at the date of death.id.applying the regulation to the case at hand,the court then stated that all that remained uncertain following the disclaimer was the valuation of the estate,and therefore,the value of the charitable donation.id.at.but t he foundation right to receive percent of those amounts in excess of million was certain.id.additionally,the court observed that the irs fails to distinguish between events that occur that change the actual value of an asset or estate and events that occur that are merely part of the legal or accounting process of determining value at the time of death.id.although the estate and the irs bickered about the value of the property being transferred,this bickering did not mean that the transfer itself was contingent in the sense of dependent for its existence on a future event.id.citation omitted.the court adopted the tax court view that r esolution of a dispute about the fair market value of assets on the date the decedent died depends only on a settlement or final adjudication of a dispute about the past,not the happening of some event in the future.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we agree with the eighth circuit reasoning and find that it is equally applicable to this case.
the irs offers three reasons to disregard christiansen,but none are persuasive.first,the irs argues that a which provides that a qualified disclaimer relates back to the time of death by allowing the disclaimed amounts to pass as though the initial transfer had never occurred ensured in christiansen that the disclaimed property passed to the foundation at the time of the decedent death as opposed to being subject to a condition precedent.as the irs explains,this rationale is inapplicable in the instant case,which does not involve a qualified disclaimer.however,it is clear from reading christiansen that the court analysis focused on the word transfer in treasury regulation b,a regulation that closely mirrors the one applicable in this case.though a buttressed the court reasoning,it did not control the outcome.see christiansen,at.second,the irs argues that the eighth circuit relied on language in reg.e vi a,an estate tax regulation that has no parallel in the gift tax regulations.we agree,but that regulation did
