in march and april,nmyo and swop mailed advertisements criticizing several incumbent state legislators.the mailings denounced certain initiatives the legislators proposed during the legislative session,pointed out that the sponsoring legislators had relied upon certain organizations for funding,and suggested that the legislators were beholden to corporate interests rather than actually working for the public good.recipients were urged to contact the legislators to express their concern about the legislators votes and funding sources.the mailings were targeted to the legislators constituents,and each mailing mentioned an upcoming special legislative session focused on healthcare.
a typical mailer looked like the one sent to state senator shannon robinson constituents.this mailer had a child depicted on the front with a thermometer in her mouth and stated with a special session of the legislature this summer to address health care,it important to find out whose side is senator robinson on id.at.on the back of the mailer,it asked when new mexico state legislature makes critical decisions on our health care,who will state senator shannon robinson stand with id.at.it then highlighted a bill that senator robinson voted against in the legislative session that would have required insurance companies to simply disclose to consumers in clear language the reasons why their health insurance premiums are increased each year,and stated that by voting against the bill,senator robinson voted with the insurance industry.id.it then cited senator robinson campaign finance reports and contended that,s ince almost of senator robinson campaign contributions have come from the health care,pharmaceutical and insurance industry,lobbyists,banks and payday loan industry,liquor and tobacco industry,political action committees,and the oil and mining industries.id.the card concluded with a special session of the legislature this summer on health care,it important to call shannon robinson.remind him he works for you.call senator shannon robinson at id.

complaint and request to comply with the new mexico campaign reporting act 
one of the targeted legislators,senator shannon robinson,sent a letter of complaint to the new mexico secretary of state,mary herrera,and made a telephonic complaint to the new mexico attorney general.a second targeted legislator,senator bernadette sanchez,also contacted the attorney general.the complaints alleged that nmyo and swop failed to register as political committees under the new mexico campaign reporting act nmcra,stat.ann.to west.
the nmcra,in relevant part,provides as follows 
a.it is unlawful for any political committee that receives,contributes or expends in excess of five hundred in any calendar year to continue to receive or make any contribution or expenditure for a political purpose unless that political committee appoints and maintains a treasurer and registers with the secretary of state.
b.a political committee shall register with the secretary of state within ten days of receiving,contributing or expending in excess of five hundred dollars by paying a filing fee of fifty dollars and filing a statement of organization under oath on a prescribed form showing 
the full name of the political committee,which shall fairly and accurately reflect the identity of the committee,including any sponsoring organization,and its address 
a statement of the purpose for which the political committee was organized 
the name,address and relationship of any connected or associated organization or entity 
the names and addresses of the officers of the committee and 
an identification of the bank used by the committee for all expenditures or contributions made or received.
stat.ann.a b.
furthermore,the nmcra requires that 
e ach treasurer of a political committee shall file a report of expenditures and contributions until the treasurer files a report that affirms that the committee has dissolved or no longer exists and that its bank account has been closed.
id.g see id.setting forth the required contents of the report.
the statute defines a political committee as 
two or more persons who are selected,appointed,chosen,associated,organized or operated primarily for a political purpose and political committee includes political action committees or similar organizations composed of employees or members of any corporation,labor organization,trade or professional association or any other similar group that raises,collects,expends or contributes money or any other thing of value for a political purpose a person or an organization of two or more persons that within one calendar year expends funds in excess of five hundred dollars to conduct an advertising campaign for a political purpose.
the statute defines an advertising campaign as an advertisement or series of advertisements used for a political purpose and disseminated to the public either in print,by radio or television broadcast or by any other electronic means,including telephonic communications,and may include direct or bulk mailings of printed materials.id.a.
on april,secretary of state herrera issued a letter stating that nmyo was not required to register as a political committee under the nmcra.on may,albert lama,chief deputy attorney general,wrote to secretary herrera,requesting that she amend her april,letter to reflect that the nmyo does fall under the nmcra.aplt app.at.
on august,secretary herrera sent a letter to nmyo stating that it appears that nmyo is operating as a political committee for purposes of the nmcra and thus must register and file reports with the secretary of state office.id.at.the letter also stated that nmyo had ten business days to correct the matter,and that failure to comply with the nmcra would subject the organization to mandatory penalties as prescribed under nmcra.on august,secretary herrera sent a similar letter to swop stating that it was operating as a political committee for purposes of the nmcra and demanding that it register as a political committee or face penalties.id.at.
in response,on december,nmyo and swop filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.the complaint challenged various provisions of the nmcra,both facially and as applied to them,and sought a preliminary injunction,ordering secretary herrera to halt enforcement of the nmcra as it applies to them.
district court grant of summary judgment 
after concluding that nmyo and swop had standing to challenge the nmcra,the district court provided an overview of the law regulating expenditures by organizations the court reviewed the two categories of speech that could be regulated,as delineated from buckley valeo,per curiam,and its progeny.these cases state that for a mailing such as this to be a regulable campaign related communication the speech must be unambiguously campaign related.aplt app.at.to count as unambiguously campaign related,the speech must qualify as either express advocacy or its functional equivalent or have originated from a political committee.
the district court then began by addressing the question of whether the mailings in question qualify in the former of the two categories.secretary herrera argued that because the mailings were sent for a political purpose,to influence or attempt to influence an election,they may be regulated.the district court first noted that,given supreme court precedent,the nmcra definition of political purpose,see stat.m p olitical purpose means influencing or attempting to influence an election or convention,including a constitutional amendment or other question submitted to the voters,was overbroad and vague.id.the court found that the definition in the nmcra mirrored the federal election campaign act definition,which the supreme court held unconstitutional in buckley,at.thus,the court stated that in order to be constitutional,the phrase political purpose may be applied only to reach contributions or expenditures for communications that constitute express advocacy for the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,or its functional equivalent.aplt app.at citing fec.right to life,wrtl.
the district court held that the communications by the nmyo and swop do not satisfy this narrow definition of political purpose.the court first established that the speech was not express advocacy.next,the court found that such ads did not constitute the functional equivalent of express advocacy.the court pointed to the following facts the communications did not mention any future primary or general election in which the targeted legislators would be running the ads highlighted the legislators voting records and the ads warned that corporate interests were likely to try to influence the legislators positions on health care legislation and urged recipients to contact their legislators so that their voices could be heard.thus,the court stated the ads are susceptible of a reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.aplt app.at quoting wrtl,at.
this conclusion was also buttressed by the fact that the ads were not mailed within days of a primary election or days of a general election.the court held that the fact that the communications were made well outside of this period further informs the c ourts findings that the ads were not regulable electioneering communications.id.at 
finally,the court addressed the question of whether nmyo and swop can be properly classified as political committees,such that all of their speech may be properly subject to regulation.nmcra defines a political committee as an organization operated primarily for a political purpose.the nmcra also states that any organization that spends over in one year on a political ad campaign constitutes such a political committee.applying buckley major purpose test,the district court struck down the second part of the definition,stating that a spending trigger for such insubstantial expenditures is not narrowly tailored and can not survive exacting scrutiny.id.at.applying circuit precedent,from crlc,at,the court found that b ecause nmcra targets organizations as a whole,requiring a reporting of each expenditure and source of each contribution received by the political committee,without regard to whether the expenditure was for an expense,or whether the contribution was made specifically for such a purpose,it differs in a material respect from valid laws governing regulation of only transactions.aplt app.at.thus,the district court granted summary judgment for nmyo and swop.the district court also dismissed as moot the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.
ii.analysis 
in arguing that the organizations may be regulated under buckley and its progeny,secretary herrera challenges the district court grant of summary judgment on the basis that the mailers should be classified as the functional equivalent of express advocacy and the finding that the groups did not constitute political committees,under buckley major purpose test,is erroneous 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.somoza of denver,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.when applying this standard,we examine the factual record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.belhomme widnall,cir.particularly because this decision implicates first amendment freedoms,we perform an independent examination of the whole record in order to ensure that the judgment protects the rights of free expression.crlc,at quoting faustin city county of denver,cir.
the regulations at issue here require disclosure,thus distinguishing them from regulations that limit the amount of speech a group may undertake.see buckley,at unlike the overall limitations on contributions and expenditures,the disclosure requirements impose no ceiling on activities.as such,the regulations must pass exacting scrutiny.id.we long have recognized that significant encroachments on first amendment rights of the sort that compelled disclosure imposes can not be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental interest w e have required that the subordinating interests of the state must survive exacting scrutiny.doe reed,wl,at june.that standard requires a substantial relation between the disclosure requirement and a sufficiently important governmental interest.to withstand this scrutiny,the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on first amendment rights.doe,wl,at internal quotation and citation omitted.
in buckley,the court held that the reporting and disclosure requirements then imposed by the federal election campaign act of,as amended,et feca,survived exacting scrutiny so long as they were construed to reach only that speech which is unambiguously campaigned related.see at.there are two categories of speech which qualify as unambiguously campaign related according to buckley and its progeny.first,speech that expressly advocates or is the functional equivalent of express advocacy for the election or defeat of a specific
