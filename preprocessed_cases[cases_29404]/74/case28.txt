in,the first baptist church of clarendon,in arlington county,virginia,arlington county plan to develop a parcel of land that the church owned and on which the church building was located.under the plan,the existing church building would be razed,and in its place a building would be erected,which would include a new church building and church facilities on the first two floors,and apartments on the upper eight floors,to include affordable units for low and moderate income people as well as units.
in furtherance of the plan,the church conveyed the property to a private development corporation,and the development corporation thereafter created a condominium on the property,one for the church and one for the apartments.the church financed the construction of its portion of the building,and arlington county and the federal government provided loans to finance construction of the apartments.
peter glassman,a taxpayer in arlington county,who lives less than one block from the property,commenced this action under.against arlington county,the commonwealth of virginia,the first baptist church,and the developer,alleging that arlington county involvement in the development violates the establishment clause of the constitution,as well as its counterpart in the virginia constitution.he seeks to enjoin completion of the project,which has already commenced,and to order rescission of the loan and restitution to arlington county of all monies advanced by the county.in his complaint,glassman alleges that the county announced purpose of providing affordable housing in arlington has been used to mask what is really a subsidy from the county to support the building of the new church,at the expense of the affordable housing cause.this is evidenced,he alleges,by the county approval of payments for the housing portion of the project,by the presence of both church and county members on the developer board,and by the physical layout of the building in which t he housing units will share with the church a common foundation,common elevator,and other common infrastructure.glassman also alleges that the funding arrangement,administration,and building layout create an unconstitutional,excessive entanglement of the church and the county.
the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint,concluding,in a thorough opinion,that the facts alleged in the complaint did not state a plausible claim upon which relief could be granted for a violation of the establishment clause.having found no violation of the constitution,the court also found no violation of the virginia constitution,which has been construed in parallel to the constitution.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
because we are reviewing the district court order dismissing glassman complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b and therefore are evaluating the complaint only for legal sufficiency,we take as true the facts alleged in the complaint in determining whether they support a plausible claim for relief.see francis giacomelli,cir.
summarizing his complaint,glassman states that he has a substantial grievance concerning the county and state financing of a baptist church building less than one block from his home.he alleges that the nature of the relationship between and among the first baptist church,the developer,and the county in the development of this project the nature of the funding and the planned structure of the completed project support his claim that arlington county has violated the establishment clause of the first amendment and its counterpart in the virginia constitution.
the complaint then recites the transaction in some detail.in the period,the first baptist church decided to develop the property on which its church building was then located in order to rebuild the church building and to construct affordable housing.by including affordable housing in the plan for the project,the church intended to take advantage of funding from arlington county affordable housing investment fund funding by the virginia housing development authority and tax credits from the federal government for housing.
the plan called for razing the existing church building and constructing a new building,including a new sanctuary and church facilities,affordable housing apartments,apartments,and a parking garage for the apartment tenants.to implement the plan,the church created a nonprofit corporation to serve as the developer of the views at clarendon corporation the developer which had a board consisting of three members designated by the church,one of whom was the president of the board,three affordable housing advocates,and one member appointed by arlington county.the developer in turn created a virginia limited north highland street,clarendon limited purchase the property from the church and administer the funding.in forming the limited partnership,the developer made itself the general partner and the limited partner.the highland partnership then created a condominium on the property,with one unit for the portion of the project to be occupied by the church and the other for the housing portion of the project.all funding for the project was paid directly to the highland partnership.
the configuration of the physical structure of the building called for a tenant parking garage and a building.the first two stories above ground,which had a footprint larger than the tower,were largely dedicated to church use,including the sanctuary.the portion of the structure extending beyond the tower footprint was designed to accommodate the church front entrance and a steeple.the tower was dedicated to housing and was comprised of below apartments,to be rented as affordable housing for low and middle income persons,and apartments.the tower lobby and elevator on the first floor were to be used in common by both church members and tenants.
the construction of the church portion of the structure,estimated to cost million,was funded mostly by the million proceeds of the church sale of the property to highland partnership.the construction of the housing portion of the project and parking garage was funded by a million loan from arlington county affordable housing investment fund,a million loan from the virginia housing development authority,and an million loan funded by the federal government.the complaint does not allege that any money from these public sources was paid to the church except for the million for the purchase of the property.
the complaint asserts that arlington county and the virginia housing development authority overvalued the apartments in making loans to the project and that this overvaluing was necessary to make the project work financially.it states that,as a consequence,the church benefited,because the viability of the project enabled construction of a new church building.based on this indirect benefit,the shared membership on the developer board,and the physical design of the building,glassman asserts that the county actions involved it in a relationship with the church.
after briefing and argument,the district court,by an order dated april,granted the defendants motion to dismiss.after examining all of the relationships between the parties,as well as the funding scheme and the physical structure,the court held that glassman had failed to allege facts showing that he was entitled to relief for violation of the establishment clause or virginia counterpart.the court found despite an innuendo plaintiff tries to draw from such allegations,the facts alleged in the amended complaint show that the purpose of the loan was to assist in the development of affordable housing in arlington county t he amended complaint fails to allege facts from which this court could conclude that the county aid results in any indoctrination attributable to the county or even the first baptist church the complaint does not support any argument that the first baptist church was paid more than fair market value for its property and the county actions in approving the project and lending money for affordable housing did not create excessive entanglement,given that p laintiff alleges no facts that the county is actively engaged in developing the first baptist church sanctuary or,for that matter,the affordable housing component of the project,and the county loan was not for the construction of a new sanctuary or other religious facilities of the first baptist church.
glassman filed this appeal,challenging the district court april,order.
our standard for review of the district court order is especially important in this case because the complaint,which is pages long,is comprised not only of factual allegations,but also of conclusions,characterizations,opinion,speculation,and argument.for example,it alleges,this case presents a remarkable example of a state actor taking unprecedented steps to promote,sponsor and fund the demolition,rebuilding and renovation of a baptist church with taxpayer money.similarly,it states,in short,the county support of the church project is so intertwined with religion that the county affordable housing mantra rings hollow such an unprecedented and irresponsible use of affordable housing dollars suggests that the county,at worst,actually acted with the purpose of establishing and promoting religion or,at best,its actions have the perceived and actual effect of advancing religion.speculating,the complaint states,the same articles of incorporation provide for an initial board of trustees of the church.certain of these church trustees would later become members of the supposed independent nonprofit board of the views corporation the developer,which the church created ostensibly to build and manage the affordable housing units separately from the church.and again,assuming that the loans are ever paid off,on information and belief the church will also be the defacto sic owner of the developer residential property,with access to the perpetual funding mechanism that the property provides.
while these statements are not inappropriate,they nonetheless can not be taken as a basis to support a plausible claim.to determine whether a plausible claim has been asserted,we consider the factual allegations of the complaint to determine whether they plausibly show an entitlement to relief.see bell atl.twombly.to be sure,glassman complaint does include extensive factual allegations related to the history and the nature of the transaction at issue.
when reviewing an order dismissing a complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,we determine whether the complaint contains sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.giacomelli,at internal quotation marks,emphasis,and citations omitted.as we explained,
the plausibility standard requires a plaintiff to demonstrate more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.it requires the plaintiff to articulate facts,when accepted as true,that show that the plaintiff has stated a claim entitling him to relief,the plausibility of entitlement to relief.
id.quoting twombly,at.under this standard,we need not accept the legal conclusions drawn from the facts,nor unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions,or arguments.giarratano johnson,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as the supreme court has admonished,a complaint must contain more than labels and conclusions,and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.twombly,at.
employing these guidelines,we now determine whether the complaint states a claim for an establishment clause violation that is plausible on its face.
in determining whether arlington county acted in a manner that effectively makes a law respecting an establishment of religion,as prohibited by the first amendment,we focus on both the purpose of the county activity in participating in the development of the housing project and the effect of its involvement.the establishment clause prohibits state action with a sectarian legislative purpose or with the primary effect of advancing religion,including fostering an excessive government entanglement with religion.see lemon kurtzman,see also agostini felton,stating that excessive entanglement has sometimes been considered independently,and sometimes as part of the effects analysis.but it does not prohibit all interaction between church and state.to the contrary,i nteraction between church and state is inevitable,and we have always tolerated some level of involvement between the two.agostini,at internal citation omitted.thus,the test for determining whether a legislative act withstands an establishment clause challenge requires that the act have a secular purpose that its principal or primary effect be neither to advance nor to inhibit religion and that it not foster excessive government entanglement with religion.see lemon,at connelly sch.of the holy child,cir.
in this case,glassman acknowledges that arlington county announced purpose to provide affordable housing in arlington county was a secular purpose.but he argues that this announced purpose was a sham and that the county real purpose was to aid the first baptist church in rebuilding its church.this,he claims,had the primary effect of advancing the baptist faith.he also contends that arlington county became unconstitutionally entangled in the baptist religion through its involvement in the project.
we now examine the complaint under the applicable test to determine whether the facts alleged support his claim.
we ask first whether the county activity in this project had a secular purpose.this first prong of the lemon test presents a fairly low hurdle,which may be cleared by finding a plausible secular purpose on the face of the regulation,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.but the proffered secular purpose must be sincere and not a sham.edwards aguillard.
while glassman acknowledges that the county invokes affordable housing as the stated rationale to support this project,he nonetheless argues that the county true purpose was to advance the baptist faith by helping the first baptist church rebuild its church.to argue that the announced purpose was not sincere,he relies on the county manager alleged statement that any approved project would have to produce sufficient capital to meet the church needs.but this statement does not necessarily indicate a purpose to advance the baptist faith.it is that the affordable housing project could not have gone forward if it were not beneficial to all involved.if the county wished to achieve its secular purpose of building affordable housing,it would have to support a proposal that would also meet the needs of the church,as well as the other relevant parties to the project.glassman has alleged no facts to suggest that county officials intended to benefit the church rather than simply attempting to craft a proposal that was workable for all involved.
in an effort to show otherwise,glassman points to a series of sent by members of the church discussing the church construction costs and the use of county loan funds to meet those costs.these allegations,again,do not support a claim that the county had a religious purpose because the can not be attributed to any government actor.indeed,the only county mentioned indicates the county contrary intent,asking that church members remove the church costs from spreadsheets before sending them to the county.
the county announced purpose to provide affordable housing is undoubtedly a legitimate,secular goal,and we conclude that the allegations in the complaint do not support the claim that this secular goal was a sham or that the county had a purpose to advance religion in deciding to lend money to the project.accordingly,we readily conclude,as did the district court,that the complaint does not set forth a plausible claim that would support an establishment clause violation based on a purpose to advance religion.
the second prong of the lemon test is directed at whether the county activities have the principal or primary effect of advancing religion.this prong could be satisfied by a showing that county funds were used to fund the religious activities of the first baptist church.see bowen kendrick.it could also be satisfied if the county activities in the project amounted to government indoctri
