this case requires us to evaluate the federal income tax consequences of,silo transactions.the court of federal claims denied wells fargo million in claimed deductions for tax year stemming from its participation in silo transactions with entities.we affirm.
a,transaction of the sort at issue in this case consists of two concurrent leases of an asset owned by a entity.in the first lease,known as the head lease,the entity leases the asset to the taxpayer for a lease term that exceeds the useful life of the asset.because the asset will be returned to the entity only after its useful life has expired,the irs treats the head lease as a sale of the asset.in the second lease,known as the sublease,the taxpayer leases the asset back to the entity for a term that is less than the asset remaining useful life.the sublease is a net lease,meaning that the entity is responsible for all expenses normally associated with ownership of the asset.the entity also retains legal title to the asset.
the taxpayer prepays the entire rent of the head lease in one lump sum.the taxpayer funds the rent prepayment in part with its own funds and in part with a nonrecourse loan.the portion of the rent prepayment funded by the taxpayer own funds is known as the equity portion,and the portion funded through borrowing is known as the debt portion.the entity receives a small percentage of the head lease rent prepayment,usually between percent and percent of the asset value,as its fee for participation in the silo transaction.the remainder of the rent prepayment,minus transaction costs,is placed in two restricted accounts,one for the equity portion and one for the debt portion.each account is nominally held by the entity,but the funds are controlled by an affiliate of the taxpayer nonrecourse lender.
the debt portion account is used to make the entity sublease rental payments.money never actually changes hands during a rental payment the lender affiliate simply moves funds from the entity debt portion account to the lender account in an amount sufficient to service the taxpayer nonrecourse loan debt.the debt portion account has sufficient funds to cover the entity payments for the life of the sublease or,equivalently,the taxpayer payments for the life of its nonrecourse loan.because of the circular nature of the debt payments,the funds in the debt portion account are known as loop debt.the taxpayer debt is effectively defeased,or extinguished,meaning that dedicated funds exist for the purpose of paying off the debt.the taxpayer can therefore ignore its nonrecourse loan debt for purposes of its balance sheet.
the lender affiliate invests the equity portion account in debt,such as government bonds.the growth of the account is managed so that the entity has sufficient funds to repurchase its asset from the taxpayer at the conclusion of the sublease.the repurchase price,or exercise price,is set at the beginning of the silo transaction.the entity can exercise its option to repurchase the asset simply by giving notice to the taxpayer.if the option is exercised,the funds in the equity portion account are transferred to the taxpayer,and a final payment of loop debt is made from the debt portion account to the taxpayer nonrecourse lender.the debt portion account is emptied and the debt of the taxpayer to the lender is satisfied.the net result is the same as if the taxpayer had simply invested its equity portion account in debt,receiving a predictable return on that investment over the life of the sublease.
if the entity chooses not to exercise its repurchase option,the taxpayer generally has two choices.the taxpayer can elect either the return option,under which the taxpayer takes control of the asset immediately,or the service contract option,under which the taxpayer postpones taking control of the asset.under the service contract option,the entity is required to satisfy several conditions before continuing to use the asset or arranging for its use by a third party.those conditions are described below.under either option,the entity ultimately receives the balance of the funds in the two accounts.
silos offer three tax benefits to the taxpayer.first,as owner of the asset for tax purposes based on the head lease,the taxpayer may take depreciation deductions on the asset for the remainder of its useful life.see a.second,the taxpayer may take deductions for interest payments made from the entity debt portion account to service the taxpayer nonrecourse loan.see a.third,the taxpayer may deduct certain transaction costs associated with the silo.if the entity exercises its repurchase option,these tax benefits are partially offset at the end of the sublease by taxes owed on the taxpayer receipt of funds from the equity portion account.even taking those taxes into account,however,the deferral of tax payments during the life of the sublease has substantial economic value to the taxpayer.
silos evolved in response to a battle among congress,the irs,and enterprising taxpayers regarding the boundaries of permissible leasing of property to generate tax benefits.in,congress enacted leasing rules that allowed taxpayers to lease property from entities.economic recovery tax act,stat.the rules,however,were quickly repealed in.tax equity and fiscal responsibility act,stat.in,congress enacted the pickle rule,which provided that property leased from a entity would be depreciated at a slower rate than other property in order to limit the tax benefits generated by such transactions.deficit reduction act,stat.
taxpayers then began to employ creative strategies to avoid the pickle rule and receive greater tax benefits from the property of entities.one of those strategies was the use of,lilo transactions.a lilo is like a silo,except that the head lease term is shorter than the asset remaining economically useful life,so the irs treats it as a lease rather than a sale.the options are also different for lilos if the entity does not exercise its repurchase option at the taxpayer discretion,the entity may be required to return the assets,renew its lease,or lease the assets to a third party.see rul.like the silo options,each of the options in a lilo is structured to effectively eliminate risk of loss to the taxpayer.see bb t united states,cir.the federal transit administration fta has at various times promoted lilo and silo leases as a means of providing infusions of cash for financially troubled public transit agencies.
the lilo market came to an end beginning in,when the treasury department issued new regulations requiring that prepayment of the head lease rent be treated as a loan for tax purposes.see reg.at that point,taxpayers were p resumptively alerted that the irs would challenge exotic efforts to transfer tax deductions from tax indifferent entities.awg leasing trust united states,d,n.in,the irs clarified that lilo transactions did not satisfy the doctrine,discussed below.rul.taxpayers then began using silos instead of lilos in order to avoid the new regulations on leases by characterizing the head lease as a sale.in addition,taxpayers asserted that the term of a service contract was not subject to the pickle rule for determining the applicable rate of depreciation.finally,in,congress put an end to tax benefits generated from both lilo and silo transactions by amending the internal revenue code.american jobs creation act,stat.see notice.while the amendments were prospective in effect,they were not designed to alter the general principles of tax law that apply in determining the legitimacy of transactions designed to generate tax deductions.see,at.
from to,wells fargo entered into several silo transactions with entities.for tax year,wells fargo claimed million in deductions based on silo transactions.seventeen of the transactions were with domestic transit agencies,and nine were with owners of qualified technological equipment qte.when the irs denied the deductions,wells fargo paid the disputed amount and filed a refund suit in the court of federal claims.before trial,the parties agreed to let the court disposition of five representative silo transactions guide the resolution of the entire claim.four of these representative transactions involved domestic transit agencies,including new jersey transit njt,caltrans,houston metro,and the washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata.the final representative transaction was a qte transaction involving two lots of cellular telecommunications equipment owned by belgacom mobile belgacom,a belgian company.
the four transit agency transactions were typical silo transactions.the assets in each case were public transit vehicles vehicles njt,locomotives and passenger rail cars caltrans,buses houston metro,and subway cars wmata.each transit agency had the option to repurchase the assets at a fixed price at the end of the sublease term.in each case,the length of the combined sublease and service contract term was no more than percent of the equipment remaining economically useful life,meaning that if the transit agency chose not to exercise its repurchase option,the equipment would be returned to wells fargo with useful life remaining.due to the length of the sublease terms,it is not known at this time whether the entities will exercise their repurchase options.
to provide for the possibility that the repurchase option might not be exercised,each of the four transit silos included a service contract option.the length of the service contracts varied from seven to fourteen years.wells fargo did not have to inform a transit agency whether it would impose a service contract until less than one year prior to termination of the sublease.if wells fargo chose to exercise the service contract option,the transit agency would need to locate a operator for the equipment and negotiate an operating agreement with that third party.the agency would also be required to refinance the outstanding debt from the debt portion account,procure and pay for insurance to cover the residual value of assets,maintain the equipment in newly refurbished condition,and arrange for payment of periodic fees to wells fargo sufficient to preserve its economic return on investment.if wells fargo chose to exercise the return option instead of the service contract option,the transit agency would receive the balance of the debt portion and equity portion accounts in exchange for giving the equipment to wells fargo in newly refurbished condition.
the options were somewhat different for the belgacom qte transaction.instead of having the option to repurchase the equipment at the conclusion of the sublease,belgacom was given an early buyout option a few years before the end of the sublease.under the early buyout option,belgacom could repurchase the equipment from wells fargo for an amount equivalent to the balance of the equity portion account at the time the option was executed.the belgacom silo did not include a service contract option.instead,if belgacom did not exercise its repurchase option,it would need to repurchase the equipment at the conclusion of the sublease,renew the sublease for a series of terms,or return the equipment to wells fargo.upon return to wells fargo,the telecommunications equipment would need to be in as new condition,including any relevant hardware and software updates,and belgacom would be required to pay for any installation of the equipment as directed by wells fargo.in and,belgacom terminated its silos for the two lots of equipment by exercising its early buyout option.during the sublease period,belgacom claimed tax ownership and depreciation deductions for the qte under belgian law.
following a bench trial addressing the five representative silo transactions,the court of federal claims denied wells fargo claim in its entirety.the court found that wells fargo participated in silo transactions only when it had sufficient tax capacity to use the tax benefits of the transactions.the court further found that wells fargo expected the entities to exercise their options to repurchase their assets because the economic effects of the alternatives were so onerous and detrimental that a rational entity would do nothing other than exercise the options.in any event,the court concluded,the service contract option in the transit agency subleases protected wells fargo from residual value risk during the assets remaining useful lives.analyzing the economic effect of the transactions,the court found that,other than the tax advantages,wells fargo received no net economic benefit from entering into the silo transactions.in addition,the court found that the silo transactions had no effect on the entities use of the assets,that no funds changed hands during the sublease period that the assets were appraised at an inflated value in order to maximize depreciation deductions,and that there were no negotiations of any of the lease terms.in summary,the court determined that each of the representative silo transactions essentially amount ed to wells fargo purchase of tax benefits for a fee from a entity that can not use the deductions.accordingly,the court held that the transactions were abusive tax shelters and that the claimed tax benefits from those transactions should be disallowed.in so ruling,the court found that transactions had to be disregarded for tax purposes under both the doctrine and the economic substance doctrine.
on appeal,wells fargo argues that the trial court employed an inappropriate methodology to determine that wells fargo lacked the benefits and burdens of ownership in the assets that were the subject of the silo transactions used the wrong test to measure its pretax profit and misapplied the nontax business purpose test.the first argument is directed to the doctrine.the remaining arguments relate to the economic substance doctrine.we review the characterization of transactions for tax purposes de novo,based on underlying findings of fact,which we review for clear error.stobie creek,llc united states,see frank lyon united states.
judicial doctrines prevent taxpayers from subverting the legislative purpose of the tax code.coltec,united states.the doctrine provides that the tax consequences of a transaction are determined based on the underlying substance of the transaction rather than its legal form.see griffiths helvering,looking to the crux of transaction by imagining it in its simplest form.tea.united states,a given result at the end of a straight path is not made a different result because reached following a devious path.holiday vill.shopping ctr.united states.
in order to be entitled to deductions for depreciation of assets and associated interest and transaction expenses,wells fargo had to show that it owned the silo equipment.see coltec,at.ownership for tax purposes is not determined by legal title.instead,in order to qualify as an owner for tax purposes,the taxpayer must bear the benefits and burdens of property ownership.frank lyon,at corliss bowers.here,the parties agree that the clearest indicator of ownership is the allocation of risk associated with the value of the leased assets.
wells fargo argues that it acquired the benefits and burdens of ownership in the leased assets because there was a possibility that it would regain possession of the leased assets at a time when they still retained some economically useful life.wells fargo notes that the sublease term,even when added to the period of a subsequent service contract,would still leave wells fargo with economically useful assets,and that it would be subject to financial risk based on the actual value remaining in those assets after the silo transaction ended.wells fargo argument is predicated on uncertainty regarding whether the entities would exercise their options to repurchase the assets.the trial court noted that for tax purposes wells fargo required the entities to state that at the time of closing they had not made any determination whether they would exercise their repurchase options.however,based on evidence including statements made by the entities at the time,the trial court found that t he evidence strongly supports a conclusion that the repurchase options would almost certainly be exercised to terminate the transactions.at oral argument,counsel for wells fargo acknowledged that affirmance would be appropriate if that finding were to stand.
we have never held that the likelihood of a particular outcome in a business transaction must be absolutely certain before determining whether the transaction constitutes an abuse of the tax system.the appropriate inquiry is whether a prudent investor in the taxpayer position would have reasonably expected that outcome.characterization of a tax transaction based on a highly probable outcome may be appropriate,particularly where the structure of the transaction is designed to strongly discourage alternative outcomes.see knetsch united states,disregarding wholly unlikely assumption regarding taxpayer future behavior in the course of concluding that transaction lacked substance stobie creek,at evaluating substance of transaction based in part on the structure of the investment,which eliminated any reasonable possibility of nontax profit frank lyon united states,finding taxpayer to have incurred risk in transaction where there was substantial risk of loss,not just the abstract possibility that something will go wrong.
seeking to undermine the trial court finding that the entities were highly likely to exercise the repurchase options,wells fargo challenges the testimony of thomas lys,the government expert on financial economics.lys concluded that exercising the repurchase option is the most advantageous option for transit agencies in virtually all circumstances.the trial court found that lys provided a compelling economic analysis of the silo transaction.according to the court,lys established beyond doubt that no entity in its right mind would fail to exercise the purchase option.
when the entities make the decision whether to exercise their repurchase options,they will necessarily compare the economic benefits provided by the leased assets with the economic benefits of the alternative options.prior to the transactions at issue in this case,wells fargo appraisers analyzed the expected benefits to the entity from the repurchase option and the service contract option.the appraisers concluded that the respective benefits and costs of the two options would be such that the entities would not be under any economic compulsion to exercise the repurchase option.lys conducted the same analysis but came to a different result.he determined that the value of the leased assets to the entity would greatly exceed the exercise price,meaning that the entity would have a strong economic incentive to repurchase the assets.at trial,wells fargo expert challenged lys analysis and defended the appraisers analysis.
the crux of the disagreement between lys and the appraisers is the discount rate that the entity would apply in calculating the net present value of its alternatives at the decision point the appraisers selected the weighted average cost of capital wacc prevailing in the industry sector in which the entity operated,the rail industry as the discount rate that the entity would use to compare net present values of the repurchase and service contract options lys equated the discount rate with the rate at which the entity could borrow funds.according to lys,that rate reflect ed the general risk of the entity.wells fargo expert,however,testified that lys choice of discount rate violate d a fundamental tenet of finance,and that the relevant industry wacc was the appropriate discount rate.
because lys used a lower discount rate than the appraisers used,lys projected that the leased assets would retain their value better than the appraisers expected and that the cost of the periodic payments to wells fargo under the service contract would be higher than the appraisers expected.consequently,according to lys,there would be no reason for the entity to risk entering into the service contract because it would receive less economic benefit than if it simply repurchased the assets.
wells fargo characterizes the trial court reliance on lys testimony as reflecting the application of an incorrect legal standard.see lazare kaplan int l,photoscribe.wells fargo argues that,as a matter of law,the likelihood of outcomes in silo transactions must be assessed using estimates based on the fair market value of the assets in question,and it cites the frank lyon case to support that argument.in frank lyon,however,there was no service contract,simply a series of purchase options provided to the lessee in a transaction at future points in time.the purchase option prices were negotiated between the parties and were known at the time the parties entered into the transaction.frank lyon united states,ustc.the trial court in that case concluded that the price of the fixed purchase options represented fair estimates of market value of the leased building on the applicable dates,and the supreme court did not disagree with that conclusion.at.the court,however,did not address the appropriate discount rate to use when comparing a fixed purchase option to alternative options.nothing in the frank lyon case or any of the other authorities cited by wells fargo supports wells fargo argument that lys testimony was predicated on a legally incorrect standard.to the contrary,the question of what discount rate is most appropriate to use in estimating the benefits and burdens of purchase and service options that will not be exercised for a number of years is a distinctly factual matter,and wells fargo has not shown that the trial court acceptance of lys methodology constituted clear error.
in any event,the critical inquiry is whether wells fargo could have reasonably expected that the entities would exercise their repurchase options,and the trial court resolution of that question does not turn on the appropriateness of lys choice of discount rate.while the court found lys testimony most valuable on that issue,the court explained that lys had simply confirmed the court conclusion based on other evidence.the court noted that m any of the expert witnesses at trial testified as to the probability that the transit agency would elect the repurchase option instead of becoming subject to the service contract or the return of the equipment.
for example,an expert on the passenger railcar industry testified that the repurchase option was very likely to be exercised in the njt,caltrans,and wmata silos,and that there was no foreseeable circumstance in which the option would not be exercised.an urban public transportation expert similarly testified that the four transit agencies were very likely to exercise their repurchase options due to the uncertainty and potential difficulties of complying with the service contract option within a short time frame.that expert report examined each of the transit agency silos individually and determined that substantial hurdles would hinder the agencies compliance with the service contract option.an expert in leasing and asset financing testified that he could not think of a set of circumstances under which caltrans would not exercise a purchase option,and the requirements of the alternatives make it a practical certainty that the purchase option will be exercised.a federal transit administration witness testified that silo arrangers consistently told the fta that it should be too concerned about the possibility of the repurchase option not being exercised because it was likely that the transit agencies would exercise it.it was the easiest way to close the transaction normally.finally,the court credited the testimony of several witnesses that service contracts are rare in the domestic transit sector,particularly for existing transit services and equipment.
the witness testimony regarding the four transit agency silos was supported by documentary evidence.credit approval presentations caps prepared by wells fargo before it entered into each silo suggest that the transactions were designed to encourage the entities to exercise their repurchase options.the njt cap,which is representative,states that the transit agency has all the cash necessary in the defeasance funds to purchase the equipment at the repurchase option point and would incur little or no added expense at this point.in an exchange,the silo promoters informed representatives of houston metro that they fully anticipate
