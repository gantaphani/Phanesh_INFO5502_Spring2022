this case involves the single issue of whether plaintiff,center for legal advocacy cla,is entitled,under the protection and advocacy for mentally ill individuals act pamii,to peer review and quality assurance records it seeks in connection with its investigation into the suicides and attempted suicide of mental health care patients,or whether such access is barred by colorado statutes prohibiting access to such records.the district court held cla was not entitled to those records.we reverse.
background 
cla is a colorado corporation designated by the governor of colorado as the state protection and advocacy system p a system under the pamii act.under the act,p a systems like cla are directed to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with mental illness,and to protect and advocate the rights of such individuals.b.
defendant colorado mental health institute at pueblo institute is a colorado facility which treats individuals with mental illnesses.it is organized and operated under the office of direct services of the colorado department of human services cdhs.defendant robert hawkins is the institute superintendent,defendant robert rossi is the manager of cdhs office of direct services,and defendant marva hammons is the executive director of cdhs.
after learning of the suicides of four patients at the institute,and the attempted suicide of another institute patient,cla sought information under pamii,including physician peer review and quality materials,to assist in its investigation of those incidents pamii authorizes p a systems like cla to have access to certain records in order to conduct its investigations into incidents involving mentally ill individuals.colorado,however,has two statutes which bar disclosure of physician peer review and hospital quality management review records in certain situations defendants eventually provided cla with all records relating to the patients under investigation,but refused to turn over peer review and quality assurance records 
cla seeks a declaratory judgment and an injunction requiring access to peer review and quality assurance records relevant to the suicides and attempted suicide it was investigating at the institute,as well as a permanent injunction for future cases,along with attorney fees plaintiff and defendants filed motions pursuant to.c for judgment on the pleadings,and the matter was referred to a magistrate judge.the magistrate judge concluded that pamii disclosure requirements applied to the professional review records sought by cla and recommended that defendants grant cla access to them.the district court disagreed,concluding that pamii does not compel the disclosure of the records at issue and does not preempt colorado statutes barring disclosure of them.it therefore held that cla could not compel access to those records,and it accordingly vacated the magistrate judge recommendation and dismissed cla claims.cla appeals.

a brief history of pamii is necessary to understand the arguments of each side in this case.pamii was enacted in.section of the act authorizes p a systems like cla to in accordance with section have access to all records of any individual who is a client of the system if such individual,or the legal guardian,conservator,or other legal representative of such individual,has authorized the system to have such access.a in,pamii was amended and reauthorized,and subsection b to,providing a definition of records,was added 
as used in this section,the term records includes reports prepared by any staff of a facility rendering care and treatment or reports prepared by an agency charged with investigating reports of incidents of abuse,neglect,and injury occurring at such facility that describe incidents of abuse,neglect,and injury occurring at such facility and the steps taken to investigate such incidents,and discharge planning records.
b a.section further provides that 
if the laws of a state prohibit an eligible system from obtaining access to the records of individuals with mental illness in accordance with section a of this title and this section,section a of this title and this section shall not apply to such system before 
i the date such system is no longer subject to such a prohibition or 
ii the expiration of the year period beginning on may,
whichever occurs first.
pamii was again amended and reauthorized in,although none of the amendments to the text of pamii are relevant to this case.all parties agree that,prior to the amendments and reauthorization,the legislative history of the act did not address the issue of access to peer review or quality assurance records.all parties also agree that the issue was raised during the reauthorization process.they disagree strongly on what,if anything,we should derive from those facts.
the mention of access to peer review records in connection with the amendment and reauthorization appeared in both the house and senate committee reports 
the committee recognizes that almost all hospitals have established medical care evaluation or peer review committees as part of their joint commissions on accreditation of health care organizations jcaho accreditation requirements.the purpose of these committees is to review and evaluate patient care in the facility in order to improve the quality of care.
the committee has been made aware that states have statutes that protect the records produced by such committees from disclosure.it is the committee intent that the pamii act does not state law regarding disclosure of peer review records relating to the proceedings of such committees.
at,reprinted in.the senate report contains virtually identical language.however,the reauthorization bill,senate bill,was passed by both the senate and the house of representatives with no discussion of access to peer review records,and no change relating to record access was actually made in the text of the act when it was reauthorized 
additionally,when congress reauthorized pamii in it provided that the secretary of health and human services shall promulgate final regulations to carry out this title.protection and advocacy for mentally ill individuals amendments act of,stat.pursuant to that authority,the united states department of health and human services enacted a regulation which states that p a systems shall have access to the following 
reports prepared by individuals and entities performing certification or licensure reviews,or by professional accreditation organizations,as well as related assessments prepared for the facility by its staff,contractors or related entities,except that nothing in this section is intended to preempt state law protecting records produced by medical care evaluation or peer review committees.
c.thus,this regulation arguably implemented the language contained in the committee reports,excluding from access under pamii peer review or medical care evaluation materials which are privileged under state law.cla argues this regulation is invalid because it directly conflicts with the clear intent of congress as expressed in the text of the pamii act.defendants argue it is a valid regulation and reflects congressional intent expressed in when the pamii act was reauthorized.
cla argues that the district court erred in denying it access to peer review and quality assurance records,contending it impermissibly relied upon c,which conflicts with congressional intent as expressed in the text of the act itself it erred in failing to conclude that pamii preempts the colorado laws providing a privilege to peer review and quality assurance records it erred in concluding that the act and c recognize two distinct classes of records patient records and hospital records and that cla may only have access to patient records,which do not include peer review and quality assurance records and the plain meaning of the statutory language conferring access to all records of any individual is expansive and necessarily includes peer review and quality assurance records.
defendants respond of pamii grants access to all records of patients,which do not include peer review or quality assurance records,and grants access only to certain records of hospitals and agencies,so that arguably expansive language all is inapplicable to and does not compel the conclusion that peer review and quality assurance records are hospital records under the reauthorization of pamii in was the equivalent of the reenactment of a new statute,so legislative history from accurately reflects congressional intent and c does not conflict with the express language of the act,but,rather,is a valid regulation,consistent with the legislative history,and it protects peer review and quality assurance records from disclosure because they are privileged under colorado law.
when interpreting the language of a statute,the starting point is always the language of the statute itself.if the language is clear and unambiguous,the plain meaning of the statute controls.quarrell,at citation omitted.in ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.united states seminole nation,cir quoting k mart cartier,d.if we find ambiguity,we may seek guidance from congress intent,a task aided by reviewing the legislative history.in re geneva steel,cir.further,if a statute is silent or ambiguous on a particular issue,we must defer to the interpretation of the statute by the agency charged with administering it if that interpretation is based on a permissible construction,that is,unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.pharmanex shalala,cir citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
we begin with the statutory language.pamii,by its terms,provides access to all records of any individual.a a.section further defines access to records.it also specifically states,i f the laws of a state prohibit an eligible system from obtaining access to the records of individuals with mental illness in accordance with section a and this section,then those sections shall not apply until the earlier of either the time the prohibition is removed or may.b c.finally,a s used in this section,the term records includes reports prepared by any staff of a facility or reports prepared by an agency charged with investigating reports of incidents occurring at facilities and discharge planning records.b a.thus,a plain reading of the statute as a whole indicates that cla should have access to all records of any individual including reports prepared by any staff of a facility and reports prepared by an agency which investigates incidents occurring at facilities.what we must determine,however,is whether a rational and logical reading of the statute permits the conclusion that peer review quality assurance records are encompassed by all records of any individual including reports prepared by any staff of a facility,or reports prepared by an agency.
while this is an issue of first impression in our circuit,we do have the benefit of a few decisions from other courts.the third circuit addressed the issue of access to privileged peer review materials in pennsylvania prot.advocacy,houstoun,cir.that court held that peer review reports fall within a a provision of access to all records of any individual.id.at.it also held that they fall squarely within the definition provided in b a as reports prepared by staff of a facility rendering care and treatment.id.quoting b a 
with respect to its conclusion that a peer review report was a record of any individual,the third circuit rejected the defendant argument that it could not be a record of any individual because peer review reports belong to the hospital,not the individual patient 
t he preposition of may be used to show connection or association as well as ownership,and it seems clear that the term is used in the former sense here.presumably,many,if not all,of allentown state hospital records concerning dolores are just as much its property as the peer review reports,but there is no doubt that pamii was meant to require the hospital to give pp a access to those records,as the hospital did.
id.at citing random house dictionary of the english language.
the third circuit also rejected the argument that pamii could not compel disclosure where state law restricted disclosure t here is nothing in the text of pamii that supports the commonwealth contention that this federal statute does not require disclosure of peer review reports that are protected under state law.indeed,there is not even any mention of peer review reports in the legislative history that accompanied the initial passage of the act in.id.further,the court held that t he interpretation of pamii set out in c does not represent a reasonable interpretation of the statute,and we must therefore reject it.id.citing chevron,at.as the court explained 
pamii requires that groups such as pp a be given access to a defined category of records.peer review reports either fall within that definition or they do not.the statutory language can not reasonably be construed to encompass identical peer review reports in some states but not others.if congress wished to achieve that result,it needed to enact different statutory language.it could not achieve that result,in the face of the statutory language it enacted,simply by inserting a passage in a committee report.nor could that result be achieved by means of a regulation.
id.at.the third circuit therefore held that pamii preempts any state law that gives a healthcare facility the right to withhold such records.id.
finally,the court observed that,although pamii would preempt any state law which in fact gave a facility the right to withhold peer review records,it noted that there was no actual conflict between pamii disclosure requirement and the particular state law at issue because the relevant state statute provided that peer review records shall not be subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in any civil action.id.quoting.stat.ann.tit.the plaintiff in that case was not seeking disclosure in connection with a civil action rather,like cla in this case,it was seeking the peer review reports in order to fulfill the advocacy and investigatory purposes of pamii.see also iowa protection and advocacy,gerard treatment programs,d following houstoun 
the new hampshire supreme court reached the opposite conclusion in disabilities rights,comm r.in that case,new hampshire laws barred access to quality assurance records.a p a system sought disclosure of those records under pamii,notwithstanding the state bar.the new hampshire court first held that b c expressly preempts a state law barring disclosure of records as defined in pamii.it then characterized c as a rule clarifying the definition of records contained in b a,id.at,and declared it reflective of congress intent to spare the state law barring access to quality assurance records from preemption.id.at.then,relying upon the committee report language during the reauthorization of pamii,the new hampshire court concluded that t he legislative history of pamii states that congress did not intend to preempt state laws protecting the records maintained by medical care evaluation or peer review committees that are established by hospitals to achieve accreditation by the jcaho.id.it therefore concluded that congress did not intend to preempt rsa prohibiting access to quality assurance records.id.finally,the court supported its reasoning by considering the purposes of both pamii and the state law conferring a privilege on quality assurance records 
i t is significant that pamii and rsa serve a similar end.both statutes benefit mentally ill individuals by fostering the improvement of services and conditions at medical and psychiatric care facilities.were we to find preemption,the facility would no longer be encouraged to engage in review and the mentally ill individuals receiving services there would no longer benefit from the improvements that flow from its quality assurance program.in this sense,
