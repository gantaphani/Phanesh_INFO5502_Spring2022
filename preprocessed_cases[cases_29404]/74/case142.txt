while the mutuals are contractually responsible for maintaining their residential buildings and common areas,they rely upon grf to perform management and maintenance services.the declaration of trust provides,grf shall perform for the benefit of all the mutuals and their members all duties imposed upon grf under separate written agreement with mutual no.one and under any other written agreements of similar nature hereinafter entered into by grf with other mutuals.the management agreement with mutual no.one requires grf to,among other things,oversee final construction of the residential buildings,pay the mortgages,maintain the mutual buildings and grounds,contract for utilities and other necessary services,maintain insurance,comply with requests by governmental authorities,coordinate each resident relocation,inspect each unit,handle the residents service requests,collect the residents monthly assessments,allocate the collected funds to specified reserve and expense accounts,pay all operating and maintenance expenses,maintain the mutual records and books,submit accountings to the mutual,prepare the mutual operating budgets,and otherwise operate and maintain the project according to the highest standards achievable longstanding management agreements require grf to provide a host of similar services to the other mutuals.grf stated in its annual report,t he sole purpose for the existence of grf is to provide management,accounting and maintenance services to the sixteen mutual corporations and to care for the community facilities.
the declaration of trust and the written management agreements allow grf to charge the mutuals for its management services,at cost and for no profit,and similarly to charge the residents for costs incurred maintaining the common facilities.grf incorporates these charges into a monthly assessment.the residents pay their monthly assessment directly to grf.

discussion 
grf contends the court wrongly found it is an association subject to the act.this issue turns largely on the nature of grf relationship to leisure world and whether leisure world is a common interest development pursuant to the act.we defer to the court factual findings regarding the relationship between grf and leisure world when they are supported by substantial evidence,but independently construe the act.benninghoff superior court th,d.
our supreme court has explained the advance of the common interest development.c ondominiums,cooperatives,and developments with homeowners associations have become a widely accepted form of real property ownership.these ownership arrangements are known as common interest developments.citations.the owner not only enjoys many of the traditional advantages associated with individual ownership of real property,but also acquires an interest in common with others in the amenities and facilities included in the project.it is this hybrid nature of property rights that largely accounts for the popularity of these new and innovative forms of ownership nahrstedt lakeside village condominium cal th,d,nahrstedt.
in california,common interest developments are subject to the provisions of the common interest development act the act,passed into law in,consolidated in one part of the civil code certain definitions and other substantive provisions pertaining to condominiums and other types of common interest developments.citation.the act enumerates the specific shared ownership arrangements that fall under the rubric common interest development.citation.it also sets out the requirements for establishing a common interest development and grants to the owners association of the development those powers necessary to the development operation nahrstedt,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
the act defines an association as a nonprofit corporation or unincorporated association created for the purpose of managing a common interest development,subd.a.grf concedes it is a nonprofit corporation.the issues remaining are whether grf was created for the purpose of managing leisure world,and whether leisure world is a common interest development.
substantial evidence supports the finding grf was created to manage leisure world 
grf governing documents support the court finding that the only purpose grf has ever had,from its inception to the present,is to manage leisure world.grf articles of incorporation explain that it was formed t o engage primarily and specifically in providing services and furnishing community facilities to housing operated on a cooperative or other basis and to the occupants thereof,to provide services to the mutuals and the residents.the declaration of trust similarly provides that grf was formed primarily for the purpose of providing services and furnishing community facilities to the mutuals and the residents.according to the declaration,grf operations include sponsoring the mutuals,conveying their parcels to them,constructing the common facilities for them,and maintaining the common facilities for the mutuals and the residents.the declaration further provides it was executed to guarantee the operation and management of the common facilities by grf.
grf management agreements with the mutuals bolster the court conclusion.the declaration of trust provides,grf shall perform for the benefit of all the mutuals and their members all duties imposed upon grf under separate written agreement with mutual no.one and under any other written agreements of similar nature hereinafter entered into by grf with other mutuals.an attached agreement provides,grf shall operate and manage the community facilities and maintain and repair the private streets,and provide administrative,recreational and medical services for the benefit of the members of the mutuals at cost and on a nonprofit basis.subsequent management agreements require grf to provide the mutuals with the long list of management services noted above,such as maintaining their files,handling their finances and banking,and providing their property management services.
grf administrator confirmed it manages the mutuals.he testified grf has entered into a management agreement with each mutual,whereby grf provides a dministrative services,maintenance services,accounting services,security,transportation,rule enforcement,and various other administrative functions for activities.he further testified grf provides management services including stock transfer services,file maintenance,and contract supervision.while grf has employees to carry out its managerial duties,the administrator conceded the mutuals have no staff to perform administrative functions.
unsurprisingly,the parties stipulated grf performs most,if not all,of the mutual administrative duties.they stipulated grf provides contract management,property management,financial,payroll,file maintenance,and stock transfer services to the mutuals.they further stipulated grf has a staff of more than administrators,property managers,and other personnel the mutuals have no permanent staff.equally important is what grf does not do.grf does not have any independent operations other than servicing the mutuals and maintaining the common facilities.the parties stipulated,grf has no other business except that which relates to seal beach leisure world.
finally,grf has acknowledged it was created to manage leisure world.it stated in its annual report,t he sole purpose for the existence of grf is to provide management,accounting and maintenance services to the sixteen mutual corporations and to care for the community facilities.going a step further,grf has even acknowledged it is an association subject to the act.it stated in a letter to the residents,leisure world seal beach,grf,and the mutuals are subject to a california law known as the common interest development law,also known as the common interest development act.it repeatedly stated in its alternative dispute resolution letters to residents sent pursuant to the act,t he association herein referred to relates to,as to the mutual corporations,the mutual,and as to the golden rain foundation,the foundation.
grf unpersuasively contends it does not manage leisure world because it does not manage the mutuals residential buildings and common areas.it notes the declaration of trust requires grf to manage only the common facilities,not the mutuals property.it further notes the mutuals articles of incorporation and bylaws require them to manage their own property.finally,grf claims it was not created for the purpose of managing leisure world because it entered the management contracts after its creation moreover,the management contracts can be terminated.
grf exalts form over substance.managing the mutuals was at the core of grf formation.its articles of incorporation provide it will engage primarily and specifically in providing services and furnishing community facilities to the mutuals and their residents.italics added.the declaration of trust provides grf was formed primarily for the purpose of providing services and furnishing community facilities to the mutuals and the residents.italics added.the same three persons formed both grf and seal beach mutual and,less than three months after seal beach mutual transferred the first leisure world property to the trust by recording the declaration of trust,one of those persons executed the first management agreement on behalf of both grf and seal beach mutual.similar management agreements between grf and the other mutuals followed thereafter.the management agreements require grf to manage the residential buildings and perform substantially all administrative functions.grf in fact provides all those services for the mutuals it has no other business.as grf aptly conceded in its annual report,t he sole purpose for the existence of grf is to provide management,accounting and maintenance services to the sixteen mutual corporations and to care for the community facilities.
in sum,substantial evidence shows grf was created to manage the mutuals residential buildings,their common areas,and its own common facilities.the court correctly found grf was created to manage leisure world.
grf alternatively contends that it manages leisure world as an agent of the mutuals,not as an association.the act defines a managing agent as a person or entity who,for compensation or in expectation of compensation,exercises control over the assets of a common interest development,subd.b.but the declaration of trust bars grf from receiving any compensation for managing the common facilities,other than recouping its expenses on an basis.it provides that grf shall receive no profits or other compensation for any of its services rendered as trustee,but shall receive full reimbursement for its costs and grf does more than merely provide management services.it holds title to common facilities pursuant to the declaration of trust.grf own expert witness on the customs and practices of common interest developments conceded at trial that grf is unique.to his knowledge,no other purported management company for a common interest development holds title to property in the community it manages,charges initiation fees to residents,or requires residents to acquire a membership in the management company.
the court correctly found leisure world is a common interest development 
because substantial evidence supports the finding grf is a nonprofit association created to manage leisure world seal beach,we now independently construe the act to decide whether the court correctly found leisure world is a common interest development.three provisions of that act are relevant sections,and.
section defines c ommon interest development as any of the following a community apartment project.a condominium project.a planned development.a stock cooperative,sub
