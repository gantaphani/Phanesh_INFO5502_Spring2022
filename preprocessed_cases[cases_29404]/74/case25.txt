the national organization for marriage nom appeals the district court denial of its motion under c to collect attorneys fees from the internal revenue service.nom contends that the district court abused its discretion by determining that nom was not a prevailing party under c a because it did not substantially prevail in litigation against the irs with respect to the amount in controversy,or the most significant issues presented,and,alternatively,the government position in the litigation was substantially justified under c b.we agree with the district court that the government litigation position was substantially justified,which,by itself,is sufficient to find that nom was not a prevailing party under the statute.consequently,we affirm.
nom is a,nonprofit organization whose mission is to protect marriage and the faith communities that sustain it across the united states.each year,nom must file irs form,which includes the names,addresses,and contribution amounts of donors who gave or more during the year.a a.while federal law requires the irs to make information in a organization return available to the public,the irs must redact the names and addresses of donors listed in a form filing.b b b,d.
despite these rules,an irs clerk released nom unredacted donor list from its filing after receiving a request in january for nom publicly available tax information.the irs destroyed the request after days per its standard policy.consequently,little is known about it other than that it was made by a matthew meisel,who identified himself as a member of the media.
meisel gave nom form information to the human rights campaign the hrc an ideological opponent of nom.the hrc then forwarded the information to the huffington post.both the hrc and the huffington post published the donor list online.
after discovering its unredacted donor list on the internet,nom sought to mitigate any potential harm.it undertook its own investigation of the unauthorized disclosure and attempted to have its information removed from the hrc and the huffington post websites.additionally,it urged the treasury inspector general for tax administration as well as certain members of congress to investigate the disclosure.nom also was forced to mount a defense to a complaint filed with california fair political practices commission by a man named fred karger.the complaint,which alleged violations of california election law,referenced the unredacted information contained in nom form.
nom filed suit against the irs seeking damages pursuant to u.for unlawful inspection and disclosure of confidential tax information by agents of the irs in violation of.nom sought statutory damages,actual damages,punitive damages due to willful and grossly negligent disclosures and inspections of nom return and return information,and costs and attorneys fees under c.
in its answer,the government admitted that on one response to meisel inadvertently disclosed an unredacted copy of nom form information.the government conceded this act entitled nom to a single recovery of statutory damages.it denied,however,that nom was entitled to actual or punitive damages,costs,or attorneys fees.
after a period of discovery,the government moved for summary judgment.it argued that nom failed to present sufficient evidence that the irs conducted any unauthorized inspections,nom was entitled to punitive damages because the irs disclosure was willful or grossly negligent,and nom was entitled to actual damages with regard to this final contention,the government maintained that the unauthorized disclosure was neither the nor proximate cause of nom alleged damages.additionally,the government argued that nom mitigated its claims for actual damages through aggressive and successful fundraising.
the district court granted partial summary judgment to the government.as to nom punitive damages claim,the court found that nom failed to present sufficient evidence showing that the irs acted willfully or with gross negligence.the court also ruled for the government on nom claim of unlawful inspection because nom failed to present sufficient evidence to carry its burden.
the district court,however,denied summary judgment on nom claim for actual damages.the court explained that it ha d little trouble concluding that the unlawful disclosure was the actual cause of nom claimed damages.org.for marriage,united states,d.as for proximate cause,the court noted that the question was a closer call given that proximate cause is a flexible concept not easily defined or implemented.id.at quoting paroline united states.nevertheless,the court explained,t he independent actions of meisel,the hrc,and others can not immunize the irs from responsibility in this case,and therefore t he fact that a was involved in the chain of events does not foreclose finding proximate cause on the facts presented.id.at.finally,the district court rejected the government mitigation argument because there was a continuing factual dispute as to whether the cited contributions were caused by the disclosure,and if so,in what amount.id.at.
the parties subsequently entered into a consent judgment.the government agreed to pay nom to resolve its claims for actual damages and costs.additionally,the parties agreed that the court would retain jurisdiction so nom could seek attorneys fees under c.

under a,a taxpayer may bring suit against the united states if an employee of the united states knowingly,or by reason of negligence,inspects or discloses any return or return information with respect to a taxpayer in violation of any provision of section.reasonable attorneys fees are potentially available under c,but if the defendant is the united states,reasonable attorneys fees may be awarded only if the plaintiff is the prevailing party as determined under section c.section c b i mandates that if the government is the defendant,the plaintiff shall not be treated as the prevailing party if the united states establishes that its position in the proceeding was substantially justified.
the district court held that the government position was substantially justified under c b.the court reasoned that the government reasonably contested nom unfounded conspiracy allegations,and unfounded willful disclosure and inspection allegations that would have supported a claim for punitive damages if properly proven.org.for marriage,united states,wl,at.the court did not comment,however,on whether the government position respecting actual damages was substantially justified.
nom seizes on the district court silence on this issue,arguing that it amounts to an abuse of discretion nom also argues that once the government contention on actual damages is taken into account,it becomes clear that the government position was not substantially justified.we will assume the district court abused its discretion as nom contends.therefore,we turn directly to whether the government position in this litigation was substantially justified in light of its arguments regarding actual damages.
the government litigation position is substantially justified if it has a reasonable basis in law and fact,united states granby,llc,cir quoting cody caterisano,cir,or if it is justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person,pierce underwood,it is not necessarily enough that the government position is more than merely undeserving of sanctions for frivolousness to qualify as substantially justified.granby,at quoting pierce,at.on the other hand,the government position need not necessarily carry the day.pierce,at.the burden is on the government to show based on the totality of the circumstances that its position was substantially justified.c b i bowles,at noting that all the facts and circumstances surrounding the proceeding provide guidance to the court quoting in re testimony of arthur andersen,f d,cir.
