respondent ralphs grocery company ralphs brought suit against appellant missionary church of the disciples of jesus christ the church for trespass.on for summary judgment,ralphs established that church members regularly placed themselves in front of the doors of ralphs el segundo grocery store to solicit donations without first seeking permission from store management or attempting to comply with ralphs rules for expressive activity.ralphs further established that neither the el segundo store nor the area where the church members stood were places where members of the public were encouraged to gather or linger.relying on in re lane cal d,lane,the church contended its members had an absolute right to solicit donations on ralphs property as a commercial location open to the general public the church expressly disavowed reliance on the supreme court landmark decision in robins pruneyard shopping center cal d,pruneyard.accordingly,the church presented virtually no evidence concerning the attributes of the store or the area or its ability to comply with ralphs time,place and manner rules.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of ralphs and issued a permanent injunction barring church members from,among other things,soliciting donations within feet of the sidewalk and apron areas of the el segundo store.
on appeal,the church continues to contend that under lane,it had an unfettered right to use the area in front of ralphs el segundo store to solicit donations without regard to the owner attempt to regulate the time,place and manner of expressive activity on its property.it now also contends the area constituted a public forum within the meaning of pruneyard.we conclude that lane does not support the church absolute right to solicit funds for charitable and religious purposes on any private property open to the public,and that the limited evidence presented supported ralphs position with respect to the characterization of the area for purposes of a pruneyard analysis.ralphs summary judgment motion was,therefore,properly granted 
factual and procedural background 
a.the complaint 
in august,ralphs sued the church for trespass,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.ralphs alleged that in may,two members of the church began soliciting contributions at ralphs el segundo grocery store.the complaint described the el segundo store as a building with a private that ran between the storefront and a fire lane that bordered the customer parking lot.the church members allegedly set up a stand with a bucket and placed themselves in the fire lane directly in front of the doors.when asked to desist,the church members refused.
the complaint stated that because the area in front of the typical ralphs grocery store is similarly limited,ralphs has adopted uniform rules for expressive activity which impose time,place and manner restrictions on all forms of expressive activity that individuals and groups seek to carry out on ralphs store property.the rules state that individuals engaged in expressive activity must position themselves feet from any store entrance according to the complaint,church members made no attempt to contact ralphs prior to engaging in activity on its property or to comply with its rules.
summary judgment 
after preliminary matters were resolved,the parties submitted for summary judgment ralphs presented evidence to support that the el segundo store was located in a building in a commercial strip development with a handful of other commercial retailers and was fronted by a that was situated between the store and a fire lane abutting the customer parking lot.ralphs has exclusive control over the interior of the store,its ways and the surrounding areas.ralphs also presented evidence that persons are invited onto the property solely to shop for food and related products,that the el segundo store did not offer amenities such as plazas,walkways or central courtyards containing benches,and that ralphs did not encourage customers to linger,meet friends,be entertained or congregate on store property for any purpose other than shopping.
ralphs evidence established that members of the church regularly positioned themselves in the fire lane directly in front of the doors of the el segundo store and solicited customers entering and leaving the store for contributions they obstructed the fire lane,disrupted customers and moved a ralphs sign.church members repeatedly ignored requests to comply with ralphs rules for expressive activity or to leave.on one occasion,the manager for operations for the el segundo store gave a church member soliciting in front of the store a copy of the rules.the member immediately threw the rules in the trash.
the church objected to many of the factual assertions made by ralphs in its moving papers as irrelevant,but presented no countervailing evidence to challenge ralphs factual assertions.in support of its,the church presented evidence that it is a nonprofit religious corporation whose goal is to teach the bible and provide assistance to the poor and needy.it also presented evidence that ralphs el segundo store is on a busy street lined with commercial locations and businesses for miles in each direction and that it shares its parking lot with other businesses.the development in which the store is located was said to have an attractive covered plaza and walkway area with tables and chairs for sitting and relaxing.the church presented no other facts about the area or the attributes of ralphs el segundo store.
in its memoranda in support of its motion for summary judgment and in opposition to ralphs motion,the church took the position that ralphs rules for expressive activity fail ed the tests for reasonable time,place and manner regulations and that application of the rules prohibit ed or interfere d with the church speech activities and its solicitation of donations for religious and charitable purposes,but did not explain how or why that was the case.the church asserted that the issue presented was governed not by pruneyard,supra,cal d,but exclusively by lane,supra,cal d.according to the church,lane established that freedom of speech,without the permission of the store owner,is constitutionally protected on a privately owned sidewalk outside the doors of a single,grocery supermarket and that the california constitution grants to members of the public the right to engage in freedom of expression at or near the entrance to grocery stores.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of ralphs and issued the requested permanent injunction.in the written order,the court explained the relevant facts are not in dispute.representatives of the church,engaged in expressive conduct,in the form of soliciting donations from ralphs customers,while on the sidewalk apron immediately outside the entrance to the ralphs store in el segundo,ca.the store is located in a building within a retail strip development.defendant representatives engaged in this conduct in violation of ralphs established restrictions on time,place and manner,and despite objections of ralphs management personnel.the church fail ed to submit any evidence that its expressive activity was related to the conduct of ralphs business,or that the retail development in question was the functional equivalent of a pruneyard town center.as there was no dispute that ralphs operates a,grocery store,ralphs was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
the injunction issued by the court precluded the church its agents,servants,assigns and all those acting in concert with it from using the interior of the ralphs store located in el segundo,the sidewalk and apron areas at the front of the store,and up to and including feet from the sidewalk and apron areas in front of the store,for the following activities obstructing store entrance and exit doors,shopping cart carrels,or fire lane access touching or threatening to touch customers,store employees,vendors,or others having business with ralphs verbally threatening or insulting customers,store employees,vendors,or others having business with ralphs,including with use of expletives asking for,soliciting,or demanding donations from customers,store employees,vendors,or others having business with ralphs placing or positioning on the store sidewalk or apron a bucket,cup,table,or any other receptacle into or onto which to place donations placing or positioning on the store sidewalk or apron any posters,pamphlets,magazines,or papers or moving or obstructing any signs,products,or barriers.the church appealed the judgment.

article i,section of the california constitution provides,in pertinent part,that e very person may freely speak,write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects,being responsible for the abuse of this right.art.i,subd.a.there is no dispute that t his provision is broader and more protective than the free speech clause of the first amendment.snatchko westfield llc th,d,quoting los angeles alliance for survival city of los angeles cal th,d.
half a century ago,federal law and california law were aligned,mov ing steadily toward the protection of the exercise of free speech upon private business property open to the public.sears,roebuck san diego county dist.council of carpenters cal d.in schwartz torrance investment bakery confectionery workers union cal d,schwartz torrance and food employees logan plaza,d logan plaza,overruled in hudgens nlrb,d,both our supreme court and the united states supreme court held that peaceful picketing by union members of a business located in a shopping mall was constitutionally protected expressive activity that the owner of the property could not forbid.the united states supreme court expressed particular concern over the unfair advantage businesses situated in malls would have over businesses located adjacent to public streets and sidewalks should it rule otherwise business enterprises located in downtown areas would be subject to public criticism for their practices,but businesses situated in the suburbs could largely immunize themselves from similar criticism by creating a cordon sanitaire of parking lots around their stores.logan plaza,supra,at.
not long after,however,the united states supreme court held in lloyd tanner,d that the owners of a shopping mall had the right to prohibit members of the public from distributing political handbills unrelated to the operation of the mall our supreme court had previously concluded that the owners of a privately owned mall could not deny all use of the premises to persons who wished to solicit signatures on an initiative petition,even though the petition was unrelated to the mall operations.diamond bland cal d,diamond i.subsequent to lloyd,our supreme court reversed diamond i in diamond bland cal d,diamond ii,finding lloyd rationale controlling.
this was not the last word.less than a decade later,our supreme court addressed the scope of the california constitution guarantee of free speech in the landmark case of pruneyard,supra,cal d.there,the owners of a shopping mall covering acres encompassing walkways,plazas,and buildings containing shops,restaurants and a cinema,prohibited any tenant or visitor from engaging in publicly expressive activity not directly related to the mall commercial purposes.finding that central business districts had yield ed their functions more and more to suburban centers and recognizing that protect ing free speech and petitioning is a goal that matches the protect ion of health and safety,the environment,aesthetics,property values and other societal goals that have been held to justify reasonable restrictions on private property rights,the court held that on the facts before it the california constitution protect s speech and petitioning,reasonably exercised,in shopping centers even when the centers are privately owned.cal d at.
the court in pruneyard made clear that its holding would not apply to every commercial property to which the public was invited.it emphasized that the mall in question was not a modest retail establishment,comparing its size and the facilities it offered to the shopping center in diamond ii,where persons were induced to congregate daily to take advantage of the numerous amenities offered by the shopping center.pruneyard,supra,cal d at,quoting diamond ii.the court also made clear that those who wished to disseminate their ideas on private property would not have free rein.ibid.it expressed support for the property owner promulgation of rules regulating the time,place and manner of any free speech activities.it quoted approvingly from justice mosk dissent in diamond ii which anticipated that the result of a rule supporting free expression would be a handful of additional orderly persons soliciting signatures and distributing handbills under reasonable regulations adopted by the property owner to assure that these activities do not interfere with normal business operations citation,and that such activity would not markedly dilute the owner property rights.pruneyard,supra,at.
throughout the proceedings before the court below,the church expressly eschewed reliance on pruneyard,stating unequivocally that t his case is not governed by robins pruneyard.the church relied solely on lane,asserting that the holding permits members of the public to engage in expressive activities on the private property of any commercial establishment open to the public,without regard to the owner rules regulating such conduct.as we explain below,lane does not support the church position.moreover,the church failure to contest the facts established by ralphs or to put forth evidence or argument with respect to factors important to a pruneyard analysis such as whether the area in front of the el segundo store was amenable to expressive activity,whether there were alternate locations that could be utilized for such activity,whether the conduct of its members was reasonable or whether ralphs rules for expressive conduct were unreasonable precludes any meaningful pruneyard analysis on appeal.

b.the church solicitation of contributions on ralphs property is not protected by lane 
before we resolve whether lane supports the right of church members to solicit funds on ralphs property,we must determine the current viability of lane as precedent.lane,which as we have said,involved a union official who stationed himself in front of a store and passed out pamphlets urging customers to boycott the store,was decided shortly after schwartz torrance,supra,cal d,and logan plaza,supra.citing both cases,as well as other california and federal authority,the court in lane stated the only significant distinction between the cases cited and the instant case is the more limited purposes for which the particular sidewalk is designed to serve here,the customers of one store,and in the other cases customers of two or more stores,or as a route of access to other places or purposes.certainly,this sidewalk is not private in the sense of not being open to the public.the public is openly invited to use it in gaining access to the store and in leaving the premises.thus,in our view it is a public area in which members of the public may exercise first amendment rights.lane,supra,cal d at.
because of its reference to first amendment rights and its reliance on logan plaza,a united states supreme court case later overturned,several appellate courts have questioned whether lane remains good law see,albertson young th,d trader joe progressive campaigns,th,d.our supreme court,however,has repeatedly cited lane with approval and acknowledged its precedential value.for example,in diamond ii,although the court supported the shopping mall owners authority to exclude persons wishing to engage in expressive activity unrelated to the operations of the mall,the court distinguished,rather than overruled lane and schwartz torrance,on the ground that in both cases labor unions had a labor dispute with,and were picketing,businesses located within the shopping centers.the labor activity in those cases had a direct relation to the businesses affected by that activity,a factor which led us to strike the balance between private property rights and first amendment activities in favor of the latter.diamond ii,supra,cal d at,fn.in overruling diamond ii in pruneyard,the supreme court cited lane and schwartz torrance with approval,stating the fact that those opinions cited federal law that subsequently took a divergent course does not diminish their usefulness as precedent.pruneyard,supra,cal d at.in sears,roebuck san diego county dist.county of carpenters,supra,cal d at,decided later that year,the court described lane as r elying both on federal free speech guarantees as set out in logan plaza,supra.and state labor policy as established in schwartz torrance and stated that the holdings in lane and schwartz torrance have not been overruled or eroded in later cases.sears,supra,cal d at.the supreme court reaffirmed the validity of lane most recently in fashion valley mall,llc national labor relations bd.cal th,d,fashion valley,where the mall owners sought to preclude union members from standing in front of a particular store and passing out leaflets urging customers to boycott the store.similar to the contention raised by ralphs here,the owners argued that lane and schwartz torrance could not be relied on because they were based upon the first amendment.id.at,fn,d.the supreme court stated that it found the principles enunciated in those cases persuasive in interpreting california free speech clause and quoted pruneyard to support their continued usefulness as precedent.ibid.
although we decline ralph invitation to find lane outdated,we conclude it fails to support the church position.as explained in diamond ii,lane weighed private property rights against the right of expression at issue and found the balance tipped in favor of the person seeking to engage in free speech because that speech had a direct relation to the business on whose property it was being undertaken.diamond ii,supra,cal d at,fn.the lane court itself stated that it had before it the identical situation the court warned against in logan plaza,supra.if we were to hold the particular sidewalk area to be off limits for the exercise of first amendment rights,in effect we would be saying that by erecting a cordon sanitaire around its store,the owner has succeeded in immunizing itself from public criticism.lane,supra,cal d at,see also sears,roebuck san diego county dist.council of carpenters,supra,cal d at,describing lane as establish ing the legality of union picketing on private sidewalks outside a store as a matter of state labor law diamond i,supra,cal d at,describing lane as involving union picketing in a shopping center and establish ing constitutional protection for picketing and other first amendment activities which are related in their purpose to the normal use to which the shopping center property is devoted.
the supreme court expressed a similar view regarding the importance of the relationship between the location and the speech at issue in fashion valley,where mall rules precluded parties exercising expressive rights from urging a boycott of any mall store.the court quoted diamond i for the proposition that w hen the activity to be protected is the right to picket an employer,the location of the employer business is often the only effective locus alternative locations do not call attention to the problem which is the subject of the picketing and may fail to apply the desired economic pressure.fashion valley,supra,cal th at,d,quoting diamond i,supra,cal d at.explaining that the decision in diamond i recognized that citizens have a strengthened interest in speech that presents a grievance against a particular business in a privately owned shopping center and that a privately owned shopping center must permit peaceful picketing of businesses in shopping centers,even though such picketing may harm the shopping center business interests,the court held in fashion valley that t he mall rule prohibiting speech that advocates a boycott can not withstand strict scrutiny.cal th at,d.
here,the evidence established no relation whatsoever between the church expressive activities and ralphs el segundo location.the church had no grievance against ralphs,much less a labor grievance of the kind at issue in lane.the sole message the church wished to communicate was its need for funds to support its efforts on behalf of the poor and needy.the church had no reason to choose ralphs el segundo store over the myriad other locations where its members could have congregated to communicate their message.accordingly,the church reliance on lane to preclude the grant of summary judgment on ralphs trespass claim was misguided.
c.the church did not contend or present evidence to establish that ralphs el segundo store or the in front is a public forum within the meaning of pruneyard 
in the trial court,the church expressly disclaimed reliance on pruneyard t his case is not governed by robins pruneyard.it presented virtually no evidence concerning the attributes of the el segundo store or the on which its members regularly stood,and no argument that any part of the el segundo store premises should be deemed a public forum within the meaning of pruneyard.in opposing summary judgment,it accused ralphs of misconstru ing the grounds of the church free speech rights by arguing as if the rights were based on the shopping center cases,pruneyard and progeny d espite the fact that the church has made no argument that the speech rights of its missionaries rely on the shopping center cases reversing course on appeal,the church now argues that pruneyard requires ralphs to permit free expression at the el segundo store because the store is located in a retail shopping center,shares a parking lot with other retail stores and,at some unspecified area in the vicinity,there is a covered plaza and walkway with tables and chairs for seating and relaxing.in reviewing the trial court grant of a motion for summary judgment,we need not consider a potential ground for denial made for the first time on appeal.under the principle of theory of the trial,a party appealing a grant of summary judgment is not permitte
