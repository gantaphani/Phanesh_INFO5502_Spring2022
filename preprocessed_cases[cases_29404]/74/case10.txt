the trustee of a testamentary trust appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york rakoff.the district court granted summary judgment to defendant united states on the trustee challenge to a denial of a tax refund.
background 
lucien brownstone was a successful man during his life,and in his will he created a trust for the benefit of his wife ethel.this trust the trust,created under article seventh of lucien will,received as its principal an amount equal to the maximum federal estate tax deduction then allowable.the terms of the trust permitted the trustee to pay principal and interest for ethel benefit,even exhausting the trust principal.in the same provision,lucien will also gave ethel the power to distribute upon her death the remaining principal of the trust to whomever she appointed in her will the power of appointment.lucien will further provided that if ethel did not exercise the power of appointment,the money would go to the lucien and ethel brownstone foundation,the brownstone foundation.
the structure of lucien will was designed to minimize the estate tax burden,and the creation of the power of appointment was critical to that plan.the use of this device ensured the funds comprising the trust principal qualified for the marital deduction from lucien estate,a deduction available,then as today,only if the will vested power in the surviving spouse to appoint the entire interest.b.
after lucien died in and ethel having survived him,the trust came into existence on march.twenty years later,in october,ethel died.in her will,she exercised the power of appointment conferred by lucien will,directing that the trust principal be paid into her estate.ethel further directed by her will that citibank,the executor of the estate,should pay the debts and expenses of the estate and distribute cash bequests to specified family and friends.finally,ethel directed that whatever residuum be divided among eight institutions.for the purposes of this appeal,the government treats those eight institutions as charities.
in april and october of,the trust made income tax payments for in the sum of.in december of,as directed by ethel power of appointment,the trust transferred million to the executor of ethel estate.in october,the trust filed an amended income tax return for,the year ethel died.that amended return,among other things,treated the million distribution as a contribution for charitable purposes and sought to receive a refund of the taxes the trust had paid in.almost two years later,in august,the internal revenue service the irs replied,granting the trust a refund but disallowing the refund in the amount of.that same month,clyde brownstone,the trustee of the trust the trustee,filed a formal written protest with the irs.the trustee argued that the trust owed zero dollars in taxes for because the million distribution prompted by ethel exercise of the power of appointment should be treated as a deductible charitable distribution under c,which allows the deduction of any gross income that pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument is paid for a purpose specified in section c including charitable purposes.c emphasis added.
in march,the irs replied that it would not grant the refund because t he trust did not qualify for a charitable deduction pursuant to section c of the internal revenue code.five months later,the trust filed a federal action challenging,among other things,the denial of the deduction and seeking in overpaid taxes.
both parties moved for summary judgment.after oral argument,the district court granted summary judgment to the government.in considering whether the million distribution qualified for a charitable deduction under section c,the district court identified two dispositive questions what is the governing instrument and was the distribution of the trust principal pursuant to that governing instrument on the first question,the court concluded that lucien will by itself was the governing instrument.the trustee argued that ethel power of appointment,combined with lucien will,comprised the governing instrument.the district court rejected that position,instead adopting the government argument that because the statute speaks in the singular the governing instrument there can only be one,and that instrument is lucien will.
on the second question,the district court held that the million distribution was not made pursuant to lucien will,relying on this court decision in ernest and mary hayward weir foundation united states,cir per curiam,where we concluded that whether a distribution was pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument turns on the intent expressed in that instrument.comparing the intent in article seventh with other,more straightforwardly eleemosynary,provisions of lucien will,judge rakoff concluded that lucien expressed no intent to give the remaining funds in the trust to charity.he noted 
i think it is a closer issue,to be frank,than the first issue.but looking at the will as a whole,it is really hard not to be struck by the fact that here you have a determination that property x goes to charity,that property y goes to charity and that property z the trust principal goes unfettered.as i have repeatedly said today,the intent analysis is one that i am obligated to apply.
thus,the district court concluded that the trust was not entitled to the charitable deduction,and it granted summary judgment to the government.
the trustee appeals.
ii.discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.morales quintel entm t,cir.in doing so,we must determine whether there was a disputed issue of material fact and,if there was not,whether the district court correctly applied the law.pagan nynex pension plan,cir.
the taxpayer bears the burden of showing that it is entitled to a claimed deduction.american valmar int l comm r,cir.
the law applicable to this dispute is discrete.the trust is entitled to the deduction if the gift was,pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument,paid for a purpose specified in section c.c.section c defines the term charitable contribution as,among other things,a contribution to or for the use of a corporation,trust,or community chest,fund,or foundation organized and operated exclusively for religious,charitable,scientific,literary,or educational purposes,or to foster national or international amateur sports competition or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals.c.
thus,to qualify for the deduction the trustee must identify the governing instrument show that the distribution was given pursuant to the terms of that instrument and demonstrate that the distribution was paid for a charitable purpose under c.here,the government assumes the third step of the inquiry is satisfied.we focus our analysis,therefore,on the first and second steps.
two precedents guide our analysis.the first is old colony trust comm r,in which the supreme court considered whether a trust was entitled to certain claimed deductions.the trustee was obligated to pay set benefits to certain beneficiaries,but the trust instrument also authorize d the trustee to pay money to charitable organizations while the beneficiaries were still alive,so long as trust income was at least twice the amount necessary to satisfy the beneficiaries payments.id.at.the trustee,with sufficient trust income,made a number of charitable donations and later claimed tax deductions for them.the government challenged the deductions,arguing they were not given pursuant to the deed creating the trust the language of the statute that preceded the current statute.the first circuit agreed with the government,holding that the deduction was available only when the trust deed unqualifiedly requires a distribution of the income of any year to charitable institutions.old colony trust comm r,cir.in order for payments to charitable institutions to be deductible,they must be directed by the person creating the trust id.at.
in reversing the decision,the supreme court relied on congressional intent and the ordinary meaning of the statute language.congressional intent favored deductions congress intended to enco
