michael and marla sklar the sklars appeal from a decision of the tax court affirming the disallowance of deductions they claimed for tuition and fees paid to their children orthodox jewish day schools.see sklar comm r,wl.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a,and we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the sklars are orthodox jews who in had five children.rather than send their children to public school to meet california state educational requirements,the sklars enrolled each of their children in one of two orthodox jewish day schools,emek hebrew academy emek and yeshiva rav isacsohn torath emeth academy yeshiva rav.they did so because of their sincerely and deeply held religious belief that as jews they have a religious obligation to provide their children with an orthodox jewish education in an orthodox jewish environment.in,the sklars paid a total of to emek and yeshiva rav which included for tuition,for registration fees,for other mandatory fees,and for an after school mishna program at emek during,emek and yeshiva rav each were exempt from federal income tax under c,which provides tax exempt status for certain institutions organized and operated exclusively for religious,charitable,or educational purposes,among others.both schools also qualified as organizations described in b a,which allows donors to deduct charitable donations to qualifying institutions.
both schools provided daily exposure to jewish heritage and values.their goals included educating their students in jewish heritage and values,as well as the tenets of the jewish faith.to this end,time was allocated in the school day for prayers and religious studies,students were required to adhere to orthodox jewish dress codes,and boys and girls attended classes separately.
a child day at each school included specified hours devoted to courses in religious studies and specified hours devoted to secular studies.the length of time that each student participated in secular classes,as opposed to religious studies,and the length of the total school day varied with the gender and grade level of the particular student.
quality secular education that fulfilled the mandatory education requirements of the state of california also was a goal of both schools.emek sought to provide a thorough and curriculum in both religious and secular studies so that every student could succeed in the most rigorous yeshiva jewish high schools and other institutions of higher learning.yeshiva rav sought to prepare its students for matriculation to yeshiva high schools and to attend a college or seminary.
during the school years in issue,the sklars paid tuition and mandatory fees to emek and yeshiva rav for their children education.to ensure payment,the sklars,like other parents,were required to contract with each school to pay,and to give to each school postdated checks covering,the tuition for the upcoming school year.both schools provided tuition discounts to families based on financial need,if documented by detailed financial information submitted to the schools scholarship committees,but the sklars did not seek or receive such assistance.although an orthodox rabbinic ruling precluded either school from expelling students from the jewish studies program during the school year,nonpayment of tuition could result in expulsion from secular studies and the schools refusal to allow the children to register for classes in the subsequent school year.
b.the prior litigation 
in,the sklars learned of a confidential closing agreement the internal revenue service irs had executed with the church of scientology that purportedly allowed deductions for certain religious educational services such as auditing and training.the sklars subsequently amended their tax returns for and,and filed a return for,including new deductions for a portion of the tuition they had paid to their children schools.see sklar,at.the irs allowed these deductions,apparently under the impression that the sklars were scientologists.see id.the sklars claimed similar deductions in,but these were disallowed.id.at.the irs notice of deficiency explained that because the costs were for personal tuition expenses,they were not deductible.the sklars pursued an unsuccessful petition for redetermination before the tax court regarding their deductions,which subsequently came before us.judge reinhardt,writing for our court in an opinion joined by judge pregerson,upheld the tax court denial of the deduction.see sklar comm r sklar i,cir,amending and superseding sklar comm r,cir.
in sklar i,the sklars made virtually identical arguments to those they assert here,based predominantly on their theories that a portion of their tuition payments are tax deductible because they received in exchange only intangible religious benefits and the scientology closing agreement is an unconstitutional establishment of religion from which they should also benefit.
the sklar i panel soundly rejected the sklars argument that certain amendments to the tax code rendered their tuition payments deductible as payments to exclusively religious organizations for which the sklars received only intangible religious benefits.at.specifically,the panel noted that the amendments addressed clearly procedural provisions and that the deduction the sklars alleged would be of doubtful constitutional validity.id.at.
next,the sklar i panel held that the irs was compelled to disclose the contents of its closing agreement with the church of scientology,at least to the extent it fell under a a,see at,and that such disclosure was necessary as a practical matter because the agreement affects not just one taxpayer or a discrete group of taxpayers,but a broad and indeterminate class of taxpayers with a large and constantly changing membership.id.at.further,the panel held where a closing agreement sets out a new policy and contains rules of general applicability to a class of taxpayers,disclosure of at least the relevant part of that agreement is required in the interest of public policy.id.in sklar i,the panel therefore rejected 
the argument that the closing agreement made with the church of scientology,or at least the portion establishing rules or policies that are applicable to scientology members generally,is not subject to public disclosure.the irs is simply not free to enter into closing agreements with religious or other organizations governing the deductions that will be available to their members and to keep such provisions secret from the courts,the congress,and the public.
id.at.the sklar i panel nevertheless opined,without resolving the issue,that the tax court ruling that the closing agreement was irrelevant to the deductibility of the sklars tuition payments was in all likelihood correct.id.it continued 
the tax court concluded that the sklars were not similarly situated to the members of the church of scientology who benefitted from the closing agreement.while we have no doubt that certain taxpayers who belong to religions other than the church of scientology would be similarly situated to such members,we think it unlikely that the sklars are.religious education for elementary or secondary school children does not appear to be similar to the auditing and training conducted by the church of scientology.
id.at see also hernandez comm r,d describing auditing and training.
the sklar i panel then turned to the sklars establishment clause and administrative consistency arguments.although it was not required to decide those issues because the sklars had failed to show that their tuition payments constitute a partially deductible dual payment under the tax code,sklar i,at,the panel noted that had it been required to do so,it would have first concluded that the irs policy constitutes an unconstitutional denominational preference under larson valente,d see sklar i,at.the panel reasoned that the denominational preference embodied in the closing agreement was unconstitutional because it can not be justified by a compelling governmental interest.id.however,the panel indicated it would not be willing to extend that preference to other religious organizations for three reasons first,an extension of the preference would amount to state sponsorship of all religions,which the panel doubted congress or any agency of the government would intend.id.at.second,an extension of the preference would be of questionable constitutional validity under lemon,because administering the policy could require excessive government entanglement with religion.id.at.third,the requested policy appeared to violate.id.
the panel also indicated it would reject the sklars administrative consistency claim because it seriously doubted that the sklars were similarly situated to the scientologists the panel further stated that even if the sklars were similarly situated,because the treatment they seek is of questionable statutory and constitutional validity under of the irc,under lemon,and under hernandez,we would not hold that the unlawful policy set forth in the closing agreement must be extended to all religious organizations.id.at.
finally,relying on united states american bar endowment,d,the sklar i panel rejected the argument that the sklars tuition payments were deductible as a dual payment or quid pro quo payment,a payment made in part as consideration for goods and services and in part for charitable purposes.in american bar endowment,the supreme court held that the taxpayer must satisfy a test to be entitled to the deduction for a quid pro quo payment 
first,the payment is deductible only if and to the extent it exceeds the market value of the benefit received.second,the excess payment must be made with the intention of making a gift.
at.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the sklar i panel held that the sklars failed to introduce evidence demonstrating both that any dual tuition payments they may have made exceeded the market value of the secular education their children received,at,or that they intended to make a gift by contributing such excess payment.id.the panel also suggested that for the purpose of demonstrating the first part of the american bar endowment test,the market value for the tuition payments would be the cost of a comparable secular education offered by private schools,evidence the sklars had failed to introduce,perhaps,because of the practical realities of the high cost of education.id.
c.the current litigation 
on their tax return,the sklars claimed in deductions for purported charitable contributions that comprised a portion of their five children tuition at emek and yeshiva rav.the deduction was based on their estimate that of the tuition payments were for purely religious education,an estimate supported by letters submitted two years later in that were drafted by each of the schools at the sklars request.sklar,at.
the irs disallowed the deduction.the irs also determined the sklars had failed to meet the substantiation requirements of internal revenue code section f with respect to the disallowed of claimed charitable contributions.the sklars petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of deficiency,asserting that the tuition and fee payments to exclusively religious schools are deductible under a dual payment analysis to the extent the payments exceeded the value of the secular education their children received a question left somewhat open in sklar i sections f and of the internal revenue code,as enacted in,authorized the deduction of tuition payments for religious education made to exclusively religious schools an issue all but foreclosed by sklar i and that the closing agreement between the commissioner and the church of scientology constitutionally and administratively requires the irs to allow other taxpayers to take the same charitable deductions for tuition payments to their religious schools a question the panel discussed at length but declined to decide in sklar i.before the tax court,the sklars and the irs stipulated that in the irs had executed a confidential closing agreement with the church of scientology,settling several outstanding issues between the irs and the church of scientology.see id.at.under this agreement,members of the church of scientology were authorized to deduct as charitable contributions at least of the fees for qualified religious services provided by the church of scientology.see id.at.
the tax court again rejected the sklars arguments,holding that the tuition and fee payments to the jewish day schools were not deductible under any of the sklars theories first,the tax court rejected the sklars effort to prove that the tuition and fee payments so exceeded the market value of the secular education their children received that they took on a dual character,that the payments had the character of both a purchase of education and a charitable contribution.id.at see also american bar endowment,at.it found that the sklars expert report regarding tuition at various los angeles area schools demonstrated only that 
some schools charge more tuition than emek and yeshiva rav isacsohn,and some charge less and the amount of tuition petitioners paid is unremarkable and is not excessive for the substantial benefit they received in exchange,an education for their children.
at.the tax court concluded that the sklars failed to demonstrate that any part of their tuition payments was intended as a charitable contribution and that the law precluding deduction of tuition payments to schools providing both secular and religious education controlled.second,the tax court held that the amendments to the code did not change what is deductible under section.id.at.in keeping with our reasoning in sklar i,the tax court concluded that neither f,nor,as amended in,nor the accompanying legislative history suggested that congress intended to make a substantive change to the code or to overrule the long line of cases precluding deductibility of tuition payments to religious schools.id.at.third,the tax court held that the closing agreement between the irs and the church of scientology is irrelevant to the question of whether the sklars are entitled to the deductions.id.at.finally,the tax court concluded that the sklars separate payments for mishna classes,which were held apart from other classes at emek,should not be treated any differently than the tuition and fee payments.the sklars timely appeal.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the tax court conclusions of law and its construction of the tax code de novo,and no deference is owed that court on its application of the law.sklar i,at.we review the tax court factual determinations for clear error and its evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.see sparkman comm r,cir.
b.the sklars tuition payments are not deductible as charitable contributions under the internal revenue code 
section of the internal revenue code allows taxpayers to deduct any charitable contribution,defined as a contribution or gift to or for the use of certain eligible entities enumerated in c,including those exclusively organized for religious purposes and educational purposes.a,c.t o ensure that the payor primary purpose is to assist the charity and not to secure some benefit,we require such contributions to be made for detached and disinterested motives.graham comm r,cir.therefore,quid pro quo payments,where the taxpayer receives a benefit in exchange for the payment,are generally not deductible as charitable contributions.see hernandez comm r,d.in keeping with this framework,tuition payments to parochial schools,which are made with the expectation of a substantial benefit,or quid pro quo,have long been held not to be charitable contributions under.id.at.see also dejong comm r,cir the law is well settled that tuition paid for the education of the children of a taxpayer is a family expense,not a charitable contribution to the educating institution.
in hernandez,the supreme court considered whether taxpayers may deduct as charitable contributions payments made to branch churches of the church of scientology in return for services known as auditing and training.at.both are considered forms of religious education.auditing involves a form of spiritual counseling whereby a person gains spiritual awareness in sessions with an auditor.by participating in training,a person studies the tenets of scientology,gains spiritually,and may seek to become an auditor.members of the church of scientology sought to deduct payments for auditing and training as charitable contributions for religious services.the court held that such payments for religious educational services do not qualify as contribution s or gift s.id.at.rather,t hese payments were part of a quintessential quid pro quo exchange in return for their money,petitioners received an identifiable benefit,namely,auditing and training sessions.id.the court reasoned t he sine qua non of a charitable contribution is a transfer of money or property without adequate consideration.id.quoting american bar endowment,at.
the court further rejected the taxpayers argument that a quid pro quo analysis was not even appropriate,because the payments for auditing and training services resulted in receipt of a purely religious benefit.id.at.the court first found no support in the language of,which makes no special preference for payments made in the expectation of gaining religious benefits or access to a religious service.id.at.second,the court reasoned that accepting the taxpayers deductibility proposal would expand the charitable contribution deduction far beyond what congress has provided.id.at.for example,some taxpayers might regard their tuition payments to parochial schools as generating a religious benefit or as securing access to a religious service,which would be incorrect because such payments have long been held not to be charitable contributions under.id.finally,the court noted that the deduction petitioners seek might raise problems of entanglement between church and state because it would inexorably force the irs and reviewing courts to differentiate religious benefits from secular ones.id.at.while declining to pass on the constitutionality of such hypothetical inquiries,the court noted that pervasive monitoring for the subtle or overt presence of religious matter is a central danger against which we have held the establishment clause guards.id.quoting aguilar felton,d.thus,the hernandez decision clearly forecloses the sklars argument that there is an exception in the code for payments for which one receives purely religious benefits.
the amendments to the tax code did not overrule hernandez 
to circumvent hernandez clear holding,the sklars resurrect their sklar i argument that the amendments to irs f and overruled the court holding in hernandez that only gifts or contributions may be deducted under.according to the sklars,the amendments provide for the deduction of tuition payments for which they receive only intangible religious benefits.we agree with the tax court that the sklar interpretation of the amendments is misguided.
amended f requires the taxpayer to substantiate the contribution by a contemporaneous written acknowledgment of the contribution by the donee organization.f a.this acknowledgment must include an estimate of the value of any goods or services the donor received in exchange,or,if such goods or services consist solely of intangible religious benefits,a statement to that effect.f b iii.the amendment also defines an intangible religious benefit as one which is provided by an organization organized exclusively for religious purposes and which generally is not sold in a commercial transaction outside the donative context.id.as the tax court correctly held,sklar,at,and as we have previously suggested,sklar i,at,this amendment creates an exception only to the new substantiation requirement created by f a nothing in the amendment language suggests that congress intended to expand the types of payments that are deductible contributions.as the sklar i panel explained 
given the clear holding of hernandez and the absence of any direct evidence of congressional intent to overrule the supreme court on this issue,we would be extremely reluctant to read an additional and significant substantive deduction into the statute based on what are clearly procedural provisions regarding the documentation of tax return information,particularly where the deduction would be of doubtful constitutional validity.
the second pertinent amendment requires donee organizations to disclose limitations on the deductibility of certain quid pro quo payments to the donors of such payments.see.amended a requires any organization that receives a quid pro quo contribution in excess of to provide the donor with a written statement declaring that the deductible portion of the contribution can not include the value of the goods or services provided by the organization,along with a good faith estimate of the value of such goods or services.however,b explains 
for purposes of this section,the term quid pro quo contribution means a payment made partly as a contribution and partly in consideration for goods or services provided to the payor by the donee organization.a quid pro quo contribution does not include any payment made to an organization,organized exclusively for religious purposes,in return for which the taxpayer receives solely an intangible religious benefit that generally is not sold in a commercial transaction outside the donative context.
b emphasis added.the sklars read the exemption from the disclosure requirement for organizations organized exclusively for religious purposes which provide solely an intangible religious benefit completely out of context.the sklar i panel explained why the sklars reading of the exemption is unsupportable 
section requires that organizations inform that they will receive a tax deduction only for the amount of their donation above the value of any goods or services received in return for the donation and requires donee organizations to give donors an estimate of this value,exempting from this estimate requirement contributions for which solely intangible religious benefits are received.
nor does the legislative history of these amendments even mention hernandez,and the house report specifically states that,although the new requirements apply only to quid pro quo contributions for commercial benefits,n o inference is intended regarding whether or not any contribution outside the scope of the bill substantiation or reporting requirements is deductible in full or in part under the requirements of section,at,reprinted in.thus,the house report confirms that congress intended to preserve the status quo ante,and hardly serves as support for the sklars argument 
to put to rest the sklars statutory claim,we now hold that neither the plain language of the amendments nor the accompanying legislative history indicates any substantive change to hernandez holding that payment for religious education to religious organizations is not deductible.we agree with the observation of both the tax court and the sklar i panel that had congress intended to overrule judicial precedent and to provide charitable contributions for tuition and fee payments to religious organizations that provide religious education,it would have expressed its intention more clearly.see at,at.
the tuition payments were not dual payment contributions 
the tax court correctly concluded that no part of the sklar tuition payments is deductible under a dual payment analysis.see sklar,at.in american bar endowment,the supreme court considered the question of the extent to which payments to organizations that bear the dual character of a purchase and a contribution are deductible under.at.irs revenue ruling had set forth a test for determining the extent to which such payments are deductible 
first,the payment is deductible only if and to the extent it exceeds the market value of the benefit received.second,the excess payment must be made with the intention of making a gift.
id.at.quoting rul,cum.bull.the court held that revenue ruling embodied the proper standard,reasoning the sine qua non of a charitable contribution is a transfer of money or property without adequate consideration.the taxpayer,therefore,must at a minimum demonstrate that he purposely contributed money or property in excess of the value of any benefit he received in return.id.at.
in american bar endowment,taxpayer members of a charitable organization sought to deduct under refunds from insurance policies negotiated and purchased on their behalf by the charitable organization,which they donated to the organization.see id.at.they claimed that the premiums paid for the insurance,part of which was subsequently refunded due to the experience rating of the policies,were dual payments.id.the supreme court held that the taxpayer members met neither prong of the test for deductibility of dual payments.stating that the most logical test of the value of the insurance the benefit received in return for their payment is the cost of similar policies,the court held that because three of the four taxpayers failed to demonstrate that they could have purchased similar policies for a lower cost,they failed to demonstrate that their payment exceeded the market value of the benefit received.id.at.because the fourth taxpayer,who did prove that there was a comparable insurance program at a lower premium rate for which he was eligible,failed to demonstrate that he knew about the available lower premium during the tax years at issue,the court held that he failed the second prong of the test that he intentionally gave away more than he received.id.
the sklars again have failed to meet their burden of satisfying either prong of the test for a dual payment,and we seriously doubt that they could ever make the showing that would support a dual payment deduction for tuition for combined religious and secular education in sklar i,the panel concluded that the sklars failed to satisfy the requirements for partial deductibility of their tuition payments.our analysis has not changed,despite the sklars effort to introduce evidence as to market value.
first,the sklar i panel reasoned that the sklars failed to show that they intended to make a gift by contributing any such excess payment.at.in fact,the sklars have never even in sklar i,not before the tax court and not before they intended to make a gift as a portion of their tuition payment.indeed,the record is to the contrary.in their brief,the sklars explain at length that they pay the tuition and fees to send their children to orthodox jewish schools because it is a religious imperative of orthodox judaism.they sent their children to yeshiva rav isacsohn and emek in because of their sincerely and deeply held religious belief that as jews they have a religious obligation to provide their children with an orthodox jewish education in an orthodox jewish environment.because they paid for religious education out of their own deeply held religious views,and because the record demonstrates that throughout the school recess,lunch and secular,as well as religious,schools inculcate their children with their religion lifestyle,heritage,and values,the sklars have actually demonstrated the absence of the requisite charitable intent.
second,the sklar i panel reasoned that the sklars have not shown that any dual tuition payments they may have made exceeded the market value of the secular education their children received.id.the panel stated that the sklars needed to present evidence that their total payments exceeded t he market value of the cost of a comparable secular education offered by private schools.id.before the tax court,the sklars introduced expert testimony asserting that catholic schools are the most reasonable comparison benchmarks for the schools attended by the sklar children.based on his estimation of tuition paid for archdiocesan catholic schools in los angeles county in,the sklars expert concluded that the market value of the secular education the sklars children received was between and,such that in the sklars made excess payments of almost per child.the sklars expert also included tuition data for other los angeles schools in his report.the tax court correctly concluded that the evidence in the record indicated some schools charge more tuition than emek and yeshiva rav isacsohn,and some charge less and the amount of tuition petitioners paid is unremarkable and is not excessive for the substantial benefit they received in exchange,an education for their children.at.before us,the sklars have failed to even argue on the tax court factual findings as to the data set forth in their expert report are clearly erroneous.
thus,the tax court did not err by concluding that the sklars failed to show that any part of their tuition fees was a charitable deduction,subject to a dual payment analysis.we conclude that under hernandez and the internal revenue code,their tuition and fee payments must be treated like any other quid pro quo transaction,even if some part of the benefit received was religious in nature.see at.we therefore agree with the tax court that the sklars tuition is not deductible,in whole or in part,under.
c.the closing agreement does not constitutionally and administratively require the irs to allow charitable deductions for the sklars tuition payments to religious schools 
the sklars reassert their sklar i argument that in light of allegedly similar deductions allowed for members of the church of scientology under a closing agreement with the irs,the disallowance of deductions for orthodox jewish religious education violates the establishment clause and principles of administrative consistency.they also argue that the tax court abused its discretion in denying discovery about the closing agreement,including compelling its production before the tax court,the sklars and the commissioner stipulated that an agreement dated october,between the commissioner and the church of scientology settled several longstanding issues.at.a letter the sklars had received from the irs was also admitted.it established that the closing agreement allows individuals to claim,as charitable contributions,percent of the cost of qualified religious services.id.the sklars argued that because of the closing agreement,the commissioner is constitutionally and administratively precluded from disallowing their deductions for school tuition and fees,which they contend are jurisprudentially indistinguishable from the auditing and training provided by the church of scientology.
the tax court correctly dispatched that argument by citing to sklar see at.there the panel stated that w e seriously doubt that the sklars are similarly situated to the persons who benefit from the scientology closing agreement because the religious education of the sklars children does not appear to be similar to the auditing,training or other qualified religious services conducted by the church of scientology.at see also id.at.we also conclude that tuition and fee payments to schools that provide secular and religious education as part of one curriculum are quite different from payments to organizations that provide exclusively religious services.because the sklars are situated differently than members of the church of scientology,the tax court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the closing agreement itself was not relevant,and therefore not discoverable in the sklars redetermination proceedings.
nor did the tax court err in its conclusion that the agreement reached between the irs and the church of scientology does not affect the result in this case,sklar comm r,at,because the analysis in american bar endowment controls here.id.internal citation omitted.the sklar i panel previously assumed the contents of the closing agreement,with reference to a wall street journal article that purported to reprint the agreement in full.see sklar i,at scientologists and irs settle for million,wall,at agreement reprinted in wall interactive edition www.wsj.com.the panel also held that the irs must make the closing agreement publicly available at.the sklar i panel further presumed from the irs failure to disclose that the terms of the closing agreement were as set forth in the wall street journal article,and concluded that the closing agreement constitutes an unconstitutional denominational preference.id.at.we can not improve upon the original panel majority elucidation of the principles at stake 
applying larson valente,at,d,to the policy of the irs towards the church of scientology,the initial inquiry must be whether the policy
