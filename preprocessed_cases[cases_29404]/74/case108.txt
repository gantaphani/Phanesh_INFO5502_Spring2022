this appeal arises from an action brought by richard and sandy gregory against fort bridger rendezvous association fbra.the gregorys allege that the fbra engaged in a horizontal group boycott by refusing to permit them to sell their goods at the fort bridger rendezvous rendezvous in violation of of the sherman act.see.based on the same conduct,the gregorys also allege that the fbra conspired to monopolize sales in violation of of the sherman act.see.the district court granted summary judgment for the fbra on both claims.we take jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
the rendezvous is a historical reenactment held each labor day weekend at the fort bridger historical site in wyoming in which participants reenact an annual rendezvous held by local fur traders from to.the weekend boasts competitions in shooting,archery,and contests,and,relevant to this appeal,hosts traders who sell accurate replicas of goods.the event attracts between visitors and is the largest of its kind in the region.
the state of wyoming granted the fbra,a nonprofit volunteer organization,the exclusive right to conduct the rendezvous.the fbra has approximately ninety members,a majority of whom trade at the rendezvous.some of the members of the fbra board of directors are also traders.one need not be a member of the fbra to trade at the rendezvous,however,as fewer than half of the traders are members of the fbra.
among other things,the fbra monitors traders wares for authenticity and assigns to traders the limited number of trading spaces allowed by its state permit.under the fbra method of assigning spaces,priority is given to traders who participated in the previous year rendezvous.in this way,if a trader files a timely application for space,he generally will receive the same space he occupied the year before.applications received by traders who did not trade at the previous rendezvous,or by traders who were at the previous rendezvous but filed their applications after the deadline,are accepted on a,basis.
although not members of the fbra,the gregorys were and rendezvous traders who offered a wide selection of goods at low prices as compared to most other traders who were members and directors of the fbra.due to their seniority,the gregorys had obtained two coveted trading spaces on the front row of the event,which they maintained by making a timely application every year to the following year rendezvous.
in addition to selling their replica goods at the rendezvous,the gregorys also sold them at a trading post located on the grounds of the fort bridger historical site.their sales of goods were governed by a contract with the state of wyoming rather than by the fbra,however,and were therefore not subject to the fbra standards of authenticity nonetheless,the gregorys sold many of the same goods at the trading post that they offered for sale at the rendezvous.additionally,the gregorys have attended and sold their goods at similar events in other parts of the country.
according to the gregorys,in the late the fbra launched an anticompetitive campaign against them.the gregorys complain of the following conduct the board,acting through a trade committee,forced the gregorys to stop selling unauthentic goods,while other traders,including board members,continued selling identical goods the board removed the camping spaces next to the gregorys trading space which the gregorys used for storage instead of camping and created another trading space the board voted to allow a trader only one space on the front row the board proposed to auction off the gregorys commercially advantageous trading area that they earned by seniority,while no other spaces became the subject of a proposed auction and the board proposed severely limiting the range of merchandise permitted under the replica standard,which would have adversely affected traders like the gregorys 
in response to these actions taken by the board,sandy gregory initiated her own course of conduct against the fbra.she wrote several letters to the board,complaining of its proposals and of personal grudges that some directors had against them.she also wrote to the state of wyoming and accused the fbra directors of gross mismanagement,embezzlement,permit violations,and ethics violations.she asked for more state involvement and control over the fbra and requested that the state keep her communications confidential.gregory also secretly recorded a traders meeting at the rendezvous and several telephone conversations between her husband and kash johnson,chairman of the rendezvous and a director of the fbra.she then wrote a letter to johnson accusing him of being unethical,unprofessional,and twisted with irrational anger.
subsequently,the state of wyoming instructed johnson not to respond to future complaints from gregory.as a result of this instruction,when the gregorys sent their application to the fbra in by registered mail,it was returned to them unopened.when gregory asked johnson why their application was returned,johnson acknowledged that he had not realized that the returned letter was their application.johnson told gregory that if he resent it,it would be accepted.after the gregorys reapplied and their application was accepted,however,the board voted unanimously to reject the gregorys application for trading space at the rendezvous and returned their application fee because of their animosity and pattern of personal and professional attacks made upon the board in their correspondence to both the board members and the state of wyoming.as a result,the gregorys were not permitted to trade at the rendezvous in the gregorys contend that their ouster was orchestrated to eliminate competition and that the reason proffered by the.gregory unruly pretextual.
the gregorys filed suit against the fbra,alleging violations of and of the sherman act.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the fbra after finding that the gregorys failed to show a plurality of actors necessary to establish concerted action or a conspiracy as required by those provisions.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
under federal rule of civil procedure c,we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo and apply the same legal standard used by the district court.coffey healthtrust,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c alteration in original.
section one of the sherman act 
concerted action 
section of the sherman act provides that e very contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise,or conspiracy,in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states is declared to be illegal.section of the clayton act creates a private cause of action for any person who has been injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws,and provides for treble damages.see a full draw productions easton sports,cir.
section has been interpreted as prohibiting only concerted,multilateral action.see bell fur breeders agric,cir.such action occurs when two or more entities that previously pursued their own interests separately combin e to act as one for their common benefit in the restraint of trade.see copperweld independence tube,d.underlying emphasis on concerted action is the rationale that when two formerly separate entities combine for their common benefit,their activity is fraught with risk because it deprives the marketplace of the independent centers of decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands.id.at.for this reason,unilateral conduct,regardless of its effects,is not prohibited by of the sherman act.motive parts warehouse facet,cir quoting contractor util.sales,cir.therefore,it is critical to distinguish between unilateral and concerted action in establishing a violation of.
the general rule,sometimes termed the rule,see freeman san diego ass of realtors,cir,is that coordinated activity within a corporation does not represent a plurality of actors necessary to establish concerted action,copperweld,at.the supreme court has explained that t he officers of a single firm are not separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,so agreements among them do not suddenly bring together economic power that was previously pursuing divergent goals.id.accordingly,an internal agreement to implement a single,unitary firm policies does not raise the antitrust dangers that was designed to police.id.
the gregorys argue that the rule does not apply to the fbra because a majority of its members are traders that are horizontally positioned competitors of the gregorys themselves.in other words,they argue that the officers and members of the corporation are separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests and therefore the principles in copperweld do not apply.indeed,we have recognized a limited exception to the general rule that a corporation can not conspire with its officers or,that employees are capable of combining with their corporate employer when they have an independent personal stake,and thus stand to benefit from conspiring with the corporation to restrain trade.motive parts warehouse,at quoting holter moore,cir.
relying on this court decision in bell fur breeders agricultural cooperative,the district court disagreed with the gregorys contention.likening the fbra to a cooperative,the court held that because the fbra members will theoretically always be in competition with each other,the gregorys were required to show either that the board acted outside the scope of its authority or that board members acted for their own benefit rather than the benefit of the fbra as a whole.having failed to make that requisite showing,the district court concluded that only unilateral conduct was at issue and therefore the gregorys had failed to show a violation of of the sherman act.
we agree with the gregorys that the district court erred in relying on bell and hold that the fbra represents a plurality of actors necessary to establish concerted action under the sherman act.in that case,a group of mink ranchers formed fur breeders agricultural cooperative for the sole purpose of providing mink feed to cooperative members at a reduced cost.the effect of the cooperative was to eliminate competition for minks based on the price of feed.initially,members of the cooperative picked up the feed from one of two locations.after time,fur breeders began delivering feed to its members on an established delivery route.because one of the cooperative written objectives was to ensure that members did not subsidize one another,members on the route paid a price for the feed that included delivery costs.for members living off the route,fur breeders would still deliver,although with an additional surcharge.members could avoid the surcharge by picking up the feed themselves the feed was discounted to exclude normal delivery costs of one cent per pound.id.at.
an member filed suit against fur breeders and its board members alleging price discrimination in violation of the sherman act because the cooperative failed to expand its existing delivery route and refused to provide a discount which included the actual cost members incurred by picking up the feed themselves.through this action,the member argued,fur breeders board members purposely kept the cost of delivered feed down,which benefitted them,but not the three members who picked up their feed.id.at.
in affirming summary judgment for fur breeders,we found that it was an agricultural cooperative whose activities fall squarely within the antitrust exemption for agricultural cooperatives in the clayton and acts.id.at citing.as such,it was immune from liability for a conspiracy with its members.in affirming summary judgment for the individual board members,we assumed without deciding that the independent stakeholder exception could apply to members of an agricultural cooperative but stated that w e do not think that the fact that fur breeders board members compete with other members is dispositive in determining whether the board members had an independent personal stake in the trade at issue and thus stand to benefit from conspiring with the corporation to restrain trade.id.at quotation and citation omitted.we explained that u nlike traditional corporate officers who do not typically compete with each other in the market place,cooperative members are theoretically always in competition with each other because they are in the same trade and sell the same product.id.therefore,holding that competition among members,alone,satisfies the plurality requirement would mean that every action taken by the board potentially violates.id.instead,in determining whether the board members have an independent personal stake to conspire to benefit themselves,we ask whether their actions are beyond the scope of their authority or for their own benefit rather than the benefit of the cooperative as a whole.id.at quotation marks and footnote omitted.
bell can not be understood to broadly exempt associations of horizontal competitors from liability under the antitrust laws so long as its board members are acting within the scope of their authority and with the intention to benefit the association as a whole.such a rule would eviscerate the protections of the sherman act because it would permit,for example,horizontal competitors to form associations in which all competitors agree to sell their product at the same supracompetitive price.this hypothetical association would have the authority to decide at what price to sell their products,and supracompetitive pricing would benefit the whole group,rather than any individual competitor.but this type of agreement is exactly what the antitrust laws were designed to prohibit.
rather,bell stands for the proposition that an agricultural cooperative and its board members constitute a single entity and are thus exempt from antitrust liability when the cooperative is not engaged in one of the excepted activities that removes it from the protections of the clayton and acts.see id.at supra note.bell further provides that in the context of a board of director operating decisions,individual board members are deemed part of the single entity so long as they act within the scope of their authority and for the benefit of the entity,even though the individuals might have an independent personal stake in the action taken by the entity.in other words,in determining the applicability of the independent stakeholder exception to the rule in the context of an association of potential competitors,the proper focus is on the type of decision made by the board.see,div.of skylight,associated press,cir recognizing that to the extent the challenged decision involves the operations of a trade association,board members and the association should be regarded as a single entity.
in this case,the board decision can not be fairly characterized as one involving operations of the fbra.see,northwest wholesale stationers,pac.stationery printing,d stating that analysis applies to a nonprofit cooperative decision to expel a retailer from membership.the decision to deny the gregorys application deprived them of the ability to compete at the decision from which every other stood to benefit.see,div.of skylight,at noting that there is no practical problem in treating those decisions of a trade association that tend to reduce competition as a conspiracy of its members quoting phillip areeda et,antitrust law,at.for these reasons,the district court inappropriately relied on bell in granting summary judgment in favor of the fbra.
finally,we note that unlike a typical corporation in which the officers and directors are not separate actors pursuing separate economic interests,the members of the fbra horizontally compete for the sale of replica goods.these types of associations have traditionally been the objects of antitrust scrutiny because their members often have economic incentives to restrain competition.allied tube conduit indian head,d see also northwest wholesale stationers,d am.soc y of mech.eng rs,hydrolevel,d.as such,we hold the challenged action taken by the the gregorys from selling products at the a plurality of actors necessary to establish the concerted action requiremen
