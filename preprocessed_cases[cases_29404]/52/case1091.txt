the foreign policy of the united states with respect to claims for unpaid insurance benefits arising out of the holocaust era favors settlement over litigation,and provides that the exclusive forum for resolution of such claims should be the international commission on holocaust era insurance claims icheic.while this foreign policy is reflected in executive agreements the president signed with germany and austria,the policy itself extends to claims against insurance companies in nations with which no executive agreement has been executed.
plaintiffs are holocaust survivors and their heirs,who have submitted claims to the icheic with respect to holocaust era insurance policies issued by assicurazioni generali generali,an italian insurer.plaintiffs claims were processed according to icheic guidelines,and were either denied or diminished.plaintiffs brought the instant action against icheic,alleging icheic claims resolution guidelines constitute unfair business practices under california law.plaintiffs assert that code of civil procedure section section provides a statutory basis for their lawsuit.we conclude that section,which provides that california residents may bring claims arising out of holocaust era insurance policies in california courts is preempted by the foreign policy of the united states.the foreign policy of the united states is to favor settlement under icheic processes.it would undermine this policy if california courts were to subject icheic established guidelines to regulation under california unfair business practices law.
and procedural background 
icheic was formed in by six european insurance companies which have funded its operations.generali is one of its principal members.icheic was established to process life insurance claims of holocaust survivors and their heirs for unpaid insurance benefits.its members include three united states insurance regulators including john garamendi,the insurance commissioner of california and certain jewish organizations.it is a private,voluntary association organized under swiss law.
icheic serves as generali agent to process and adjust all holocaust era claims settlement offers are made to claimants based on icheic valuations.plaintiffs allege the icheic guidelines are being used by generali to diminish or deny valid claims,to lower generali overall exposure.in particular,icheic allows generali to employ negative evidence to deny claims.specifically,generali is permitted by icheic to deny a claim if there is no evidence in generali files of an applicable policy,even though generali records are incomplete or incorrect this practice,and others are alleged to constitute unfair business practices under business and professions code section.in reliance on section plaintiffs brought a class action on behalf of all california residents who are holocaust survivors or their heirs who have filed claims to icheic for life insurance policy benefits due them from generali and whose claims have been denied or diminished based upon icheic guidelines or decisions.plaintiffs sought an injunction preventing icheic from using negative evidence and engaging in the other alleged unfair business practices 
icheic responded with a motion to quash and demurrer.icheic argued its contacts with california provided an insufficient basis for personal jurisdiction.further,icheic argued adjudication of this dispute was preempted by foreign policy.icheic supported its foreign policy argument with references to executive agreements signed by the president with germany and austria,setting forth the united states opinion that holocaust era insurance disputes should be resolved by settlement rather than litigation,as well as testimony given before a congressional committee reflecting the same sentiment.
plaintiffs opposed the motion,submitting facts on which they believed personal jurisdiction over icheic could be exercised.as to the foreign policy argument,plaintiffs took the position that,as there was no executive agreement executed with italy or generali,there was no foreign policy interest implicated by this case.
the trial court granted the motion and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court concluded this case implicated the foreign relation interests of the united states,whether or not expressly set forth in an executive agreement.as the case involved a matter which is in the first instance under the primary jurisdiction of our executive branch in conducting the foreign relations of this country,the action was barred.alternatively,the trial court granted the motion to quash 
judgment was entered in favor of icheic and plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.
contentions of the parties 
on appeal,plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in dismissing the action as preempted by foreign policy.plaintiffs assert that,since their action is limited to an action against icheic an entity with which the united states has entered into no agreement with respect to policies issued by generali an insurance company based in italy,a country with which the united states has entered into no relevant agreement,their action is not preempted by the foreign policy interest reflected in the executive agreements with germany and austria icheic responds that the foreign policy of the united states preempts section,barring all such lawsuits,not merely those that may run afoul of existing international agreements.
discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.blank kirwan cal d.
the impact of american ins.garamendi 
the united states supreme court most recent pronouncement on the issue of foreign relations preemption involved the conflict between california statutes and the united states foreign policy interest in resolving holocaust era insurance claims by settlement under icheic guidelines.american ins.garamendi,d hereafter garamendi.as the garamendi opinion dictates the resolution of this appeal,we discuss it in detail.
the garamendi opinion begins with a discussion of the history of world war ii reparations.the issue of reparations against germany was largely postponed after the war,out of fear that reparations would cripple germany and render it a less effective buffer against communism.id.at.it was only after germany was reunified that the moratorium on holocaust claims by foreign nationals was lifted,and class action suits poured into united states courts against companies doing business in germany during the nazi era.id.at.
german companies and the german government sought peace from these actions,and the united states government took action to resolve them.in july,negotiations resulted in the german foundation agreement,by which a fund was established funded half by german businesses and half by the german government to compensate all victims.ibid.the german participation in the foundation agreement was conditioned on an expectation of freedom from lawsuits in united states courts.the united states agreed,somewhat ambiguously,to submit a statement in any relevant lawsuit indicating united states foreign policy favors the foundation as the exclusive forum and remedy for claims against german companies arising from the holocaust era,although the statement would expressly state that it did not itself provide a legal basis for dismissal.id.at.as for insurance claims specifically,both countries agreed that the german foundation would work with the icheic,a voluntary organization formed in by several european insurance companies,the state of israel,jewish and holocaust survivor associations,and the national association of insurance commissioners,the organization of american state insurance commissioners.the job of the icheic,chaired by former secretary of state eagleburger,includes negotiation with european insurers to provide information about unpaid insurance policies issued to holocaust victims and settlement of claims brought under them.it has thus set up procedures for handling demands against participating insurers,including a reasonable review of the participating companies files for production of unpaid policies,an investigatory process to determine the current status of insurance policies for which claims are filed,and a claims and valuation process to settle and pay individual claims,employing relaxed standards of proof.citation.in the pact with the united states,germany stipulated that insurance claims that come within the scope of the current claims handling procedures adopted by the icheic and are made against german insurance companies shall be processed by the companies and the german insurance association on the basis of such procedures id.at.the german foundation pact has served as a model for similar agreements with austria and france,and the united states government continues to pursue comparable agreements with other countries.id.at,fn.omitted.
in the meantime,california was passing its own statutes to address unpaid insurance policies.california enacted section,which provides california superior courts with jurisdiction over lawsuits for unpaid holocaust era insurance claims.california also passed the holocaust victim insurance relief act hvira,insurance code sections,which required all insurers currently doing business in california to disclose information about all policies sold in europe between and by the insurers and their related entities.garamendi,supra,at.
after hvira was enacted,administrative subpoenas were issued against several subsidiaries of european insurance companies participating in the icheic.id.at.in response,deputy secretary of treasury eizenstat wrote to the insurance commissioner of california that although hvira reflects a genuine commitment to justice for holocaust victims and their families,it has the unfortunate effect of damaging the one effective means now at hand to process quickly and completely unpaid insurance claims from the holocaust period,the icheic.ibid.the same day,deputy secretary eizenstat also wrote to california governor making the same points and stressing that hvira would possibly derail the german foundation agreement clearly,for this deal to work german industry and the german government need to be assured that they will get legal peace,not just from lawsuits but from the kind of legislation represented by the hvira.ibid.these expressions of the national government concern proved to be of no consequence,for the state commissioner announced at an investigatory hearing in december that he would enforce hvira to its fullest,requiring the affected insurers to make the disclosures,leave the state voluntarily,or lose their licenses.id.at.
several insurance companies,including generali brought suit for injunctive relief against the california insurance commissioner,challenging the constitutionality of hvira.the supreme court ultimately concluded hvira was preempted because it interfered with the foreign policy of the executive branch.
the supreme court first noted that valid executive agreements are fit to preempt state law,just as treaties are,and if the agreements here had expressly preempted laws like hvira,the issue would be straightforward.id.at,fn.omitted.yet the executive agreements with germany and austria contained no preemption clause.the issue presented was therefore whether hvira was preempted because of its interference with the foreign policy embodied in the agreements.id.at.
the court noted a dispute existed between whether field or conflict preemption should apply in the foreign policy context.that is to say,whether state action with more than incidental effect on foreign affairs is preempted,or whether state action is only preempted when it interferes with a specific interest of the federal government.id.at.the court found it unnecessary to resolve the dispute as the hvira failed the narrower test.the court held that,under the stricter test,the likelihood that state legislation will produce something more than incidental effect in conflict with express foreign policy of the national government would require preemption of the state law.id.at.
the court then set forth its analysis under the narrower test.to begin with,resolving insurance claims that may be held by residents of this country is a matter well within the executive responsibility for foreign affairs.id.at.moreover,t he exercise of the federal executive authority means that state law must give way where,as here,there is evidence of clear conflict between the policies adopted by the two.id.at.the historical background to the execution of the agreements demonstrates that the consistent presidential foreign policy has been to encourage european governments and companies to volunteer settlement funds in preference to litigation or coercive sanctions.ibid.as for insurance claims in particular,the national position,expressed unmistakably in the executive agreements signed by the president with germany and austria,has been to encourage european insurers to work with the icheic to develop acceptable claim procedures,including procedures governing the disclosure of policy information.ibid.this position,of which the agreements are exemplars,has also been consistently supported in the high levels of the executive branch.id.at.
in contrast,california had taken a position of forced disclosure and payment,supplemented by a new cause of action for holocaust survivors if the other sanctions should fail.id.at.hvira compulsion to disclose more information than required by the icheic guidelines undercuts the president diplomatic discretion and the choice he has made exercising it.id.at.the court recognized that if hvira is enforceable,the president would have less economic and diplomatic leverage,and enforceability would ultimately compromise the president ability to speak for the nation in negotiations with other governments.id.at.in short,the california statute thwarts the government policy of repose for companies that pay through the icheic.id.at.
the supreme court held that hvira must yield due to the clear conflict.ibid.the basic fact is that california seeks to use an iron fist where the president has consistently chosen kid gloves.we have heard powerful arguments that the iron fist would work better,and it may be that if the matter of compensation were considered in isolation from all other issues involving the european allies,the iron fist would be the preferable policy.but our thoughts on the efficacy of the one approach versus the other are beside the point,since our business is not to judge the wisdom of the national government policy dissatisfaction should be addressed to the president or,perhaps,congress.the question relevant to preemption in this case is conflict,and the evidence here is more than sufficient to demonstrate that the state act stands in the way of the president diplomatic objectives.id.at.
as relevant to the instant appeal,the garamendi opinion not only sets forth the relevant test,but applies it.a state may not enforce a statute which interferes with a specific interest of the federal government.to have preemptive effect,the specific interest need not be expressly set forth in an official agreement.an interest reflected in official agreements and statements by executive branch officials is sufficient.moreover,the federal government policy of repose for companies that pay through the icheic,is sufficient to preempt a california statute imposing additional duties on european insurers.garamendi held that california insurance disclosure laws which require greater disclosure than that required by the icheic are preempted by this foreign policy.similarly,we must conclude that section,which provides for private actions arising out of holocaust era insurance policies,is preempted by the same policy 
in reaction to garamendi,a federal district court dismissed state and common law actions again
