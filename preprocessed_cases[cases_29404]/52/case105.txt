in support of the criminal proceeding in switzerland,berlamont seeks the production of certain documents relating to an examination of rajiv jaitly jaitly,a former chief risk officer for ois.the jaitly documents were a product of discovery in a case formerly pending before the united states district court for the southern district of new york,rembaum banco santander,civ.
the plaintiffs in the rembaum case were a group of ois investors who brought civil claims in new york similar to those of berlamont in the current swiss criminal proceeding.knowing that jaitly held a management position at ois from to,the parties sought to examine him regarding ois conduct with respect to its madoff investments.on may,the rembaum court issued a letter rogatory to the english high court of justice requesting that jaitly examination be ordered and conducted in london.the english high court granted the application and ordered the examination of jaitly.on july,jaitly was examined in london and a transcript was produced.thereafter,on august,the district court shira scheindlin,judge dismissed the rembaum action on forum non conveniens grounds,holding that switzerland was the appropriate alternative forum.

ii.discussion 
our review of a district court decision granting discovery involves two inquiries whether as a matter of law,the district court erred in its interpretation of the language of the statute and if not,whether the district court decision to grant discovery on the facts before it was in excess of its discretion.brandi dohrn ikb deutsche industriebank ag,cir a district court is said to abuse its discretion if it base s its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.in re sims,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
