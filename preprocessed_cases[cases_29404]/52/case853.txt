prewitt enterprises,prewitt appeals from the dismissal of its complaint against the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec for insufficient service of process and from the denial of its motion for alternative service of process.prewitt complaint against opec alleged a violation of the sherman act,for illegal agreements on production and export of crude oil and claimed equitable relief pursuant to the clayton act,because opec initially did not respond to the complaint,the district court entered a default final judgment against opec enjoining it from entering into,implementing or enforcing any agreements to fix and control the production and export of crude oil for one year.opec then appeared and moved to vacate the default judgment and injunction on the grounds that opec had never been properly served with process,and thus,the court lacked jurisdiction over it.the district court concluded that,because opec resides in austria and the applicable austrian law prohibits service without opec consent,prewitt complaint must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.we agree and affirm the dismissal of prewitt complaint for lack of jurisdiction because service of process on opec has not been effectuated.we also affirm the district court denial of alternative service of process because,in this case,there are no means available for service upon opec under the federal rules of civil procedure.
background 
prewitt is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of alabama with its principal place of business in birmingham,alabama.prewitt purchases substantial quantities of gasoline and other refined petroleum products for resale at its eastwood texaco service center gasoline station.
opec is an intergovernmental organization originally established in via resolutions promulgated at the conference of the representatives of the governments of iran,iraq,kuwait,saudi arabia and venezuela in baghdad,iraq.the principal aim of opec is the and unification of the petroleum policies of member countries and the determination of the best means for safeguarding their interests,individually and collectively.opec stat.art.a.presently,opec membership consists of algeria,indonesia,iran,iraq,kuwait,libya,nigeria,qatar,saudi arabia,the united arab emirates and venezuela.since september,opec has been headquartered in vienna,austria.its relationship with the austrian government is governed by the agreement between the republic of austria and the organization of the petroleum exporting countries regarding the headquarters of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries,february,bgbl headquarters agreement or headquarters agreement.
prewitt filed a complaint with the district court against opec on behalf of itself and as the representative of all persons or entities who have indirectly purchased petroleum or petroleum products in the united states since march.prewitt claimed that opec has been coordinating an international conspiracy through agreements among its member states and members to limit the production and export of oil in order to fix world oil prices above competitive levels.prewitt argued that these agreements constitute violations of united states antitrust laws,specifically the sherman and clayton acts,and have resulted in a substantial and adverse impact on united states trade and commerce.prewitt claimed that as a result of opec illegal conduct,its own acquisition and inventory costs for gasoline have increased significantly.consequently,prewitt requested that the court declare the agreements illegal under united states law,enjoin implementation of the agreements,grant any other appropriate equitable relief,and award costs of the suit against opec for injuries sustained by prewitt.
prewitt attempted service on opec by requesting that the trial court send a copy of the complaint to opec by international registered mail,return receipt requested.the court clerk did so,mailing prewitt summons and complaint to opec at its headquarters in vienna.the pleadings were signed for,stamped received by opec administration and human resources department,and forwarded to the director of opec research division as well as other departments including the secretary general office.ultimately,the secretary general decided that the opec secretariat would not take any action with regard to the summons and complaint.
without the participation of opec,the district court certified a class defined as all persons or entities who purchased refined petroleum products in the united states from march to the present and entered a default final judgment and order of injunction against opec.the court found that there was a conspiracy between opec,its member states,and members,namely norway,mexico,the russian federation and oman,to fix and control crude oil prices that the agreements coordinated and implemented by opec were illegal under united states antitrust laws that opec illegal conduct has resulted in substantial and adverse impact on united states trade and commerce of approximately million per day and that opec and those acting in concert with opec should be enjoined from entering into,implementing,and enforcing any further oil agreements for a period of twelve months.copies of the court orders were delivered to each of the united states embassies for the member states of opec.
in response,opec made a special appearance and filed a motion to set aside the default judgment and stay its enforcement pursuant to rule b,and of the federal rules of civil procedure fed.civ,which the district court granted,vacating the default judgment and injunction opec then filed a motion to dismiss prewitt complaint on various grounds including insufficient service of process pursuant to.b the district court dismissed the case without prejudice,finding that prewitt had failed to serve opec its summons and complaint properly under the federal rules.prewitt then filed a motion to pursue alternative means of effecting service or to amend the judgment.the district court denied the motion finding that,in this case,opec can not be effectively served with process.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of a motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process under.b by applying a de novo standard to the law and a clear error standard to any findings of fact.s davis int l,republic of yemen,cir.we generally review the district court interpretation of.on service of process as a matter of law de novo.vencor,standard life accident,cir.likewise,the district court interpretation of foreign law in determining sufficiency of service of process is subject to de novo review.united states mcnab,cir citing united states gecas,cir en banc.however,we join our sister circuit in holding that the district court denial of a motion for alternative service of process under.f is subject to an abuse of discretion standard because the plain language of the rule stipulates that the district court may direct alternative means of service.rio properties,rio int l interlink,cir.
the threshold issue in this case is whether opec has been effectively served under the federal rules of civil procedure.if it has not,we must then determine whether extraterritorial service of process on opec may be effectuated at all under the circumstances here.by definition,service of summons is the procedure by which a court having venue and jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit asserts jurisdiction over the person of the party served.publ g murphree.a court is required to have personal jurisdiction under the due process clauses of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution as a matter of individual liberty so that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.ins.of ir.compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d quoting int l shoe washington.
there are two rules of federal civil procedure that apply to service of process upon an international entity located outside of united states jurisdiction.f service upon individuals in a foreign country and.h service of process upon corporations and associations.the latter governs service on unincorporated associations located outside of the united states and provides that 
unless otherwise provided by federal law,service upon a n unincorporated association that is subject to suit under a common name,and from which a waiver of service has not been obtained and filed,shall be effected 
in a place not within any judicial district of the united states in any manner prescribed for individuals by subdivision f except personal delivery emphasis added.
h.thus,an unincorporated association headquartered outside of the united states that is subject to suit under a common and has not waived may be served in any manner authorized under.f for individuals in a foreign country except for personal delivery.
turning to.f,the first relevant section provides that 
unless otherwise provided by federal law,service upon an individual from whom a waiver has not been obtained and filed,other than an infant or an incompetent person,may be effected in a place not within any judicial district of the united states 
by any internationally agreed means reasonably calculated to give notice,such as those means authorized by the hague convention on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents 
f.in this case,no other means of service has been otherwise provided by federal law nor is there an internationally agreed means reasonably calculated to give notice such as those means authorized by the hague convention on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents the federal laws pertaining to service of process on a foreign entity are codified in et,the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,and et,the international organizations immunities act ioia.the parties agree that neither of these federal laws apply to opec in this case the parties likewise agree that there is no international agreement that stipulates the appropriate means of service 
thus,we must look to the remainder of.f,which provides for other methods by which an unincorporated association may be served in the absence of relevant federal law or international agreements 
if there is no internationally agreed means of service or the applicable international agreement allows other means of service,provided that service is reasonably calculated to give notice 
a in the manner prescribed by the law of the foreign country for service in that country in an action in any of its courts of general jurisdiction or 
b as directed by the foreign authority in response to a letter rogatory or letter of request or 
c unless prohibited by the law of the foreign country,by 
i delivery to the individual personally of a copy of the summons and the complaint or 
ii any form of mail requiring a signed receipt,to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the party to be served or 
by other means not prohibited by international agreement as may be directed by the court.
prewitt originally chose to attempt service of process on opec under.f c ii.however,the method set forth under that provision applies only if it is not prohibited by the law of the foreign country.based on the evidence presented the district court correctly found that service on opec was prohibited by the law of austria.article of the headquarters agreement provides that the service of legal process shall not take place within the opec headquarters seat except with the express consent of,and under conditions approved by,the secretary general.since the headquarters agreement was enacted into law by resolution of the austrian parliament and published in the austrian official gazette pursuant to the austrian constitution,the district court found it to be an integral part of austrian law thus,because service was prohibited by austrian law,prewitt could not have effectively served opec under.f c ii.
prewitt nonetheless suggests that we should liberally construe the formal requirements for service under the federal rules because opec received actual notice but simply chose to ignore the whole thing.br.of appellant at.however,we find no support for such an argument due process under the united states constitution requires that before a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant,there must be more than notice to the defendant t here also must be a basis for the defendant amenability to service of summons.absent consent,this means there must be authorization for service of summons on the defendant.omni capital int l rudolf wolff,d emphasis added in other words,an individual or entity is not obliged to engage in litigation unless officially notified of the action under a court authority,by formal process.murphy,michetti pipe stringing,d.in this case.f c ii clearly states that service of process by registered mail is only authorized where it is not prohibited by foreign law.here,the headquarters agreement constitutes austrian law and,under article,expressly prohibits all service of process upon opec within the headquarters seat that has not been consented to by its secretary general.thus,we agree with the district court that even though opec had actual notice of the filing of the suit,service of process was ineffective because it was clearly not in substantial compliance with the requirements of.f c ii.
alternatively,prewitt argues that even if service failed under.f c ii,service by registered mail upon opec nonetheless complied with.f a,which permits service if it is effectuated in the manner prescribed by the law of the foreign country for service in that country in an action in any of its courts of general jurisdiction.the provisions of austrian law that prewitt references from austria civil procedure code and regulations for service of process by mail relate to service by austrian courts on persons resident in austria and abroad.none of these austrian law provisions directly pertain to service mailed from abroad upon international organizations resident in austria.prewitt argues that we should look only to the approved method of service within the foreign jurisdiction and not to the substance of austrian law.however,the substance of the law specifically relating to service of process can not be divorced from the method of service.indeed,and of the austrian service act specifically address service from authorities abroad upon residents in austria and trump the more general provisions cited by prewitt from the austrian code of civil procedure and regulations for service of process by austrian courts on residents in austria or abroad moreover,the regulation regarding the service of process by mail upon persons abroad in civil proceedings that prewitt argues applies in this case specifically states that it does not apply to service on entities specified under of the austrian service act.dist.doc,exh.section as amended of the austrian service act requires that 
the service of documents generated by authorities abroad to recipients in austria shall be carried out in accordance with the existing international conventions,in the absence of which it has to be done in accordance with this law emphasis added.
section as amended of the austrian service act directly addresses service from abroad upon international organizations such as opec requiring that 
the mediation of the federal ministry for foreign affairs shall be enlisted in undertaking service of process on foreigners or international organizations that enjoy privileges and immunities under international law,regardless of their place of residence or headquarters.
there would be no way for prewitt to serve opec under of the austrian service act because we must assume that if it had gone to the austrian federal ministry of foreign affairs,the ministry would have applied the laws of its own country and obeyed the dictates of the headquarters agreement prohibiting service without opec consent.
in response,prewitt again argues that actual notice can cure defective service of process pursuant to section of the austrian service act,which provides 
should defects in service of process occur,service shall be deemed effectuated at the time when the document has actually reached the recipient designated by the authority.
section as amended january,of the austrian service act.however,this section has specifically been interpreted in austria not to apply to defects in service of process that are in breach of the requirements for service under an international agreement such as the headquarters agreement moreover,section may not cure a failure to obtain opec express consent because under the austrian law of lex specialis,the more specific provision in the headquarters agreement for service of process upon opec takes precedence over the more general language of the austrian service act.expert decl.of wolfgang hahnkamper,dist.doc,exh.at,finally,prewitt contends that even if its service by registered mail on opec could not be effectuated pursuant to any of the provisions of.f,the district court still had the discretion to order service of process pursuant to.f,which provides that service may be effected by other means not prohibited by international agreement as may be directed by the court.emphasis added.we agree with prewitt that a district court denial of relief under f is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.however,there is no abuse of discretion here on the contrary,any circumvention of f c ii by the district court in directing service again by registered mail would constitute such an abuse.on these facts,we can not read f as permitting that which has already been specifically prohibited under f.
prewitt then argues that,even if service by registered mail is prohibited by f,other means of giving actual notice,such as fax or,that are not mentioned in the rule or prohibited by international agreement could be employed to serve opec under.f,even if the service is contrary to the laws of austria however,the advisory committee notes to.f instruct that 
paragraph authorizes the court to approve other methods of service not prohibited by international agreements inasmuch as our constitution requires that reasonable notice be given,an earnest effort should be made to devise a method of communication that is consistent with due process and minimizes offense to foreign law.
emphasis added.rather than minimizing offense to austrian law,the failure to obtain opec consent would constitute a substantial affront to austrian law.we can find no support permitting such a consequence in the face of austria direct prohibition of service on opec without its consent the case relied upon as persuasive by prewitt,rio properties,rio int l interlink,cir,is not at all applicable to the circumstances here.in rio,the court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering service by email upon an international corporation based in costa rica.however,the primary issue in that case was whether.f should be read to create a hierarchy of preferred methods of service of process,requiring a party to attempt service by the methods enumerated in.f before petitioning the court for alternative relief under.f.more importantly,the facts supporting the district court direction of alternative service in rio are completely different from the facts here.in rio,the court determined that the defendant,an international internet company doing business in the united states,had a viable presence in the united states that physical personal service had been legally attempted by actually serving a legitimate agent of the defendant in the united states and that the defendant had evaded the attempted service.the most important distinction,however,is that in rio,there was no discussion of costa rican law at all,much less of any prohibitions relating to service of process and thus,no need to take into account the advisory note to.f directing that alternative service of process should minimize offense to foreign law 
austrian law clearly provides protection to opec as an international organization from all methods of service of process without its consent and also requires that any service of process from abroad be effected through austrian authorities.in this case,opec has made clear that it refuses to consent expressly to service of process by prewitt thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying prewitt motion to authorize alternative means of service.
iii.conclusion 
based on the foregoing,we affirm the district court motion to dismiss this case for insufficient service of process and its denial of alternative service of process on opec.
