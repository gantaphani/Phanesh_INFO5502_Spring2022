this case arises from the unfortunate death of daisy scott emory,who died while on vacation in the bahamas.at issue in this appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the suit on forum non conveniens grounds.for the following reasons,we reverse and remand this matter to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
factual background 
in,emory purchased a discounted vacation package at the island palm resort on grand bahama island,bahamas.the vacation package required her to tour the island palm sister hotel,the island seas,in order to attend a timeshare presentation.emory traveled to the bahamas with her daughter,sister,and two cousins.while at the island seas,emory and her party purchased tickets for a banana boat ride from paradise watersports,llc,a vendor which operated a kiosk near the front desk.paradise watersports leased the kiosk space at the island seas in order to market its services directly to guests and visitors of the resort.
george douglas,a paradise watersports employee,was in charge of towing the banana boat.the plaintiff,the representative of emory estate,alleges that emory notified douglas that she and another member of her party could not swim.the plaintiff also alleges that douglas gave emory a life vest that was too small and worn,but assured her that it would keep her afloat if necessary.
while emory and three of her family members were riding on the banana boat,the boat capsized,and emory fell into the water.douglas was operating the tow boat at that time.emory eventually died,though the parties dispute whether or not she drowned.
emory daughter,rene wilson,filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of florida as the personal representative of emory estate,alleging negligence,vicarious liability,and fraud.in her corrected second amended complaint,the plaintiff named island seas investments,island seas resort island palm investments,island palm resort aqua sun investments,and robert william bill carlson as defendants.carlson owns island palm investments and island seas investments.paradise watersports and douglas were not named as defendants.the plaintiff subsequently dismissed all of her claims against aqua sun investments.
at the time of her death,emory was an orlando,florida resident.orlando is located in the middle district of florida.emory estate is being probated in orange county,florida,which is located in the middle district.emory sister and two cousins who witnessed emory death all live in the middle district of florida.the plaintiff is also a resident of the middle district of florida.all of the fact witnesses concerning damages,including family members,friends,doctors,and emory employer,are residents of the united states,most in various parts of florida.documentary evidence relating to damages is also located in florida.
douglas is a resident of the bahamas.according to the plaintiff,he is the only witness to the incident on the boat who is not a florida resident.douglas is no longer employed by paradise watersports,and may no longer be located in the bahamas,as further discussed infra.paradise watersports is owned by two bahamian residents.
defendant carlson is a permanent resident of the bahamas.for more than years,he owned and operated businesses in florida.at the time the lawsuit was filed,he owned and was an officer or director of at least nine florida corporations,including aqua sun investments,which the plaintiff contends essentially runs both the defendant island seas and the defendant island palm out of ormond beach,florida.
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff complaint for improper venue.they argued that no legitimate basis existed for the case to be heard in the southern district of florida,and that under the forum non conveniens test,the appropriate forum for the case was the bahamas.
in support of her response to the defendants motion to dismiss,the plaintiff presented an affidavit from a bahamian attorney listing the ways having to file the case in the bahamas would be detrimental to the plaintiff.the affidavit states that contingency fee contracts are outlawed in the bahamas,so the plaintiff would have to pay her attorneys an hourly fee that the attorney hourly fee was,which was typical that the plaintiff attorneys from the united states would not be permitted to prosecute an action in the bahamas on her behalf that the defendants may apply to a bahamian court to require the plaintiff to post security for litigation costs that if the plaintiff should not prevail in a bahamian action,the bahamian court could assess not only costs against her,but all or part of the defendants attorneys fees as well that it would likely take two to three years for the case to get to trial in the bahamas that a bahamian court has very little power to compel foreign persons to give testimony that discovery is permissible only after the close of pleadings,in a separate action and that it was unlikely that a bahamian court would grant the plaintiff a jury trial.
the plaintiff also filed an affidavit of her own,stating that her witnesses were all in the united states and mostly in florida.the affidavit also stated that she would not be able to litigate her claim if the case was heard in the bahamas,rather than in florida 
there were three family members who traveled with my mother to the bahamas and they are all witnesses to her death.these include our cousins,syretta wright,kyendah wood,and my mother sister,roxeen williams.all three are florida residents.all of the deceased sic treating physicians reside and work in florida.the estate does not have money to bring these doctors or witnesses to the bahamas for trial there.i have learned that continency sic legal contracts are prohibited in the bahamas.the estate does not have assets that could be sold in order to pay for hourly legal representation in the bahamian courts.i have also learned that a bond would be required in order to bring this matter in the bahamas.the estate does not have monies to post a bond in order to proceed with litigation.should the estate be forced to post a bond or hire hourly legal representation,we could not afford to continue to prosecute this matter and we would be shut out of any recovery for the death of our mother.
emphasis in original doc,paragraphs.
neither the plaintiff affidavit nor the attorney affidavit was challenged or rebutted by the defendants.
procedural background 
the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss,finding that the balance of conveniences strongly favored dismissal and that the bahamas was the proper forum for the plaintiff claims.the plaintiff appeals that ruling,arguing that the district court failed to use the proper standard to evaluate the forum non conveniens motion.
