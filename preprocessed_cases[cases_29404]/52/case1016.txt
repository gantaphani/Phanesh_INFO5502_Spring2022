the commission then appealed to this court.we vacated the decision of the court of international trade in nippon ii and ordered a remand to the commission for additional data gathering and analysis.nippon iii,at.we explained that to the extent the court of international trade engaged in refinding the facts,by determining witness credibility,or interposing its own determinations on causation and material injury it exceeded its authority,and held that the trade court abused its discretion by declining to remand the case to the commission.id.at.
on the second remand,the commission yet again made an affirmative material injury determination.srd.nippon sought review once more,and the court of international trade remanded for a third time,again instructing the commission to enter a negative material injury determination.nippon iv,at.in addition,the trade court directed the commission to determine whether the domestic industry was threatened with material injury.id.at.
the commission entered a negative material injury determination on the third remand,stating this outcome is dictated by the court findings in nippon iv it is not,however,the determination we would have made in the absence of those findings.trd at.similarly,the commission found that certain statutory factors weighed in favor of an affirmative threat determination,but explained that the trade court statement in nippon iv that the record fully supports a negative determination and will not support an affirmative one,d at emphasis in original,constrained significantly its ability to perform a threat analysis and,in effect,required it to issue a ruling contrary to its factual findings.trd at.as such,the commission issued a negative threat of material injury determination.id.the commission expressed concern that the court of international trade had again exceeded the scope of its authority 
although we comply with the court order,we are concerned the court has again exceeded the scope of its review authority in this case w e believe that the trade court has committed the same mistakes identified by the federal circuit in nippon iii.for example,the court has again facts by substituting its view of the record for that of the commission on such important issues as the significance of subject underselling or the existence of correlations between underselling and increased purchases of subject imports during the period of investigation.the court has also rejected the commission witness credibility determinations,substituting in its place the court own assessment of the accuracy of testimony offered by purchasers during the investigation.
finally,by directing the commission to issue a determination that subject imports did not cause material injury to the industry,the court has again substituted its own findings on the ultimate issues of causation and injury for those of the commission,even though the federal circuit specifically directed the court in nippon iii not to do so.

the united states and mittal appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
congress created a highly specialized system for resolving antidumping allegations,which recognizes and exploits each participant area of expertise.an antidumping inquiry is divided into two a determination of whether the subject imports were,or were likely to be,sold at ltfv,and a material injury determination.congress placed responsibility for the ltfv determination with industry experts at the department of commerce,a,and placed responsibility for the material injury determination with trade experts at the commission.id.b.
commissioners are appointed by the president,and confirmed by the senate,because of their expertise in recognizing,and distinguishing between,fair and unfair trade practices.they presumably are selected to be commissioners based on their expertise in,inter alia,foreign relations,trade negotiations,and economics.because of this expertise,commissioners are the factfinders in the material injury determination it is the commission task to evaluate the evidence it collects during its investigation.certain decisions,such as the weight to be assigned a particular piece of evidence,lie at the core of that evaluative process.steel group united states.
in contrast,article iii judges have expertise primarily in law.accordingly,congress assigned the court of international trade,and,through our appellate authority,this court,the responsibility to review the legal sufficiency of a commission determination.when the commission has made a final determination of material injury or threat of material injury to a domestic industry,b b i provides that the court of international trade shall hold unlawful any determination,finding,or conclusion found to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record,or otherwise not in accordance with law.to be sure,judges of the court of international trade are experts in such cases,which form most of their docket,while this court judges are characterized as generalists,as trade cases comprise only about six percent of the federal circuit docket.
congress did not specify a standard of review for this court in reviewing judgments of the court of international trade.in atlantic sugar,united states,however,we adopted the substantial evidence judicial review standard prescribed at b b i for the trade court as our appellate standard of review because the substantial evidence standard requires review of the entire administrative record,we consider both the trade court prior decisions and the commission determinations,see am.silicon techs.united states,including the evidence presented to and the analysis by the commission,matsushita indus.united states.in undertaking this review,we give great weight to the informed opinion of the court of international trade.suramerica de aleaciones laminadas,united states.indeed,it is nearly always the starting point of our analysis.
in nippon iii,we expressly declined to decide whether the evidence supporting the commission affirmative material injury determination was substantial,stating that i f and when the case reaches us again there will be time enough to do so.at.the case has reached us again,and we must now examine the substantiality of the evidence.
substantial evidence is difficult to define precisely.however,the supreme court,congress,and prior panels of this court have provided some guidance.in nlrb columbian enameling stamping,the court explained that s ubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla,and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established.a reviewing court must consider the record as a whole,including that which fairly detracts from its weight,to determine whether there exists such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.universal camera,at.quoting consol.edison nlrb.as judge nies explained in her additional views in ssih equipment sa united states itc,in the hierarchy of the four most common standards of review,substantial evidence is the second most deferential,and can be translated roughly to mean is the determination unreasonable 
in the legislative history of the apa,which adopted the substantial evidence standard of judicial review for certain agency decisions,see e,the senate judiciary committee report recognized the difficulty of precise definition 
as a matter of language,substantial evidence would seem to be an adequate expression of law.the difficulty comes about in the practice of agencies to rely upon and of courts to tacitly approve something rely upon suspicion,surmise,implications,or plainly incredible evidence.it will be the duty of the courts to determine in the final analysis and in the exercise of their independent judgment,whether on the whole record the evidence in a given instance is sufficiently substantial to support a finding,conclusion,or other agency action as a matter of law.
sess,quoted in universal camera,at.accordingly,the court in universal camera instructed that,under the substantial evidence standard,a reviewing court is not barred from setting aside a board decision when it can not conscientiously find that the evidence supporting that decision is substantial,when viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes,including the body of evidence opposed to the board view.at.
a party challenging the commission determination under the substantial evidence standard has chosen a course with a high barrier to reversal.mitsubishi heavy,united states.we have explained that even if it is possible to draw two inconsistent conclusions from evidence in the record,such a possibility does not prevent the commission determination from being supported by substantial evidence.am.silicon techs.united states.accordingly,the question for the court of international trade was,and for this court is,not whether we agree with the commission decision,nor whether we would have reached the same result as the commission had the matter come before us for decision in the first instance.steel,at.rather,we must affirm a commission determination if it is reasonable and supported by the record as a whole,even if some evidence detracts from the commission conclusion.altx,united states,internal quotation marks omitted.in short,we do not make the determination we merely vet the determination.
in a material injury inquiry,the commission is required by statute to evaluate the volume,price effects,and impact of the subject imports.when the commission makes an affirmative material injury determination,it must decide whether the material injury to the domestic industry is by reason of the subject imports.b.
the commission engaged in substantial research and analysis prior to issuing its initial affirmative material injury determination.it created,distributed,and analyzed responses to detailed questionnaires sent to all seven domestic tccss producers,as well as the five largest domestic purchasers of tccss.from producers,the commission obtained and analyzed information on production,geographic scope of sales,pricing and discounting practices,capacity utilization,shipments,inventories,and employment.from purchasers,the commission obtained and analyzed information on final bids of domestic and japanese suppliers,negotiation tactics,and purchasing volume,and attempted to verify producers lost sale allegations.two commission staff members visited complainant weirton steel premises and interviewed several employees regarding the tccss manufacturing process,negotiations,pricing,and contracts.in addition,commissioners heard a full day of testimony,including that of officers of four domestic purchasers,the ceo of weirton steel,and seven members of congress,including senator john rockefeller iv.
the court of international trade likewise engaged in careful,thoughtful review of each of the commission findings.in nippon i,the court of international trade sustained the commission finding of a small but significant volume.d at.the commission also found significant impact,which nippon did not appeal.see id.at.thus,as of nippon iv,the court of international trade had already approved commission findings on two of the three factors to be considered in a material injury determination.the evidence rejected by the court of international trade in nippon iv related to the remaining factor,price effects,and to causation.we therefore state the issue before us as whether the commission findings that japanese tccss dumping could be linked to price effects in,and causation of injury to,the domestic market so distorts or detracts from the evidence in favor of injury as to render the evidence supporting the commission ultimate affirmative material injury determination insubstantial on the record.
section c ii provides that in evaluating price effects,the commission shall consider whether 
i there has been significant price underselling by the imported merchandise as compared with the price of domestic like products of the united states,and 
ii the effect of imports of such merchandise otherwise depresses prices to a significant degree or prevents price increases,which otherwise would have occurred,to a significant degree.
the trade court clearly was warranted in concluding that one finding of the commission was unsupported by substantial evidence.however,we agree with the appellants that,with respect to other commission findings,the record contained such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.universal camera,at.quoting consol.edison,at.
the court of international trade rejected the commission price effects evidence because,it stated,japanese underselling and domestic price depression or suppression was insignificant over the period of investigation and certain conditions of competition also minimized any effect subject imports could have had on domestic prices.nippon iv,d at.in particular,the trade court cited a low to moderate ability of the imported tccss to impact domestic sales and prices compartmentalized and segmented price negotiations with domestic and foreign producers,largely due to superior domestic lead times the fact that domestic producers supplied the majority of product and weirton inability to produce documentary evidence of japanese price competition.id.
on the one hand,the trade court correctly rejected evidence of price effects that contained a mathematical miscalculation.in an earlier determination,the commission had provided disaggregated data on purchaser a facilities and product types,frd at in response to remand instructions,nippon ii,d at,the commission aggregated purchaser a data.srd at,however,the calculations were inconsistent.the number of underselling bids decreased,while the volumes associated with underselling the total underselling bid.nippon iv,d at.the court of international trade correctly pointed out that aggregation should not affect the total bid volume and,after noting that the commission had provided no explanation for the change in the total volume,correctly disregarded the evidence.id.however,because the court of international trade approved the other two commission findings relating to compilation of price comparison data,id.at,even setting aside the flawed calculation,the trade court largely accepted the commission methodology.
on the other hand,we can not support the court of international trade rejection of the commission analysis of certain domestic producer accounting data,and thus its conclusion regarding domestic price suppression.the trade court rejected the commission finding that the subject imports caused the suppression of domestic prices,which was based on the commission underlying finding that the domestic industry was suffering from a squeeze the commission evaluated the producers financial data,noting that the domestic industry overall cost of goods sold cogs had increased in relation to net sales,from percent of sales in to percent in and percent in.srd at.the commission attributed this change to a corresponding decline in unit prices at a rate that outstripped the industry unit costs and noted that the industry profitability levels also declined consistently during the relevant period,with operating losses increasing from percent in to percent in to percent in.id.the commission acknowledged that the operating losses decreased to percent in the interim year,but attributed this change to the filing of the antidumping petition in october.id.at.likewise,the commission considered and rejected nippon assertion that members of the domestic industry were able to increase their prices during the period in the face of subject import underselling for certain purchasers,stating that the record data indicates that any such price increases were not sufficient to offset any corresponding changes in the industry cogs.id.at.
the court of international trade agreed that the domestic industry generally may have been experiencing a squeeze,but rejected the commission conclusion based on nippon assertion that the two domestic producers competing most directly with japanese tccss importers reported positive operating margins during the period of investigation.nippon iv,d at.implicit in nippon assertion,and the commission rejection thereof,is the fact that other domestic producers showed negative operating margins.thus,we are faced with a situation where some domestic producers,and the industry as a whole,were in a squeeze,while two major producers were not.substantial evidence exists on both sides of the issue.the commission opted for one inference,and the court of international trade for another.in such a situation,however,the statutory substantial evidence standard compels deference to the commission.
likewise,we can not uphold two of the trade court rejections of commission findings regarding conditions of competition in the domestic industry.first,the trade court rejected the commission finding that and japanese negotiations take place on equal footing.in nippon ii,the court of international trade instructed the commission to evaluate purchaser perceptions with respect to the domestic industry advantage as a potential explanation for keeping negotiations on separate tracks with volume allocated among domestic versus foreign suppliers.nippon ii,d at.in its srd,the commission found that domestic producers lead time advantage was offset by purchasers engaging in negotiations far in advance of production needs and by japanese producers willingness to carry the cost of consignment inventories at storage facilities in the united states.srd at.in support,the commission cited purchaser testimony indicating that purchasers mitigated risks by giving a finite number of specifications to an offshore source,and two purchasers internal memoranda discussing consignment,one of which stated that the purchaser was working through to insure consignment inventories would be in place in an effort to mitigate problems with delivery from foreign sources.id.at.the commission noted that the internal memoranda were consistent with a third purchaser testimony regarding consignment.id.at.
the court of international trade stated that t he fact that purchasers negotiate for advance specifications and for consignment inventories with japanese suppliers but not with domestic suppliers,undercuts the commission finding that and japanese negotiations take place on equal footing.nippon iv,d at.we do not agree that the commission finding was unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole.in any purchasing situation,competing producers are not identical.as the commission explained in its srd,each supplier,regardless of whether it is foreign or domestic,negotiates to maximize premiums based on its unique capabilities.srd at.purchasers attempt to negotiate concessions that will minimize each producer drawbacks,and undertake a analysis in making the optimal purchasing decisions.this individualized assessment of producers may not mean that foreign and domestic producers do not compete for the same piece of business,and may indicate merely that purchasers can not evaluate foreign and domestic producers in an identical way.the commission finding of equal footing was thus plausible given the evidence in the record as a whole.
second,the trade court substituted its own inference regarding the significance of weirton inability to provide contemporaneous documentary evidence of japanese price competition.the weirton representative submitted documentation from the period of investigation that only contained pricing data from other domestic firms.see nippon iv,d at.he testified that he only discovered after the fact that weirton was competing with japanese prices,and thus was not informed by customers that a particular quoted price was from a japanese producer.id.at.in its frd,the commission accorded the absence of contemporaneous documentation little weight,frd at,and reevaluated this finding after the court of international trade criticized its decision in nippon ii.nippon ii,d at.
on remand,the commission again concluded that the absence of contemporaneous documentation deserved little weight.srd at.the commission stated that the record reflects that purchasers do not specify the identity of suppliers with which they are negotiating,making it more difficult for
