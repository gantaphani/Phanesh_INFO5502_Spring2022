petitioner dave arnett was employed by raytheon corporation and stationed in antarctica for the calendar year.when he filed his tax return for that year,he claimed an exclusion for income earned in a foreign country under section for the income he earned while working in antarctica.the internal revenue service irs assessed a deficiency for this exclusion based on its view that antarctica is not a foreign country for purposes of section.arnett challenged that deficiency in the tax court.the tax court sustained the irs position.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the tax court.
background 
the facts of this case are not in dispute.arnett,a resident of hayward,wisconsin,was employed by raytheon support services,which provided support services under contract with the national science foundation at mcmurdo station,ross island,antarctica.when he filed his tax return for income received during tax year,arnett claimed that,by virtue of section,he was entitled to exclude in income received from his work in antarctica.on march,the irs sent arnett a notice of deficiency,stating that he was not permitted to exclude the income that he had received from his work in antarctica because antarctica is not a foreign country within the meaning of section.arnett contested the irs conclusion in the tax court.
in the tax court,the commissioner of internal revenue commissioner moved for summary judgment,contending that,under the treasury regulations then in effect,only territory under the sovereignty of a foreign nation is considered a foreign country for purposes of section.see h.the united states neither makes any claim to sovereignty nor recognizes any other nation claims of sovereignty over antarctica.see antarctic treaty art.iv,smith united states,d.thus,the commissioner submitted,under the applicable treasury regulations antarctica is not a foreign country for purposes of section.relying on chevron,natural resources defense council,d,the tax court deferred to the commissioner interpretation of section,embodied in irs regulations,and held that,for purposes of section,the term foreign country applied only to territory within the sovereignty of a foreign country.the tax court therefore concluded that,because antarctica was not within the sovereign territory of any foreign country,arnett could not exclude income earned for services rendered in antarctica.
discussiona.
in challenging the tax court holding,arnett makes two arguments.first,he submits that the term foreign country is not ambiguous and therefore there is no need for deference to the irs regulation defining the term.in arnett view,the word foreign country unambiguously includes antarctica.secondly,arnett submits that,even if the statute is ambiguous,the language of the regulation does not support the tax court conclusion that antarctica is not a foreign country for purposes of section.we begin our assessment of these contentions by first examining the statute in question and the methodology mandated by the supreme court cases for resolving the issues before us.
under section,qualified individuals may exclude,within statutory limits foreign earned income from their gross income.a,b d.foreign earned income is defined in the statute as amounts received from sources within a foreign country for services performed by the taxpayer.id.b a.the internal revenue code irc does not define foreign country.the commissioner,therefore,has issued regulations to define this term.these regulations were promulgated under a specific grant of statutory authority to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of section,id.d,and under the irc general grant of authority to prescribe rules to enforce the provisions of the irc,id.a.see.july.these regulations define foreign country to include territory under the sovereignty of a foreign nation.see h.the tax court accorded this definition chevron deference and concluded that antarctica did not fall within the definition of a foreign country because the united states does not recognize antarctica to be the sovereign territory of any foreign government.
under the chevron doctrine,we examine an agency construction of a statute that it administers under a analysis that mirrors arnett arguments.we first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,and second,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,whether the agency construction is permissible.chevron,at.emphasis added.when the statute grants the agency an express delegation of authority to elucidate a specific provision of a statute by regulation,the agency construction of the statute is permissible,and the regulation will be controlling,unless the regulation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.see also united states mead,d.when the statute does not delegate rulemaking authority explicitly,we shall consider statutory ambiguities to be implicit delegations to the agency administering the statute to interpret the statute through its rulemaking authority.see mead,at.chevron,at.such interpretation will be permissible,and we shall defer to it,so long as the interpretation is a reasonable construction of the statute.chevron,at.
we must first determine whether the term foreign country is unambiguous.the term has been defined in other contexts by the supreme court.in smith united states,d,the court had to determine whether antarctica was a foreign country for purposes of the federal tort claims act ftca,b,b,b.that statute states that the united states waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply to a ny claim arising in a foreign country.k see also smith,at.in its examination of the issue,the court explicitly noted that the dictionary definition of country which it noted,a region or tract of land,was not the only possible interpretation of the term.id.quoting webster new international dictionary ed internal quotation marks omitted.then,in order to arrive at a definition of country for purposes of the ftca,the court examined the rest of the ftca.id.
first,the court noted that the ftca provisions operated both as a waiver of sovereign immunity and as a choice of law provision.id.the court reasoned that,if antarctica were not a foreign country under the statute,the ftca would waive the united states sovereign immunity in antarctica and,at the same time,direct the district courts to look to the law of a place that has no law in order to determine the liability of the united states,a result the court found bizarre.id.at.additionally,the ftca venue provisions would result in a waiver of sovereign immunity but provide no venue when a person injured in antarctica did not reside in the united states.id.at.the court found that this result was incompatible with the presumption that congress does not in general intend to create venue gaps.id.at.quoting brunette mach.works,kockum,d internal quotation marks omitted.the court also noted that,because the ftca is a limited waiver of sovereign immunity,the court should not extend the waiver beyond that which congress intended.id.at.quoting united states kubrick,d internal quotation marks omitted.lastly,the court found important the presumption against extraterritorial application of statutes.id.at.
in short,in order to give meaning to the term foreign country in the ftca,the supreme court focused in smith on the purpose and operation of the ftca.the court resort to the statute context in order to give meaning to the term undercuts arnett claim that the term foreign country unambiguously includes antarctica smith demonstrates that the term foreign country has meaning only when that term is interpreted in the particular statutory context in which it appears.
the conclusion that the term foreign country is inherently ambiguous is certainly validated by an examination of the text of section.here,the appropriate meaning of the term is even more difficult to discern from the statutory context.indeed,the text of section provides no indication of the proper definition of foreign country or whether antarctica should be considered a foreign country.
because we conclude that the term fore
