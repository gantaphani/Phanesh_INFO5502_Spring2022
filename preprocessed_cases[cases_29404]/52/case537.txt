although individuals playing the lottery rarely strike it rich,those selling lottery tickets apparently do quite well.take the case of seven affiliated canadian corporations,two united states corporations,and their six corresponding principal officers,who made millions selling chances to play in the canadian lottery.their enterprise came to a halt,however,after the federal trade commission ftc initiated an action for injunctive and other relief pursuant to sections b and of the federal trade commission act ftc act,b and,the telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act telemarketing act,and the ftc telemarketing sales rule tsr.the ftc alleged that the defendants had engaged in deceptive trade practices by,among other things,failing to notify consumers that it is illegal to buy and sell foreign lottery tickets.the district court entered a permanent injunction against five of the canadian corporations and ordered them to pay million in consumer redress.the court also entered judgment holding two of the corporate officers,george yemec and anita rapp,jointly and severally liable.the defendants appeal,arguing primarily that the district court erred by holding yemec and rapp liable for the corporations allegedly deceptive practices.
in the ftc began investigating a canadian telemarketing enterprise selling chances to play the canadian lottery.the enterprise involved the following string of interrelated corporations world media brokers,ontario ontario,canadian catalogue,canadian catalogue services,ccs,and interwin marketing faby games,ontario,canadian catalogue services,and ccs ontario limited,express sales,express marketing services,ems,and first telegroup marketing ontario limited,express marketing services and ems ontario,canadian express club express marketing services,ems cash and prizes,and intermarketing services.it is difficult if not impossible to separate the actions of the various corporations,which we refer to collectively as the corporate defendants.
the corporate defendants began operations in the late.at that time,george yemec,former publisher of whole world lottery guide and millions magazine,started several companies that bought groups of lottery tickets and resold them to and canadian consumers.anita rapp served as a corporate officer for several of the corporate defendants and also handled various financial matters for them.
the various corporate defendants operated by purchasing lists of names that telemarketers then used to call individuals and offer them chances to play the canadian lottery.there were multiple variations on the offers extended.the most common offers involved opportunities to buy packages or groupings of tickets in two of canada largest lotteries,lotto and lotto super.telemarketers promised buyers that playing by mail in a small group is the best way to play the canadian government guaranteed lottery.the options to play included packages with combinations of individual and group tickets that could be purchased for anywhere from up to.other possibilities included a subscription to play lotto and lotto super available for a set fee plus an additional service fee,or a stake in the lotteries comprised of a combination of seven individual tickets,group tickets,one share in the group,and a draw from what was called the cash prizes program.others were given a chance to take advantage of a special introductory offer to join the jackpot alert service,a number where callers entered a pin number and paid a minute to get lottery information.
the ftc investigated the corporate defendants operations for several years.during its investigation,the ftc gathered declarations from individuals who had participated in the lotteries and also procured of telemarketers calls.relying on this evidence,in the ftc filed actions in ontario,canada the canadian proceeding and the northern district of illinois.in the canadian proceeding the ftc obtained two ex parte orders an injunction authorizing it to freeze certain corporate assets,and an order allowing it to search the corporate defendants premises 
several months later,in october,the ftc filed its complaint in district court,alleging that the corporate defendants and six individual corporate officers violated section a of the ftc act,a,which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,and two provisions of the a ii requiring telemarketers to disclose material limitations on any goods or services offered and a forbidding telemarketers from making false or misleading statements to induce purchase of goods or services.specifically,the ftc alleged that the defendants had misled consumers by representing,among other things,that it was legal for citizens to play the canadian lottery.in november the district court entered a stipulated order for a preliminary injunction and an asset freeze against both the individual and corporate defendants.
in august,the ftc moved for partial summary judgment against yemec,rapp,and five of the canadian corporate defendants.in march,the district court granted the ftc motion.the court concluded that it was undisputed that the canadian corporate defendants used telemarketers to call consumers in the united states and sell group and individual tickets in the canadian lottery.in these calls,telemarketers failed to inform consumers that selling canadian lottery tickets to citizens is illegal.see making it a crime to transmit a ticket or interest in a lottery in foreign commerce making it a crime to mail any lottery ticket or instrument representing a ticket or interest in a lottery making it a crime to send in foreign commerce any instrument designed for use in a numbers,policy,or bolita game.in fact,when consumers questioned the legality of buying tickets in the canadian lottery,the telemarketers were trained to assure them that it was legal.thus,concluded the court,the corporate defendants had engaged in deceptive practices forbidden by a,namely by misleading reasonable consumers into believing that it was legal for them to purchase tickets or interests in the canadian lottery.
likewise,the corporate defendants had violated a ii of the tsr by failing to conspicuously or at all,for that matter disclose that selling foreign lottery tickets is illegal.the district court found that the canadian corporate defendants had also violated a of the tsr by falsely assuring consumers of the legality of their purchases.finally,the district court concluded that yemec and rapp were individually liable for the corporate defendants deceptive practices because they had authority to control the corporations and knew or should have known that it was illegal to sell canadian lottery tickets to citizens.
in june,the district court entered final judgment against yemec,rapp,and the five canadian corporate defendants the judgment permanently enjoined yemec,rapp,and the corporate defendants from engaging in any telemarketing in the united states and from selling lottery tickets to residents.the court also ordered yemec,rapp,and the corporate defendants to pay million in consumer redress.see b giving court jurisdiction to authorize necessary relief,including consumer redress b granting ftc authority to seek the same penalties for violations of the telemarketing act as for violations of the ftc act.finally,the order enjoined the defendants from selling or disclosing customer lists and required them to provide existing customer lists to the ftc.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,celotex catrett,d,construing all facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party,anderson liberty lobby,d.although all five canadian corporate defendants appealed,none of the arguments on appeal relate to the corporate defendants liability.instead,the defendants argue only that the district court erred by granting summary judgment against yemec and rapp and holding them jointly and severally liable for the million in consumer redress.
to hold an individual liable for a corporation deceptive practices,the ftc must first prove an underlying corporate violation of section of the ftc act.see ftc amy travel,cir see also ftc freecom
