appellants oladele raji and frank martins appeal the district court order declining to compel the disclosure of certain sensitive law enforcement documents possessed by the united states,including grand jury materials,work product,and wiretap information,all of which appellants contend are relevant to their defense of a criminal prosecution in england.the united states agreed to produce certain records related to appellants prosecution,but refused to produce others.the district court found that the undisclosed documents are privileged or protected by statute,and that appellants had failed to demonstrate a compelling need for them.because the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to order further disclosure of these documents,we affirm.
the background to this appeal is relatively straightforward.appellants are currently awaiting trial in england on criminal charges related to an alleged credit card fraud scheme the indictment in that case alleges that appellants participated in a conspiracy whose members used,in the united kingdom,american express credit card numbers that they had obtained from american.the american were tried in a separate proceeding before a federal district court in the southern district of florida following an investigation by the united states government the ojomo prosecution 
in january,appellants and a third defendant in the english proceeding,olumbummi woods,applied to judge elwen of the crown judge presiding over the criminal the issuance of a letter rogatory seeking the disclosure of various materials related to the ojomo prosecution.judge elwen granted the request,and accordingly issued two letters rogatory on behalf of the appellants,dated february,and february,respectively.the letters asked the united states district court for the southern district of florida to assist the three english criminal defendants by ordering agents of the united states government government and american express to produce various materials gathered during and generated by the investigation giving rise to the ojomo prosecution.
appellants then moved in the southern district of florida for discovery and inspection of the materials identified in the letters rogatory.in response,the government agreed to produce voluntarily some of the requested materials,including grand jury and wiretap information.on july,the district court memorialized these voluntary disclosures in an order which lifted secrecy protections applicable to the wiretap and grand jury materials and thereby permitted the government to disclose them.in addition,the district court authorized appellants to take the deposition of joan ojomo,in connection with which the government gave the british crown prosecution service cps access to additional materials from the ojomo investigation.
meanwhile,on or about august,the cps,apparently pursuant to its discovery obligations under english law,served appellants with a disclosure schedule prepared by the cps and a british police constable after a visit to the offices of the secret service in miami that schedule inventoried several hundred files and boxes of unused investigative materials related to the ojomo prosecution still in the possession of the united states.the listed materials are generally of three types grand jury materials,work product including written summaries and memoranda of the local attorney office and the secret service,and records of intercepted conversations obtained during the ojomo investigation.it is these materials,not the items covered by the earlier requests,which are the subject of this appeal.
upon receipt of the cps schedule,appellants asked the district court to permit additional discovery.in an order dated october,the district court explained that it stood ready to respond to any request issued by its sister court in britain,but would only consider granting relief if judge elwen first issued such a request after determining that the interests of justice would be served by additional discovery in the united states.
appellants then moved in the english court for additional discovery.judge elwen determined that the very fact that the items were listed on the cps disclosure schedule meant that these items satisfied the threshold test of relevance or possible relevance and therefore were discoverable under english law.accordingly,on october,judge elwen ruled that appellants were entitled to discovery of the items.in so doing,however,judge elwen emphasized that this ruling was subject to any claim as to privilege,immunity,or otherwise as may be asserted by those with possession of the documents and upheld by the appropriate american judicial authority emphasis added.
citing this ruling and the february letters rogatory,appellants,on october,filed a second motion with the district court,seeking an order compelling disclosure of the items.the district court referred the matter to a united states magistrate judge.the magistrate judge conducted a hearing on the matter,during which the magistrate judge and the parties considered in detail each of the several hundred items on the disclosure schedule.the government agreed to disclose voluntarily certain of the requested materials,including wiretap applications,supporting affidavits,court orders authorizing wiretaps,and secret service interviews of persons arrested in the ojomo prosecution.the government did not,however,agree to produce all of the requested items.the assistant united states attorney responsible for the matter repeated an earlier representation that the government investigation and the requested materials did not relate to,mention,or incriminate the appellants.
on october,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation.in her report the magistrate judge ordered american express to disclose certain account information relating to the ojomo investigation,excluding work product and personal,customer,or proprietary information,and also recommended that the district court approve the government voluntary disclosures.otherwise,however,the magistrate judge recommended against disclosure of the items on the disclosure schedule.she concluded that the grand jury and work product materials were privileged,implicitly finding as well that appellants had not shown a sufficient basis to overcome the privilege.as for the records of intercepted conversations,she concluded that the federal wiretap statute,et,barred their disclosure,and that moreover appellants had not shown a compelling need for them.
appellants filed a timely objection to the report and recommendation.on november,the district court affirmed the report and adopted its recommendations.the district court issued an amended order to the same effect on december,after considering appellants objections a second time.this appeal followed.
as an initial matter,it is essential to clarify the laws or treaties by which appellants may assert their entitlement to the materials in dispute.appellants identify three sources for their entitlement to these materials the treaty between the government of the united states of america and the government of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters,treaty doc.mlat and the hague convention on the taking of evidence abroad in civil and commercial matters.the united states agrees that provides authority for the potential disclosure of the materials it disputes,however,that the mlat and the hague convention are implicated by this case.we agree.
the mlat in relevant part authorizes united states courts to give effect to certain requests made by the united kingdom for information relevant to criminal investigations or prosecutions.see mlat.the mlat with the united kingdom is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance treaties negotiated by the united states in order to counter criminal activities more effectively.the mlat provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters,including the taking of testimony or statements of witnesses the provision of documents,records,and evidence the service of legal documents the location or identification of persons the execution of requests for searches and seizures and the provision of assistance in proceedings relating to the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime and the collection of fines imposed as a sentence in a criminal prosecution.see letter of transmittal from the president of the united states to the senate.the mlat is a treaty,and was in effect at the time this proceeding commenced.
a key feature of the mlat is the requirement that a request for assistance be made,not directly to the courts,but rather between the central authorities,which the treaty defines as the secretary of state of the home department for the united kingdom,and the attorney general for the united states,or their designees.mlat.there is no provision for private parties,such as individual criminal defendants in the english or american courts,to request the production of information.see mlat,the provisions of this treaty shall not give rise to a right on the part of any private person to obtain,suppress,or exclude any evidence.moreover,the request itself must comply with various requirements.specifically,it must include a the name of the authority conducting the proceedings to which the request relates b the subject matter and nature of the proceedings for the purposes of which the request is made c a summary of the information giving rise to the request d a description of the evidence or information or other assistance sought and e the purpose for which the evidence or information or other assistance is sought,see also,listing additional items to be included t o the extent necessary and possible.
we need not consider appellants arguments under the mlat,because no valid mlat request was ever made for the specific materials at issue in this appeal appellants refer to a document sent by the cps to the district court on or about october,entitled response by crown prosecution service to the defense application for disclosure of unused material in the united states of america,and suggest that it constituted a mlat request.that document,however,did not conform to the requirements of the mlat,and thus can not be viewed as a proper mlat request.the document was not transmitted between central authorities or their designees,but rather was sent by the cps directly to the district court.appellants suggest that the october letter should be viewed as a supplement to the prior requests,which they contend were transmitted in conformity with the mlat.but there is simply no dispute that the original communications did not discuss,let alone request,the specific material referenced by the october letter the material underlying the october letter was far more expansive and entirely different in scope.the letter can not be viewed as a valid mlat request solely because a proper mlat request had been made earlier for other records relating generally to the same subject matter 
appellants alternative suggestion that the hague convention provides a source for the disclosure of this information fares no better.the convention permits signatory nations such as the united states and the united kingdom to respond to a request from another signatory for evidence related to civil and commercial matters.see note see also,in civil or commercial matters a judicial authority of a contracting state may,in accordance with the provisions of the law of that state,request the competent authority of another contracting state,by means of a letter of request,to obtain evidence,or to perform some other judicial act.the convention plainly does not apply to this proceeding.the materials at issue here are sought for use in a criminal proceeding the convention,by contrast,by its terms applies only to civil and commercial matters.see in re letter of request from the amtsgericht ingolstadt,federal republic of germany,cir t he convention on the taking of evidence abroad in civil and commercial matters,as its title verifies,applies only to civil and commercial cases.
appellants contend that because this request involves discovery it should be deemed a civil matter.but that argument,in addition to being wholly unsupported,would contradict the plain meaning of the text of the convention by making the convention potentially applicable in all disputes,not merely civil or commercial cases.appellants also contend that because the underlying criminal case involves commercial transactions,the convention should be triggered.but that argument suffers from the very same defects it is unsupported,and would rewrite the text of the convention.in any event,even if we were to hold that the convention could be applied in connection with a criminal proceeding,the cps october letter plainly did not comply with the convention requirements for a letter of request.see note,
in short,it is,and alone,that provides a potential basis for disclosing to appellants the information now at issue.
under,district courts have the power to provide assistance to foreign courts by responding to letters rogatory and other requests from interested parties such as appellants here.the statute provides in pertinent part 
the district court of the district in which a person resides or is found may order him to give his testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal,including criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation.the order may be made pursuant to a letter rogatory issued,or request made,by a foreign or international tribunal or upon the application of any interested person and may direct that the testimony or statement be given,or the document or other thing be produced,before a person appointed by the court the order may prescribe the practice and procedure,which may be in whole or part the practice and procedure of the foreign country or the international tribunal,for taking the testimony or statement or producing the document or other thing.to the extent that the order does not prescribe otherwise,the testimony or statement shall be taken,and the document or other thing produced,in accordance with the federal rules of civil procedure.
a.the last sentence of the statute contains an important caveat,by explaining that a person may not be compelled to give his testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing in violation of any legally applicable privilege.id.
whether,and to what extent,to honor a request for assistance pursuant to has been committed by congress to the sound discretion of the district court.see,lo ka chun lo to,cir in re request for assistance from ministry of legal affairs of trinidad and tobago,cir,sess,reprinted at,explaining that section leaves the issuance of an appropriate order to the discretion of the court which,in proper cases,may refuse to issue an order or may impose conditions it deems desirable.two important points flow from this fact.first,a district court compliance with a request is not mandatory contrary to appellants repeated suggestions,the district court was not obliged to grant their application simply by virtue of the english court order or for any other reason.second,our review of the district court decision in this case is extremely limited and highly deferential.because congress has given the district courts such broad discretion in granting judicial assistance to foreign countries,this court may overturn the district court decision only for abuse of discretion.lo ka chun,at accord,trinidad and tobago,at this deferential standard is identical to that used in reviewing the district court ordinary discovery rulings,such as rulings as to whether the foundation for a claim of privilege has been established.see harris chapman,cir district judges are accorded wide discretion in ruling upon discovery motions,and appellate review is accordingly deferential.cox administrator united states steel carnegie,cir discovery orders should not be overturned unless the district court has abused its discretion and such abuse has resulted in substantial harm to the party seeking relief.citation omitted see also euromepa esmerian,cir stressing that if the district court determines that a party discovery application under section is made in bad faith,for the purpose of harassment,or unreasonably seeks cumulative or irrelevant materials,the court is free to deny the application in toto,just as it can if discovery was sought in bad faith in domestic litigation.
appellants contend that the district court abused its discretion in declining to order production of items that the government refused to produce voluntarily.appellants challenge particular aspects of the district court reasoning with respect to the grand jury,work product,and wiretap materials in question.more broadly,they contend that the magistrate judge whose report was adopted by the district court ignored judge elwen finding regarding the relevance of these materials to the defense of the english prosecution.
turning first to the broadest objection,we find no reversible error in the magistrate approach to the issue of relevance.in deciding whether to respond to a request under,the district court must decide whether the evidence would be discoverable in the foreign country before granting assistance.trinidad and tobago,at see also euromepa,at noting that inquiry into the discoverability of requested materials should consider only authoritative proof that a foreign tribunal would reject evidence obtained with the aid of section.here,the english court determined that,as a matter of english law,the items listed on the cps disclosure schedule were relevant or possibly relevant to appellants defense and thus were discoverable.the magistrate judge demonstrated proper respect for that finding,and did not expressly reject appellants request because they failed to show relevance.
the magistrate judge did,at certain junctures in her opinion,question the sufficiency of appellants showing of a powerful need for some of these materials she did so,however,not in the context of discussing relevance,but rather in the analytically distinct context of determining whether the government claims of privilege and statutory immunity should be sustained.moreover,although the relevance of a piece of evidence to the subject matter of the case is obviously a consideration in evaluating a party need for that evidence,it is by no means the only consideration.it is often the case that a piece of evidence may be relevant as that concept is defined under applicable law without being so vital or unique that powerful competing interests such as those embodied in a privilege must give way.indeed,judge elwen expressly recognized this fact by qualifying the ruling as to discoverability and making it subject to any claim as to privilege,immunity,or otherwise as may be asserted by those with possession of the documents and upheld by the appropriate american judicial authority.as this language underscores,judge elwen made no attempt to rule that the appellants had demonstrated sufficient particularized need for the materials to overcome a claim of privilege or statutory immunity indeed,judge elwen made no express finding at all regarding appellants relative need for these materials,and simply held that appellants met the threshold test for discoverability under english law subject to any satisfactory claims of privilege.
accordingly,the district judge did not err by failing to equate judge elwen finding of relevance or possible relevance with a finding that the appellants need for these materials is powerful enough to overcome the privileges and immunities that otherwise attach to these items 
we turn,then,to the particular claims of privilege upheld by the magistrate judge.we see no reversible error in the district court implicit finding that appellants failed to establish the particularized need required for disclosure of secret grand jury materials.with limited exceptions not applicable here,the disclosure of grand jury materials must first be authorized by the court.see.e.in light of the benefits of maintaining the secrecy of grand jury proceedings,disclosure is appropriate only in those cases where the need for it outweighs the public interest in secrecy,the burden of demonstrating this balance rests upon the private party seeking disclosure.douglas oil petrol stops northwest,d.the supreme court has repeatedly stressed the wide discretion given district courts in evaluating whether disclosure of grand jury materials would be appropriate.see,united states john doe.i,d.
under this court precedent,in order to obtain disclosure of protected grand jury materials,a person must show a particularized need for them.united states cole,cir citing united states tucker,cir.parties seeking grand jury materials must show that the material they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding,that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy,and that their request is structured to cover only the material so needed.douglas oil,at.see also id.at.holding that the requesting party must demonstrate that without the requested materials a defense would be greatly prejudiced or an injustice would be done.
appellants contend that the magistrate judge should have ordered disclosure of the grand jury materials over the government objection.they do so in part based on the mistaken premise,discussed above,that the english court finding of relevance or possible relevance under english law suffices as a determination of particularized need under american law regulating the disclosure of grand jury material.they also assert that there is sufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate the exculpatory nature of the materials sought and thereby to show a particularized need for those materials.but appellants blanket request for all of the unused grand jury materials from the ojomo prosecution can not be described as the kind of particularized request required for the production of otherwise secret information.moreover,the breadth of appellants request,while understandable to some extent given their lack of access to the materials,makes it virtually impossible for them to demonstrate that each of hundreds of grand jury items is likely to be exculpatory in the ways they suggest,especially given the representation by the government attorney on the record that these items do not mention,let alone exculpate,the appellants 
finally,appellants arguments as to need are presented at the very highest order of abstraction the fact that these items are being sought by defendants in a criminal case for use in defending the charges brought against them is insufficient standing alone.see cole,at see also united states rockwell int l,cir discussing particularized need requirement and stressing that n o grand jury testimony is to be released for the purpose of a fishing expedition or to satisfy an unsupported hope of revelation of useful information.the district court did not abuse its broad discretion in declining to grant appellants request for secret grand jury material.
similarly,the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to order the production of the government confidential work product.the doctrine reflects the strong public policy underlying the orderly prosecution and defense of legal claims.hickman taylor.the privilege applies in criminal matters as it does in civil cases.see,united states nobles,d although the doctrine most frequently is asserted as a bar to discovery in civil litigation,its role in assuring the proper functioning of the criminal justice system is even more vital.the interests of society and the accused in obtaining a fair and accurate resolution of the question of guilt or innocence demand that adequate safeguards assure the thorough preparation and presentation of each side of the case.specifically,rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure does not permit the discovery or inspection of reports,memoranda,or other internal government documents made by the attorney for the government or any other government agent investigating or prosecuting the case.a.
although we have never addressed the precise contours of rule a,courts have generally explained in civil matters that to overcome the work product privilege a person must show both a substantial need for the information and that seeking the information throug
