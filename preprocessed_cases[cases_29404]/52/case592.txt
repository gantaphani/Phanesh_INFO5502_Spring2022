barapind sought relief from extradition pursuant to the united nations convention against torture and other forms of cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the convention by submitting an application to the united states department of state the department.barapind argued before the department that under the convention,as implemented by the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of farra,the united states would violate b if it extradited barapind to india because he would more likely than not be tortured there,that diplomatic assurances would be insufficient to guarantee that he would not be tortured,and that he would be denied a fair trial in india.thereafter,the department and the indian government exchanged a series of diplomatic notes and,in those notes the understanding,the indian government stated that barapind would not be tortured.
the substance of the understanding is found in internal department memoranda.in response to a january,request by the united states for india to assess the merit of barapind torture claim due to the united states obligations under the convention and,the indian government,through its ministry of external affairs,provided the following response on february,

following these assurances,in june the department surrendered barapind to the indian government.after standing trial on the three criminal charges,in may,barapind was acquitted on all three charges.barapind alleges that eventually he resumed his religious and political activities in india.on september,indian police forces arrested barapind and allegedly subjected him to acts of torture from september.

discussion 
barapind argues that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over his claim because the indian government,through its reference in the understanding to the convention and its diplomatic assurances not to torture barapind,implicitly waived its sovereign immunity.barapind contends that this interpretation is appropriate because india has only signed,but not ratified,the convention and,therefore,the reference to the convention is a reference to law of the united states.we disagree.
the fsia is the sole basis upon which jurisdiction may be obtained over a foreign state.argentine republic amerada hess shipping.thus,if a foreign state is immune from suit,jurisdiction is lacking.see id.foreign states,including their political subdivisions,agencies,and instrumentalities,
