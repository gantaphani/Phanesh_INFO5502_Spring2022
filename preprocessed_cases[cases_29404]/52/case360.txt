almaz nezirovic,a citizen of bosnia and herzegovina,entered the united states as a refugee in in the wake of the war in the former country of yugoslavia.in,bosnia and herzegovina requested nezirovic extradition based on war crimes he allegedly committed during the conflict.a magistrate judge in the western district of virginia issued a certification of extraditability,finding that nezirovic was subject to extradition under a treaty between the united states and bosnia and herzegovina.
nezirovic filed a petition in the district court for habeas corpus relief under to challenge the magistrate judge certification.the district court denied nezirovic petition.nezirovic now appeals,arguing that his extradition is barred under the applicable statute of limitations,and by the exemption provided in the treaty for political offenses.upon our review,we affirm the district court judgment.
in the early,the former socialist federal republic of yugoslavia yugoslavia collapsed,leading to a state of war between the country ethnic groups.one of the constituent republics of yugoslavia was the socialist republic of bosnia and herzegovina.between april and december,nezirovic served as a member of the croatian defense council hvo,abbreviated from its croatian name,a paramilitary group that deemed itself the supreme defense body of the croat people in herzeg bosnia.nezirovic testified that he joined the hvo to protect himself and his family during the conflict after serbian troops attacked nezirovic hometown.as a member of the hvo,nezirovic was stationed as a guard at the rabic internment camp in bosnia and herzegovina,which held in confinement persons of serbian descent.
in january,the doboj police department of bosnia issued a criminal report against nezirovic,accusing him of committing war crimes against civilians while a guard at the rabic camp.according to bosnian authorities,nezirovic engaged in the individual and group torture and inhuman treatment of civilians of serb nationality detained at the camp,causing great physical and emotional suffering and serious injuries.bosnian authorities alleged that 
nezirovic personally beat prisoners using his arms and legs,his rifle,batons or sticks,and other objects.the treatment included threats of death,and the detained serbian civilians were forced to endure starvation and other severe adverse health conditions.nezirovic further exposed these serbian civilians to great humiliation by forcing them to remove their clothing and to crawl on the ground,putting their noses in others anuses,and to eat grass on which others had urinated.nezirovic also forced serbian civilians to expose three specific fingers ones the prisoners,in the orthodox tradition prevailing in the serb community,would use for praying on a table and he would then strike their fingers and the rest of their bodies using a rubber baton or stick.
a judge in bosnia and herzegovina issued a warrant for nezirovic arrest in,six years after nezirovic entered the united states.in,bosnian authorities made a request to the united states department of state for nezirovic arrest and extradition pursuant to the treaty between the united states and for the mutual extradition of fugitives from justice,u,stat.treaty the extradition request was accompanied by the statements of witnesses,who claimed that nezirovic committed acts of torture.
after determining that the extradition request was governed by a treaty,the department of state referred the request to the department of justice,which represents foreign governments in extradition proceedings conducted in united states courts.see generally gon holt,cir.based on nezirovic place of residence in roanoke,virginia,the united states attorney for the western district of virginia filed an extradition complaint for review by a magistrate judge in that district.see id.after an evidentiary hearing,the magistrate judge concluded that nezirovic was subject to extradition under the treaty and entered a certification of extraditability.the district court later denied nezirovic habeas corpus petition.this appeal followed.
a magistrate judge conducting extradition proceedings is required to evaluate whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain the charge under the terms of the treaty.the limited purpose of an extradition hearing is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that there has been a violation of the laws of the foreign country requesting extradition,whether such conduct would have been criminal if committed in the united states,and whether the fugitive is the person sought by the foreign country for violating its laws.gon,at citation omitted.
if the magistrate judge determines that these requirements have been met and that the applicable treaty does not otherwise bar extradition,the magistrate judge issues to the secretary of state of the united states a certification of extraditability.gon,at mironescu costner,cir.an individual who is the subject of such a certification may challenge the magistrate judge finding only by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.ordinola hackman,cir.
habeas corpus is available only to inquire whether the magistrate judge had jurisdiction,whether the offense charged is within the treaty and whether there was any evidence warranting the finding that there was reasonable ground to believe the accused guilty of the asserted crimes.id.quoting fernandez phillips,internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.the secretary of state makes the final determination whether to extradite the fugitive to the requesting country,considering factors affecting both the individual defendant as well as foreign that may be beyond the scope of the judge review.mironescu,at internal quotation marks,alterations,and citation omitted gon,at.
the united states and serbia ratified the treaty at issue in this case in the parties to the treaty agreed to the extradition of persons who have been charged with or convicted of specified crimes in either country,upon such evidence of criminality as,according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found,would justify his or her apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime or offense had been committed there.treaty art.although not initially listed in the treaty as an offense for which extradition was available,the offense of torture became an extraditable crime when the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat was incorporated into the treaty in.
in the present case,nezirovic does not dispute that he is the person sought by bosnian authorities for violation of certain laws of bosnia and herzegovina,and that the conduct alleged by the bosnian authorities would have been criminal if committed in the united states.see gon,at.nor does nezirovic dispute that,subject to the treaty exceptions he argues here,the statements of the witnesses are sufficient to establish probable cause to support a finding that there have been violations of the laws of bosnia and herzegovina.see id.instead,nezirovic alleges that two provisions in the treaty prevent his extradition for the alleged offenses.
the first treaty provision on which nezirovic relies prohibits extradition for offenses that are in the surrendering country.article vii of the treaty provides that 
e xtradition shall not be granted,in pursuance of the provisions of this treaty,if legal proceedings or the enforcement of the penalty for the act committed by the person claimed has become barred by limitation,according to the laws of the country to which the requisition is addressed.
the second provision of the treaty cited by nezirovic exempts from extradition political offenses.article vi of the treaty states that 
a fugitive criminal shall not be surrendered if the offense in respect of which his surrender is demanded be of a political character,or if he proves that the requisition for his surrender has,in fact,been made with a view to try or punish him for an offense of a political character.
we address in turn nezirovic challenges under these articles of the treaty.
we first consider nezirovic claim that his extradition is barred by the statute of limitations applicable to his charged offenses.he contends that the magistrate judge and the district court erred in applying the indefinite limitations period in the united states torture act the torture act or the act.he asserts that although the torture act is the united states statute most analogous to his alleged bosnian crimes,application of the act statute of limitations would violate ex post facto principles because the act became effective two years after his alleged conduct occurred.nezirovic urges us instead to use the statute of limitations applicable to the crime of assault under.see establishing general statute of limitations for offenses.we disagree with nezirovic arguments.
we apply the statute of limitations applicable to the substantive offense under united states law that is most closely analogous to the charged offenses.sainez venables,cir.because nezirovic is charged under the laws of bosnia and herzegovina with war crimes against civilians,including torture and inhuman treatment,the torture act,which criminalizes acts of torture and attempted torture,is the united states statute most closely analogous to the charged offenses there is no statute of limitations under the torture act when,as here,the acts of torture resulted in,or created a forseeable sic risk of,death or serious bodily injury to another person.b g b i.
to determine whether nezirovic is subject to extradition,we look to the law in place at the time the extradition request was made,not the law in effect when nezirovic allegedly committed the offenses.see united states ex rel.oppenheim hecht,cir hilario united states.therefore,the treaty may be applied retroactively in this case to render nezirovic extraditable for earlier conduct see hecht,at see also galanis pallanck,cir noting the rule that extradition treaties,unless they contain a clause to the contrary,cover offenses committed prior to their conclusion citations and internal quotation marks omitted.applying the same reasoning,the united states,as the surrendering state,may lengthen retroactively the statute of limitations applicable to extraditable conduct.in re extradition of mcmullen,cir en banc concluding that a supplementary treaty did not violate the prohibition against bills of attainder when the treaty narrowed the definition of the political offense exception to extradition,causing a fugitive who was previously protected by the exception to be eligible for extradition.
ex post facto principles do not affect this rule to bar the retroactive application of the torture act statute of limitations.the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution prohibits laws that retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.united states.farrow,cir quoting collins youngblood.however,this constitutional protection has no relation to crimes committed without the jurisdiction of the united states against the laws of a foreign country,as in the case of a fugitive facing extradition for crimes committed outside the united states.neely henkel,see also snider seung lee,cir t he supreme court has made clear that constitutional protections do not extend to foreign prosecutions.
our conclusion is not altered by nezirovic contention that the terms of the present treaty contain additional ex post facto guarantees that otherwise would not be available.we construe extradition treaties liberally in favor of surrendering a fugitive to the requesting country,in the interest of justice and friendly international relationships.factor laubenheimer,in re extradition of handanović,d,citing factor,at.nezirovic fails to identify any specific language in the treaty granting any ex post facto protections to fugitives.and we observe that article vii of the treaty is silent regarding whether the surrendering country statute of limitations should be applied based on the date of the alleged crime or on the date of the extradition request 
under these circumstances,we apply the indefinite limitations period from the torture act that was in place at the time of the extradition request.we therefore conclude that the request for nezirovic extradition is not under article vii of the treaty.
nezirovic next argues that he is not subject to extradition because the allegations against him constitute political offenses exempt from extradition under the terms of the treaty.he contends that the magistrate judge and the district court erred in reaching a contrary conclusion,because his alleged offenses,when viewed objectively,were political in nature,and because his subjective intent manifested his political motivations.we disagree with nezirovic arguments and conclude that the political offense exception does not preclude his extradition under the treaty.
the political offense exception of the treaty prohibits the extradition of a person accused of offenses that are political in nature.ordinola,at.in addition to pure political offenses,such as treason and espionage,the exception also protects from extradition persons charged with relative political offenses,which are common crimes so intertwined with a political act that the offense itself becomes a political one.id.at.
to qualify for the exception as a relative political offense,the alleged conduct must have been incidental to or in furtherance of a violent political uprising that was occurring in the requesting country at the time of the alleged offenses,or incidental to quelling such an uprising id.at.we apply a test to determine whether a fugitive actions were incidental to a political disturbance.we consider whether the fugitive subjectively was politically motivated to commit the offenses,and whether the offenses,when viewed objectively,were political in nature.id.at.
the issue whether a person is charged with commission of a political offense presents a mixed question of law and fact,but primarily is a question of fact.id.at.we accord significant deference to the factual findings of the magistrate judge,and will reverse the judge determination regarding whether a political offense has been established only if the determination is palpably erroneous in law and a reasonable factfinder would have had no choice but to conclude that the offender was acting in furtherance of a political uprising.id.quoting ornelas.ruiz,internal quotation marks omitted.
the magistrate judge concluded that nezirovic alleged conduct was not subjectively motivated by a political aim,and that the offenses were not political in nature when viewed objectively.in conducting our review,we need not decide whether nezirovic has satisfied the subjective prong of the test,because we conclude that he can not demonstrate that his offenses were political in nature when viewed objectively.see ordinola,at assuming without deciding that a fugitive actions were motivated by subjective political considerations,and concluding that the offenses were not political when viewed objectively.
we require that a fugitive make an objective showing that the charged offenses are political in nature,because extradition treaties do not protect acts simply because a fugitive can proffer a subjective political rationale for having committed them.id.at.accordingly,in applying the objective prong of the test,we look to the totality of the circumstances,focusing on such particulars as the mode of the attack and the identity of the victims.id.at.a fugitive commission of crimes against innocent civilians is highly relevant,and likely is fatal,to a claim that the offenses were political in nature when viewed objectively.id.at see also eain wilkes,cir explaining that the indiscriminate bombing of a civilian populace is not a political act.
we strongly affirm our reasoning in ordinola that the civilian status of victims largely will be determinative of the objective inquiry.we previously have relied on the department of state view that the political offense exception is not applicable to violent attacks on civilians,and have granted this position great weight in our analysis.ordinola,at citation omitted.moreover,the original justification for the political offen
