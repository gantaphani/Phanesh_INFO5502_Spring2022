the government of the republic of ghana appeals two orders of the district court denying its motions to reopen judgment under rule b.those motions seek relief from a judgment enforcing against ghana a consent decree entered by that country high court of justice.ghana argues,first,that it never waived sovereign immunity before judgment and therefore may raise it after judgment and,alternatively,that the parties reached a postjudgment settlement.we hold that ghana may not,after having voluntarily withdrawn its direct appeal,assert sovereign immunity in a collateral attack,and that the parties did not enter into a settlement agreement.therefore,we affirm the orders of the district court denying ghana rule b motions.
background 
the government of ghana contracted to buy corn from delta foods,a ghanaian corporation.after delta purchased the corn in the united states and tried to deliver it,the government refused to take it or to pay for it.delta sued ghana in the high court of justice,after which the two parties negotiated a settlement agreement,the terms of which were then embodied in a consent decree.ghana was to pay delta billion ghanaian cedis for the corn,the cost of storage,and interest.in addition,ghana was to reimburse delta for any cost of storage,and to pay delta interest in an amount to be negotiated by the parties.
in january,still not having been paid any money,delta sued ghana in the district court here to enforce the decree of the high court.ghana moved to dismiss or for summary judgment on the grounds of forum non conveniens,comity,and ripeness,but it did not assert sovereign immunity.delta opposed ghana motion and for summary judgment.ghana then filed a reply in which it stated 
also confused in the opposition papers are the principles of sovereign immunity and act of state with that of comity.the first two are doctrines of jurisdictional immunity.comity on the other hand,like the doctrine of forum,concerns discretionary jurisdiction.neither sovereign immunity nor act of state is relevant since immunity to jurisdiction is not claimed.
in october,the district court granted delta motion for summary judgment and ordered ghana to pay delta the billion cedis due under the ghanaian consent decree,plus interest.converting the billion cedis to dollars using the rate of exchange at the time delta filed suit in the united states,the court awarded delta plus interest from the entry of the consent decree to the entry of judgment in the district court,for a total of,plus interest on that sum.
ghana timely appealed to this court each and every part of the said judgment but still did not assert sovereign immunity.in december,however,ghana moved voluntarily to dismiss its motion we it could file in the district court a motion under rule b seeking relief from that court judgment.
meanwhile,on november,ghana had deposited billion cedis into the ghanaian court,pursuant to the consent decree,but delta had rejected the payment,no doubt because by that time the cedis were worth millions of dollars less than the to which it was entitled under the judgment of the district court.ghana also had tendered some billion cedis it owed under the consent decree for warehouse costs delta accepted that money.in its rule b motion ghana quoted a letter delta counsel had sent the government in march,stating that i f the judgment debt is satisfied in ghana,the proceedings in the can not continue since satisfaction of the judgment in ghana will be a complete answer to proceedings for execution in the 
the district court denied ghana motion to vacate the judgment.the court ruled that neither delta letter nor its acceptance of payment for decree warehouse part of the ghanaian judgment delta had not sought to enforce in the united states establishes that the parties ever entered into a settlement.
in march,ghana moved again under rule b to vacate the judgment of the district court,this time on the ground of sovereign immunity.ghana explained its belated assertion of immunity as follows t here has been a substantive change in the law which affects the judgment of this court.this change is affected by virtue of a most recent decision of the second circuit court of appeals,here referring to transatlantic shiffahrtskontor gmbh shanghai foreign trade.
the district court denied ghana second motion to vacate,holding that ghana had,by the passage in ghana opposition to the plaintiff motion for summary judgment,explicitly waived any claim to sovereign immunity.therefore,the court did not reach the question whether ghana was precluded from raising sovereign immunity in a motion.
ghana now appeals the district court dismissal of its two rule b motions.the time for appeal of the underlying judgment has long passed,of course.
ii.analysis 
ghana contends initially that it has not waived sovereign immunity and may raise it for the first time in a postjudgment motion.in the alternative,ghana argues that it satisfied the judgment of the district court when it paid into the high court of ghana billion cedis for the benefit of delta.
ghana initially must show that it may assert sovereign immunity in a motion under rule b.because we hold that it may not,we need not reach the question whether ghana waived sovereign immunity.
sovereign immunity 
ghana points out that it never answered delta complaint it merely moved to dismiss or for summary judgment on various preliminary grounds,such as forum non conveniens.when the district court denied that motion,ghana filed an appeal,which it later withdrew.there being no doubt it could move to dismiss on the ground of forum non conveniens without thereby waiving sovereign immunity,ghana argues that it could likewise withdraw its appeal of the forum non conveniens motion without losing its right to assert sovereign immunity.
delta counters that ghana lost its right to assert sovereign immunity when it withdrew its direct appeal.according to delta,a party may not challenge a court jurisdiction in a collateral attack if the party initially appeared in its own defense the question of jurisdiction is res judicata.
we can not but agree with delta.the problem with ghana argument is that ghana never timely asserted sovereign immunity in any forum.its failure to assert sovereign immunity in the district court is not by itself fatal because,as ghana points out,it did not answer the complaint and sovereign immunity is not necessarily waived by the tactical choice to raise other preliminary objections first.canadian overseas ores,compania de acero del pacifico,cir.therefore,when the district court entered summary judgment for delta,ghana arguably could have asserted sovereign immunity for the first time in the court of appeals because the objection goes to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.see bazuaye united states,challenges to subject matter jurisdiction can be raised for the first time on appeal.there is a limit,however,to the timeliness of even a jurisdictional objection,and that limit was reached when the time to appeal ran out with no appeal pending,the judgment of the district court then became final.for,as the supreme court has stated 
a party that has had an opportunity to litigate the question of jurisdiction may not reopen that question in a collateral attack upon an adverse judgment.it has long been the rule that principles of res judicata apply to jurisdictional subject matter and personal.

ghana now seeks to raise the issue of sovereign immunity because it believes that transatlantic,which the second circuit decided two months after the last day for ghana to appeal,works a substantive change in the law from which ghana might benefit.according to ghana,that case holds that in a suit to enforce a foreign judgment,the immunity of a foreign sovereign is not subject to the commercial activity exception unless the foreign judgment arises out of commercial activity in the united states.
whether ghana would benefit from the transatlantic case is irrelevant to the proper disposition of its motion to vacate the judgment.the supreme court has been clear,in terms that might as well have bee
