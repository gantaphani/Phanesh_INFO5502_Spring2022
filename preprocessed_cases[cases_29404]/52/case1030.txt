cummins appeals the united states court of international trade grant of summary judgment,which held that the crankshafts imported by cummins into the united states did not originate in mexico and were not entitled to preferential treatment under the north american free trade agreement nafta.cummins united states,d.int l trade.we affirm.
background 
under the united states tariff laws,products that originate in the territory of a nafta party are entitled to preferential duty treatment.general note a ii,harmonized tariff schedule of the united states htsus see also.one way a product may so originate is if it is transformed in the territory of a nafta party.general notes b i iv,htsus.one manner in which a good can be transformed,as is relevant to this case,is by undergoing a change in tariff classification to subheading from any other heading.general notes b ii a,t a,htsus.here,cummins contends that the crankshafts it imports into the united states undergo such a tariff shift in mexico from heading to subheading,and are thereby entitled to preferential duty treatment.
the facts surrounding the production of the crankshafts are undisputed.production begins in brazil,where krupp metalurgica campo limpo creates a forging having the general shape of a crankshaft.this forging is created from a forging process,which involves forging alloy steel between matrices.after forging,the excess material that was squeezed out of the matrices,called flash,is removed by a process called trimming.the trimming is done on a separate machine within approximately ten seconds of the forging press operation.because the process of trimming can distort the forging,the forging is then coined.coining involves applying pressure to the forging,which is still hot and malleable,in a closed die.after coining,the forging is subjected to shot blasting.shot blasting uses abrasive particles to strike the surface of the forging to remove dirt and oxide from its surface.the forging is then cooled,and its ends are milled so that it can be securely clamped into machines in mexico for final machining operations.the last manufacturing process performed in brazil is mass centering,in which the forging center of balance is determined and locator center points are machined into each end.
after these processes are performed in brazil,the forging is imported into mexico by cummins de mexico,cummsa,a wholly owned subsidiary of cummins.as imported,the forging has the general shape of,but can not yet function as,a crankshaft.after importation into mexico,cummsa performs at least fourteen different steps on the forging that cover over of its surface area resulting in a useable crankshaft,which cummins imports into the united states.it is undisputed that the crankshaft imported into the united states is classifiable under subheading of the htsus,which covers t ransmission shafts including camshafts and crankshafts and cranks 
the court of international trade addressed nearly identical facts in an earlier case involving the same crankshafts.cummins engine united states,d.int l trade cummins i.the crankshaft manufacturing process there was nearly identical to the one here,except that a grease pocket was milled into the forging in brazil.the court held that machining the grease pocket in brazil precluded classification under heading upon importation in mexico,because it was further working the product beyond roughly shaping it by forging.
after cummins i,cummins filed for an amended advance ruling letter from the united states customs and border protection customs,based on the grease pocket being machined in mexico instead of brazil.despite the change in the manufacturing process,customs determined that the crankshafts did not originate in mexico.crankshafts processed in mexico from forgings of brazilian origin originating goods under nafta,ruling.prior to issuing its decision,customs submitted the question to the world customs organization wco,which issued a classification opinion,approved by the member states to,determining that the proper classification of the forgings imported into mexico was under heading,not heading.classification of certain forgings for crank shafts,doc.no,available at amendments to the compendium of classification opinions arising from the classification of certain forgings for crank shafts in subheading,doc.no.at march.however,customs did not expressly rely upon the wco decision in denying cummins preferential treatment.
in response to customs advance letter ruling,cummins filed an action in the court of international trade under h while that action was pending,cummins imported into the united states a test shipment of three finished crankshafts marked as originating in mexico,which customs classified under subheading,htsus.cummins protested this classification,arguing that the proper classification was mx after protesting customs classification of the test shipment,cummins filed an action under a.the trial court consolidated the two actions,but later found the section h action moot in light of the one under section a.
the court determined on summary judgment that the articles imported into mexico were properly classified under subheading,not heading,and accordingly did not undergo a tariff shift and were not entitled to preferential treatment under nafta.cummins appeals the trial court grant of summary judgment,and we have jurisdiction under a.

we review the trial court grant of summary judgment on tariff classifications de novo.group united states,citation omitted.a classification decision involves two underlying steps determining the proper meaning of the tariff provisions,which is a question of law and then determining which heading the disputed goods fall within,which is a question of fact.universal elecs.united states,citing intel,united states.however,when the nature of the merchandise is undisputed,as it is here,the classification issue collapses entirely into a question of law,at citing bausch lomb.united states.although our review is de novo,we accord deference to a customs classification ruling in proportion to its power to persuade under the principles of skidmore swift.united states mead,d mead united states,citations omitted.in addition,customs relative expertise in administering the tariff statute often lends further persuasiveness to a classification ruling,entitling the ruling to a greater measure of deference.mead,at.
it is undisputed that the crankshafts imported into the united states are properly classified under subheading.the disputed issue is whether the crankshafts undergo a tariff shift in mexico.that is,do the crankshafts enter mexico under a different tariff heading than they leave mexico the trial court concluded that the crankshafts do not undergo a tariff shift as they are classified under subheading upon import into and export out of mexico.cummins contends that this classification was error,and the proper classification of the product upon import into mexico is under heading,which covers o ther alloy steel in ingots or other primary forms semifinished products of other alloy steel.
the general rules of interpretation gri govern the classification of goods within the htsus.united states.under gri,the classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relevant section or chapter notes.as noted above,cummins contends that the goods imported into mexico are properly classified as semifinished products of other alloy steel under heading.chapter notes expressly define semifinished,in pertinent part,as products of solid section,which have not been further worked than roughly shaped by forging,including blanks for angles,shapes or sections.chapter,note ij,htsus.thus,if the product imported into mexico has been further worked beyond being roughly shaped by forging,it does not fall within heading.the parties dispute the meaning of the term further worked.
cummins relies on additional note to chapter,which defines further worked as subjecting the product to one of several expressly listed surface treatments it is undisputed that none of these surface treatments are performed in brazil,and cummins contends
