hanvit bank and chohung bank the banks appeal from interlocutory orders of the united states district court for the southern district of new york cedarbaum,concluding that the banks were not foreign states entitled to immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,et.the orders vacated previous ones granting immunity under the fsia with respect to claims brought against them by gary filler and lawrence perlman the filler plaintiffs and janet and james baker the baker plaintiffs.the vacatur occurred as a consequence of an intervening supreme court decision,dole food patrickson,d,which held that a foreign state must itself own a majority of a corporation shares if the corporation is to be deemed an instrumentality of the state under the fsia we affirm.
background 
the filler plaintiffs are trustees of the tra rights trust,which is the of seagate technology,seagate and holds all claims arising out of seagate acquisition in june of million in stock of lernhout hauspie speech products,l h,a belgian software company.the baker plaintiffs owned more than million of l h stock,which they obtained in june in a stock swap for their principal interest in dragon systems.a few months later,l h was implicated in a multibillion dollar fraud permeating their worldwide operations.the fraud,which was perpetrated by senior management of l h along with outside auditors and others in the united states and korea,involved reporting hundreds of millions of dollars of nonexistent revenue from contracts with related parties or fictitious customers.after the fraud was exposed,more than of the revenue reported by l h for the period was reversed,including the entirety of the million of revenue reported by the firm korean operations in and.this fraud has been the subject of an sec as well as a criminal investigation and multiple arrests by belgian authorities.public exposure of the fraud caused a loss of of l h market the value of the stock held by the appellees.
chohung bank and hanvit bank are both commercial banks organized under the laws of korea with headquarters in seoul.both banks were private entities prior to january when,because of severe financial problems,they received substantial capital infusions from the korean deposit insurance corporation kdic.the kdic is a korean governmental institution created by the korea depositor protection act and a presidential decree.under its enabling statute,the kdic exists as a special legal entity for the purpose of operating a deposit insurance system.the kdic is run by the korean ministry of finance and the economy of the republic of korea.at the time of the filing of these actions the kdic directly owned of the shares of chohung bank and of the shares of woori finance holdings,which in turn owned of the shares of hanvit bank.since the filing of the actions,the kdic has sold chohung bank to a private entity,and hanvit bank is expected to emerge as a private entity in the near future.in their complaints,the baker and filler plaintiffs allege that chohung and hanvit along with shinhan bank,a party not appealing here were involved in the fraud perpetrated by l h,and that the two banks actively made material misrepresentations to their independent auditors about the source and amounts of l h revenue.
the filler plaintiffs action was filed against chohung and hanvit in october while the baker plaintiffs complaint was filed against the two banks a year later.in february,the district court dismissed the filler plaintiffs claims against chohung and hanvit on the grounds that the banks enjoyed sovereign immunity under the fsia,and in march dismissed the baker plaintiffs claims against the banks on the same ground.following the supreme court decision in dole food in april,the plaintiffs in both cases successfully moved for reconsideration.the district court vacated its previous orders dismissing the claims against hanvit and chohung,finding that dole food precluded sovereign immunity where,as here,government ownership of the defendant corporations is indirect.the banks appeal,and we affirm.

sovereign immunity 
the fsia is the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this country.saudi arabia nelson,d quotation marks and citation omitted robinson gov t of malaysia,cir.the fsia provides that s ubject to existing international agreements to which the united states is a party at the time of enactment of this act a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states except as provided in sections to of this chapter.the act further provides 
for purposes of this chapter 
a a foreign state,except as used in section of this title,includes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state as defined in subsection b.
b an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state means any entity 
which is a separate legal person,corporate or otherwise,and 
which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,and 
which is neither a citizen of a state of the united states as defined in section c and d of this title nor created under the laws of any third country.
there is no dispute that both chohung and hanvit satisfy the first and third criteria of b test for agency or instrumentality are both separate legal entities and are neither citizens of a state of the united states nor created under the laws of a third country.
further,there is no dispute that the kdic is an organ of a foreign b.filler hanvit bank,d,filler i.although there is no specific test for organ status under the fsia,various factors are relevant 
whether the foreign state created the entity for a national purpose 
whether the foreign state actively supervises the entity 
whether the foreign state requires the hiring of public employees and pays their salaries 
whether the entity holds exclusive rights to some right in the foreign country and 
how the entity is treated under foreign state law.
kelly syria shell petroleum dev,cir quotation marks and citation omitted alteration in original see corporacion mexicana de servicios maritimos,cir.the district court correctly concluded that the kdic is an organ of a foreign state because the kdic was formed by statute the korea depositors protection act and presidential decree,it performs functions traditionally performed by the government protecting depositors and promoting financial stability,has its directors are appointed by the ministry of finance and economy its president appointed by the president of the republic of korea and many of its operations overseen by the ministry of finance and economy.filler i,d at.
the only question is whether the banks satisfy the second criteria for agency or instrumentality,whether they are organ s of a foreign state or have a majority of their shares owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof.b.the banks contend that they do,arguing that once we determine that the kdic is an organ of the government of south korea,they automatically become agencies or instrumentalities of the state because the majority of their stock is owned by the kdic.see in re air crash disaster near roselawn,cir accepting this tiering theory of sovereign immunity.but see gates victor fine foods,cir rejecting the same.in other words,the banks argue that since the kdic is an organ and therefore an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state,it is also a foreign state by virtue of a definition of a foreign state as includ ing its agencies or instrumentalities.and because the kdic owns the majority of their shares,the two banks contend that they are agencies or instrumentalities of a foreign state by virtue of b ownership prong.put another way,the banks argue the transitive foreign state means agency or instrumentality agency or instrumentality means organ or corporation therefore foreign state means organ or corporation and therefore,corporations of an organ are corporations of a foreign state.
we note that chohung and hanvit claim to be corporations of a foreign state for purposes of fsia analysis even though chohung is a subsidiary and hanvit is a subsidiary.accepting their analysis would permit an infinite number of subsidiaries to enjoy sovereign immunity.each subsidiary becomes an agency or instrumentality,and therefore the foreign state,for purposes of assessing its majority ownership of the next subsidiary in line.
the district court initially accepted the banks argument,holding that such tiering was allowed and that chohung and hanvit were entitled to foreign sovereign immunity by virtue of kdic ownership interest in them.filler i,d at the supreme court then addressed tiering under the fsia in dole food,affirming the ninth circuit and noting that t he court of appeals resolved the question of the fsia applicability by holding that a subsidiary of an instrumentality is not itself entitled to instrumentality status.its holding was correct.at.because the companies claiming immunity were separated from the foreign state by one or more intermediate tiers,the court found that these companies were not instrumentalities of the foreign state under the fsia at any time.id.at.the court relied on the elementary principle of corporate law that corporations are distinct from their shareholders to conclude that only direct ownership of a majority of shares by the foreign state satisfied the statutory requirement of majority ownership.id.at.in light of this ruling,the district judge,acting on a motion for reconsideration under.b,revised and vacated the earlier dismissal of plaintiffs claims,holding that the banks were not entitled to sovereign immunity.filler hanvit bank,civ,wl,dist.lexis july,baker hanvit bank,civ,wl,dist.lexis july.
while dole food rejected the contention that b majority ownership clause allowed for the tiering of corporate subsidiaries,such that each could avail itself of sovereign immunity under the fsia,at,the banks advance a somewhat different argument in this,that an organ under the first half of b that is an agency or instrumentality is also,by definition,a foreign state under a,and that its subsidiary is therefore directly owned by a foreign state and entitled to sovereign immunity.accepting the banks proposed distinction would,however,eviscerate dole food.rather than claiming a subsidiary is entitled to immunity because of successive majority ownership up the chain of control,defendants would simply claim that at each level,majority ownership grants agency or instrumentality status,designation as a foreign state,and,therefore,sovereign immunity.such a result would be incompatible with the purpose of the fsia,which is to grant governmental,not private corporate immunity,and,in any event,would reflect infidelity to the supreme court reasoning in dole food.the fact that chohung is a subsidiary while hanvit is a subsidiary only makes the problem more apparent because it requires an additional finding that woori is an agency or instrumentality and therefore a foreign state,thus conferring immunity on hanvit.such a result is incompatible with dole food.the supreme court made it unmistakably clear that a subsidiary of an instrumentality is not itself entitled to instrumentality status,at,and that only direct ownership of a majority of shares by the foreign state satisfies the statutory requirement.id.at.emphasis added.
the banks argument fails for a number of other reasons as well.first,the statutory language of a makes clear that a foreign state includes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state a emphasis added.this statement is not equivalent to saying that a foreign state is or is defined as an agency or instrumentality.gates,at.while these latter terms would suggest equivalency between the foreign state and the agencies and instumentalities,the use of the term includes implies that agencies and instrumentalities,as well as political subdivisions,are subsumed within the foreign state.thus,a proper understanding of the term includes does not support the notion of recursive tiering.once an entity is determined to be an agency or instrumentality,it is deemed part of the foreign state but it does not become the foreign state and,therefore,can not confer agency or instrumentality status on corporate entities further down the chain of ownership.
further,as the ninth circuit recognized,if congress intended foreign state to mean agency or instrumentality as appellants urge,it must also have meant for foreign state to mean political subdivision by the terms of a.id.however,this latter proposition clearly can not be the case as the rest of the statute repeatedly distinguishes between foreign states and political subdivisions.for example,b states that an entity must be an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,in order to be accorded instrumentality status.id.noting this contradiction in more detail.if we were to accept the banks argument,we would render the reference to political subdivisions in these provisions redundant,a result that is to be avoided in statutory construction.babbitt sweet home chapter of cmtys.for a great,d applying cannon of interpretation disfavoring readings of statutes that render statutory language surplusage.
additionally,our interpretation is consistent with the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity codified in the fsia.republic of austria altmann,d verlinden cent.bank of,d.the restrictive theory provides that a state is immune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts as to its sovereign or public acts jure imperii,but not as to those that are private or commercial in character jure gestionis.nelson,at.finally,we note that while the kdic serves a public function in ensuring the stability of the south korean banking system,the same can not be said of the defendant banks,which have conceded that they have reverted or are in the process of reverting back to private ownership.thus,denial of sovereign immunity to chohung and hanvit would not undermine a public function of the government of korea and basically impacts the private commercial interests of the banks.
iii.conclusion 
for these reasons,we affirm the district court denial of motions to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity.
there are two cases on appeal baker hanvit bank,l,and filler hanvit bank,l.because they present the same legal issue,we resolve them together in this opinion.
the remaining was owned by financial institutions,securities firms,private corporations,and individual shareholders.
sections and of title provide some exceptions to the general rule of sovereign example,when the foreign state waives immunity,when the suit arises out of commercial activity carried out in the united states or commercial activity causing a direct effect in the united states,when the suit addresses a violation of property rights in contravention of international law,and when the suit consists of counterclaims made against a foreign state that initiates litigation.while the did raise the commercial activity exception below,that argument is not implicated on appeal.
while our circuit has never ruled on the question,filler,d at,the ninth and seventh circuit have come to starkly different conclusions on the application of tiering to sovereign immunity analysis.in gates,the court held that although one defendant was an organ and thus an agency or instrumentality of canada,the organ majority ownership of a subsidiary did not similarly make that subsidiary an instrumentality.id.at.in contrast stood the seventh circuit,which in roselawn,held that tiering was allowed for fsia purposes,re
