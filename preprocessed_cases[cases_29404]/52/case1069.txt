plaintiff john doe appeals from the trial court order quashing service of summons and process on the archdiocese of cashel emly in ireland.we hold that plaintiff has waived the issue by his failure to fairly and completely set forth,discuss,and analyze the relevant facts under the applicable substantial evidence standard of review.we alternatively hold that substantial evidence supported the trial court ruling that the defendant had insufficient contacts with the state of california to support an exercise of either general or specific jurisdiction.
facts and procedural history 
jurisdictional facts 
john doe sued the roman catholic diocese of stockton and oliver,one of its former priests,alleging that sexually molested him in and,when plaintiff was approximately years old.although plaintiff eventually settled with the stockton archdiocese,he later added as a doe defendant the archdiocese of cashel emly,located in county tiperary,ireland according to plaintiff,cashel emly owned and operated saint patrick college,the seminary that trained and ordained,and which sent him to stockton knowing he was a child molester.
cashel emly,acting through archbishop dermot clifford,moved to quash service of the summons on the ground it was not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the california courts.the trial court permitted plaintiff to take discovery on the jurisdictional issues.distilled,the evidence showed that,who was born and raised in ireland and was living there at the time,entered the seminary in.in,he was incardinated into the stockton archdiocese.according to plaintiff expert,incardination is the process by which a diocese accepts a candidate for priesthood.the stockton archdiocese paid saint patrick for tuition and living expenses.completed his seminary studies in,and was ordained as a priest by thomas morris,the archbishop of cashel emly.ordination is the ceremony by which one becomes a priest,and is thereby vested with the powers and duties of priesthood.then moved to the stockton area and began serving as a priest.
archbishop clifford supporting declaration said he became affiliated with the archdiocese in and became its archbishop in.saint patrick is located within the geographical boundaries of the archdiocese but is a juridically separate entity held in trust by a wholly distinct board of trustees.clifford is a member of the saint patrick board,as are other clergy members from two dioceses.the college no longer operates as a seminary,offering instead a traditional collegiate curriculum.when saint patrick was a seminary,it was one of six in ireland that educated prospective priests for ordination throughout ireland dioceses,as well as in foreign countries.according to clifford,was never a priest,employee,volunteer,agent,or representative of cashel emly.nor did the archdiocese have any contact of any kind with.the archdiocese did not own property or conduct business operations in california,and had never sent an agent or representative to the state in order to conduct business on its behalf.mcdermott said he had travelled to california twice in at the invitation of an american nonprofit entity that was trying to raise funds to support seminary education in ireland.while saint patrick college might have received money from such fundraising,the archdiocese never did.
plaintiff opposed the motion to quash with a declaration from patrick wall,a catholic priest and benedictine monk who claimed to have expertise in canon law through his service as a on the judicial tribunal for the.paul area archdiocese.wall declaration included the following assertions excerpts from an attached copy of the irish catholic directory listed cashel emly as the entity that owned,operated,and controlled saint patrick college excerpts from an attached copy of a book titled irish priests in america said the college was a seminary for mostly overseas dioceses,that it had ordained priests who served in the united states,and that as of,priests educated at saint patrick were serving in california church records showed that entered the seminary in,was incardinated to the stockton archdiocese in,and arrived in stockton as a newly ordained priest in.the normal practice would have required the stockton archdiocese to support education by way of payments to saint patrick for room,board,and tuition and a petition for laicization removal from the priesthood that was filed by the church in the,listed a psychic defect under canon of the catholic church canon law code as the ground for the petition.wall interpreted that to mean the petition alleged had committed a crime or had a mental disorder before he was ordained that had to have been known by the archbishop who ordained him.
plaintiff counsel,venus soltan,submitted a declaration claiming that wall had reviewed and translated the certificate showing ordination into the priesthood,and had translated it to mean that was ordained by the,who assigned to serve the stockton archdiocese.those statements do not appear in wall declaration,however.interrogatory responses from the archdiocese also showed that the stockton archdiocese paid educational and living expenses while he attended saint patrick.
the archdiocese countered with a reply brief supported by the declaration of anthony anscombe,a partner in the law firm representing the archdiocese.anscombe declared that as part of his coursework for his college degree in classical languages,he took numerous advanced level courses in latin literature.he also taught latin at the high school level some years before.anscombe interpreted the ordination certificate to mean that was ordained by the archdiocese for the benefit of service in the stockton archdiocese,but it did not mean that cashel emly had assigned him to the stockton archdiocese.
the parties submitted supplemental briefs and declarations.soltan submitted an declaration,along with supporting documents,on behalf of the plaintiff.much of soltan declaration purported to describe how the archdiocese operated the nature of its structure and affiliation with saint patrick how the archdiocese came to know that was already molesting young boys while he studied at saint patrick and the meaning and effect of the proceedings to remove from the priesthood.wall submitted another declaration describing how,in his view,saint patrick was in fact controlled by cashel emly.william smith,the author of irish priests in the united states a vanishing subculture,submitted a declaration that as of,alumni of saint patrick served as priests in united states dioceses,with of those in california,and of those in the stockton archdiocese.
the archdiocese submitted the declaration of nicholas cafardi,a lawyer,law professor,and former dean of both duquesne university school of law and the law school at the university of pittsburgh.cafardi also had worked as counsel for the pittsburgh diocese and obtained a degree in canon law.cafardi reviewed the wall declarations and supporting documents,and said he disagreed with wall conclusions.according to cafardi,wall seriously misrepresent ed the meaning of the petition to remove from the priesthood.instead,cafardi said the various documents involved in the proceeding showed that an attempt was made to remove from the priesthood for having molested two boys,and that the petition was dropped when request for voluntary laicization was granted by the pope.even so,a psychic defect could not have been grounds for laicization and that nothing in the documents or canon law could be interpreted to mean that the archbishop of cashel emly would have known such a defect existed when was ordained.
fathers ronald bowers and daniel ward,who served on the judicial tribunal of the.paul archdiocese and who knew plaintiff expert wall,said wall was never a of the tribunal as he had claimed.instead,he was an intern who functioned as a law clerk,drafting documents and taking notes under the guidance of an actual advocate or judge.his duties in that regard were limited solely to marriage annulment cases.both questioned the extent of his knowledge of canon law.
the archdiocese also objected on various grounds to numerous portions of all the declarations submitted by soltan and wall up to that point.as to soltan,most of the objections went to her lack of personal knowledge of,or otherwise lay a foundation for,the factual assertions she made.objections were also made on grounds of hearsay,the best evidence rule,and others.similar objections were made to wall declarations,as well as a general objection that wall falsification of his qualifications showed he lacked sufficient knowledge of canon law to qualify as an expert on the subject.wall responded with a declaration claiming that bowers and ward were unaware of his true functions and that he was in fact qualified in canon law.wall also disagreed with cafardi interpretation of the record.john manly,a partner in the law firm representing plaintiff,also attested to wall qualifications.
the trial court ruling 
the trial court sustained the archdiocese objections to of the paragraphs in soltan first declaration,and to of the paragraphs in her second declaration.the court sustained objections to three paragraphs and two exhibits from wall first declaration,but sustained none as to his second declaration.all other attachments to the declarations were considered,but summaries of those exhibits by soltan and wall were not.the court found that wall was qualified to give an opinion on canon law,but,as the trier of jurisdictional facts,found that the expert declarations from the archdiocese were more credible.the trial court then went on to find that cashel emly was not subject to either general or specific jurisdiction by the california courts.
in concluding that california did not have general jurisdiction over the archdiocese,the trial court found that it had no ongoing residence or relationships in california.although plaintiff presented evidence that seminary students from saint patrick regularly moved to california after ordination,and that the seminary maintained contact with those students,that was insufficient to establish general jurisdiction.the trial court noted that simply because many ordained priests leave ireland and go elsewhere does not subject the seminary and cashel emly to jurisdiction everywhere.
as for specific jurisdiction,the court found there was no admissible evidence that the archdiocese knew had a propensity to molest children or that his ordination would put him in a position to do so wherever he went.the trial court found that cashel emly did not expressly aim at or target california as a location to send upon his ordination.was incardinated into the stockton archdiocese in,well before he was ordained.original italics.was merely a student at saint patrick for several years,and was not its and therefore not cashel emly agent or employee.the court disagreed with wall interpretation of ordination certificate and found that cashel emly had not assigned him to the stockton archdiocese.instead,in accordance with the declaration of cashel emly latin language expert,the certificate was best read as a statement that the archdiocese ordained for the benefit of the stockton archdiocese.in short,the trial court found that the archdiocese did not purposefully avail itself of california.it also found that asserting jurisdiction would not comport with fair play and substantial justice.the court declined to reach the issues whether saint patrick was owned or controlled by the archdiocese or its archbishop during the relevant period or as a matter of irish law,cashel emly even existed as an entity 
discussion 
principles of personal jurisdiction 
california courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant on any basis not inconsistent with the constitutions of this state or the united states.code civ,vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,d,vons companies.personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant served with process outside the state satisfies constitutional due process requirements if the defendant has such minimum contacts with the state that the assertion of jurisdiction does not violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.id.at,d,citing internat.shoe washington.
personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific.general jurisdiction exists when a nonresident defendant contacts in the forum state are substantial,continuous,and systematic.in short,the defendant contacts are so that they take the place of physical presence in the forum as a basis for jurisdiction.when general jurisdiction exists,the cause of action against the defendant does not have to be connected with the defendant business relationship to the forum state.vons companies,supra,cal th at,d.
if sufficient contacts for general jurisdiction do not exist,a nonresident defendant may be subject to a forum state specific jurisdiction when the defendant has purposefully availed himself of that state benefits and the cause of action is related to or arises out of the defendant contacts with the state.vons companies,supra,cal th at,d.specific jurisdiction exists when a nonresident defendant has purposefully directed his activities at a forum resident derived benefit from his forum activities or availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.ibid.once it has been determined that a nonresident defendant contacts are sufficient to invoke specific jurisdiction,the court must still determine whether doing so comports with notions of fair play and substantial justice.factors involved in this determination include the defendant burden in appearing in the forum state,the forum state interest in adjudicating the claim,the plaintiff interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief in the state,and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.id.at,d.
when a defendant moves to quash service of process on the ground that it is not subject to the state personal jurisdiction,the plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.if the plaintiff does so,the burden shifts to the defendant to show that exercising jurisdiction would be unreasonable.when there is conflicting evidence,we will affirm the trial court factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence.if there are no evidentiary conflicts,the existence of jurisdiction is a legal question that calls for our independent review.vons companies,supra,cal th at,d.
plaintiff has waived the issue by his failure to fully and fairly discuss the conflicting evidence submitted by cashel emly 
a party who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding must set forth,discuss,and analyze all the evidence on that point,both favorable and unfavorable.schmidlin city of palo alto th,d.contrary to fundamental principles of appellate review,plaintiff has failed to do so.instead,his opening brief sets forth only his version of the evidence,omitting any reference to the conflicting evidence submitted by cashel emly,as described in our statement of facts.plaintiff also failed to mention the many evidentiary objections that were sustained to his supporting declarations and documents,as well as the trial court factual findings in granting the motion to quash instead,plaintiff asserted in his opening appellate brief that the facts were not in conflict,calling for our independent review.
this deficiency in plaintiff opening appellate brief was pointed out by the archdiocese in its respondent brief.in reply,plaintiff contends that no waiver occurred because although there is a conflict in the evidence as to whether the archdiocese knew about propensity to molest children,there is no conflict in the evidence concerning its activities in california accepting tuition and other college expenses from the stockton diocese specifically for,as well as from other archdioceses throughout the state,in order to train priests for service in california.we disagree.plaintiff opening appellate brief argued that one of the primary grounds for asserting jurisdiction over cashel emly was its knowledge of sexual predilections,and that argument was analyzed by plaintiff solely in reference to h
