opinion of the court 
this appeal presents two questions of first impression.first,we consider whether the general criminal venue provision,applies when a defendant commits part of his offense inside the united states.second,we determine whether c and f,which together criminalize noncommercial illicit sexual conduct outside the united states,is a valid exercise of congress power under article i,section,clause of the united states constitution the foreign commerce clause.
on november,thomas pendleton boarded a plane in new york city and flew to hamburg,germany.six months after his arrival in germany,pendleton sexually molested a boy.german authorities arrested pendleton,and a jury in hamburg found him guilty of engaging in sexual acts with a person incapable of resistance.after serving nineteen months in a german prison,pendleton returned to the united states,where he was arrested and indicted by a federal grand jury in the district of delaware on one count of engaging in noncommercial illicit sexual conduct in a foreign place,in violation of c and f.
adopted in as part of the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act the protect act,c provides any united states citizen or alien admitted for permanent residence who travels in foreign commerce,and engages in any illicit sexual conduct with another person shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.the statute defines illicit sexual conduct in two ways a sexual act as defined in section with a person under years of age that would be in violation of chapter if the sexual act occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states or any commercial sex act as defined in section with a person under years of age.f.pendleton was indicted under the first subpart of f,which criminalizes noncommercial sex with a minor.
pendleton moved to dismiss the indictment,challenging congress authority to regulate noncommercial activity outside the united states under the foreign commerce clause and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.the district court denied pendleton motion,holding that c was a valid exercise of congress power to regulate the channels of foreign commerce see united states clark,cir t he phrase travels in foreign commerce unequivocally establishes that congress specifically invoked the foreign commerce clause.the district court also held that pendleton due process claim was foreclosed by our decision in united states martinez hidalgo,cir 
following a jury trial,pendleton was convicted of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in germany in violation of.c,and he was sentenced to thirty years in prison at the close of the government case,pendleton moved for judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure a,claiming that he should have been tried in the eastern district of new york.the district court denied the motion,holding that venue was proper in the district of delaware because pendleton was arrested there following his return to the united states.united states pendleton,wl,at.
pendleton timely appealed the district court judgment of sentence and seeks reversal for two reasons venue was improper in the district of delaware and the noncommercial prong of c is facially unconstitutional.we consider each argument in turn.
jurisdiction lies over pendleton appeal under and,and we exercise plenary review over the district court venue determination.united states perez,cir.
as a defendant in a criminal trial,pendleton has a constitutional right to be tried in the district where his crime was committed.id.at citing const.amend.vi and const.art.iii,cl.congress may fix jurisdiction in any district where a crucial element of the crime is performed.id.when congress has not indicate d where it consider s the place of committing the crime to be,we determine jurisdiction from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.united states rodriguez moreno,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.when the crime consists of distinct acts occurring in different places,venue is proper where any part of the crime occurs.id.citing united states lombardo.
although the protect act contains no express venue provision,pendleton argues that congress fixed venue for all crimes involving transportation in foreign commerce only in those districts where foreign travel commenced.for this proposition,pendleton cites a,which reads in relevant part 
any offense involving the use of the mails,transportation in interstate or foreign commerce,or the importation of an object or person into the united states is a continuing offense and,except as otherwise expressly provided by enactment of congress,may be inquired of and prosecuted in any district from,through,or into which such commerce,mail matter,or imported object or person moves.
because he boarded the plane to germany in the eastern district of new york,pendleton claimed jurisdiction would have been proper only in that district.the district court disagreed,writing that the protect act contains no directive as to the appropriate venue for the prosecution of those charged under its provisions.consequently,the court relied on rodriguez moreno approach to determine venue in this case.pendleton,wl,at.this was not error.
contrary to pendleton argument,a does not include a mandatory venue provision.rather,the statute instructs that offenses involving interstate or foreign transportation may be inquired of and prosecuted in the district from which such commerce moves.id.emphasis added.accordingly,the government is not statutorily barred from prosecuting pendleton in another district if it can show that a portion of his offense was committed there.moreover,the constitution does not command a single exclusive venue.united states goldberg,cir quoting united states reed,cir.the c onstitution requires only that the venue chosen be determined from the nature of the crime charged as well as from the location of the act or acts constituting it,and that it not be contrary to an explicit policy underlying venue law.id.quoting reed,at.
where,as here,congress has not designated the venue in the relevant criminal statute,we employ the approach set forth in rodriguez moreno.see at.a court must initially identify the conduct constituting the offense the nature of the crime and then discern the location of the commission of the criminal acts.id.to identify which conduct constitutes the offense,we look to pendleton crime of conviction,which provides 
any united states citizen or alien admitted for permanent residence who travels in foreign commerce,and engages in any illicit sexual conduct with another person shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
c.the crime of conviction thus comprises three elements being a united states citizen or permanent resident traveling in foreign commerce and engaging in illicit sexual conduct.see clark,at finding that an american citizen who traveled in foreign commerce to cambodia and engaged in commercial sex acts with underage boys could be prosecuted under c.
of these three elements,we agree with the district court that engaging in illicit sexual conduct is the most critical to c.indeed,the title of the offense engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places describes only this conduct.moreover,while travel in foreign commerce is an element of c,the crime itself is not complete until a person engages in illicit sex.in this regard,c is unlike the crime of t ravel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct,defined in b,which is complete as soon as one begins to travel with the intent to engage in a sex act with a minor.see united states bredimus,cir we find that the criminal act under b is foreign travel with criminal intent and thus,the offense is complete even if the illicit intent is never realized.although c targets the same individuals as does b namely,persons traveling in commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sex it does so by focusing the court attention on the defendant actual conduct in the foreign nation.see,at explaining that congress enacted c so the government would only have to prove that the defendant engaged in illicit sexual conduct with a minor while in a foreign country.thus,the locus delicti of c is the place where the illicit sex occurs,and not as is the case with b where the intent to engage in the illicit conduct is formed.
because the crux of pendleton offense was committed out of the jurisdiction of any district,the district court held that was the controlling venue provision.section provides that an offense begun or committed outside the united states shall be prosecuted in the district in which the offender is arrested.pendleton argues that does not apply to him because part of his offense occurred in the eastern district of new york and the title of describes only those offenses not committed in any district.id.emphasis added.this argument has some persuasive force,as two of our sister courts of appeals have held that s ection does not apply unless the offense was committed entirely on the high seas or outside the united states.united states pace,cir united states gilboe,cir see also united states perlitz,d stating in dicta that can not apply,by its terms,to a c offense because an essential conduct element of the offense,foreign travel,occurs within a district of the united states.
on the other hand,the courts of appeals for the fourth and fifth circuits have held that applies even when some of a defendant offense conduct takes place in the united states.see,united states levy auto parts,cir,cert.denied,finding venue proper under when conspiracy was essentially foreign,even when some overt acts occurred inside the united states united states erwin,cir,cert.denied,that venue may also be appropriate in another district will not divest venue properly established under.see also united states bin laden,d,criticizing the second circuit narrow reading of in gilboe as myopic and directly in conflict with the clear language of the statute,and noting that the decision has never been favorably cited or relied upon by district courts in the second circuit.
although the title of includes only offenses not committed in any district,it is a rule of statutory interpretation that titles and section headings can not limit the plain meaning of statutory text where that text is clear.ex rel.state operated sch,cir.here,the plain language of supports the fourth and fifth circuits interpretation of the statute.section applies,by its terms,to any offense begun or committed outside the united states.pendleton would have us read the term committed to mean wholly committed.but this can not be correct,because crimes that are wholly committed outside the united states are,by definition,begun abroad.for the term committed to have independent meaning,it must refer to crimes that begin inside the united states but that are in their essence committed abroad.see rosenberg xm ventures,cir w hen interpreting a statute,courts should endeavor to give meaning to every word which congress used and therefore should avoid an interpretation which renders an element of the language superfluous.
here,although pendleton offense began when he initiated foreign travel by boarding a plane bound for germany in the eastern district of new york,he committed the offense when he engaged in an illicit sex act in germany.because pendleton criminal conduct was essentially foreign,levy auto parts,at,the district court did not err in applying to hold that venue was proper in the district of arrest.
having found that venue was proper in delaware,we turn to pendleton substantive claim,namely,his assertion that the noncommercial prong of c is facially unconstitutional.pendleton constitutional claim is subject to plenary review.united states singletary,cir.because pendleton raises a facial challenge,we will invalidate the statute only if we find that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid,that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.state grange.state republican party,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has noted that a facial challenge is the most difficult challenge to mount successfully.united states salerno.
the constitution authorizes congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations,and among the several states,and with the indian tribes.const.art.i,cl.in the early days of the republic,the supreme court defined commerce broadly to include every species of commercial intercourse between two parties.gibbons ogden.more recently,the supreme court has recognized three general categories of regulation in which congress is authorized to engage under its commerce power.gonzales raich.these include the use of the channels of interstate commerce the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,or persons or things in interstate commerce and activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.lopez,at.in its pathmarking decision in lopez,the supreme court held unconstitutional a statute criminalizing the possession of a firearm in a school zone because it did not fall within one of the three aforementioned categories.five years later,in united states morrison,the court struck down portions of the violence against women act on similar grounds,the concern that congress might use the commerce clause to completely obliterate the constitution distinction between national and local authority seems well founded.
the framework outlined in lopez and morrison applies,on its face,to statutes enacted pursuant to the interstate commerce clause.the supreme court has yet to determine whether this framework applies to cases involving congress power to regulate pursuant to the foreign commerce clause.early opinions of the court suggest that the three subparts of the commerce clause should be interpreted similarly.notably,in gibbons ogden,chief justice marshall suggested that commerce,as the word is used in the constitution,is a unit and it must carry the same meaning throughout the sentence,and remain a unit,unless there be some plain intelligible cause which alters it.at see also reno bossier parish sch,refus ing to adopt a construction that would attribute different meanings to the same phrase in the same sentence,depending upon which object it is modifying saikrishna prakash,our three commerce clauses and the presumption of intrasentence uniformity,in practice,we have three different commerce clauses when text and history indicate that we ought to have but one.
notwithstanding chief justice marshall statement in gibbons,the three subclauses of article,cl.have acquired markedly different meanings over time.whereas the interstate commerce clause has been constrained by state sovereignty concerns,see,morrison,at,the indian commerce clause has been interpreted so broadly as to grant congress plenary and exclusive authority to regulate nearly every aspect of indian life.united states lara,citing united states wheeler,see also cotton petroleum new mexico,while the interstate commerce clause is concerned with maintaining free trade among the states even in the absence of implementing federal legislation,the central function of the indian commerce clause is to provide congress with plenary power to legislate in the field of indian affairs.
the foreign commerce clause likewise has followed its own distinct evolutionary path,clark,at,having been used primarily as a tool to limit the ability of the several states to intervene in matters affecting international trade.see,barclays bank plc franchise tax,japan line,county of los angeles,antilles cement acevedo vila,cir.for example,in japan line,the supreme court held that california could not impose an ad valorem tax on japanese shipping containers that were stored temporarily in the state because the scheme could restrict the federal government ability to speak with one voice in foreign affairs.at.recognizing that the purpose of the foreign commerce clause was to establish national uniformity over commerce with foreign nations the court held that,a lthough the constitution,art.i,cl,grants congress power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states in parallel phrases,there is evidence that the founders intended the scope of the foreign commerce power to be the greater.id.
although jurisprudence on the dormant foreign commerce clause is,c ases involving the reach of congressional authority to regulate our citizens conduct abroad are few and far between.clark,at.courts have consistently held that the foreign commerce clause requires a jurisdictional nexus with the united states,see,e,weingarten,cir stating that a person who travels from one foreign nation to another to commit an illicit sex act may not be punished pursuant to congress foreign commerce power cheng boeing,cir the federal aviation act does not apply to the activities of a foreign carrier operating between two foreign points without contact in the united states,but there is precious little case law on how to establish the requisite link to commercial interests in the united states.in the absence of supreme court precedent on the issue,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit determined that the lopez framework which developed to reconcile the conflicting claims of state and national power has little analytical value in the foreign commerce clause context.clark,at.rather than applying lopez framework to determine whether a statute has a constitutionally tenable nexus with foreign commerce,the ninth circuit proposed a global,commonsense approach,which considers whether the statute bears a rational relationship to congress authority under the foreign commerce clause.id.
the government urges us to adopt the ninth circuit approach to the foreign commerce clause.although we agree with clark that the interstate commerce clause developed to address unique federalism concerns that are absent in the foreign commerce context,we are hesitant to dispose of lopez framework without further guidance from the supreme court.see id.at ferguson,dissenting.the supreme court has not yet held that congress has greater authority to regulate activity outside the united states than it does within its borders in fact,the language used to describe its extraterritorial jurisdiction is quite similar to that used in lopez.see,hartford fire ins.california,recognizing that the sherman antitrust act applies extraterritorially,and stating that a jurisdictional nexus exists when foreign conduct was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the united states.in any case,we need not reach the fundamental question of whether the supreme court will adopt the ninth circuit broad articulation of the foreign commerce clause because,as we shall explain,c is a valid congressional enactment under the narrower standard articulated in lopez.
t he authority of congress to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses has been frequently sustained,and is no longer open to question.heart of atlanta motel,united states,quoting caminetti united states,see also morrison,at describing the court holding in lopez,and noting that that although g contains no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce,s uch a jurisdictional element would have establish ed that the enactment is in pursuance of congress regulation of interstate commerce citations and internal quotation marks omitted.unlike congressional authority to regulate activities affecting interstate commerce under the third category in lopez,congress authority to regulate the channels of commerce is not confined to regulations with an economic purpose or impact.see,caminetti,at criminalizing the interstate transportation of a woman or girl for prostitution perez united states,banning the interstate shipment of kidnapped persons united states cummings,f d,cir holding that the international parental kidnapping crime act regulates the channels of foreign commerce by prohibiting the removal or retention of a child outside the united states with intent to obstruct the lawful exercise of parental rights.
in united states tykarsky,we held that b,which criminalizes interstate travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor,is a valid exercise of congress power to regulate the channels of commerce,cir accord united states hawkins,cir per curiam united states buttrick,cir bredimus,at.pendleton attempts to distinguish tykarsky by noting that unlike b,c includes no intent requirement.citing united states rodia for the proposition that t he mere presence of a jurisdictional element does not in and of itself insulate a statute from judicial scrutiny under the commerce clause,pendleton claims the district court should have inquired whether the jurisdictional component in this case limits the statute to items that have an explicit connection with,or effect upon,foreign commerce,cir finding that a b jurisdictional requirement that materials like film and cameras move in interstate commerce is only tenuously related to the ultimate activity regulated intrastate possession of child pornography.no such connection exists here,pendleton argues,because his conviction under c would stand even if he traveled through the channels of commerce for an entirely lawful purpose and only later formed the intent to engage in illicit sex with a minor.contrary to pendleton assertions,however,a statute need not include an element of mens rea to trigger the first prong of lopez.
in united states shenandoah,we upheld portions of the sex offender registration and notification act sorna,a and and i,making it illegal for a sex offender to fail to properly register after traveling in interstate commerce,cir accord united states ambert,cir united states may,cir.like the provision at issue here c,sorna does not require that a sex offender intend,at the time of travel,to later violate federal registration requirements.nor does sorna require the government to demonstrate a temporal connection between the time of travel and a sex offender failure to register.united states husted,dist.lexis,at.june,citing,t he legislative history of the statute shows congress chose not to incorporate a temporal requirement but,instead,intended to encompass all sex offenders.for instance,a tier i sex offender who moves from one state to another and,years later,violates sorna provisions by failing to update his information on an annual basis can be convicted under the statute.a see carr united states,observing in dicta that a sequential reading of the statute helps to assure a nexus between a defendant interstate travel and his failure to register as a sex offender 
nevertheless,sorna was specifically enacted to address one of the biggest problems in our current sex offender registry,cong.rec.s daily ed.july,wl,namely,sex offenders who go missing from the national registry by moving from one state to another,wl.finding that over sex offenders,or nearly in the nation are missing,congress chose to regulate the behavior of all sex offenders who cross state lines.because congress invoked its authority to regulate the use of interstate commerce to facilitate forms of immorality,shenandoah,at citing brooks united states,it was not obliged to include an express intent or temporal element in its definition of the offense.accord united states dixon,f d cir summarily rejecting defendant commerce clause argument,noting that the defendant must in the heat of argument have forgotten the mann act united states hann,d,lopez encompasses a because the statute regulates sex offenders who travel in interstate commerce even though the threat congress was attempting to address failure to register as a sex offender is an intrastate activity.citations omitted.
the same rationale applies to pendleton case.just as sorna failure to report provision was intended to prevent convicted sex offenders from us ing the channels of interstate commerce in evading a state reach,carr.at,congress enacted c to close significant loopholes in the law that persons who travel to foreign countries seeking sex with children are currently using to their advantage in order to avoid prosecution,at summarizing the purpose of adopting language similar to c in the sex tourism pro
