ii.procedural background 
the ij denied the cardenas family applications for asylum and withholding of deportation.petitioners filed a timely appeal of the ij decision to the bia.on march,the bia affirmed the ij decision and denied their applications after finding only one small part of cardenas testimony not credible and concluding that the evidence did not establish past persecution.more important,the bia concluded that cardenas failed to show that his fear of future persecution by the shining path was reasonable in light of his ability to relocate within the country.the bia based its determination that he had not established a fear of persecution by the shining path solely on its conclusion that cardenas had not established that his fear of persecution by the shining path would exist for him country wide.this determination,in turn,was based on the evidence that cardenas was able to live elsewhere in peru for six months without harm,and on the state department country report on peru that showed a weakening of the reach of the shining path.the bia also denied the applications of the two oldest children,cheryl and sharon,on the ground that they were no longer eligible for derivative status as they had reached the age of after the hearing before the ij.
the cardenas family filed a petition for review of the bia decision in this court,contending that the bia erred in concluding that they did not have a fear of future persecution because they had not shown that their fear of persecution extended 
the transitional rules of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira apply to the cardenas family appeal because the bia decision was rendered on or after october,and deportation proceedings were initiated prior to april.specifically,as amended by iirira c setting forth the transitional rules for judicial review,governs this court exercise of jurisdiction.
iii.standard of review 
because the bia in this case conducted an independent review of the ij findings,this court reviews the bia decision,and not that of the ij.lal ins,cir,as amended by cir.to establish statutory eligibility for asylum,an applicant must show that he is unable or unwilling to return to his country because of past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of certain statutory grounds,including imputed political opinion.zahedi ins,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.this court reviews the bia denial of an application for asylum on the ground that the alien has not established eligibility for asylum,for substantial evidence.ochave ins,cir.therefore,the bia determination must be affirmed if supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence in the record.ins,d.
iv.cardenas ability to relocate within peru 
the bia rests its conclusion that cardenas was ineligible for asylum relief on its determination that cardenas has not met his burden of showing that,despite his fear,he could not relocate elsewhere in peru.the ins regulations governing asylum applications place the burden on the applicant who has not established past persecution to show that it would not be reasonable for him to relocate within his country,unless the persecution he fears is perpetrated by a government or sponsored by a government.b i.where an asylum applicant has shown past persecution,the burden is placed on the ins to show that it would be reasonable for him to relocate within the country.the bia asserted that the threats that cardenas received did not rise to the level of past persecution,and therefore placed the burden with respect to relocation on him.it is not necessary for us to decide whether cardenas evidence is sufficient to establish past persecution because,in reaching its decision with respect to his ability to relocate,the bia failed to mention critical evidence of the direct threat that cardenas received when he returned from that,in light of all of the other evidence regarding threats by the shining path,compels the conclusion that cardenas met his burden under the law of showing that he could not safely relocate within peru.
the bia does not assert that the threats cardenas received from the shining path before moving to canete,or the threat he received thereafter,were insufficient to establish a fear of persecution nor does it question that the threats were actually made by the shining path over a period of time nor,finally,does it suggest that the threats were insufficient to give rise to a fear of persecution were cardenas to continue to live in his home city of lima.its decision is based solely on the fact that he need not fear the shining path if he moves to another part of the country.therefore,the issue is whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the conclusion that,while cardenas may have a fear of persecution in lima,he has failed to show that he would have such a fear if he were to move elsewhere in peru.the record contains no substantial evidence supporting that conclusion.
first,cardenas testified that he received a direct threat after his six month absence in which the shining path informed him that it would get to him wherever he was located.the bia found cardenas credible on all points except one,on which we affirm its adverse credibility finding.given that the bia did not question the credibility of cardenas testimony as to the direct threats he received,including the final one,we must accept his statements as true.navas ins,cir dep t of immigration naturalization,cir.thus,there can be no real dispute that the final threat was made.the ins asserts in a letter that the source of the threat was never conclusively identified,and that cardenas only speculated that the threat came from the shining path.that litigation argument is wholly unpersuasive.on the basis of the record before the bia,there is no evidence that would support the possibility that the threat was made by anyone other than the shining path.the terrorist organization had made threats against cardenas in the recent past,both before and after his trip to the united states,and no one else had done so.we do not require
