the dow chemical company,shell oil company,and shell chemical company the companies sued more than a thousand nicaraguan citizens the nicaraguans in federal district court in california.the companies seek a declaration that they are not liable for any injuries to the nicaraguans caused by dibromochloropropane,a toxic pesticide commonly known as dbcp and any judgments of nicaraguan courts to the contrary are not enforceable in this country.the question before us is whether the nicaraguans consented to personal jurisdiction by either choosing to file suit in nicaragua under a nicaraguan law that requires american companies to deposit a specified sum or submit unconditionally to the jurisdiction of courts or defending on the merits a declaratory judgment action brought by a different company in the same federal district court concerning the same set of underlying nicaraguan judgments.the district court rejected both of these contentions.agreeing with the district court,we hold that the nicaraguan defendants did not consent to personal jurisdiction in this action.
factual and legal background 
the underlying disputes in this case concern whether the companies are liable for injuries allegedly caused by exposure to dbcp.dbcp was used by fruit and vegetable growers throughout the world in the,and.by,use of dbcp in the united states was generally prohibited.
thousands of plaintiffs,including several nicaraguans,brought suit in the united states in the against both the manufacturers of dbcp and fruit companies that allegedly continued to use dbcp in developing countries after it was banned in the united states.see delgado shell oil.with respect to the nicaraguan plaintiffs,the court in delgado determined that nicaraguan courts offered an adequate and more convenient alternative forum,see id.at,and dismissed the suit on forum non conveniens grounds.see id.at.
in,the national assembly of nicaragua passed the special law for the conduct of lawsuits filed by persons affected by the use of pesticides manufactured with a dbcp base,known as special law.of import to this appeal are two procedural sections,articles and of special law.
article requires defendants to deposit within ninety days after the respective lawsuits have been brought before the courts of nicaragua,the sum of one hundred thousand dollars or the equivalent thereof in cordobas as a procedural prerequisite for being able to take part in the lawsuit.special law.relatedly,article states 
companies that,within ninety days of being given notice of this law by the plaintiff and service of process through the corresponding channel,have not deposited the sum established in article hereof,must subject themselves unconditionally to the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states of america for the final judgment of the case in question,expressly waiving the defense of forum non conveniens invoked in those courts.in the event that the companies decide that the proceedings are to continue in the nicaraguan courts,they are to deposit the amount established in article of this law.
nicaraguans suing under special law have obtained more than million in judgments against companies,including the dow chemical company,shell oil company,shell chemical company,and dole food company,many of which were issued without participation by the defendant held liable.facing potential attempts at enforcement of the various judgments rendered in nicaragua,dow chemical and the two shell companies filed a declaratory judgment action against named on january,in the central district of california.the companies first amended complaint seeks a declaration that the companies are not liable to the nicaraguans for any asserted injuries allegedly caused by exposure in nicaragua to products purportedly manufactured by plaintiffs and that any judgment obtained by the nicaraguans in nicaragua is not recognizable or enforceable in the united states.the nicaraguans moved to dismiss the complaint under.b lack of personal jurisdiction and.b failure to state a claim.
dole food company filed a separate declaratory judgment action against of the nicaraguans the managuan defendants named in this suit.see dole food gutierrez,no.cv nm pjwx.filed july.the nicaraguans in dole food waived any objection to personal jurisdiction in that case by filing a motion under.b.id.the district court in dole food noted that h ad the issue been raised,it is doubtful that this court would have found a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction over the nicaraguans,id.at,and dismissed most of the claims on the b grounds dole food voluntarily dismissed the remainder of its case.
in this case,the district court granted the nicaraguans motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,concluding that none of the nicaraguans had consented to jurisdiction.the companies appeal.
ii.personal jurisdiction 
we review de novo the district court determination that it does not have personal jurisdiction over defendants.see schwarzenegger fred martin motor,cir.personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is tested by a analysis.first,the exercise of jurisdiction must satisfy the requirements of the applicable state statute.second,the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with federal due process.chan soc y expeditions,cir.california statute,allows courts to exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the constitution of california or of the united states.this provision allows courts to exercise jurisdiction to the limits of the due process clause of the constitution.see mattel,greiner hausser gmbh,cir.thus,the governing standard here would be whether exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process.
the due process clause protects an individual liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgments of a forum with which he has established no meaningful contacts,ties,or relations.burger king rudzewicz,d quoting int l shoe washington.t he test for personal jurisdiction requires that the maintenance of the suit not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.ins.of ireland compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d quoting international shoe,at.internal quotation marks omitted ellipsis in original.
as t he personal jurisdiction requirement recognizes and protects an individual liberty interest,id.at,it can,like other such rights,be waived.id.at.b ecause the personal jurisdiction requirement is a waivable right,there are a variety of legal arrangements by which a litigant may give express or implied consent to the personal jurisdiction of the court.burger king,at.quoting insurance,at.see also chan,at.for instance,parties to a contract may agree in advance to submit to the jurisdiction of a given court.equip.rental,szukhent,d.p articularly in the commercial context,parties frequently stipulate in advance to submit their controversies for resolution within a particular jurisdiction.burger king,at.when such understandings have been obtained through freely negotiated agreements and are not unreasonable and unjust,their enforcement does not offend due process.id.quoting the bremen zapata,d.
the companies specifically disavow any contention that the nicaraguans had sufficient minimum contacts with california to establish specific jurisdiction in compliance with due process.instead they argue that the nicaraguans consented to the personal jurisdiction of the district court in two ways first,the companies maintain that the nicaraguans decision to sue under special law constitutes consent because that law functions like a forum selection clause.second,the companies contend that the managuan defendants impliedly consented to personal jurisdiction in this action by defending dole food on the merits.we address these contentions separately.
special law as a forum selection clause 
the companies first contention is based on the text of article of special law.article provides that defendants sued by a nicaraguan citizen claiming injuries related to dbcp in a nicaraguan court either must subject themselves unconditionally to the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states of america for the final judgment of the case in question,or post
