factual and procedural background 
on february,husband and wife were married in new delhi,india.in july they moved from india to new york state.husband is a united states citizen and wife is a legal resident of the united states.their daughter,was born in new york on february.she is a united states citizen.
according to wife,on august,husband told her the family was going to switzerland for a vacation.however,when they got to frankfurt,germany,they changed planes not for switzerland,but for india.they arrived in india on august.less than a week later,on august,husband filed for divorce in an indian court.three days later,on august,husband filed a petition for custody of in the indian court and an application to restrain wife from leaving india with husband then returned alone to new york.
according to wife,husband abandoned wife and in new delhi without financial support,taking with him wife united states residency documents,her indian passport,and united states passport.wife tried to obtain replacement documents to allow her return to the united states with s.when wife tried to obtain a replacement passport for,husband refused to sign the necessary consent for purposes relating to certain pending court proceedings.wife was able to temporarily return to the united states in to work on her own immigration papers and request passport.she then rejoined her daughter in india in march.new united states passport was eventually issued on september.wife and were able to leave india on november.they flew to new york and then a few days later flew to california where they took up residence.
husband denied he abandoned wife and in india.he declared it was understood they were going to vacation there,but that wife continued tantrums,threats,and cruel behavior compelled him to file for divorce shortly after their arrival.he claimed he voluntarily left with wife while the divorce and custody proceedings were pending,after making provisions for their support.he denied taking wife or passports or documents.he claimed wife had property and family in new delhi.he contended wife was legally required to stay in india while the divorce and custody proceedings were pending there.
the divorce and custody proceedings in india,started by husband in august,continued with husband and wife both flinging accusations of mistreatment,abuse,lies,threats,neglect,misrepresentations,and fraud against each other.wife apparently filed a dowry action against husband.husband sought to change his divorce petition to an annulment proceeding based on allegations that wife fraudulently induced their marriage on a false representation of her educational background.on application by wife,the indian trial court entered an order in may requiring husband to pay child and spousal support.the record contains evidence of husband paying only two months of the ordered support.the indian court did not enter any order restraining wife or from leaving the jurisdiction and the statute referenced by husband as barring wife leaving applied only where a guardian was appointed,which had not occurred.
on january,wife filed,in the sacramento county superior court,a petition for child custody and support,including a request for child abduction prevention orders.
husband filed a motion to quash jurisdiction premised on the grounds that india has jurisdiction of the custody proceedings for and wife illegally kidnapped to come to california,did not have minimum contacts with california,husband did not have minimum contacts with california,and that husband did not cause an effect in california.
wife opposed husband motion to quash,denying husband factual contentions and claiming she did not violate indian law or any indian court order by moving back to the united states when she was able to do so,that she never intended to go to india or stay there,that her presence in india was not voluntary,and that she was now lawfully living in california with the permission of the indian government.wife argued personal jurisdiction over husband was not necessary for a custody determination under the uccjea,that the indian proceedings did not preempt exercise of california jurisdiction,and that california could exercise jurisdiction premised either on california being home state or on there being no home state and significant connection with california.wife stated in november she came to sacramento where her brother lives and works and is able to give her and considerable moral support.she is working here and is receiving temporary assistance to needy families tanf.
while husband motion to quash was pending in sacramento,the court in india dismissed the application of husband for an order staying the proceedings in california,finding it did not have jurisdiction over a california court.the indian court denied husband request for an interim custody order,but the issue of custody remained pending in the indian court.
after argument and supplemental briefing,the trial court filed a ruling on submitted matter,granting husband motion to quash.in pertinent part,the ruling stated in this case,the divorce case commenced in india,one week after wife and arrived there.thus,india was not the home state under the uccjea for purposed sic of the proceeding in delhi.at the time home state was new york.this action was filed on january.at the time had resided in india for a year and thus under the statutory definition india was the home state for purposes of the uccjea t he court in india has not declined to exercise its jurisdiction and may in fact do so on august the date set for hearing in the indian court,which according to the parties has since been continued.the uccjea is clear,at this time absent an order from the delhi court declining jurisdiction in favor of california,this court does not have jurisdiction under the uccjea.
discussion 
it is in california that the uccjea is the exclusive method of determining subject matter jurisdiction in custody disputes involving other jurisdictions.in re stephanie cal th,d,in re th,d in re th,d,subd.b.the uccjea applies to international custody disputes as well as interstate disputes.in re stephanie,supra,at,d,in re,supra,at,d.under the act,foreign countries are to be treated as states for the purpose of determining jurisdiction,unless the child custody law of the country violates fundamental principles of human rights,subds.a,b and c.nothing in the record suggests the custody law of india in any way violates principles of human rights.
although there is some conflict in the parties version of events in this case,the relevant jurisdictional facts are largely undisputed.we are not bound by the trial court findings regarding subject matter jurisdiction,but rather independently reweigh the jurisdictional facts.citation.s ubject matter jurisdiction either exists or does not exist at the time the action is commenced citation and can not be conferred by stipulation,consent,waiver,or estoppel citations.in re,supra,th at,d guardianship of ariana th,d where evidence is not in dispute,de novo review applies.the action is commenced when the first pleading is filed,subd.e in re marriage of torres th,d here,january.
the first issue we address is whether the trial court was precluded from exercising jurisdiction due to the pendency of the custody proceedings in india.husband admits he filed for custody in india before the family had been in the country for six months,which would have been a requirement under the uccjea for home state jurisdiction,but claims his action came within the jurisdictional requirements of indian law and that the proceeding in india preclud
