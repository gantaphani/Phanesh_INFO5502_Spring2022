american airlines appeals the judgment and verdict in favor of anna lloyd in this litigation case.we affirm in part,reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.
background 
on june,american airlines flight crashed on the runway at little rock airport in little rock,arkansas.the pilot and ten passengers died as a result of the accident.anna lloyd was a passenger on this flight,returning from a trip to germany and austria with a group of college singers from ouachita baptist university.this incident spawned several lawsuits,and the judicial panel on litigation consolidated the cases and transferred them to the eastern district of arkansas.because lloyd was an international passenger,she sued american under the warsaw convention for the unification of certain rules relating to international transportation by air,stat,reprinted in note the warsaw convention.prior to trial,american moved for leave to file a complaint against the united states for contribution in all cases arising out of the air crash,both domestic and international.the district court granted the motion with regard to the domestic cases,but denied the motion for international cases.the district court ruled that because american signed a series of international air transport association iata intercarrier agreements it was liable to the passenger in contract,not in tort,and therefore could not be a joint tortfeasor.
at trial,lloyd testimony about the accident and her recovery revealed the following facts.lloyd was seated near the back of the airplane at the time of the crash,and her leg was punctured and scraped by the bolts from an airplane seat.she also suffered traumatic quadriceps tendinitis when other seats fell on her knees.lloyd was treated for these injuries and smoke inhalation,and released from the hospital on the same night as the crash.lloyd later saw two doctors concerning her knee injuries and underwent physical therapy for three to four weeks.
following the accident,lloyd spent the remainder of the summer with a friend in texarkana,which is what she had planned to do before the accident,and worked with young children.the next fall,lloyd returned to ouachita and continued her studies toward becoming a music teacher.she testified that she was anxious and nervous that semester and struggled to get good grades.however,her cumulative grade point average for the fall semester was higher than her grade point average before the accident.further,between the time of the accident and trial,lloyd had traveled on three more trips with the ouachita singers.at the time of trial,lloyd continued to suffer from flashbacks and panic attacks.
lloyd scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist,harris,in march.prior to that appointment,harris referred lloyd to a psychological examiner,vanblaricom,for testing.vanblaricom performed psychological assessment tests and provided the results to harris,who then diagnosed lloyd as suffering from post traumatic stress disorder ptsd and a major depressive disorder.harris also served as one of lloyd experts at trial.harris testified that lloyd personality traits made her susceptible to ptsd,and that the condition was caused by lloyd experiences during the airplane crash.harris stated that the physical injuries to lloyd legs were a factor in her ptsd and depression,but later testified that these conditions were not necessarily caused by her knee injuries,stating,i think it was so horrible on that flight,she thought she was going to die,i think she would have had ptsd without the knee injury.
harris also testified that lloyd had a physical injury to her brain due to her chronic ptsd.he referred to academic articles on this subject,which state that the hypothalamus and limbic system in the brain of people with ptsd function abnormally.however,harris did not testify that lloyd hypothalamus and limbic system functioned abnormally,and he also admitted that he did not perform available tests which could have determined if lloyd suffered from any such abnormalities.rather,harris merely stated that lloyd brain was not functioning normally as evidenced by lack of sleep and concentration,as well as the flashbacks.
charles fuller,a professor of music at ouachita,testified on lloyd behalf.fuller testified that lloyd had a very low chance of completing student teaching and becoming a music teacher.fuller stated that following the accident,lloyd lacked the ability to focus on schoolwork however,he also admitted that lloyd successfully completed full course loads in the two semesters following the accident.furthermore,fuller related that while lloyd had dropped classes in the fall semester,she did not need a full course load to complete her degree,and that she would be eligible to begin student teaching once she completed the course she was then taking.
american psychiatric expert,eth,examined lloyd and her medical records and testified that with proper treatment,lloyd prognosis was quite good.finally,lloyd economic expert testified that her maximum economic losses,including future medical expenses and income loss due to her inability to attain a teaching certificate and become a music teacher,were.
at the close of the evidence,american made a motion for judgment as a matter of law to strike the claims for mental injuries and argued that under eastern airlines,floyd,d,such injuries were not recoverable under the warsaw convention.the district court denied this motion and also denied a motion for new trial.in re air crash at little rock,on june,d.
the jury returned a million verdict in favor of lloyd.american appeals,and argues that the verdict bears no reasonable relationship to lloyd injuries,is grossly excessive as a matter of law,and shocks the conscience.american also argues the district court improperly admitted lay and opinion testimony,and finally,that the district court improperly precluded it from joining the united states as a tortfeasor for contribution.the united states has filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of american on this final point

iii.discussion 
recovery for mental injuries 
american argues,as indicated,that the verdict was excessive as a matter of law and that the evidence established at trial does not support an award of million.american also argues that mental injury damages are not recoverable at all under the warsaw convention,or in the alternative,that if they are recoverable,they are recoverable only to the extent that they flow from physical injuries.under either scenario,according to american,a million verdict is excessive.
in floyd,the court held that mental injuries,unaccompanied by physical injuries,were not compensable under the warsaw convention.the court expressly left open the question of whether mental injuries accompanied by physical injuries were recoverable under the convention.at.
the aftermath of floyd has led to a split of authority on the issue of when,if ever,to allow recovery for mental injuries.very few,if any,courts have taken the primary stance that american emotional injuries are not recoverable at all under the warsaw convention.see,jack trans world airlines,rejecting approach of allowing no recovery at all for mental injuries because that approach is too restrictive of passengers rights.and in fact,the case american cites for this proposition,turturro continental airlines,d,does not support this rigid theory.instead,the turturro court merely held that the plaintiff could not recover for physical manifestations of her emotional damages.id.at.
the more mainstream view,and widely attributed to the decision of the northern district of california in jack,is that recovery for mental injuries is permitted only to the extent the distress is caused by the physical injuries sustained.at.in jack,trans world airlines flight attempted to depart from new york jfk,but experienced an aborted takeoff,crash and fire on the runway,injuring three international passengers.in making its determination as to which damages should be recoverable,the court interpreted article of the warsaw convention and the floyd decision.the court evaluated several possible approaches to emotional distress in a convention case,ranging from no recovery at all to recovery only for distress flowing from the bodily injury.id.at.
the jack court concluded the flowing from approach was best,reasoning that it would prevent inequities among the passengers,such that t he happenstance of getting scratched on the way down the evacuation slide did not enable one passenger to obtain a substantially greater recovery than that of an unscratched who was equally terrified by the plane crash.id.at.under this approach,a plaintiff can not recover for the emotional distress arising from the accident itself.id.this approach has been utilized by several lower courts which have considered the issue.see alvarez american airlines,at,airline not liable because the emotional injuries were not proximately caused by physical injuries suffered during the accident wencelius air france,no.sacv,wl,same longo air france,cv,wl,at july,same.in re inflight explosion on trans world airlines.aircraft approaching athens,greece on april,passenger injured in an explosion and then ejected from plane in could recover for his conscious pain and suffering,rev on other grounds sub nom.ospina trans world airlines,cir burnett trans world airlines,damages for mental anguish directly resulting from a bodily injury were recoverable rosman trans world airlines,holding that under warsaw convention,only damages which flowed from bodily injury are compensable.
on the other hand,some courts have permitted full recovery for mental injuries,provided only that there are some physical injuries as well,even unrelated,which serve as a threshold to recovery for psychological injuries.see in re aircrash disaster near roselawn,on,permitting recovery for fear when the impact resulted in physical injury and death chendrimada,denying motion to dismiss plaintiffs claim for compensation for mental injuries when the plaintiff also alleged physical injuries,including nausea and cramps.
the district court followed the roselawn approach and ruled that a physical injury was simply a prerequisite to full recovery for mental injury.once a physical injury was established,all of lloyd mental injuries were deemed compensable.d at.
we disagree with this approach,and hold that damages for mental injury must proximately flow from physical injuries caused by the accident.this approach is consistent with floyd,yet provides full compensation for the victim within the bounds established by the warsaw convention.if the emotional damages flow from,or are caused by,physical injuries,the physical injuries will not be fully compensated if we do not allow recovery for this aspect of the harm.however,allowing a physical injury,no matter how minor or unrelated,to trigger recovery of any and all mental injuries would violate both the letter and spirit of floyd.thus,the district court ruling that a showing of any physical injury is sufficient to trigger recovery for all emotional damages,regardless of the causal connection between the two,is reversed.
the district court also ruled,in the alternative,that lloyd adequately established a nexus between her physical injuries and her mental injuries sufficient to justify a million verdict.d at.again,we disagree.lloyd suffered smoke inhalation and fairly deep cuts to her lower legs,both injuries for which she was treated and released from a little rock hospital the same night as the crash.she also suffered injuries to her quadriceps that required physical therapy for a month or so.lloyd mental injuries are,as indicated,ptsd and depression.
while we agree that the physical injuries to lloyd legs may have caused some of her emotional damages,we also agree with american contention that lloyd physical injuries did not cause ptsd sufficient to sustain the principal component of an award of.appellant brief at.instead,in accordance with the flowing from rule we announce today,we find that lloyd can recover only emotional damages which flow from the injuries to her legs and the smoke inhalation.in this regard,the evidence shows that the bulk of lloyd mental injuries did not result from these physical injuries.first,lloyd testified in a deposition that her knee injuries did not cause her ptsd.second,her expert witness,harris,testified that the experience of being in the crash was the cause of lloyd mental injuries.when asked,on,whether lloyd would have suffered ptsd if she had not injured her legs,harris replied,yes.i think it was so horrible on that flight,she thought she was going to die,i think she would have had it without the knee injury.finally,the district court reasoning suggests that it also believed the accident,and not the physical injuries,caused lloyd ptsd,stating,the knee and calf injuries,the smoke inhalation,were all part of a terrifying accident,which led to lloyd ptsd.d at.
therefore,under the floyd interpretation of the warsaw convention,we must draw a line between mental injuries flowing from physical injuries suffered in the crash and mental injuries directly caused by the accident.at the bottom line,lloyd evidence at trial was simply not sufficient to establish a million connection between her relatively insignificant physical injuries and her very significant ptsd and depression.
finally,the district court offered a second alternative lloyd ptsd was actually a physical injury within the meaning of the warsaw convention.d at.in so concluding,the district court credited harris testimony that people with chronic ptsd may have brain dysfunction,meaning that ptsd is both biological and psychological.id.according to the district court,under this theory,lloyd suffered a physical her brain.however,there is no contention that lloyd suffered a head injury of any kind in the crash.indeed,it is uncontroverted that her only physical injuries as a result of the accident came from leg trauma and smoke inhalation.
we reject this second alternative theory for two reasons.first,as discussed further in section b,we note there is a complete lack of proof that lloyd actually suffers from physical changes to her brain as a result of chronic ptsd.lloyd was not given a magnetic resonance spectroscopy,a positron emission tomography pet scan or a single positron emission computed tomography spect scan,all tests which harris testified could have been utilized to show the functioning of lloyd brain.her blood was not tested for elevated levels of cortisol or other hormones,which could also have indicated a dysfunctioning hypothalamus or thyroid.the only evidence that lloyd brain actually underwent a physical change was harris otherwise unsupported opinion that it did.harris based this opinion on lloyd symptoms of disrupted sleep and concentration,and flashbacks.we find that this testimony was not adequate,as a matter of law,to establish a physical change to lloyd brain.
further,if lloyd elects to proceed to a new trial and is subsequently able to prove that she does have a physical injury to her brain,we hold that subsequent physical manifestations of earlier emotional injury are not compensable under the warsaw convention.two other circuit courts which have considered this issue are in accord with our decision.see carey united airlines,cir terrafranca virgin atlantic airways,cir 
the terrafranca court considered whether the plaintiff weight loss was compensable under the warsaw convention as a physical manifestation of mental injury.the court examined floyd and concluded that dicta in the final section of the opinion did not authorize this theory of recovery.the terrafranca court underscored the requirement of direct causation between the accident and the physical injury,stating,w e therefore hold that plaintiff must demonstrate direct,concrete,bodily injury as opposed to mere manifestation of fear or anxiety.at.
in carey,the plaintiff physical manifestations of mental injury consisted of sleeplessness,nausea,cramps and perspiration.the court reasoned that it would undermine floyd to allow recovery for physical manifestations of emotional distress injuries,stating,a s a practical matter,floyd would thus be converted into an easily satisfied pleading formality,and a back door would be impermissibly opened to recovery for purely psychological injuries so long as plaintiff could allege nausea and the like.at quoting alvarez,wl,at.
floyd draws a clear line between physical injuries and mental injuries.once recovery is allowed for a physical manifestation of a mental injury,the distinction becomes blurred and under our reading of floyd,this approach is disallowed.accordingly,we agree with the reasoning in carey and terrafranca and reverse the district court second alternative holding that lloyd ptsd and purported physical changes to her brain were compensable under the warsaw convention.
in sum,our holding today is that emotional damages are recoverable under the convention to the extent that they are caused by physical injuries suffered in the accident.on the other hand,physical manifestation of mental injuries such as weight loss,sleeplessness,or physical changes in the brain resulting from chronic ptsd are not compensable under the treaty.finally,the evidence at trial of the physical injuries lloyd suffered and of the emotional injuries which were caused by those physical injuries,was not sufficient to sustain a million verdict.
clearly lloyd suffered compensable physical injuries and it is equally clear that some of her emotional trauma can be fairly traced to those injuries,albeit much less than would account for the million award.although not long in duration,the trial of this case was obviously stressful given lloyd emotional condition.accordingly,we are reluctant to order a new trial without permitting the acceptance of a remittitur in lieu of another adversary proceeding.
an appellate court may condition affirmance upon the plaintiff acceptance of a remittitur,and there is a somewhat lengthy history of the practice in this circuit.see hale firestone tire rubber,cir million punitive damages award remitted to million rather than ordering a fourth new trial hollins powell,cir compensatory and punitive damages awards under section remitted or plaintiffs were free to retry the issue of damages before another jury everett parks,cir though defendant had unsuccessfully moved trial court for a remittitur a n appellate court may itself order a new trial unless the plaintiff consents to a remittitur in a specific amount citing charles wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at united states acres of land,more or less,situate in polk county,cir commission award based on erroneous use of income capitalization method remitted to conserve judicial resources for complex,lengthy litigation stineman fontbonne,cir personal injury award for the loss of an eye during a college softball game remitted to where medical bills did not exceed,and jury award grossly exceed ed the damages proven at trial arnott american oil,cir verdict in antitrust case remitted to kropp ziebarth,cir per curiam in light of the case complexity,the large record,and the length of time that had transpired since the events in question,court offered remittitur option rather than ordering a new trial where evidence of damages at prior trial was duplicative.
in light of the amount of time that has passed since the accident in june,and because this was one of several cases on the litigation docket,instead of ordering a new trial on damages,we offer lloyd the option of accepting a remittitur for a final judgment of million.we find that number more in line with the evidence presented at trial,including that from lloyd own experts.if lloyd is not agreeable to a remittitur of this amount,we reverse and remand for a new trial.
evidentiary rulings 
in the event that lloyd does not accept the remittitur and proceeds to a new trial,we address american assignments of evidentiary error regarding the testimony of harris and fuller.
american challenges the testimony of lloyd expert,harris,that lloyd ptsd was actually a biological syndrome,rather than merely a psychological one.harris testified that researchers have shown brain dysfunction in people who have chronic ptsd and based his opinion that lloyd had brain dysfunction on this outside research.harris testified that there were functional tests that would show physiological changes in the brain,but admitted that he did not perform any of these tests on lloyd.at trial,american made a motion to exclude harris testimony on brain function and ptsd because he was not a neurosurgeon,because he did not perform the functional tests on lloyd,and because the theory that ptsd results in physical changes to the brain is not a recognized psychiatric concept.the district court denied the motion.lloyd argues that american request for a daubert hearing was untimely and that american did not preserve the issue for appeal since it failed to renew its objection during harris trial testimony.
in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,the supreme court detailed the rule standard for admission of scientific evidence.daubert offers general criteria for assessing the reliability of scientific evidence,and directs the district court to perform a gatekeeping function with respect to such evidence to ensure that evidence submitted to the jury meets rule criteria for relevance and reliability.id.at.the rule concern with scientific knowledge bottoms on issues of reliability,while the requirement that the evidence assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue is a relevance test.id.
daubert demands an assessment of whether the expert methodology has been tested,and an inquiry into whether the technique has been subjected to peer review and publication,has a known or knowable rate of error,and has been generally accepted in the proper scientific community.bonner,at.we recognize that the district court has considerable latitude in determining whether expert testimony will assist the trier of fact and be reliable,and it may consider one or all of the daubert factors in making this determination.united states larry reed sons,cir.
of american three objections to harris testimony,only the physical changes to the brain resulting from ptsd is not recognized in the psychiatric raised a daubert issue.unfortunately,the district court does not appear to have considered any of the daubert factors in addressing this objection.the district court merely noted that harris was a qualified psychiatrist,and then stated it beyond my competence.i do know whether what he says is true or not or what he says in the deposition,that there is research material that shows brain changes as a result of this syndrome.tr.at.this inquiry was not adequate to satisfy the district court essential gatekeeping role under daubert.however,lloyd point that american requested the daubert hearing too late in the game is.during the hearing on the motion,which was held prior to lloyd testimony on the second day of trial,the district court noted that in prior cases where daubert was raised,we have had extensive depositions taken on the issue and have had hearings.now,this thing is sprung on me right before the man is to testify.i think that a little bit late in the day to raise this particular issue.tr.we agree with the district court that when reasonably possible,daubert issues should be raised prior to trial and that ideally the daubert hearing should not be conducted following a morning recess shortly before the expert is scheduled to testify.
however,american second objection to harris there was an inadequate nexus shown between the scientific theory and any physical condition in lloyd the day.see weisgram marley,cir expert testimony not reliable where there was lack of ne
