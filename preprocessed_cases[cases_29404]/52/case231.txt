this appeal challenges the district court dismissal of an action brought by a purported class of vietnamese nationals plaintiffs on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated for injuries allegedly sustained by their exposure to agent orange and other herbicides manufactured by united states companies collectively,defendants and deployed by the united states military during the vietnam war.plaintiffs brought this action seeking relief under the alien tort statute,which grants the district courts jurisdiction over any civil action by an alien claiming damages for a tort committed in violation of international law or a treaty of the united states.in their complaint,plaintiffs alleged that the united states government violated international law by spraying toxic herbicides in areas of south vietnam from to and that defendants either aided and abetted the government violations by supplying it with agent orange or that they were directly liable in their corporate capacities.plaintiffs also asserted claims grounded in domestic tort law.in connection with their alleged injuries,plaintiffs sought money damages as well as injunctive relief in the form of environmental abatement,and disgorgement of profits.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.in their motion,defendants contended that the complaint failed to state a claim under the alien tort statute because it did not allege a violation of any and rule of international law as required by sosa,d.defendants also argued that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring suit,that their claims under the alien tort statute were nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine,and that all of their claims were barred by the defense.in addition,defendants moved for partial summary judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure to dismiss all claims as barred by the applicable statute of limitations.in the course of the proceedings below,the united states government submitted a statement of interest supporting defendants position with respect to the issues of international law and on the questions of justiciability and the defense.
the district court made several rulings that were favorable to plaintiffs,but it ultimately determined that plaintiffs had failed to allege a violation of international law because agent orange was used to protect united states troops against ambush and not as a weapon of war against human populations.the district court also determined that plaintiffs domestic tort law claims were barred by the defense,which the court previously had found to bar similar claims brought by united states veterans against some of the same defendants named as in the companion appeal decided herewith.accordingly,the court denied plaintiffs claims for relief under both international and domestic law and granted defendants motion dismissing the complaint.because we agree with the conclusions reached by the district court in this case,we affirm the judgment for the reasons set forth in this opinion.
background 
united states authorization of herbicide use in vietnam 
early in the vietnam conflict,the united states government began exploring the possibility of using herbicides to deprive enemy forces infiltrating south vietnam of the benefit of vegetation that provided them with cover and sustenance.in late,the united states department of state and the department of defense recommended to president kennedy that the military initiate a defoliation program.president kennedy soon accepted that recommendation and,in november,approved the launch of military herbicide operations in vietnam.operation trail dust,as the entire herbicide operation was called,included the united states air force program known as operation ranch hand,which commenced its defoliation spray missions in september missions targeting crops that sustained enemy forces commenced in november of that same year.
herbicides were effective in meeting important united states and allied military objectives in vietnam.as assistant secretary of defense william lemos explained o ne of the most difficult problems of military operations in south vietnam is the inability to observe the enemy in the dense forest and jungle.after summarizing the military herbicide operations,admiral lemos then concluded the result is that our forces have been better able to accomplish their mission with significantly reduced and vietnamese casualties.another assistant secretary later explained that the use of herbicides in vietnam was appropriate and had one s ave the lives of americans and our allies.the record in this case reveals that the policy of the department of defense at that time was to carefully select crop destruction targets so as to attack only those crops known to be grown by or from the viet cong or north vietnamese army,and the department ha d issued instructions to the joint chiefs of staff to reemphasize the already existing policy that chemical herbicides be utilized only in areas remote from population.admiral lemos also stressed that the military had instituted policies intended to ensure that the herbicides were applied only to targets of military significance.
the herbicide program nevertheless was controversial,as recognized it would be from the outset.but despite concerns that communist propaganda would characterize the program as a form of germ or chemical warfare,policymakers persisted in the decision to use herbicides in light of their substantial military benefits.they also consistently concluded that the military use of herbicides in vietnam was permissible under existing treaties and customary international law.secretary of state dean rusk advised president kennedy in that the use of defoliant does not violate any rule of international law concerning the conduct of chemical warfare and is an accepted tactic of war.in,the united states faced a move in the united nations general assembly to resolve whether the geneva protocol,see geneva protocol for the prohibition of the use in war of asphyxiating poisonous or other gases and of bacteriological methods of warfare,june,entered into force,for the united states,the geneva protocol,banned at least some herbicide use in warfare.the united states delegation rejected that interpretation,claiming that c hemical herbicides which were unknown in,could not be included within the scope of the prohibitions.thus,the united states voted against the resolution.in,when president nixon transmitted the geneva protocol to the senate for ratification,secretary of state william pierce rogers reiterated that i t is the united states understanding of the protocol that it does not prohibit the use in war of chemical herbicides.and in,when president ford issued executive order renouncing,as a matter of national policy,first use of herbicides in war,his accompanying remarks confirmed the consistent position of the united states that the geneva protocol does not cover chemical herbicides.
congress was well aware of the herbicide program,and while it denied funds for certain military initiatives in southeast asia of which it disapproved,it never denied funding for herbicides.instead,it affirmatively ratified herbicide use by appropriating funds specifically for herbicide procurement,and attempts by members of congress to terminate or constrain the herbicide program failed by wide margins.see,at.during the senate debate over the military procurement authorization act of,united states senators gaylord nelson and charles goodell introduced an amendment to prohibit the expenditure of funds for any military application of chemicals or for the transfer of chemicals for use by other countries.the full senate rejected this measure by a vote of.another amendment sought to prohibit the expenditure of funds for the use of chemicals for crop destruction,and that amendment was rejected by a vote of.thus,while keenly aware of arguments against the military use of herbicides in vietnam,congress continued to appropriate the funds necessary to sustain the program.see cong.rec.
congress likewise was aware of the controversy over the legality of the use by the united states of herbicides in vietnam.indeed,a congressional report observed that,although it was highly desirable that the united states adhere to the geneva protocol,such adherence could be difficult to attain if it would require acceptance of the view that the use of herbicides would violate international law,a position the united states had consistently rejected.see report of the subcomm.on national security,warfare policies international effectt,comm.print.even after the united states terminated the use of herbicides,the government continued to maintain that the geneva protocol did not prohibit the use of herbicides in war.when president nixon submitted the protocol to the senate for its advice and consent,secretary of state rogers explained to the senate that the united states had decided not to enter a reservation that would preserve its ability to use herbicides,precisely because the united states position remained that the protocol did not prohibit the use in war of chemical herbicides,letter of submittal from secretary of state william rogers to the president.see the geneva protocol of hearings before the comm.on foreign relations,cong.
ii.adjustments with vietnam 
the paris peace accords of january ended the united states participation in the vietnam war.after the fall of saigon in,the united states severed relations with vietnam and imposed a trade embargo prohibiting most commercial transactions between united states nationals and vietnamese nationals.see.president clinton partially lifted the trade embargo in february,and he fully lifted it in march.on january,the united states and vietnam agreed to a settlement of certain outstanding claims between the countries.this agreement covers all claims against either nation arising out of the nationalization,expropriation,or taking of,or other measures directed against,properties,rights,and interests of the parties and their citizens during and after the war.significantly,the agreement makes no provision for reparations or restitution to settle claims arising out of the use by the united states of herbicides,including agent orange.
the united states and vietnam continue to discuss issues arising out of the war in the context of their current diplomatic,economic,trade,aid,and security relationships a memorandum of understanding provides for scientists representing both governments to work together to determine the effects,if any,of agent orange on people and ecosystems,along with methods and costs of treatment and environmental remediation.but,to date,the united states never has agreed that it has a legal duty to provide funds or assistance to remediate harms allegedly caused by agent orange.
iii.procurement of agent orange 
the facts relevant to the manufacture and procurement of agent orange are the principal focus of the appeals in the veterans cases especially with regard to the defense and are set forth in this court opinion resolving the veterans claims before this court.with respect to the instant appeals by vietnamese nationals,a brief summary of the facts surrounding the veterans appeals and additional relevant facts underlying the vietnamese nationals claims follows.
the herbicidal properties of the components of agent orange,acid and acid,were identified in research conducted by the united states military during the.in the,the military conducted field tests to demonstrate the feasibility of dispensing those substances from aircraft these dissemination trials,and work on aerial spray systems,laid the groundwork for the defoliation systems used in vietnam.in,the advanced research projects agency of the department of defense evaluated the feasibility of defoliating tropical vegetation in vietnam and recommended that appropriate formulations of and be exploited for immediate use.in january,the united states air force began the operational phase of the defoliation program in south vietnam,using a substance agent purple.later in,a research team concluded that a mixture of and was most formulation became known as agent orange.see in re agent orange prod.liab,d.
formal specifications for and were prepared and promulgated by the military.these specifications established the design and specific characteristics of the mixture of and that the government had requested.the same specifications also were later used as the basis for the military procurement of agent orange.the government supplied manufacturers with copies of these specifications and incorporated them into the manufacturers agent orange contracts.the government also strictly prescribed the markings that were to be placed on the drums of herbicides manufactured by the defendants.the names of the various agents agent orange,agent purple,refer to the band that the government required on the outside of the drums containing the relevant herbicide.aside from that colored band,the government generally prohibited the manufacturers from including any language,markings,or identification on the drums.id.
in,the government became concerned that the pace of production of agent orange was insufficient to meet its projected needs and decided instead to compel production from the manufacturers.in so doing,the government acted under the authority of the defense production act of dpa.supp.section of the dpa authorized the president to require that performance under contracts or orders which he deems necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense shall take priority over performance under any other contract or order,and,for the purpose of assuring such priority,to require acceptance and performance of such contracts or orders in preference to other contracts or orders.id.the president thereafter delegated that authority to the secretary of commerce.in march,the united states department of commerce,expressly invoking section of the dpa,directed defendants to accelerate the delivery of existing orders for the defoliant agent orange.this directive essentially commandeered all of the defendants capacity to produce agent orange.in re agent orange prod.liab,d at.
iv.end of the herbicide program 
in june,a government study on the health effects of pesticides,including known as the bionetics study,uncovered evidence of teratogenicity birth defects in mice.the completed bionetics study was delivered to the national cancer institute nci,a component of the national institutes of health,in september,although nci personnel previously had received progress reports concerning the possible teratogenicity of.the government undertook further extensive analyses of the bionetics study data in early,but it did not restrict the ongoing herbicide program in vietnam.however,upon the public release of the study in october,the government restricted the use of both in the united states on food crops and around the home and in vietnam,limiting its use to areas remote from human populations.on april,the department of defense suspended military use of agent orange upon evidence of the toxicity of the dioxin component.subsequently,herbicide spraying for defoliation using agent white continued a short while,and crop destruction using agents white and blue continued through.in january,the last spray mission took place.
nature of the complaint proceedings below 
plaintiffs in the instant action include individual vietnamese nationals residing in both north and south vietnam,as well as the vietnamese association for victims of agent orange vavao,a vietnamese,organization representing persons who were exposed to agent orange and other herbicides during the war and whose purpose is to protect the interests of its members and to raise funds for their care and treatment.plaintiffs brought this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated who sustained injuries as a result of their exposure to dioxin.as the district court enumerated in extensive detail below,plaintiffs alleged injuries included,among other things,miscarriages,birth defects,breast cancer,ovarian tumors,lung cancer,hodgkins disease,and prostate tumors.
plaintiffs alleged in their september,amended complaint that the united states military use of agent orange violated international,domestic,and vietnamese law and that defendants either aided and abetted these violations or committed independent violations by fulfilling the military demand for herbicides.with respect to their claims arising under international law,plaintiffs alleged that defendants actions constituted torts that were cognizable under the alien tort statute ats,and included war crimes,genocide,crimes against humanity,and torture.with respect to their claims arising under domestic and vietnamese tort law,plaintiffs alleged that defendants were liable for assault and battery,intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligent infliction of emotional distress,negligence,wrongful death,and unjust enrichment under the laws of the united states,vietnam,and the state of new york,and for strict product liability under the laws of the united states and the state of new york.plaintiffs also sought equitable relief under theories of public nuisance and unjust enrichment.in their prayer for relief,plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief directing defendants to provide environmental remediation of the allegedly contaminated areas in vietnam and to disgorge profits gained from their production and supply of herbicide.
on november,defendants filed several dispositive motions.they first moved under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under the ats.they further moved under rule for partial summary judgment dismissing all claims as.with respect to several threshold issues that applied to all international and domestic law claims,defendants argued that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this action and that plaintiffs had raised claims that were nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine,were,and were precluded by the defense.on the merits,defendants contended that plaintiffs failed to allege a violation of international law under the ats that would meet the standard set forth in sosa,d.defendants also asserted that any award of injunctive relief requiring remediation of the land in vietnam would be impracticable.on january,the united states government filed a statement of interest supporting defendants motion to dismiss the claims under the ats as nonjusticiable,as barred by the defense,and as insufficient to meet the sosa standard.
at a hearing before the district court,the parties agreed that the court could consider the motion under rule b as a motion for summary judgment against all of the domestic law claims but not against the international law claims.they also agreed that the extensive record assembled by both parties in the related veterans cases could be relied upon by the court on the summary judgment motions.on march,the district court issued an opinion and order,which was amended on march.in re agent orange prod.liab,d.in its order,the district court rejected defendants contentions and found in plaintiffs favor on a number of issues.initially,although the court cited rulings denying associational standing to pursue damages claims,it held that vavao had standing because it also sought injunctive relief.id.at.the court next rejected defendants position that plaintiffs claims were nonjusticiable,id.at,and it further determined that plaintiffs ats claims were not subject to any statutes of limitation,id.at,or the defense,id.at.moreover,the court concluded that corporations could be liable in a civil action brought under the ats for a violation of international law and that a claim for aiding and abetting liability was cognizable under the statute.id.at.
nevertheless,the district court ultimately determined that none of plaintiffs claims could proceed.with respect to the ats claims,the court concluded that plaintiffs had failed to state a cause of action because neither the military use of agent orange nor defendants agreement to supply it to the military violated a and international norm prohibiting the use of herbicides in war.see id.at the court concluded that plaintiffs domestic and vietnamese law claims were barred by the defense for the same reasons as set forth in the companion case brought by the veterans,isaacson dow chem,d.see in re agent orange prod.liab,d at.the court also denied plaintiffs claims for injunctive relief,concluding that implementing such relief would be wholly impracticable and could compromise vietnam sovereignty.see id.at.final judgment dismissing the complaint was entered on march,and this timely appeal by plaintiffs followed.
plaintiffs limit the scope of their appeal to three primary claims.they first contend that the district court erred by dismissing their ats claims,arguing that defendants violated customary international law norms prohibiting the use of poisoned weapons and the infliction of unnecessary suffering plaintiffs further argue that the court erred by dismissing their state law claims pursuant to the defense without conducting further discovery with respect to agents white and blue,and incorporate by reference the same substantive contentions raised in the veterans appeals.finally,plaintiffs assert that the court prematurely dismissed their claims for injunctive relief without the benefit of adequate discovery.
for their part,defendants contend that plaintiffs failed to state a cognizable claim under the ats because the wartime use of herbicides solely for defoliation purposes did not violate international law and that prudential considerations counsel against the recognition of plaintiffs claims.defendants also argue that the ats claims present nonjusticiable political questions because those claims require an inquiry into executive and legislative judgments relating to the prosecution of a war.in addition,defendants assert that there is no basis in international law for either corporate liability or civil aiding and abetting liability,and they argue that plaintiffs ats claims are barred by both the defense and the statute of limitations.defendants argue that plaintiffs state law claims are preempted by the federal foreign affairs power and the defense,and they incorporate by reference the same contentions raised in the veterans cases.defendants also argue that the district court properly denied injunctive relief because it would be impracticable for the court to supervise remediation of million acres of distant foreign land.finally,defendants argue that the district court acted within its discretion in denying additional discovery on plaintiffs claims relating to agent white and agent blue,because these claims fail for the same reasons as the claims based on agent orange and because plaintiffs had essentially abandoned these claims in the district court.

ii.plaintiffs international law claims 
alien tort statute and the sosa rule 
the ats provides that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.the ats confers federal subject matter jurisdiction when three independent conditions are satisfied an alien sues,for a tort,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty ratified by the united states.see filartiga,cir.the supreme court has clarified that the ats,which originally was enacted as part of the judiciary act of,was jurisdictional in that it gave the district courts cognizance of certain then existing causes of action.sosa,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the court was clear that the ats did not create a statutory cause of action,but the court just as clearly rejected the notion that the ats was stillborn because there could be no claim for relief without a further statute expressly authorizing adoption of causes of action.id.at.
in the broader context,the law of nations has become synonymous with the term customary international law,which describes the body of rules that nations in the international community universally abide by,or accede to,out of a sense of legal obligation and mutual concern.flores peru copper,cir.in ascertaining whether a rule constitutes a norm of customary international law,courts have traditionally consulted the works of jurists,writing professedly on public law or by the general usage and practice of nations or by judicial decisions recognizing and enforcing that law.filartiga,at quoting united states smith,wheat.sources of international law generally include 
a international conventions,whether general or particular,establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states 
b international custom,as evidence of a general practice accepted as law 
c the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations 
d judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations,as subsidiary means for the determination of the rules of law.
filartiga,at citing statute of the international court of justice,june,stat,entered into force,united states yousef,cir same also noting that scholarly works are not included among the authoritative sources of customary international law see also restatement third of the foreign relations law of the united states.while not exhaustive,the list of principles that may be said to have ripened into universally accepted norms of international law,kadic karadzic,includes the proscriptions against piracy,slave trade,attacks on or hijacking of aircraft,genocide,and war crimes,see restatement third of the foreign relations law of the united states.with respect to other types of violations,because customary international law is created by the general customs and practices of nations and therefore does not stem from any single,definitive,source,we have advised district courts to exercise extraordinary care and restraint in deciding whether an offense will violate a customary norm.flores,at.
in sosa,the supreme court further cautioned courts to be careful in deciding whether an alleged violation of the law of nations could support an ats claim.mindful of the legislative history,albeit sparse,of the ats,the court limited the types of claims that could be recognized under the statute to those bearing the same character as the claims originally contemplated by congress at the time of claims alleging violations of the law of nations of the sort that would have been recognized within the common law at the time of its enactment.at.in the court view,the statute was intended as jurisdictional in the sense of addressing the power of the courts to entertain cases concerned with a certain subject,id.at,and t he jurisdictional grant is best read as having been enacted on the understanding that the common law would provide a cause of action for the modest number of international law violations with a potential for personal liability at the time,id.at.in particular,sosa held that courts should require any claim based on the law of nations to rest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the paradigms that informed the legislation.id.at.moreover,these paradigms encompassed only those torts corresponding to blackstone three primary offenses violation of safe conducts,infringement of the rights of ambassadors,and piracy.id.at.although the court did not circumscribe ats claims to include only these offenses,it concluded that any claim must reflect the same degree of definite content and acceptance among civilized nations as these historical antecedents.id.at.whether an alleged norm of international law can form the basis of an ats claim will depend upon whether it is defined with a specificity comparable to these familiar paradigms and based upon a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world.id.at.we accordingly begin our evaluation of plaintiffs ats claims by considering whether they have alleged the violation of an international norm that is sufficiently clear in nature to support subject matter jurisdiction under the ats.
plaintiffs sources of customary international law 
in support of their argument that the deployment of agent orange violated customary norms prohibiting use of poisoned weapons and the infliction of unnecessary suffering,plaintiffs cite to a number of both domestic and international law sources.primarily,they rely upon the hague regulations,annex to the hague convention iv respecting the laws and customs of war on land,october,stat,the hague regulations the geneva protocol and the fourth geneva convention,the fourth geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war,august,the fourth geneva convention,as well as other sources derived from these documents.the hague regulations,which the united states ratified in,address the range of military operations executed on land and set forth the rules for conducting hostilities,including the permissible and impermissible means and methods of war,including poisonous weapons and the prohibition of materials calculated to cause unnecessary suffering.the hague regulations also form the basis of much of the language in the national military law handbooks of leading international states,including those of the united states.see dep t of the army,field manual the law of land warfare following the hague regulations article by article.by contrast,the fourth geneva convention,which the united states ratified in,principally addresses the treatment of noncombatants in the hands of enemy forces.as such,it is less relevant than the hague regulations.nevertheless,the parties do not dispute that these treaties,with the exception of the geneva protocol,were in force with respect to the united states during the time frame alleged in the complaint and that they have achieved the status of customary international law.
the united states did not ratify the geneva protocol until.accordingly,the protocol can not be said to have constituted a treaty of the united states,during the period relevant to this appeal.even at the time of ratification,the united states and other states reserved the right to respond in kind to a belligerent first use of poisonous weapons and further limited the treaty obligation to apply only against other treaty parties.the protocol provides t he use in war of asphyxiating,poisonous or other gases,and of all analogous liquids,materials or devices,has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilized world and shall be universally accepted as part of international law,binding alike the conscience and the practice of nations.given the nature and scope of the reservations to ratification,however,it would be an impermissible stretch to find that the geneva protocol had acquired the status of binding customary international law during the vietnam conflict.
in support of their argument that they have stated a claim cognizable under the ats for a violation of the proscription against the use of poisonous weapons,plaintiffs cite to the march letter opinion of major general myron cramer,judge advocate general cramer opinion,issued during the second world war in response to a request from the secretary of war.in particular,plaintiffs point to the opinion conclusion that 
the use of chemical agents to destroy cultivations sic or retard their growth,would not violate any rule of international law prohibiting poison gas upon condition,however,that such chemicals do not produce poisonous effects upon enemy personnel,either from direct contact,or indirectly from ingestion of plants and vegetables which have been exposed thereto.w hether such herbicides are toxic to such a degree as to poison an individual system,is a question of fact which should be definitely ascertained.
in addition,plaintiffs cite to the april,letter opinion of fred buzhardt buzhardt opinion from the office of general counsel for the department of defense,in response to a request from senator fulbright,chairman of the senate foreign relations committee.that opinion relates to the application of articles a and e of the hague regulations of were incorporated into the department of the army field the destruction of crops through chemical agents during the vietnam war 
n either the hague regulations nor the rules of customary international law applicable to the conduct of war and to the weapons of war prohibit the use of antiplant chemicals for defoliation or the destruction of crops,provided that their use against crops does not cause such crops as food to be poisoned nor cause human beings to be poisoned by direct contact,and such use must not cause unnecessary destruction of enemy property.
in further support of their claim that the use of herbicides as poison violated international law,plaintiffs rely on the opinions of their experts,professors george fletcher and jordan paust,as well as the works of other international law scholars,who generally contend that the use of chemical or biological warfare violates international law.
in support of their claim that defendants violated the prohibition against unnecessary suffering,plaintiffs argue that the use of any material object that may have collateral consequences and is not necessary for military purposes is universally prohibited.in short,they contend that the use of agent orange was disproportionate to military necessity because it caused unnecessary human suffering.in particular,plaintiffs assert that articles and of the fourth geneva convention prohibit extensive destruction and appropriation of property,not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly if committed against protected persons or property.in addition,they argue that article of that convention lists as a grave breach the act of willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health.plaintiffs further contend that the nuremberg charter and the nuremberg principles prohibit war crimes namely,violations of the laws and customs of war,including murder,or deportation to slave labor or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory,murder or of prisoners of war or persons on the seas,killing of hostages,plunder of public or private property,wanton destruction of cities,towns or villages,or devastation not justified by military necessity.
whether plaintiffs claims are based on a international norm 
application of sosa to plaintiffs international law claims 
the sources of international law relied on by plaintiffs do not support a norm prohibiting the wartime use of agent orange that is defined with the degree of specificity required by sosa.although the herbicide campaign may have been controversial,the record before us supports the conclusion that agent orange was used as a defoliant and not as a poison designed for or targeting human populations.inasmuch as agent orange was intended for defoliation and for destruction of crops only,its use did not violate the international norms relied upon here,since those norms would not necessarily prohibit the deployment of materials that are only secondarily,and not intentionally,harmful to humans.in this respect,it is significant that plaintiffs nowhere allege that the government intended to harm human beings through its use of agent orange.in their amended complaint,plaintiffs recognize that t he stated purpose of the herbicide spraying was twofold a to defoliate forests and mangroves to destroy the vegetative cover used by the democratic republic of vietnam and national liberation front troops for concealment,and b to destroy crops to deprive them of food.in addition,plaintiffs acknowledge that the herbicide defoliation campaign heavily targeted,among other things,vegetative cover adjacent to military bases and surrounding areas,making it all the more implausible that the government intended to use the herbicide as a poisonous weapon during war.
there is lack of a consensus in the international community with respect to whether the proscription against poison would apply to defoliants that had possible unintended toxic side effects,as opposed to chemicals intended to kill combatants.the prohibition on the use of poison or poisoned weapons in article a of the hague regulations is certainly categorical,see stat,but its scope is nevertheless undefined and has remained so for a century.as the international court of justice icj has acknowledged in an authoritative interpretation of article a,that provision nowhere defines the critical term poison,and different interpretations exist on the issue.legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons,advisory opinion,july,nuclear weapons advisory opinion.indeed,plaintiffs own expert conceded that t he concept of poison is not defined.plaintiffs themselves concede that the authorities go both ways as to whether the use of herbicides in war,particularly to destroy crops not intended for use by enemy forces,did violate established norms of international law prior to.
plaintiffs ignore language from the cramer opinion that would permit the use of agent orange under the circumstances in which it was in fact used.notably,that opinion recognizes that a distinction exists between the employment of poisonous and deleterious gases against enemy human beings,and the use of chemical agents to destroy property,such as natural vegetation,crop cultivations,and the like.moreover,the cramer opinion concludes that t he proposed target of destruction,enemy crop cultivations,is a legitimate one,inasmuch as a belligerent is entitled to deprive the enemy of food and water,and to destroy his sources of supply whether in depots,in transit on land,or growing in his fields.the buzhardt opinion,as it relates to permissible uses of herbicides,notes that general cramer opinion clearly encompasses the activities that have taken place in vietnam and reflects the same position which we have taken in evaluating the legality of the destruction of crops through chemical agents and the application of the geneva protocol and the hague convention.
according to the buzhardt opinion,the prohibition of poisonous weapons does not effect any prohibition on the use of other weapons and,in particular,it does not prohibit the use of chemical herbicides for depriving the enemy of food and water.that opinion interprets the army field manual relied upon by plaintiffs to permit measures being taken to destroy,through chemical or bacterial agents harmless to man,crops intended solely for consumption by the armed forces if that fact can be determined but it draws a distinction between herbicides that are intended to destroy crops belonging to enemy soldiers and crops belonging to.the opinion further states as follows the thrust of the phrase harmless to man draws attention to article e of the hague regulations of,wherein combatants are forbidden to employ weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering.
in a further narrowing of the circumstances under which crop destruction is impermissible,the buzhardt opinion states 
where it can not be determined whether crops were intended solely for consumption by the enemy armed forces,crop destruction would be lawfu
