after a court trial held on september,the trial court found defendant dragisa lazarevich guilty of two counts of withholding a minor child and maliciously depriving the lawful custodian of her right to custody between january,and june,in violation of penal code section in the context of section,which is located in the child abduction chapter of our penal code,withholds means retains physical possession of a child whether or not the child resists or objects,subd.g.
the only issue presented in this appeal is whether california may assert criminal subject matter jurisdiction over defendant dragisa lazarevich conduct where the defendant,in violation of a court order of this state,harbored his children outside of this country and failed to return them to the custodial parent,their mother,who is a resident of california.in that regard,defendant contends international law forbids california from asserting subject matter jurisdiction for conduct occurring exclusively on foreign land,this prosecution violates due process because all conduct from to occurred outside the united states,and prosecuting him for conduct exclusively in another country interferes with the sole authority of the federal government to conduct foreign affairs.
for the reasons stated below,we conclude that defendant acts of harboring his children outside of california and failing to return them to the custodial parent in violation of a california custody order subjected defendant to prosecution in california and that the federal constitution does not place limits on criminal jurisdiction in california under the facts of the case before us.
