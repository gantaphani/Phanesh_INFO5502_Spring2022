this case involves two issues whether the plaintiff contracts with mexican customers in this case violated mexican law,and,if so,whether that illegality is a defense to the plaintiff claims.because we hold that the plaintiff contracts did not violate mexican law,we do not reach the second issue.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand the cause to that court to determine whether any other asserted ground supports the trial court order.
background 
in,the mexican government granted teléfonos de méxico telmex a exclusive concession to build,operate,and exploit public telephone service in mexico.in,the government amended the concession to facilitate the eventual transition to a competitive telecommunications market beginning in.
sbc communication sbc owns ten percent of telmex stock.sbc international sbi,a subsidiary of sbc,assists telmex with organization and development.the office of the secretary of communications and transportation sct is a mexican government administrative agency that oversees the country telecommunication services.mci,long distance international ldi,and star marketing services sms are united states telecommunications companies.
when calls originate from mexico to the united states,the call mexico leg is carried on telmex wires up to the border.the call united states leg is then picked up by a united states carrier line here,mci.because the call originates in mexico,telmex bills the mexican customer and reimburses mci for its carrying the call united states leg.when a call to mexico originates in the united states,this process is reversed,with mci billing the american customer and reimbursing telmex for the mexico leg.the carriers contractually set these settlement amounts.
in,telmex and several united states carriers,including mci,entered into agreements to provide international services.usually,calls are free to the caller and billed to the receiver.the agreement between mci and telmex established the billing amount for each leg of the calls and contained the monthly settlement amounts between the companies.
mci then entered into agreements with three different types of united states customers.the first category was end users.end users give their number acquired from mci to mexican callers who in turn call the end user on that number to purchase goods or services.rather than telmex billing the mexican caller,mci bills the end user for the entire cost and then reimburses telmex for the mexico leg.
the second category of mci united states customers included other phone companies such as ldi and sms,the plaintiffs here sms contracted with mci to receive numbers that sms supplied to ldi.ldi then contracted with mexican callers rather than american end users.under these contracts,ldi provided a mexican caller with an number linked to a texas switching station.when the number answered,the mexican caller received a dial tone allowing them to call another united states number.ldi would bill the mexican caller and pay mci through sms for the number use.mci would then reimburse telmex for the mexico leg.consequently,telmex only set the rate for the mexico leg.however,had the mexican customer called its united states destination directly,telmex could have set the mexican customer rate for the entire call.
the third category of mci united states customers included phone companies engaging in services.these companies also provided numbers acquired from mci to mexican callers.the numbers were linked to a system.so,when a mexican customer called the number,the call would not be answered,but the caller number was electronically recorded.then the mexican customer would receive a call back,which would provide the caller with a dial tone to call anywhere in the united states.as in the second category of mci customers,these american companies would bill the mexican caller directly.however,because the call originating in mexico was not answered,neither the caller nor the company would pay telmex for the unanswered call.instead,telmex was only reimbursed for the mexican leg of the call back,just as with any other call originating in the united states 
a dispute about the services first arose in.in october,jose maria rivas moncayo,a sct manager,wrote mci a letter stating that the scheme was illegal under mexican law and requesting that mci suspend service it provided to any customers engaged in this practice.in april,telmex sent mci a letter explaining that resale was illegal under mexican law and requesting a list of customers providing resale.telmex stated that it would then forward mci a list explaining who would be disconnected and when.mci responded a month later,requesting a copy of specific laws and regulations prohibiting resale.mci response also explained that it did not understand the definition of resale under mexican law.furthermore,mci refused to supply the customer list,asserting that this disclosure is illegal under united states law.in july,after consulting with sbi,telmex began disconnecting numbers it determined were being used for resale,including some numbers ldi acquired through sms contract with mci.
in,sued telmex and sbi for tortious interference with contractual relations,tortious interference with prospective relations,conspiracy to commit tortious interference,breach of contract,antitrust,and texas deceptive trade practices act violations.the trial court granted telmex and sbi summary judgment on all claims.the court of appeals affirmed,holding that because was violating mexican law,it could not maintain any of its claims.on identical facts,the fifth circuit recently reached the opposite result,concluding that conduct did not violate mexican law.access telecom,mci telecomms,cir,cert denied,d.
we granted petition for review to decide whether contracts violated mexican law,and,if so,whether that illegality would provide a defense to the plaintiff claims.because we determine that did not violate mexican law,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand to the court of appeals for it to consider whether any other asserted ground supports the trial court order.

b.the record 
both parties,complying with rule,requested that the trial court take judicial notice of certain provisions.both parties provided copies and translations of the concession empowering telmex to build,install,maintain,operate and exploit a public telephone network for a period of years,beginning march,throughout all the national territory,except the area under license to telefonos del noroeste,de this concession was modified on december.the pertinent sections of this modified version provide 
definition of terms 
user an individual or corporation with temporary or permanent access to a public or private telecommunication service.
telmex network resale capacity 
telmex is required to permit its users to resell excess capacity contracted with telmex except as provided in the following paragraph.
during the first six years of this franchise,telmex will not be obligated to permit the reselling of excess circuit capacity,to provide basic long distance telephonic public service.
modificación al título de concesión de teléfonos de méxico december,amended title of concession.telmex relies primarily upon chapter iii of the ley de vias generales de comunicación general means of communication law,which provides in pertinent part 
article.to construct,establish and exploit general routes of communications or any type of connected services,a concession or permit from the federal executive through the secretariat of communications shall be necessary and subject to the precepts of this law and its regulations.
article.concessions for the construction,establishment,or exploitation of general means of communication shall only be granted to mexican citizens or corporations constituted under the laws of the country 
article.those interested in obtaining a concession or permit to build or exploit general means of communication shall forward a request to the secretariat of communications 
article.a general means of communication should not be exploited that is the subject of a concession,or permit,nor its related services,without prior authorization 
ley de vias generales de comunicación,ch.iii.telmex also relies on correspondence among and within telmex,mci,scb,and the sct this includes 
an october letter from jose moncayo,a general manager with the sct,to mci stating that callback services are illegal in mexico,and in violation of the exclusivity provisions agreed to between the federal government and the telmex company.
an april letter from telmex to mci requesting the names of all its customers engaged in resale and stating that resale is prohibited in mexico at this time.further,since none of these resellers have permits or concessions to operate in mexico they are in violation of applicable telecommunications rules.there are only four authorized international carriers for traffic.they are at t,mci,sprint,and and they must transmit via telmex for these calls.all national calls are also to be sent via telmex for completion and billing to the mexican market.
a september letter from telmex to mci stating that telmex will not knowingly install for resale and will immediately terminate those services we find to be resale applications.
a letter from telmex to mci amending the terms of the contract between telmex and mci to reflect that subscribers to services can not offer or bypass services to mexican customers.
both parties also cite the reglamento de telecommunicaciones telecommunications rulings.notes that chapter ii,article requires a concession only to install,establish,operate,and exploit telecommunications networks.telmex references section iii,article,which provides that the exploitation of the telecommunications network given in concession must be carried out directly by its holder.
finally,both and telmex rely on expert testimony about the legality of contracts under mexican law.elvia salas de de stefano,an attorney and former assistant to the director general of the sct legal affairs,testified in her deposition that no mexican law expressly prohibited activities and thus that these activities were not illegal under mexican law.she also proffered an expert report opining that conduct was legal.
in response,telmex expert francisco xavier manzanero escutia proffered a report opining that,because telmex held the exclusive franchise to provide mexican phone service,conduct could not be legal under mexican law.telmex also presented several current and former scb and telmex employees depositions opining that conduct amounted to illegal reselling of services.
c.the parties contentions 
telmex argues,and the court of appeals agreed,that was operating as a mexican telecommunications provider.telmex asserts that mexican law prohibits any entity from exploiting international services without a concession.thus,because telmex held the exclusive concession until,telmex maintains that conduct could not have been legal.telmex also asserts that even if mci and are considered resellers,they still needed a mexican concession.it argues that a law requiring concessions to resell phone service only restated the existing law rather than creating a new law.see ley federal de communicaciònes,ch.iii,i,federal law of communication.finally,telmex urges us to defer to the sct fifth circuit amicus brief and rivas moncayo letter,written while he was general manager for the sct,condemning services.it asserts that the sct is entitled to agency deference and that moncayo letter applies to schemes and conduct equally.
in response,contends,as the fifth circuit concluded,that mexican law does not forbid the resale of telephone services.asserts that,in fact,the only relevant mexican law contemplates that resale is permitted,though not required.further,notes that the law requiring a concession to merely resell mexican phone service was not effective until after telmex forced out of business by disconnecting its phone lines.thus,asserts,just because resale without a concession later became illegal,that does not make its conduct retroactively unlawful.finally,contends that the moncayo letter is not entitled to deference because the letter only discussed services,something did not provide.moreover,argues,we should only defer to official mexican judicial,administrative,or legislative an employee opinion in a letter that contains no reference to specific law.
we must first determine whether was a reseller or provider of mexican telecommunications service.then we must determine whether any mexican law expressly prohibits the service it provided.
characterization of services reseller or provider 
telmex claims that provided phone service rather than resold phone service because the end result allowed mexican callers to call the united states for less money than telmex would have charged for a direct call.we disagree.the fifth circuit aptly explained why,regardless of the practical outcome of services,can not be considered the provider 
t he crucial difference between resellers and providers is that a reseller can not compete with a monopoly provider because the provider is the reseller only supplier.the reseller can only undersell the provider if the provider sells its services to the reseller for less than they are worth.that is not the same kind of competition a provider faces against another provider.competition between the provider and the reseller is at the mercy of the provider and the provider knowledge or ignorance of the market.
access telecom,at.in essence,acted as a middleman,delivering and billing telmex service to mexican customers.the relevant mexican law at the time required a government concession to construct,establish,and exploit telecommunications systems.we read this provision to mean that if had built its own telecommunications equipment and infrastructure and provided telecommunication service with its own equipment rather than purchasing and reselling telmex,then it would have needed a concession.
our conclusion that conduct is better characterized as resale is further bolstered by both telmex and the fcc characterization of this and similar services.telmex refers to as a reseller several places in the record.for example,telmex motion relies on its letter to mci requesting the names of all mci customers engaged in resale and stating that resale is illegal.telmex also relied on another letter to mci,in which telmex indicates that it will not knowingly install for resale.
the fcc has also characterized services,which are in many ways conceptually similar to services,as resa
