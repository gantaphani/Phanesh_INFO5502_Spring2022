at issue is whether the foreign sovereign immunities act,confers jurisdiction in the united states district court for the central district of california over the republic of austria and the austrian gallery in a suit alleging wrongful appropriation of six gustav klimt paintings from their rightful heirs.maria altmann,a united states citizen,seeks the recovery of the paintings from the republic of austria,which now houses them in the austrian gallery.she alleges that i the nazis took the paintings from her jewish uncle to aryanize them in violation of international law ii the war ii and wartime austrian government was complicit in their original takings iii the current government,when it learned of the heirs rights to the paintings,deceived the heirs as to the circumstances of its acquisition of the paintings and iv the republic and the gallery now wrongfully assert ownership over the paintings.the republic of austria appeals from the district court denial of its motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.rejecting the austrian republic assertions,the district court found,inter alia,that the fsia applied retroactively and generally to the events of the late and,and that the seizure of the paintings fell within the expropriation exception to the fsia grant of immunity.
for the reasons stated below,we determine that the exercise of jurisdiction in this case does not work an impermissible retroactive application of the fsia.if true,the facts alleged by altmann establish a taking in violation of international law that confers jurisdiction upon our federal courts,and thus altmann has presented a substantial and nonfrivolous claim.see siderman de blake republic of argentina,cir at the jurisdictional stage,we need not decide whether the taking actually violated international law as long as a claim is substantial and nonfrivolous,it provides a sufficient basis for the exercise of our jurisdiction.quoting west multibanco comermex,cir,cert.denied,d.because appellants profit from the klimt paintings in the united states,by authoring,promoting,and distributing books and other publications exploiting these very paintings,these actions are sufficient to constitute commercial activity for the purpose of satisfying the fsia,as well as the predicates for personal jurisdiction.finally,because the republic of austria does business in the central district of california,venue is appropriate there and the principles of forum non conveniens do not counsel otherwise.thus we uphold the district court assertion of jurisdiction under the fsia.
background 
in the early ferdinand bloch,a wealthy czech sugar magnate,commissioned a portrait of his young wife,adele,by the austrian painter gustav klimt.adele and ferdinand,members of the wealthy viennese intellectual elite,commissioned klimt painting at a time when the artist commanded a fee in excess of a quarter of the price of a furnished country villa.klimt made hundreds of sketches of adele,culminating in with the shimmery golden portrait,adele before adele untimely passing in,she owned six klimt paintings,including another portrait of herself,a portrait of a close friend,and three landscapes adele i ii,amalie zuckerkandl,apple tree i,beechwood,and houses in unterach am attersee.obviously oblivious to the terror to come,which would dramatically affect austria generally and her husband ferdinand intimately,adele left a will kindly requesting that ferdinand donate the paintings to the austrian gallery upon his death.
the nazi invasion of austria on march,worked a dramatic upheaval on the lives of ferdinand and all austrians.many of the austrians embraced the nazis,moving adolf hitler to declare the annexation of austria to nazi next day.to imbue these actions with a basis,a mock council of ministers was convened,which adopted the resolution for the anschluss.the legitimate austrian cabinet leaders were arrested and deported to concentration camps.the country was split into single districts under the direct control of berlin.even the name austria was abolished.ferdinand,who was jewish and had supported efforts before the annexation of austria,fled the country to avoid persecution,leaving behind all his holdings,including his paintings,a valuable porcelain collection,and his beautiful home,castle,and sugar factory.he settled in zurich,switzerland.
in the meantime,nazi officials,accompanied by representatives of what later became the austrian gallery,convened a meeting to divide up ferdinand property.his sugar company was aryanized and his vienna home was reduced to a german railway headquarters.reinhardt heydrich,the author of the infamous final solution,moved into ferdinand castle.ferdinand vast porcelain collection was sold at a public auction,with the best pieces going to vienna museums.hitler and hermann g ring confiscated some of ferdinand austrian masters paintings for their private collections.others were bought for hitler planned museum at linz.erich fuerher,the nazi lawyer liquidating the estate,chose a few paintings for his personal collection.fuerher purported to give two of the paintings at issue,adele i and apple tree i,to the austrian gallery in,in exchange for a painting donated by ferdinand in.he accompanied the transaction with a note claiming to deliver the paintings in fulfillment of the last will and testament of adele and signed it heil hitler.in march,fuerher sold adele ii to the gallery and beechwood to the museum of the city of vienna.he kept houses in unterach am attersee for his personal collection.it is not clear what immediately happened to amalie zuckerkandl,although it ended up in the hands of the art dealer vita k nstler.
ferdinand died in switzerland in november.he left a will,revoking all prior wills,and leaving his entire estate to one nephew and two nieces,including maria altmann.like ferdinand,altmann and her husband had been forced to flee austria.when the nazis invaded austria,they imprisoned her husband fritz in the labor camp at dachau and moved altmann to a guarded apartment.her managed to get fritz released from dachau,after which they escaped to holland.ultimately,they ended up in hollywood,california,where altmann became a united states citizen in.
also in,the second republic of austria was born and the next year,it declared that all transactions motivated by the nazis were void.despite this official policy,altmann and her family members were unsuccessful in recovering the klimt paintings.altmann brother could retrieve only houses in unterach from the private collection of fuehrer.in december,the museum of the city of vienna offered to return the painting beechwood,but only in exchange for a refund of the purchase price.this offer was rejected by ferdinand heirs.the heirs then unsuccessfully sought return of three of the paintings from the gallery the gallery refused to transfer the paintings,asserting that they had been bequeathed to it by the terms of adele will.under color of the will,the legal effect of which has yet to be determined the museum even began to prepare suit for return of the klimt paintings not yet in its possession.despite the museum aggressive stance,a private letter from karl garzarolli dated march,of the gallery to his predecessor revealed that nothing in the files of the gallery would document the donation of the paintings to the gallery.this letter was kept hidden from ferdinand heirs.
in,an agent of austria federal monument agency contacted rinesch,the austrian lawyer hired by the family,to discuss the artworks in question.he informed rinesch that the artworks could not be exported without resolution of their ownership.in a practice later declared illegal by the austrian government,the agency informed rinesch that it would grant export permits on some of the family other recovered artworks in exchange for a donation of the klimt paintings.with little hope of otherwise exporting the other artworks,rinesch agreed that ferdinand heirs would acknowledge the will of adele and allow the austrian gallery to keep the six klimt paintings mentioned in the will.he justified this decision to robert bentley,altmann brother,by claiming that adele will would be sufficient to give the museum a claim to the six paintings.he executed a document,dated april,acknowledging the agreement and gave houses in unterach to the austrian gallery.as agreed,rinesch obtained export permits for almost all of the other recovered artworks.
in early,an international art scandal broke the city of new york seized two egon schiele paintings loaned by austria to the museum of modern art in new york,claiming that they were stolen by the nazis.in response to allegations that the austrian gallery still possessed looted art,the austrian minister for education and culture for the first time opened up the ministry archives to permit research into the provenance of the national collection.the austrian government also created a committee made up of government officials and art historians to advise the minister for education and culture on which artworks should be returned and to whom.the documents that surfaced in demonstrated that reliance on adele will as the source of legal title to the paintings was questionable at best.
notwithstanding the discovery of the documents undermining the austrian gallery ownership of the paintings,the committee recommended against returning the six klimt paintings at issue.altmann alleges that the committee vote was predetermined by the austrian government before the committee ever discussed the matter.altmann points to the resignation of one committee member who abstained from the vote and later stated that she had been ordered by a superior to vote against return of the six paintings.
in september,altmann decided to file a lawsuit in austria to overturn the committee recommendation regarding the klimt paintings.to do so,under austrian law,altmann was required to pay a filing fee that is a percentage of the recoverable amount.the standard formula used to calculate the court fees is of the amount in controversy plus austrian schillings.because the amount in controversy here is approximately million,altmann would have been required to pay about million to pursue her claim altmann applied for legal aid,seeking reduction of the fees,and was granted a partial waiver.based on the information detailing her assets,the court determined that altmann and her could afford a fee of million schillings,or approximately.although altmann did not appeal the decision,the republic of austria appealed on the grounds that altmann had not declared the value of various art objects worth almost that she had recently recovered from the austrian government.the petition was rejected as untimely.regardless of the amount paid,in the event that altmann prevailed in the austrian civil action,she would be entitled to recover all of the court fees and her attorney fees as part of the final judgment.
because of what they viewed as the prohibitive cost of the lawsuit,altmann and her family abandoned their austrian complaint.on august,altmann filed the present action against the republic of austria and the gallery in the central district of california.the republic of austria and the gallery moved for dismissal under i.b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction ii.b for lack of venue iii.b for failure to join indispensable parties and iv the doctrine of forum non conveniens.the district court denied this motion on may.
ii.subject matter foreign sovereign immunities act 
on an appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss,we review the dismissal de novo,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and making all reasonable inferences in the favor.zimmerman city of oakland,cir.
a foreign state is normally immune from the jurisdiction of federal and state courts in the united states.verlinden cent.bank of nigeria,d.the united states supreme court has long recognized that foreign sovereign immunity is a matter of grace and comity on the part of the united states,and not a restriction imposed by the constitution.id.the fsia provides a limited means to obtain jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns and their agencies and instrumentalities and codifies a statutory set of exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity.those exceptions include actions involving waiver of immunity,commercial activity,rights in property taken in violation of international law,rights in property in the united states,tortious acts occurring in the united states,and actions brought to enforce arbitration agreements with a foreign state.thus a federal court can not hear claims against sovereign nations,unless the claim falls within one of these enumerated exceptions.verlinden,at.
altmann contends that the taking of her family klimt paintings by the austrian government violates international law and falls squarely within the expropriation exception to the fsia.the district court agreed,finding that i the fsia was retroactive to the pre and acts of the nazis and the austrian government ii personal jurisdiction existed over the republic and the gallery iii the doctrine of forum non conveniens did not require transfer of jurisdiction to austria iv all necessary parties had been joined and v venue was appropriate in the central district of california.altmann republic of austria,d.we turn first to whether the fsia applies to altmann claims.
a.the applicability of the fsia 
we must first determine whether the district court properly held that the fsia may be applied to the alleged wrongful appropriation by the republic.the fsia provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this country.argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d.the defendants maintain that jurisdiction is lacking because the fsia may not be retrospectively applied to conduct the department of state issuance of the tate letter,while the last taking in this case purportedly occurred in.see letter of jack tate,acting legal advisor,department of state,to acting attorney general philip perlman,may,tate letter,reprinted in dep t state bull.and in alfred dunhill of london,republic of cuba,app,d.to the extent courts have considered the retroactivity of the fsia,the consensus appears to be that it would encompass events dating back at least as far as the date of this letter.see carl marks union of soviet socialist republics,cir jackson people republic of china,cir slade united states of mexico.
we need not reach the broad conclusion of the district court that the fsia may be generally applied to events predating the tate letter.instead,we find persuasive the reasoning set forth by judge wald,who resigned in from the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit to serve two years as a judge on the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia.in her dissenting opinion in princz federal republic of germany,judge wald agreed with the majority that application of the fsia to conduct is not impermissibly retroactive,but set forth a narrower rationale for that conclusion.see,wald,dissenting on other grounds,cert.denied,d.
the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence,and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our republic.ins cyr,d quoting kaiser aluminum chem.bonjorno,d scalia,concurring.although congress is empowered to enact statutes with retrospective effect,a statute may not be applied retroactively absent a clear indication from congress that it intended such a result.id.noting that cases where the supreme court has found truly retroactive effect involved statutory language so clear that it could sustain only one interpretation.
a statute does not operate retrospectively,and thus impermissibly,simply because it applies to conduct antedating the statute enactment.landgraf usi film,d.we must ask whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.id.at.t he judgment whether a particular statute acts retroactively should be informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.cyr,at.internal quotation marks omitted.we must consider the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.landgraf,at.e very statute,which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past,must be deemed retrospective.id.at.quoting soc y for propagation of the gospel wheeler,cas.on the other hand,statutes that confer or oust jurisdiction,or change procedural rules,may be applied in suits arising before their enactment without raising concerns about retroactivity.id.at.because these rules take away no substantive right but simply change the tribunal that is to hear the case,present law governs in such situations.id.at.quoting hallowell commons.
the princz majority found that congress intention for the fsia to be retroactively applied was manifest in the statute statement of purpose that claims of foreign states to immunity should henceforth be decided by courts of the united states and of the states in conformity with the principles set forth in this chapter.princz,at quoting.the majority interpreted congress use of the word henceforth to mean that the fsia is to be applied to all cases decided after its enactment,regardless of when the plaintiff cause of action accrued.id.the court also pointed out that congress deletion of the language in providing for diversity jurisdiction over suits by a united states citizen against a foreign government would prevent prospective plaintiffs from suing over acts unless the fsia replacement section,were available.id.at.further,the princz majority suggested,as the district court found here,that application of the fsia to the facts at issue effected merely a change of jurisdiction thus,because the fsia did not alter liability under the applicable substantive law,its application would not be impermissibly retroactive.id.at see also altmann,d at.
other courts have determined not to apply the fsia to events predating its enactment.see carl marks,jackson,slade.nevertheless,in reaching this conclusion,these courts did not rely solely on the lack of a clear expression of congressional intent otherwise,they would have concluded that the fsia could not be applied to events predating its enactment.instead,they recognized that the fsia would properly apply to events occurring after the issuance of the tate letter.see carl marks,at we believe,as did the district court,that only after was it reasonable for a foreign sovereign to anticipate being sued in the united states courts on commercial transactions.alterations and quotation marks omitted jackson,at we agree that to give the act retrospective application to events would interfere with antecedent rights of other sovereigns and also with antecedent principles of law that the united states followed until.slade.at t he court finds that the fsia can not be applied retroactively to this case where all the operative events occurred before.although the issuance of the tate letter has been recognized as the moment when the american position changed and the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity was adopted,for purposes of determining whether austria could have settled expectations of immunity in a united states court,we note the observation of judge re,chief judge emeritus of the court of international trade,that it was announced in that the state department was reconsidering the policy.edward re,human rights,domestic courts,and effective remedies,john.
assuming,without deciding,that these cases are correct that congressional intent to allow application of the fsia to facts is not manifest in the statutory language,we turn to the second prong of the landgraf test and examine whether applying the fsia would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,princz,at wald,dissenting on other grounds quoting landgraf,at,whether austria would have been entitled to immunity for its alleged complicity in the pillaging and retention of treasured paintings from the home of a jewish alien who was forced to flee for his life.
in determining what rights austria possessed when it acted,and what were its legitimate expectations,we look to the practice of american courts at that time,which was one of judicial deference to the foreign policy determinations of the executive branch.id.at citing verlinden,at.we note that in verlinden,the supreme court explained that u ntil,the state department ordinarily requested immunity in all actions against friendly foreign sovereigns.at.emphasis added.in,the supreme court pronounced that it is of public importance that the action of the political arm of the government taken within its appropriate sphere be promptly recognized,and that the delay and inconvenience of a prolonged litigation be avoided by prompt termination of the proceedings in the district court.ex parte peru.two years later,the court exercised in rem jurisdiction over a mexican vessel,noting the absence of a certification of immunity by the state department or other evidence supporting immunity in conformance with the principles accepted by the state department.see republic of mexico hoffman.
determining whether the fsia may properly be applied thus turns on the question whether austria could legitimately expect to receive immunity from the executive branch of the united states for its complicity in and perpetuation of the discriminatory expropriation of the klimt paintings.mindful that such seizures explicitly violated both austria and germany obligations under the hague convention iv on the laws and customs of war on land,bevans,lexis entered into force,and that austria second republic officially repudiated all nazi transactions in,we hold that austria could not expect such immunity.
that austria and the united states were no longer on opposite sides of world war ii at the time the federal monument agency attempted to extort valid title to the klimt paintings does not mean that austria could reasonably expect the granting of immunity for an act so closely associated with the atrocities of the war.although the deprivation of private property,while discriminatory and indeed dehumanizing,pales in comparison with the horrors inflicted upon those who,unlike ferdinand,were unable to escape the slavery,torture,and mass murder of the nazi concentration camps,we are certain that the austrians could not have had any expectation,much less a settled expectation,that the state department would have recommended immunity as a matter of grace and comity for the wrongful appropriation of jewish property.
indeed,the state department position on that question is evident in an april,letter from tate announcing the state department adoption of a policy to remove obstacles to recovery specifically for victims of nazi expropriations.on april,the united states state department issued a press release stating,in pertinent part 
as a matter of general interest,the department publishes herewith a copy of a letter of april,from jack tate,acting legal advisor,department of state,to the attorneys for the plaintiff in civil action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.
the letter repeats this government opposition to forcible acts of dispossession of a discriminatory and confiscatory nature practiced by the germans on the countries or peoples subject to their controls states that it is this government policy to undo the forced transfers and restitute identifiable property to the victims of nazi persecution wrongfully deprived of such property and sets forth that the policy of the executive,with respect to claims asserted in the united states for restitution of such property,is to relieve american courts from any restraint upon the exercise of their jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the acts of nazi officials.
press release,jurisdiction of united states courts re suits for identifiable property involved in nazi forced transfers,reprinted in bernstein,cir per curiam emphasis added.the press release was accompanied by a copy of the actual letter,which states in pertinent part 
this government has consistently opposed the forcible acts of dispossession of a discriminatory and confiscatory nature practiced by the germans on the countries or peoples subject to their controls.
the policy of the executive,with respect to claims asserted in the united states for the restitution of identifiable property or compensation in lieu thereof lost through force,coercion,or duress as a result of nazi persecution in germany,is to relieve american courts from any restraint upon the exercise of their jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the acts of nazi officials.
letter from jack tate,acting legal advisor,department of state,to the attorneys for the plaintiff in civil action,reprinted in bernstein,at.we conclude,as did judge wald,that the application of the fsia infringes on no right held at the time the acts at issue occurred,and thus the fsia is not impermissibly applied to austria in this case.
this result is particularly apt for at least three additional reasons.first,we note that by the,austria itself had adopted the restrictive theory,which recognizes sovereign immunity with regard to sovereign or public acts jure imperii of a state,but not with respect to private acts jure gestionis.tate letter,reprinted in alfred dunhill,at.see also joseph sweeney,the international law of sovereign immunity dep t of state policy research study,at the end of world war i,the courts of austria abandoned the absolute concept of sovereign immunity and adopted the restrictive concept.as the tate letter of may describes 
the newer or restrictive theory of sovereign immunity has always been supported by the courts of belgium and italy.it was adopted in turn by the courts of egypt and of switzerland.in addition,the courts of france,austria,and greece,which were traditionally supporters of the classical theory,reversed their position in the to embrace the restrictive theory.rumania,peru,and possibly denmark also appear to follow this theory.
tate letter,reprinted in alfred dunhill,at.thus austria could have had no reasonable expectation of immunity in a foreign court.as judge wald notes,the nuremberg trials signaled that the international community,and particularly the united states would not have supported a broad enough immunity to shroud the atrocities committed during the holocaust.princz,at wald,dissenting on other grounds.because a united states court would apply the international law of takings,which presumably would be applied in any foreign court,the application of the fsia to the facts of this case merely address es which court shall have jurisdiction and thus can fairly be said merely to regulate the secondary conduct of litigation and not the underlying primary conduct of the parties.hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d emphasis in original citing landgraf,at.because such application would affect only where a suit may be brought,not whether it may be brought at all,id.emphasis in original,the application of the fsia to the facts of this case is not impermissibly retroactive.
second,the cases holding the fsia inapplicable to events involve economic transactions entered into long before the facts of this case arose and,unlike here,prior to the defendant country acceptance of the restrictive principle of sovereign immunity and to the widespread acceptance of the restrictive theory.the soviet union,which was sued in carl marks over its default with respect to debt instruments issued in,see at,was in,together with the soviet satellite countries and the united kingdom,one of the few remaining jurisdictions that supported continued full acceptance of the absolute theory of sovereign immunity.tate letter,reprinted in alfred dunhill,at.the tate letter also noted that china,sued in jackson over its default on bonds issued in,see at,was among the jurisdictions not yet having clearly adopted the restrictive principle.tate letter,reprinted in alfred dunhill,at.as for mexico,sued in slade over its default over a interest agreement,see,it is that nations did not accept the restrictive approach to immunity well into the.see wang houli,sovereign immunity chinese views and practices,chinese,spring,at.
third,the disputes in carl marks,jackson,and slade essentially involved contracts,an area in which courts have traditionally deferred to the settled expectations of the parties at the time of contracting in recognition of the parties allocation of risk.such deference is especially due in financial transactions involving foreign debt instruments,where unexpected judicial intrusion essentially would the parties original bargain.such presumptions are inapplicable in the context of a claim like the international takings violation at issue here.thus,even if austria had indeed expected not to be sued in a foreign court at the time it acted,an expectation which we have explained would be patently unreasonable,such expectation would be due no deference.
for these reasons,we hold that application of the fsia to the actions of the republic of austria is not impermissibly retroactive.
expropriation exception to sovereign immunity 
the fsia expropriation exception to immunity provides that 
a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states or of the states in any case in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property or any property exchanged for such property is owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and that agency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the united states 
a.this exception to foreign sovereign immunity is based upon the general presumption that states abide by international law and,hence,violations of international law are not sovereign acts.west,at,at,reprinted in,t he central premise of the bill is that decisions on claims by foreign states to sovereign immunity are best made by the judiciary on the basis of a statutory regime which incorporates standards recognized under international law.see also trajano marcos in re estate of marcos human rights litig,cir congress intended the fsia to be consistent with international law.for guidance regarding the norms against takings in violation of international law,we may look to court decisions,united states law,the work of jurists,and the usage of nations.see siderman de blake,at west,at.nevertheless,we recognize that a t the jurisdictional stage,we need not decide whether the taking actually violated international law as long as a claim is substantial and,it provides a sufficient basis for the exercise of our jurisdiction.siderman de blake,at quoting west,at.
the facts alleged by altmann fall squarely within the expropriation exception to sovereign immunity.there is no question but that rights in property are in issue.the austrian republic and gallery insist on adele will as the basis for their legal ownership of the klimt paintings.altmann,as a true heir and as a representative of other heirs,asserts the will has no such legal effect and the documents unearthed in revealed that fact to the current austrian government and to the austrian gallery,which nevertheless have retained possession of the paintings without payment therefor.
the next question is whether the property in issue was taken in violation of international law.to constitute a valid taking under international law three predicates must exist.first,v alid expropriations must always serve a public purpose.west,at.second,aliens must not be discriminated against or singled out for regulation by the state.id.at.finally,a n otherwise valid taking is illegal without the payment of just compensation.id.relying on reports from the foreign claims settlement commission,international law journals,the restatement second of foreign relations law of the united states,and federal case law.to fall into this exception,the plaintiff can not be a citizen of the defendant country at the time of the expropriation,because e xpropriation by a sovereign state of the property of its own nationals does not implicate settled principles of international law.siderman de blake,at quoting chuidian philippine bank,cir.
the facts of record,which in this procedural posture we must take as true,show that the klimt paintings have been wrongfully and discriminatorily appropriated in violation of international law.the nazis did not even pretend to take the klimt paintings for a public purpose instead,fuehrer sold them for personal gain or exchanged them to supplement his private collection.in addition,their taking appears discriminatory.altmann is a jewish refugee,now a united states citizen,who is a descendant of a czech family whose property was looted by the nazis because of their religious heritage.according to altmann,despite convening a committee to evaluate expropriation claims and return stolen artwork,the austrian government intentionally intervened to thwart a fair and impartial vote on the restitution of the klimt paintings.further,the austrian government has not yet returned the paintings to altmann and her family or justly compensated them for the value of the paintings without compensation,this taking can not be valid.see west,at.
finally,the austrian gallery is engaged in commercial activity in the united states.altmann has satisfied the fsia statutory nexus requirement by showing that the paintings are owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state,here the austrian gallery,which is engaged in commercial activity in the united states.a.the defendants do not contest that the gallery is an agency or instrumentality.the fsia defines commercial activity as either a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act,and provides that t he commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act,rather than by reference to its purpose.id.at d.
altmann argues that the gallery engages in commercial activity in the united states by authoring,editing,and publishing in the united states both a book entitled klimt women,as well as an guidebook,containing photographs of the looted paintings she also contends that the advertisements in the united states of gallery exhibitions,particularly those relating to the klimt paintings,as well as operation of the gallery itself,constitute commercial activity.the key commercial behavior of the gallery here is not its operation of the museum exhibition in austria,however,but its publication and marketing of that exhibition and the books in the united states.klimt women,for example,is published in english in the united states by yale university press and capitalizes on the images of three of the paintings at issue.that book was published in conjunction with a large exhibition at the gallery featuring the expropriated paintings.furthermore,the austrian gallery asserts copyright ownership as authors two employees of the gallery edited the book and the director of the gallery is listed as responsible for its content.the museum guidebook is also published in english and features the painting adele i on its cover.the publication and sale of these materials and the marketing of the klimt exhibition in the united states are commercial activities in and of themselves,but are also a means to attract american tourists to the gallery.given that the commercial activity is centered around the very paintings at issue in this action and far exceeds that which we found sufficient to justify applying a in siderman de blake,at,we must conclude that the gallery is engaging in commercial activity sufficient to justify jurisdiction under the fsia.
iii.due process and personal jurisdiction 
austria maintains that even if an exception to sovereign immunity applies,altmann suit can not be maintained unless the district court has personal jurisdiction over the republic and the gallery.under the fsia,however,personal jurisdiction over a foreign state exists where jurisdiction exists and where proper service has been made.b.because we hold that the paintings are subject to the expropriation exception of the fsia,and there has been proper service of process under,as the republic concedes,the court has personal jurisdiction over the republic and the gallery.
we also hold that,if the facts are as altmann alleges,the assertion of personal jurisdiction over the republic and the gallery complies with the due process clause of the fifth amendment.assuming that a foreign state is a person for purposes of the due process clause,republic of argentina weltover,d,there must be sufficient minimum contacts between the foreign state and the forum such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,int l shoe washington.citation omitted.see also theo.davies republic of the marshall islands,cir w e need not decide whether the government agency is a person for purposes of the due process clause.we simply assume,without deciding,that both are.factors to be taken into consideration are whether the defendant makes sales,solicits or engages in business in the state,serves the state markets,designates an agent for service of process,holds a license,or is incorporated there.bancroft masters,augusta,cir see also helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.where service is made under fsia section,the relevant area in delineating contacts is in the entire united states,not merely the forum state.richmark timber falling consultants,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
the republic and the gallery have sufficient minimum contacts with the united states such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.as previously noted,the gallery edits and publishes several publications in the united states,two of which capitalize on the very paintings at issue here.the gallery publication and marketing of these books is designed to solicit tourism by united states citizens in austria and to attract those visitors to the gallery,in particular to view the klimt works.both the republic and the gallery profit from the sales of the books and the resulting united states tourism.
furthermore,it is not only the gallery activities in the forum,but also actions taken by the government on behalf of the gallery that support personal jurisdiction.see texas trading milling fed.republic of nigeria,cir.the austrian press and information service of the austrian embassy has published a tourism brochure advertising the klimt exhibition at the austrian gallery and featuring the portrait of adele on its cover.this brochure is available at austrian consulates throughout the united states,distributed to a large mailing list of individuals in the united states,and is widely available on the internet.the advertisement and promotion of this exhibition directly benefit the gallery.
the republic itself does not contest that it has substantial,systematic,and continuous contacts with the united states through its operation of consulates,sponsorship of tourist relations and trade,and promotion of austrian business interests.the republic alone operates three consulates in the united states and honorary consulates in the united states and its territories the austrian trade commission and austrian national tourist offices operate in both new york and los angeles.austria also recently invested in the renovation of the rudolf schindler house,a historic architectural landmark in los angeles.thus altmann has established continuous and systematic contacts.helicopteros,at nn.siderman de blake,at finding jurisdiction where hotel solicited united states tourism and accepted united states credit cards for payment for guest reservations.we do not hold that these contacts are enough to support general jurisdiction,but they support the reasonableness of the assertion of specific jurisdiction based on the gallery publication of books and advertisements featuring the klimt works.we conclude that fair play and substantial justice would not be offended if we maintain jurisdiction over austria in this case.
iv.joinder of parties 
we reject austria contention that altmann are necessary parties to the litigation requiring dismissal of this action under rule unless they are joined.see dawavendewa salt river project agric.improvement power,cir,cert.denied,d.in determining whether the are necessary parties under rule,we consider whether,in the absence of their join
