since,our legislature has proscribed any than specifically exempted financial engaging in the business of receiving money for the purpose of transmitting the same or its equivalent to foreign countries without first obtaining a license from the commissioner of the department of financial institutions,subd.a.section makes it a felony for any person who has not complied with the department licensing requirements to represent that he or she is authorized to receive,or to solicit or receive,money for transmission to a foreign country.following a bench trial,defendants bijan mehdipanah and mostafa noori were found guilty of violating section.the trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed mehdipanah on formal probation,which included imposition of the maximum fine of.the trial court granted noori motion to reduce his conviction to a misdemeanor and imposed summary probation.
mehdipanah and noori were tried on the understanding that section was a general intent crime,meaning that in addition to proving that defendants lacked the requisite license from the department,the prosecution was required to prove that defendants acted intentionally in representing they were authorized to receive or in soliciting or receiving money for the purpose of transmitting it to a foreign.it was also understood that there was no additional knowledge or intent element.the trial court rejected the defense contention that the prosecution was obliged to prove defendants were aware of the department licensing requirement and made their representations or solicitations with the knowledge they were not in compliance with the financial code.
in the published portion of this opinion,we address defendants argument that constitutional due process concerns require that section include the special mental state element that defendants knew they lacked the department license at the time they committed the felony offense.finding no statutory basis for importing such an element into section and no constitutional requirement,we reject that argument.we also address mehdipanah closely related argument that the exclusion of testimony by defendant business attorney deprived him of his constitutional right to present a defense.the intended the effect that private counsel assured mehdipanah that the business was in compliance with california have contributed merely to an improper mistake of law defense,not a permissible mistake of fact defense.
in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we address noori contention that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because he was merely an employee.we reject that contention for the reasons adduced in people niroomandi th,d.we also address mehdipanah remaining contentions the prosecution engaged in discriminatory prosecution the exclusion of testimony from his private counsel deprived mehdipanah of his constitutional right to present mitigation evidence and the sentencing court was influenced by improper evidence.we find nothing in the record to support those contentions and affirm.
statement of the facts 
a.the prosecution case 
detective daryoush sameyah of the los angeles police department,who was fluent in farsi,was part of an investigation concerning the transmission of money to iran.he was aware of an entry in the currency exchange section of the local iranian yellow pages for sarafi bijan,located on ventura boulevard in tarzana.in farsi,sarafi means the exchange of foreign currency.sarafi bijan also had a advertisement which promised the secure delivery of money to its destination.on march,detective sameyah,working undercover,telephoned the number listed in the advertisement and spoke to a person who identified himself as bijan.the detective asked if he could arrange to send one million tomans an iranian unit of currency to iran.bijan told the detective that he could facilitate the transaction at a rate of tomans to the dollar,plus a fee.
three days later,detective sameyah,still working undercover,visited the tarzana office of sarafi bijan.the detective had a concealed wire,allowing him to broadcast his conversation to officers waiting outside in a surveillance van.inside the office,noori was sitting at a desk by the front door.the detective told noori that he wanted to send to iran.noori gave the detective a form to fill out,and the two discussed the terms of the transaction.noori business card represented that he was an office worker for sarafi bijan,which provided for the payment of foreign exchange,express in less than one day.
the transaction form,which was written in farsi and english,required the customer identifying information and bank account number.under the terms of the agreement,the customer funds would be transferred to a bank account or delivered directly to the designated receiver.when the detective told noori that he had in cash to transmit,noori informed him that sarafi bijan accepted no more than in cash,so the detective would have to use a cashier check made out to sarafi bijan for the transaction.noori quoted an exchange rate to the detective and told him that it would take one to four days to complete the transaction.noori explained that the cashier check itself would not be sent to iran.rather,we will give money in iran to whoever you say,in tomans.
when detective sameyah expressed concern over the level of security for his money,noori told him that a coworker had completed approximately similar transactions that day,and he suggested the detective inquire about their reputation from the iranian community.when the detective asked further about the safety of the transaction,noori took him to mehdipanah office.mehdipanah represented that he was bijan,the owner of sarafi bijan,but added,we are all bijan here.
on april,detective sameyah and other officers conducted a search of sarafi bijan tarzana office.there were between and customers in the office sending money to iran.
documents seized from sarafi bijan office showed that it was engaged in the business of transmitting money to iran.between november,and april,sarafi bijan transferred just a little over million to iran.
arlene rutherford,who before her retirement had worked for the california department of financial institutions for years,testified as an expert in state regulation of transmitters of money abroad.state regulations require that such entities obtain a license in order engage in the business of sending money to foreign countries.a transmitter must apply for a license and post a bond.
in february of,the department verified for the los angeles police department that neither sarafi bijan nor either defendant was licensed to transmit money abroad.in fact,only corporations could be licensed for that purpose however,a licensed corporation could apply to have persons serve as approved agents of the entity.the department commissioner issued a certificate that sarafi bijan did not have such a license.neither mehdipanah nor noori was an approved agent.indeed,at the relevant times,no entity could have obtained a license to transmit money to iran because federal law proscribed the transmission of money to that country.
after his arrest,noori waived his rights and gave a statement to the police.noori had been in the united states since.he was employed by mehdipanah for the four years leading up to his arrest.he would take three months off of work every year to spend in iran.apart from answering the telephones,noori responsibilities at sarafi bijan were to receive the money from customers,give them receipts,and inform them when the money had been sent to iran.the business averaged to customers daily.sarafi bijan advertised through various media.noori told the police that he believed sarafi bijan or mehdipanah was licensed and was able to send and receive money.
detective robert cosley of the los angeles police department interviewed mehdipanah,who waived his miranda rights.mehdipanah said he was the owner and controller of sarafi bijan,which was engaged in the business of sending money back and forth between persons in the united states and iran.mehdipanah had partners or trusted friends in iran who assisted him in completing the transactions.he advertised the business in the local iranian yellow pages.mehdipanah company,sarafi international,was registered with the california secretary of state as a limited liability corporation.
defendants case 
noori testified that mehdipanah was a family friend.noori worked for him for about four years.he received a salary of per month less state and federal income taxes,which was paid even while noori spent three or four months in iran.he believed sarafi bijan money transmitting business was legitimate.it advertised openly in various media and had many returning customers.there was a license on the wall however,he did not know what kind of license it was.mehdipanah told noori that the business was licensed noori admitted that when detective sameyah came to visit the business,noori told him that sarafi bijan could transfer money to iran for him,and that it did so regularly.noori had customers fill out money transmission forms as part of such transactions more than one thousand times in the course of his employment.the first time the department informed noori that a license was required to conduct sarafi bijan business was days after his arrest.
mehdipanah testified that after immigrating to the united states from iran,he worked for rivandi money exchange,a business engaged in transferring money abroad.in,when mehdipanah left the rivandi business,he retained a lawyer named cyrus meshki to help him set up his own business to transfer money to iran.mehdipanah wanted it to be legal.meshki formed sarafi international,llc,in accordance with california law.meshki knew that the business would be engaged in transferring money to iran.mehdipanah received an employer identification number for the purpose of money exchange,trade,and financial services.
in early,mehdipanah received a letter from the united states treasury department concerning his business.mehdipanah was copied with the letter meshki wrote back to the treasury department to the effect that the business had gotten all your proper licenses.the business had a license from the city of los angeles,which mehdipanah posted in the tarzana office.at that point,however,mehdipanah business had not received a license from the commissioner of the department of financial institutions.it was not until the month after his arrest that mehdipanah received a communication from the department informing him of the licensing requirement.mehdipanah retained meshki to attempt to obtain the necessary licensing.they met with the department personnel for that purpose.
discussion 
section is a general intent crime that does not require specific knowledge of noncompliance with the licensing requirement 
to determine the meaning of section,and whether it mandates knowledge of the licensing requirement to support a conviction,we look to the intent of the legislature in enacting the law,being careful to give the statute words their plain,commonsense meaning.citation.if the language of the statute is not ambiguous,the plain meaning controls and resort to extrinsic sources to determine the legislature intent is unnecessary.citation.additionally,we must interpret section in context with the entire statute and the statutory scheme.in re jennings cal th,d,construing bus,subd.c.
section is contained in the financial code comprehensive regulations for the transmission of money abroad,found in chapter,sections through.section expresses the legislature intent,which is to protect the people of this state from being victimized by unscrupulous practices by persons receiving money for transmission to foreign countries and to establish a minimum level of fiscal responsibility and corporate integrity for all entities engaging in the business of receiving money for transmission to foreign countries without regard to the method of transmission,subd.a.to that end,t he legislature finds and declares that california has a large and diverse population many of whom are concerned with the financial plight of people remaining in the countries which they left.many of these people are not familiar with the varied and intricate financial systems of this state and due to language barriers and other obstacles do not have access to entities offering legitimate money transmission services.in an effort to transmit money to their friends and relatives,these persons give their money to persons under the precept that the money or its equivalent will be immediately transmitted to the designated foreign country.the money is frequently misappropriated or never transmitted.the victims of these practices are generally not aware of the law enforcement services available to help them,thus this unlawful conduct goes unreported,subd.b,fn.omitted.
certainly,those policy concerns evince nothing that would support a special knowledge of illegality requirement.the legislature broad consumer protection objectives would be seriously undercut,if not wholly thwarted,if persons lacking the wherewithal to safely conduct a to mention those actively desirous of exploiting a incentive to remain ignorant of our state licensing requirements.people niroomandi,supra,th at,d recognizing that section broad legislative intent supports applying section to all individuals,not just those in charge of corporations violating the law.as the niroomandi court recognized in a related context,t o apply the statute only to corporate officers and directors would render the licensing requirement a sham and lead to absurd results.if only an unlicensed corporation and its controlling owners,officers or directors were subject to prosecution,a person receiving money for transmittal abroad could readily avoid prosecution simply by failing to incorporate.ibid.were we to accept defendants interpretation of the statute,persons wanting to avoid compliance with our state consumer protection regulations would effectively be granted a free pass up until the time they were given official notice of noncompliance.
consideration of the overarching statutory scheme reveals no basis for importing a special knowledge element.as indicated above,section sets forth the general licensing requirement no person shall engage in the business of receiving money for the purpose of transmitting the same or its equivalent to foreign countries without first obtaining a license from the commissioner and lists the exempted entities,subd.a see also.section contains various defined terms,including agent,which means any person whom a licensee has appointed as its agent with authority to receive transmission money on behalf of the licensee,subd.a.such a person is defined so as not to include any officer or employee of the licensee when acting as such at an office of a licensee,subd.c.other provisions concern matters such as licensing fees the procedures for license applications,their approval,and issuance reporting and accounting requirements for licensees examination of a licensee business the deadline for forwarding a customer money customer refunds security deposits the necessity of clearly stating the exchange rate on a customer receipt and the process for license revocation or suspension.
the provision directly at issue here,section,identifies no intent requirement,much less a specific knowledge of wrongfulness element every person who violates or fails to comply with this chapter,or who,without complying with this chapter,represents that he or she is authorized to receive,or who solicits or receives,money or the equivalent for transmission to a foreign country,shall upon conviction be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars or shall be imprisoned in the state prison,or in a county jail for not more than one year,or be punished by both the fine and imprisonment.
in contrast,the legislature chose to treat differently the issue of liability for agents after revocation or suspension of a license.in that context actual knowledge of the department action is required.section,subdivision a provides that a licensee agent who has actual notice that the commissioner has suspended or revoked the license of a licensee shall not receive any transmission money on behalf of the licensee.if any agent of a licensee,after first having
