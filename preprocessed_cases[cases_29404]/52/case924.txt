this case arises out of the kidnapping and murder of an american citizen in lebanon between november and april.libya appeals from the denial of its motion to dismiss the case,arguing that sovereign immunity protects it from suit and that the plaintiff lacks a viable cause of action.we reject the first contention,concluding that the terrorism exception of the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,a,strips libya of the shield of sovereign immunity.we decline to exercise appellate jurisdiction over the second.
blake kilburn brought suit against the socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya libya,the libyan external security organization leso,the islamic republic of iran,and the iranian ministry of information and security,seeking damages on his own behalf and as executor of the estate of his brother,peter kilburn together,the plaintiff,for peter kidnapping,sale,torture,and death.the allegations of the complaint,as further detailed in district court pleadings and a declaration,are as follows.
peter kilburn was an american citizen who lived in lebanon and worked as an instructor and librarian at the american university of beirut.on november,he was abducted from his apartment hizbollah,a terrorist organization funded by iran,claimed responsibility.in late,the american government was approached by an intermediary who claimed to be acting on behalf of kilburn captors and who sought a ransom for his return.for the next several months,the united states negotiated for kilburn release.
on april,while kilburn was still in captivity,the united states conducted airstrikes on tripoli,libya,in retaliation for libya involvement in the bombing of a berlin nightclub that killed two american soldiers.thereafter,libya made it known that it wanted to purchase an american hostage to murder in revenge for the airstrikes.sometime between april and,the arab revolutionary cells arc,a terrorist organization sponsored by libya,bought kilburn from hizbollah for approximately million and subsequently tortured him.on or about april,arc murdered kilburn and left his body by the side of a road near beirut,alongside the bodies of two british hostages.in a note found nearby,arc claimed responsibility.
blake kilburn complaint,filed on june,alleged that his brother was the victim of hostage taking,torture,and extrajudicial killing,for which the defendants were responsible.the complaint sought recovery through multiple causes of action,including the flatow amendment,note,and theories of wrongful death,battery,assault,false imprisonment,slave trafficking,torture,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.although the complaint did not specify the legal sources of the latter causes of action,later pleadings asserted that they arose under state common law,foreign law,and international law,and that additional federal statutory causes of action might also be available.
the iranian defendants did not appear,and the plaintiff sought a default judgment against them.that motion remains pending in the district court.the libyan defendants did appear,and the parties agreed to a limited course of jurisdictional discovery.thereafter,the libyan defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,contending that their sovereign immunity deprived the court of jurisdiction,and pursuant to rule b,contending that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.the district court denied both requests.sua sponte,the court also considered a question not raised by the parties whether the plaintiff could assert a claim for punitive damages against defendant leso and answered in the affirmative.this appeal followed 
we begin with the question of the libyan defendants sovereign immunity.the district court decision to deny their motion to dismiss plainly did not end the case to the contrary,it permitted the case to go forward.ordinarily,that would preclude our hearing this interlocutory appeal,because our jurisdiction is generally confined to final decisions of the district court.see id.permitting interlocutory appeals in certain circumstances not present here.under the collateral order doctrine,however,an order qualifies as final under if it conclusively determine s the disputed question,resolve s an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d internal quotation marks omitted see cohen beneficial indus.loan.the denial of a motion to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity satisfies all three criteria,and is therefore subject to interlocutory review.see,price socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,jungquist sheikh sultan bin khalifa al nahyan,islamic republic of iran.in particular,with respect to the last criterion,an order denying dismissal for immunity is effectively unreviewable on appeal because sovereign immunity is an immunity from trial and the attendant burdens of litigation,and not just a defense to liability on the merits.jungquist,at quoting,at.
under the fsia,a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction of american courts unless the case falls within one of a list of statutory exceptions or as provided by international agreements.see id.if no exception applies,the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.id.if an exception does apply,the district court has jurisdiction.id.a see world wide minerals,republic of kazakhstan,phoenix consulting,republic of angola.
congress amended the fsia in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,adding an additional exception colloquially known as the terrorism exception.that exception denies sovereign immunity in any case 
in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture,extrajudicial killing,aircraft sabotage,hostage taking,or the provision of material support or resources as defined in section of title for such an act if such act or provision of material support is engaged in by an official,employee,or agent of such foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office,employment,or agency 
a.this exception applies only if three additional criteria are also satisfied the foreign state was designated a state sponsor of terrorism at the time the act occurred the foreign state was given a reasonable opportunity to arbitrate a claim regarding an act that occurred within the state borders and the claimant or victim was a national of the united states.id.a a,b.there is no dispute that these criteria are satisfied here.the only question is whether the plaintiff claims fall within the main body of the exception,upon which the jurisdiction of the district court depends.
in order to preserve the full scope of sovereign immunity,the district court must make the critical preliminary determination of its own jurisdiction as early in the litigation as possible.phoenix consulting,at quoting,at.in making that determination,the nature of the court inquiry depends on the nature of the defendant challenge.if the defendant challenges only the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff jurisdictional allegations,then the district court should take the plaintiff factual allegations as true and determine whether they bring the case within any of the fsia exceptions to immunity invoked by the plaintiff.id.at.but if the defendant challenges the factual basis of the court jurisdiction,the court may not deny the motion to dismiss merely by assuming the truth of the facts alleged by the plaintiff and disputed by the defendant.instead,the court must go beyond the pleadings and resolve any disputed issues of fact the resolution of which is necessary to a ruling upon the motion to dismiss.id.
in their motion to dismiss,the libyan defendants challenged both the legal and factual sufficiency of the plaintiff claims.for the sake of clarity,we address these challenges separately in parts iii and iv.our standard of review is de novo.see price,at.
the libyan defendants maintain that,even if the allegations of the complaint are true,they fail to bring this case within the compass of the terrorism exception.that contention is founded on two legal arguments regarding the scope of the exception.
the defendants first argument is that a requires,as a matter of jurisdiction,a causal connection between the foreign state alleged acts and the victim alleged injuries.stated at that level of generality,the defendants are plainly right.the section provides an exception to sovereign immunity in any case in which money damages are sought for injury or death that was caused by an act of torture,extrajudicial killing,aircraft sabotage,hostage taking,or the provision of material support or resources for such an act.a emphasis added.as we are generally required to give effect to every statutory term,duncan walker,d,we can not ignore the phrase caused by.moreover,because a is a jurisdictional provision,see islamic republic of iran,causation is indeed a jurisdictional requirement.
it is here,however,that we part company with the defendants.they contend not merely that a requires a causal connection,but that it specifically requires but for causation that is,an allegation and,ultimately,evidence that but for libya actions,peter kilburn would not have been purchased,tortured,or killed.the defendants apparently regard but for as a particularly restrictive standard of causation,and insist that nothing less will do 
as a moment inspection of a makes clear,there is no textual warrant for this claim the words but for simply do not appear only caused by do.republic of argentina weltover,d rejecting the suggestion that the fsia commercial activity exception,a,which requires a direct effect in the united states for acts performed elsewhere,contains any unexpressed requirement of substantiality or foreseeability.in jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d,the supreme court interpreted caused by in another jurisdictional statute to require only a showing of proximate cause.we follow the court example here.
in grubart,jurisdiction turned on the meaning of the extension of admiralty jurisdiction act,which provides that the admiralty jurisdiction of the united states shall extend to all cases of damage or injury caused by a vessel on navigable water.app.emphasis added.rejecting the contention that caused by means that the damage must be close in time and space to the activity that caused it,the court held that the phrase means only what tort law has traditionally called proximate causation.grubart,at.at.as the court explained,this classic tort notion normally eliminates the bizarre.see generally prosser keeton on the law of torts ed.noting that an essential element of the plaintiff cause of action for any tort is that there be some reasonable connection between the act or omission of the defendant and the damage which the plaintiff has suffered,a connection usually dealt with by the courts in terms of what is called proximate cause.there is no need or justification,the supreme court said,for imposing an additional nonremoteness hurdle in the name of jurisdiction.grubart,at.at.
the essence of the libyan defendants argument is that here there is a need or justification for imposing an additional hurdle beyond proximate cause,and that but for cause is the appropriate hurdle.they offer the following hypothetical 
a terrorist organization is supported by two foreign states.one specifically instructs the organization to carry out an attack against a citizen.can the state which only provides general support,but was not involved with the act giving rise to the suit,also be stripped of its immunity 
reply br.at.the answer to this hypothetical,the defendants assert,clearly must be no.id.libya argument fails to persuade for several reasons.
first,we are not moved by the plight of libya hypothetical foreign state.we see no reason why there would be a greater justification for or why congress would have a greater interest in protecting a party haled into court under a than one trying to resist admiralty jurisdiction.after all,the only defendants that are subject to a in the first place are those that the state department has designated as state sponsor s of terrorism.a a.
second,a permits actions for injuries caused by material support of terrorist acts by such state sponsors,and,as congress recognized,such support is difficult to trace.as the house report on the terrorism exception stated 
s tate sponsors of terrorism include libya,iraq,iran,syria,north korea,cuba,and sudan.these outlaw states consider terrorism a legitimate instrument of achieving their foreign policy goals.they have become better at hiding their material support for their surrogates,which includes the provision of safe havens,funding,training,supplying weaponry,medical assistance,false travel documentation,and the like.for this reason,the committee has determined that allowing suits in the federal courts against countries responsible for terrorist acts is warranted.
at emphasis added.accordingly,the more likely situation is not libya hypothetical,involving one direct and one general state sponsor,but rather the case in which multiple foreign states claim to be providing only general support.such a case,in which application of a but for standard to joint tortfeasors could absolve them all,is precisely the one for which courts generally regard but for causation as inappropriate.see prosser keeton,at.
third,libya hypothetical and its argument deals solely with a claim based on a state general material support for a terrorist organization.but the provision of material support for a terrorist act is only one of the predicates for the a exception.foreign states also lose immunity for acts of torture,extrajudicial killing,or hostage taking engaged in by an official,employee,or agent of the state itself.a.libya makes no argument at all as to why a restrictive standard of causation should be imposed in direct action cases,yet the statutory phrase caused by applies equally to every a case 
finally,we underline that the only issue before us here is jurisdictional causation,because a is solely a jurisdictional provision,at.to succeed in the end,the plaintiff must go beyond jurisdiction and provide proof satisfying a substantive cause of action.id.the plaintiff has alleged a number of sources that could provide a cause of action,including state,federal,foreign,and international law.whatever the ultimate source may be,it will no doubt carry with it as a matter of substantive law its own rules of causation.of these,there are a large variety.see prosser keeton,at.any concerns about reaching too far to charge foreign states with the attenuated impact of their financial activities are better addressed as questions of substantive law.indeed,to go further as a matter of jurisdiction to accept libya contention that a requires a single causation standard that is more restrictive than the standard of proximate cause runs afoul of the fsia injunction that a foreign state shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.
in this case,there is no doubt that the plaintiff allegations satisfy the proximate cause standard.the complaint alleges that,after the united states bombed tripoli,libyan agents in lebanon made it known that they wanted to purchase an american hostage to murder in retaliation.compl.it specifically asserts that peter kilburn was purchased and killed by members of the arab revolutionary cells,id,whose acts were funded and directed by libya,id.emphasis added.a subsequent declaration makes clear that the plaintiff allegation is not just that arc was supported and funded by the libyan government,but that it was directed by that government and acted as its agent in lebanon to carry out terrorist activities,including the purchase and assassination of peter kilburn.decl.of ambassador robert oakley ret.hereinafter oakley decl.if proven,these allegations are more than sufficient to establish that the acts of the libyan defendants were the proximate cause of peter kilburn injury and death.
the libyan defendants also advance a second argument in favor of a restrictive view of a.noting that the statute denies sovereign immunity for claims involving injury caused by an act of torture,extrajudicial killing,aircraft sabotage,hostage taking,or the provision of material support or resources for such an act,a emphasis added,they insist that to come within this provision,a state material support must go directly for the specific act,torture that gives rise to the claim.in the instant case,the defendants contend that a requires the plaintiff to allege and,ultimately,to prove that libya directly funded arc purchase,torture,and murder of peter kilburn not just that libya provided material support to arc.
although the defendants pose this as an independent restriction on the scope of a,it is closely tied to their causation argument and suffers from some of the same defects.on the one hand,imposing a jurisdictional requirement that a state sponsor financial assistance to a terrorist organization must be directly traceable to a particular terrorist act would likely render a material support provision ineffectual.money,after all,is fungible,and terrorist organizations can hardly be counted on to keep careful bookkeeping records.on the other hand,the requirement that the plaintiff injury be caused by the provision of material support in the sense of proximate causation,see supra part should ameliorate most concerns about remoteness.any further concerns will likely be addressed by the substantive law that governs the applicable cause of action.see generally doe dominion bank of washington,noting that it is axiomatic that under a negligence regime,one has a duty to guard only against foreseeable risks boim quranic literacy inst.holy land found.for relief,cir holding that,to establish a private cause of action for material support of terrorism under,the plaintiffs must be able to show that the murder of their son by hamas was a reasonably foreseeable result of defendants making a donation to hamas.
in any event,libya textual argument has no application here.the plaintiff does not allege that libya merely provided material support to arc,but rather that it specifically funded and directed peter kilburn purchase and murder.see oakley decl.see also id,compl.indeed,the plaintiff claims rest not only on a theory of material support,but also on a theory of agency.the plaintiff asserts that arc was not just some independent organization that libya provided with funds,but rather an agent of libya.see oakley decl.in statutory terms,plaintiff allegation is that peter kilburn injuries and death were caused by terrorist acts engaged in by an agent of a foreign state and not merely by provision of material support for such an act.a emphasis added.the for such an act language that libya highlights plays no textual role with respect to those kinds of allegations.to the contrary,libya is responsible for the acts of its agent within the scope of its agency,regardless of whether libya financed those acts provided,of course,that the elements of agency are established.see,at holding that a foreign state is responsible for the actions of a commercial entity if it exercise s the necessary degree of control over it to create a relationship see also transamerica leasing,la republica de venezuela,same gilson republic of ireland,same.
we turn next to defendants challenge to the factual basis for the district court jurisdiction.as explained above,if a defendant invoking sovereign immunity challenges the factual basis of the court jurisdiction,the court must go beyond the pleadings and resolve any disputed issues of fact the resolution of which is necessary to a ruling upon the motion to dismiss.phoenix consulting,at.to resolve such a factual dispute,however,the court retains considerable latitude in devising the procedures it will follow to ferret out the facts pertinent to jurisdiction.id.quoting prakash american,see grubart,at.at noting that any litigation of a contested jurisdictional fact issue occurs in comparatively summary procedure.
contrary to defendants assertion,the district court understood its responsibilities in this regard.see kilburn republic of iran,citing phoenix consulting,at.in this case,the parties agreed to limited jurisdictional discovery,pursuant to which the plaintiff provided the defendants with supporting documents from the cia and state department,and with a declaration by retired ambassador robert oakley.oakley was the state department coordinator for counterterrorism during the period of peter kilburn kidnapping and murder.plaintiff also produced a list of witnesses who would testify to libya responsibility.no depositions were conducted or sought.after reviewing these materials,the district court concluded that denial of the motion to dismiss was warranted.we agree.
in accordance with the restrictive view of sovereign immunity reflected in the fsia,the defendant bears the burden of proving that the plaintiff allegations do not bring its case within a statutory exception to immunity.phoenix consulting,at quoting transamerican somali democratic republic,see princz federal republic of germany.we have never decided whether,in addition to the ultimate burden of persuasion,the defendant also bears the initial burden of production but even if the plaintiff has the burden of production,he has satisfied it.ambassador oakley declaration states that he would testify both as an expert and based on knowledge of some of the events in question that arc was an agent of libya,that it purchased,tortured,and killed peter kilburn,and that the libyan government expressly provided the funds for the purchase and directed the killing.see oakley decl.given that the only discovery to date has been that which the plaintiff has voluntarily accorded the defendants,and that the plaintiff has not yet had an opportunity to conduct any,that is more than sufficient to satisfy any possible burden of production at this stage of the litigation 
it is equally plain that the libyan defendants have so far satisfied neither a burden of production nor their required burden of persuasion.they submitted no affirmative evidence whatsoever to show that they fall outside the terrorism exception.they did not,for example,file an affidavit denying that their agents purchased or killed peter kilburn.phoenix consulting,at noting that,by filing a sworn declaration that an alleged written contract was a forgery,the foreign state defendant disputed the plaintiff claim that it had waived sovereign immunity through the contract.they did not proffer testimony denying that they had provided material support for those acts.they did not even deny that arc was their agent.
what the defendants did do,instead,was to point out what they see as contradictions between the plaintiff claims and some passages in the cia and state department documents.these asserted contradictions primarily involve reports that multiple terrorist organizations had claimed responsibility for hostage taking in lebanon during the relevant period.although the defendants do not explain the significance of these reports or what they contradicted,presumably the defendants believe the reports suggest that a organization did not carry out the acts in question.but the reports do not deny that a organization purchased or killed peter kilburn nor do they suggest that such an organization was not a proximate cause of those acts,even if not the sole cause.in fact,it is not apparent that the asserted contradictions have any relevance at all to this case 
in short,the defendants have failed to satisfy their burden of proving that the plaintiff allegations do not bring its case within a statutory exception to immunity.phoenix consulting,at.the district court was therefore right to deny their motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under rule b.
in addition to challenging the district court jurisdiction,the libyan defendants also sought dismissal pursuant to rule b,contending that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.the district court denied that motion and,at the same time and sua sponte,held that defendant leso could be subject to punitive damages if it were ultimately found liable.the libyan defendants seek review of both decisions.in particular,they note tha
