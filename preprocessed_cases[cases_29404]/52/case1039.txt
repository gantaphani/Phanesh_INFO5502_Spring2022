background 
this is the fourth case to come before this court involving jazz importation of lffps,also known as disposable cameras,single use cameras,or use cameras.the initial proceeding began in,when fuji filed a complaint at the commission,alleging that respondents,including jazz,were violating section by importing into the united states articles that infringed fifteen patents owned by fuji or by importing articles that were produced by means of a process covered by the claims of fuji patents.jazz photo int l trade comm n,jazz i.the commission held that respondents,including jazz,infringed all or most of the claims in suit of fourteen of fuji patents and it issued an exclusion order on june,prohibiting the importation into the united states of certain lffps.we stayed the commission order pending appeal.on august,we reversed the commission judgment of patent infringement with respect to lffps for which the patent right was exhausted by first sale in the united states,and that were permissibly repaired,and affirmed the commission order for all other cameras.id.at.
fuji also filed a second action at the commission in june seeking institution of a formal enforcement proceeding to enforce the exclusion order and to impose civil penalties.fuji photo film,int l trade comm n,jazz ii.in may,the administrative law judge found that jazz had violated the exclusion order with respect to some lffps imported by jazz from august,through december,that determination became the final determination of the commission on july.subsequently,on january,the commission imposed a civil penalty against jazz.
in addition to the two actions before the commission,fuji filed suit against jazz for patent infringement in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on june,seeking damages and injunctive relief for direct and indirect infringement of its lffp patents between and august.fuji photo film jazz photo,jazz iii.after a jury trial,the court entered judgment on march,that jazz was liable for willful infringement of fuji patents and awarded damages of.id.at.we affirmed that court judgment on january.
the present appeal arises from customs decision to exclude from entry two shipments of lffps that jazz imported at the port of los beach on august and.all the subject lffps were reloaded cameras,also known as refurbished cameras,that were initially manufactured by fuji or one of its licensees kodak,concord,or konica and,after being used by consumers and collected following photo processing,were processed by polytech enterprise limited polytech in china.jazz photo united states,d.int l trade decision.that processing included fitting the camera with new film,and in some instances with new flash batteries,repairing the camera case to exclude light following the film reloading operation,repackaging,and relabeling under jazz trademark.id.at.some of the subject lffps were processed using spent disposable cameras or shells that polytech obtained from a collector of shells,photo recycling enterprise,photo recycling.id.at.the remaining subject lffps were processed using shells that jazz acquired from a company known as seven buck,seven buck and provided to polytech.id.jazz inventory control system identified the reloaded cameras processed using photo recycling shells separately from the reloaded cameras processed using seven buck shells.id.
customs concluded that jazz had failed to prove that the subject lffps were outside the scope of the exclusion order and excluded the two shipments from entry on september and.id.at.jazz then filed a protest to customs decision under a,and customs denied jazz protest on september.id.on october,jazz challenged customs denial of its administrative protest in the court of international trade under a,seeking an order that the subject lffps were admissible into the united states and an order directing customs to release the subject lffps.
after a bench trial,the court of international trade held on november,that jazz established by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells were first sold in the united states and permissibly repaired,and thus that those lffps should be released by customs for entry.id.at.the court also held that jazz did not establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject lffps processed using seven buck shells were first sold in the united states,and thus that those lffps were properly excluded from entry by customs.id.at.
the court made factual findings supporting its conclusions on three issues permissible repair,first sale,and segregation.first,the court relied on the testimony of michal zawodny,the quality assurance manager for jazz,in concluding that polytech refurbished all of the subject lffps in a process that constituted permissible repair.id.at.second,the court credited the testimony of leon silvera,the president of photo recycling,in holding that the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells were first sold in the united states.id.at.the court relied in part on a presumption of regularity,reasoning that any new single use cameras identified by the exclusion order that are commercially imported by anyone other than fuji or one of its licensees would be unlawful imports and presumed to be excluded from the market.id.at.the court also observed that while this presumption does not extend to the lffps called tourist cameras because the exclusion order contains an exception allowing noncommercial importations,there was no record evidence from which the court may conclude that the subject merchandise actually includes cameras refurbished from tourist shells.id.at.at the same time,the court found that the subject lffps processed using seven buck shells were not first sold in the united states.finally,the court found that the subject lffps processed using seven buck shells were located in master lot number,and thus could be segregated from the subject lffps made using photo recycling shells that were not included in master lot number.id.at.
on november,the court entered final judgment in favor of jazz as to the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells,and in favor of the government as to the subject lffps processed using seven buck shells.final judgment,slip op.at.the government and fuji timely appealed that portion of the court order permitting entry of the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells,and jazz filed a contesting the exclusion of the subject lffps made using seven buck shells.
jazz has now been rendered moot by the may,order of the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey that,pursuant to the parties settlement agreement,ordered the sale of substantially all of jazz assets to ribi tech products llc ribi.ribi subsequently took ownership of the subject lffps processed using seven buck shells and exported them for sale overseas.thus,the only portion of the final judgment on appeal is the entry and segregation of the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

as a threshold matter,it is important to state that this case has not been mooted by the release of the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells into the stream of commerce following the final judgment.mootness of an action relates to the basic dispute between the parties,not merely the relief requested.thus,although subsequent acts may moot a request for particular relief or a count,the constitutional requirement of a case or controversy may be supplied by the availability of other relief.intrepid pollock,citing powell mccormack,d the mootness of powell claim for injunctive relief related to his seating in congress held not to moot the case because his claim for back salary remained a viable issue.standard fashion.suit to restrain contract violation held not mooted with the contract expiration if there is also a request for damages that is capable of ascertainment.
here,although the release of the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells into the stream of commerce removed the possibility of the relief originally requested,exclusion of the goods from entry,the government may still seek other relief by demanding redelivery of the goods and imposing liquidated damages on jazz for failure to redeliver.therefore,there remains a definite and concrete controversy between jazz and the government concerning the exclusion of the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells.
entry of the subject lffps 
affirmative.first sale 
on appeal,the government argues that the court of international trade erred as a matter of law in holding that jazz had demonstrated a first sale for the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells.the government asserts that under the first sale defense articulated in jazz i,jazz did not satisfy its burden.according to the government,the court reliance,even in part,upon the presumption of regularity is incorrect for three reasons first,the exclusion order does not prohibit the importation of used foreign lffps that were not first sold in the united states second,the exclusion order allows the importation of foreign lffps by tourists that were not first sold in the united states and third,ample evidence in the record rebuts any presumption that commercial quantities of unauthorized lffps were not in the united states market.the government points out that jazz was able to import substantial quantities of infringing lffps notwithstanding the exclusion order the commission found that of the lffps imported by jazz from to december were found to have infringed fuji patents.fuji essentially repeats the arguments made by the government on this issue and also contends that the testimony credited by the court was inadmissible as lay opinion and hearsay.fuji also argues that absent a presumption of regularity,there is no credible evidence as to the place of first sale for at least of the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells.
jazz responds that the court correctly applied the presumption of regularity,albeit in a limited way,to hold that the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells satisfied the first sale requirement.jazz points out that the court only applied the presumption of regularity to new lffps or single use cameras that had not been repaired,and did not apply the presumption to cameras repaired abroad whose importation had previously been held to infringe fuji patents or violate the exclusion order.according to jazz,the court properly applied the presumption of regularity because the government did not offer clear evidence to the contrary rebutting the presumption.jazz also argues that the court properly held that jazz overcame the presumption of correctness attached to customs decision to exclude the subject lffps because the government did not present a and the only evidence admitted at trial as to whether the subject lffps satisfied the first sale and permissible repair defense was provided by jazz.
we agree with jazz that the court did not err in holding that jazz satisfied the first sale defense for the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells.we articulated the affirmative defense of first sale and permissible repair in jazz i,holding that the unrestricted sale of a patented article,by or with the authority of the patentee,exhausts the patentee right to control further sale and use of that article by enforcing the patent under which it was first sold.at.we reasoned that when a patented device has been lawfully sold in the united states,subsequent purchasers inherit the same immunity under the doctrine of patent exhaustion so long as the device has been permissibly repaired.id.the party raising the affirmative defense has the burden of establishing it by a preponderance of the evidence.id.at.moreover,we have defined preponderance of the evidence in civil actions to mean the greater weight of evidence,evidence which is more convincing than the evidence which is offered in opposition to it.hale dep t of,fed.aviation.
here,jazz bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence its affirmative defense,and the trial court has the responsibility to weigh the evidence and evaluate the credibility of witnesses to determine whether jazz satisfied its burden.state,the weighing of conflicting evidence is a task within the special province of the trial judge who,having heard the evidence,is in a better position than we to evaluate it.at trial,jazz relied on evidence from silvera to establish its affirmative defense of first sale.silvera testified that photo recycling obtained approximately of its shells from national retailers in the united states operating internal photo processing labs,to of its shells from independent photo processors or small,wholesale photo finishing labs in the united states,and the remaining to of its shells from shell collectors in the united states he also testified that,as an industry standard,at least of disposable cameras developed at photo processing locations,such as national retailers or independent photo processors,were usually purchased from that same location.further,silvera testified that photo recycling required that the shells it purchased from shell collectors be accompanied by letter certifications indicating the shells in the cartons had been collected from photo processors in the united states.in addition,silvera testified that photo recycling sold over of the shells it had collected to polytech.
based on silvera demeanor,demonstrated knowledge of photo recycling business activities,and general knowledge of the business of collecting spent shells,the trial court credited his testimony and made factual findings corresponding to his assertions.decision,d at.the trial court then concluded that jazz had presented sufficient,unrebutted evidence to establish that the shells collected by photo recycling and subsequently used by polytech in producing lffps at issue in this case were collected from photo processors in the united states.id.at.we conclude that the trial court factual determinations were not clearly erroneous and its legal conclusion was not erroneous as a matter of law.
to be sure,jazz did not present direct evidence that each of the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells were first sold in the united states jazz case is circumstantial.however,jazz may carry its burden by presenting its case based upon circumstantial evidence.moleculon research cbs,citing michalic cleveland tankers,d it is hornbook law that direct evidence of a fact is not necessary.circumstantial evidence is not only sufficient,but may also be more certain,satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence.here,the circumstantial evidence offered by silvera tended to show that the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells were first sold in the united states.because the court was entitled to give weight to that evidence,we see no error in the court conclusion that jazz met its burden.
we reject the government and fuji argument that the trial court erred as a matter of law in applying the presumption of regularity to hold that jazz satisfied its evidentiary burden.the presumption of regularity supports official acts of public officers.in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary,the doctrine presumes that public officers have properly discharged their official duties.bernklau principi,citing butler principi.in the context of customs decisions,we have applied the presumption of regularity to presume that the import specialist properly performed his duties.ford motor united states,citation omitted.
here,the presumption of regularity operated to presume that certain new lffp shells collected by photo recycling were not illegally imported into the united states contrary to the exclusion order because customs would have excluded any infringing shells.however,the court made clear that the application of the presumption of regularity did not absolve jazz of its burden of proof jazz must meet its evidentiary burden through factual evidence establishing first sale that goes beyond the mere fact that the shells were obtained in the united states.decision,d at.accordingly,jazz offered evidence that at least of the shells collected by photo recycling from photo processors in the united states were purchased at the same location as where processing occurred.it follows that the trial court application of the presumption of regularity was limited to the remaining minority of shells that,according to silvera testimony,were not purchased at the same location as where processing occurred.the court application of the presumption of regularity was also limited to new single use cameras and did not include used foreign lffps.id.moreover,the government did not offer any evidence,much less clear evidence to the contrary,that would rebut this presumption for those specific lffps.nor did the government introduce any evidence tending to show that the performance of customs officers was irregular.based on the evidence presented,we conclude that the trial court limited reliance on the presumption of regularity to hold that jazz had established first sale by a preponderance of the evidence was not erroneous as a matter of law.our conclusion of course is limited to the particular circumstances of the exclusion order at issue in this case.
moreover,we disagree with the government that the trial court application of the presumption of regularity eviscerated the literal requirements of the first sale defense articulated in jazz whether jazz met its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence was decided by the trial court based on its weighing of the evidence.the government takes issue with the court statement that jazz and similarly situated companies can not reasonably be expected to have access to information that does or may exist,and would be expected to be proprietary to fuji and the licensees,from which the location of first sale of a shell could be ascertained to a certainty.id.at.however,there is no requirement that jazz establish the defense of first sale to a certainty or that jazz submit all commercially available evidence as to first sale to meet its burden.because the trial court permissibly weighed the evidence as to whether the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells satisfied the first sale defense,there is no error in the court conclusion that jazz met its burden of proof.
finally,the government other arguments on this issue are not persuasive.the government asserts that the presumption of regularity does not apply here because it does not provide a barrier to the importation of used foreign lffp shells entered lawfully under the exclusion order,it does not rule out the possibility that domestic photo processors could have obtained lffps from tourists who may lawfully bring lffps into the united states under the exclusion order,and it is rebutted by the commission finding that jazz had violated the exclusion order with respect to some of its product imported from various facilities in china from to december.we conclude that the government objections,while raising potential issues concerning the application of the presumption of regularity in general,do not establish that the trial court erred in applying the presumption to the specific facts of this case.
to meet its burden of proof,jazz was not required to prove to a certainty that there were no used foreign shells,infringing shells,and tourist shells in the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells.here,the theoretical possibility that used foreign shells,infringing shells,and tourist shells may exist in photo recycling shells did not necessarily mean that the specific lffps at issue in this case were processed from those shells.indeed,the government did not present any evidence at trial that any of the photo recycling shells used to make the subject lffps actually used foreign shells,infringing shells,or tourist shells.the court thus credited testimony offered by silvera that there was a very tiny number or de minimis amount of tourist shells that were first sold outside the united states that could possibly have been among the shells photo recycling collected from photo processors in the united states.decision,d at,t here is no record evidence from which the court may conclude that the subject merchandise actually includes cameras refurbished from tourist shells.
moreover,the commission ruling that jazz imported infringing cameras into the united states from august,through december,does not establish that the photo recycling shells used to make the subject lffps included infringing shells.similarly,that used foreign shells could have been imported into the united states does not establish that the photo recycling shells used to make the subject lffps were processed using any of those shells.we recognize that the government was not required to present evidence that the lffps at issue were actually processed from used foreign shells,infringing shells,and tourist shells.however,in the absence of such conflicting evidence,the court was entitled to give weight to jazz evidence.accordingly,there is no error in the court conclusion that jazz established first sale by a preponderance of the evidence.
permissible repair 
on appeal,the government argues that the court of international trade erred in holding that jazz established permissible repair for the subject lffps processed using photo recycling shells because jazz did not carry its burden of demonstrating that the repair process consisted of no more than the eight permissible steps identified in jazz i.according to the government,the court failure to identify various minor operations in polytech processing of the cameras is important because there is evidence in the record that polytech engaged in replacements in the past,which amounted to impermissible reconstruction.the government also contends that the court improperly relied on two videotapes as depicting the repair process performed by polytech,pointing out that the videotapes did not accurately reflect the process used to make the subject lffps.fuji essentially repeats the arguments made by the government on this issue and also contends that issue preclusion prevents the court from relying on the two videotapes to establish permissible repair because,in a separate enforcement proceeding decided by the commission in,jazz ii,the commission found that those same videotapes were not sufficient to show permissible repair.
jazz responds that the court failure to identify various minor operations did not mean that the subject lffps were impermissibly repaired because polytech had stopped engaging in replacements at the time the subject lffps were produced.according to jazz,the government argument that the various minor operations included replacements is mere speculation that is unsupported by evidence.jazz also argues that the court reliance on the two videotapes as showing permissible repair was proper because the commission finding as to the admissibility of a piece of evidence has no preclusive or binding effect on a court determination regarding that same evidence in a separate proceeding.jazz points out that the two videotapes were offered for a narrower purpose in this case than in the enforcement proceeding before the commission,and that zawodny testified as to all the steps of permissible repair depicted in the videotapes.
we agree with jazz that the trial court did not err in holding that the subject lffps were permissibly repaired in accordance with the standard set forth in jazz i.we held in jazz i that the following eight steps were permissible repair,not prohibited reconstruction removing the cardboard cover,cutting open the plastic casing,inserting new film and a container to receive the film,replacing the winding wheel for certain cameras,replacing the battery for flash cameras,resetting the counter,resealing the outer case,and adding a new cardboard cover.at.we reasoned 
the decisions of the supreme court require the conclusion that reconstruction of a patented entity,comprised of unpatented elements,is limited to such a true reconstruction of the entity as to in fact make a new article,after the entity,viewed as a whole,has become spent.in order to call the monopoly,conferred by the patent grant,into play for a second time,it must,indeed,be a second creation of the patented entity mere replacement of individual unpatented parts,one at a time,whether of the same part repeatedly or different parts successively,is no more than the lawful right of the owner to repair his property.this right of repair,provided that the activity does not in fact make a new article,accompanies the article to succeeding owners.
id.at quoting aro convertible top replacement,d internal citations omitted.here,the subject lffps were permissibly repaired under the standard set forth in jazz i because the steps did not in fact make a new single use camera.
the trial court found,based on zawodny testimony,that the processing undertaken by polytech for the subject lffps was 
opening of the body of the shell,replacement of the advance wheel,replacement of the film and of the battery if a flash camera,resetting the counter,closing and repairing the case using original parts except for the additional molded part referred to above,repackaging the refurbished camera,and various minor operations incidental to these processes.
decision,d at.the government does not challenge the trial court holding that the first six steps constituted permissible repair under jazz however,the government argues that the court did not properly determine whether various minor operations constituted permissible repair.we disagree.while there is no test for determining whether a device has been permissibly repaired,it does not turn on minor details.here,the court characterized the seventh step as various minor operations incidental to the first six steps.because the first six steps did not make a new single use camera,it follows that minor operations which were incidental to those steps also did not make a new single use camera.moreover,even if the trial court did not identify the specifics of each minor operation,the fact that they were incidental to the first six steps indicates that the court considered them to be known processes that were permissible repair.we thus discern no error in the court conclusion that those various minor operations did not make a new single use camera and thus constituted permissible repair.
we also disagree with the government position that the court failure to identify various minor operations was reversible error because it left open the possibility that the processing of the subject lffps included a full back replacement step,which would not have qualified as permissible repair.the trial court expressly rejected the possibility that the processing of the subject lffps included a full back replacement step,finding,based on zawodny testimony,that the various minor operations did not include full back replacements.decision,d at.evidence in the record supports the court determination,demonstrating that at the time the subject lffps were produced,polytech had stopped using full back replacements.because the government has not offered any evidence to the contrary,there was no clear error in its factual finding and we thus conclude that the court properly held that the subject lffps were permissibly repaired under jazz 
in addition,the government argues that the trial court conclusion that the subject lffps were permissibly repaired was incorrect because the court relied on two videotapes that did not accurately reflect the process used to make the subject lffps.that argument misses the point.after assessing all the evidence,the court gave weight to the two videotapes based on zawodny testimony.even if the government had presented any evidence to the contrary,which it did not,the trial court is in a better position to evaluate conflicting evidence than we are.accordingly,we discern no error in the court holding.moreover,that the commission accorded the two videotapes different weight in a previous proceeding,jazz ii,does not preclude the trial court from crediting the evidence in this case.the commission assessment of the two videotapes related to lffps imported by jazz from august,through december.the subject lffps in this case were imported by jazz in august.because the issue considered by the commission was not identical to the one considered by the trial court here,the commission determination has no preclusive effect on the trial court decision in this case.
segregation of jazz lffps 
on appeal,the government argues that the court of international trade erred in ordering customs to supervise jazz segregation of the lffps that the court deemed to be admissible and to release those lffps.the government contends that the court exceeded its authority by directing customs to assist in the segregation and in ordering the release of the goods.according to the government,compliance with the court order imposed significant administrative demands upon customs jazz,not customs,should have been responsible for segregating the admissible lffps from the inadmissible lffps.
jazz responds that supervision by customs was necessary to segregate the goods because the subject lffps were stored in a bonded warehouse owned by customs.jazz also contends that customs regulations and laws require that importers segregate commingled goods under the supervision of customs.according to jazz,even if the court erred in ordering customs to supervise jazz segregation of goods,the government has not shown how it was prejudiced by that error and does not justify reversal of the court order.
we agree with jazz that the trial court did not err in ordering customs to supervise the segregation of the subject lffps.cfr b provides that in customs warehouses customs shall supervise all transportation,receipts,deliveries,sampling,recordkeeping,repacking,manipulation,destruction,physical and procedural security,conditions of storage,and safety in the warehouse as required by law and regulations.id.emphasis added.under the regulation,customs is obligated to supervise certain activities in its warehouse and that supervision is mandatory,not discretionary.here,the subject lffps were stored in a customs warehouse,and the segregation of those goods necessarily involved manipulation of the merchandise.because customs was required to supervise the segregation of the subject lffps in its warehouse,we see no error in the trial court order.
moreover,we disagree with the government that compliance with the trial court order imposed significant administrative demands upon customs.the cou
