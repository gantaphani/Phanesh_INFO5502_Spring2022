tassilo bonzel appeals the decision of the united states district court for the district of minnesota dismissing this action on grounds of lack of jurisdiction and forum non conveniens.we affirm the dismissal on jurisdictional grounds,and conclude that the district court acted within its discretion in agreeing with the minnesota state court that this case would more conveniently be brought in germany,with potential return to forums in the united states should a german forum not be available.
background 
bonzel,a german citizen residing in germany,is the inventor of certain catheters for use in coronary angioplasty,patented in the united states by patent.the patented catheters are used in conjunction with the insertion of stents to keep coronary arteries open after they have been unblocked.the record states that catheters invented by bonzel are used in over a million procedures annually.
in bonzel granted an exclusive worldwide license to schneider ag,a swiss corporation that was at that time a subsidiary of pfizer.the license agreement was negotiated in germany in the german language,and by its terms is construed according to german law.a modification dated october,designated as agreement v,was also negotiated and drafted in germany and is subject to german law.it requires in section xii a that the licensee will notify bonzel of any infringement occurring in any country and will pay bonzel a portion of any monetary recovery in any infringement action,and contains other provisions relating to license payments.
in the schneider companies were sold by pfizer to boston scientific,carrying with it the exclusive license to bonzel patents.boston scientific united states subsidiaries boston scientific scimed and scimed life systems are described as successors of schneider,and are minnesota corporations.bonzel states that the sale was at least partly in settlement of a suit for infringement that had been brought in massachusetts by schneider europe ag.boston scientific schneider europe ag.settled march.bonzel states that in accordance with agreement v he is entitled to share in the proceeds of the sale.that is the substantive issue underlying this action.
bonzel filed suit in minnesota state court against several defendants pfizer,pfizer research and development,schneider ag,schneider,and schneider europe,joining boston scientific as an involuntary plaintiff,alleging breach of contract because,inter alia,the licensees did not notify bonzel of the patent infringement by boston scientific and the settlement whereby pfizer sold the schneider companies to boston scientific on terms that bonzel asserts included payment resolving the infringement issues.the defendants removed the case to the federal district court for the district of minnesota,asserting diversity jurisdiction,a,and that the patent aspects invoked federal jurisdiction under a.
bonzel moved to remand that federal action to the minnesota state court,stating that he was not charging infringement or seeking a declaration of patent rights,but was solely seeking enforcement of a contract and remedy for its breach.boston scientific was realigned as a defendant,and the federal district court then transferred the case back to the minnesota state court on the grounds of lack of diversity and lack of a federal question.with respect to diversity,the district court held that schneider ag or its successor schneider gmbh,the patent licensee under agreement v,is a necessary party,which barred diversity jurisdiction because they are foreign corporations and bonzel,the only plaintiff,is a foreign citizen.see a,federal jurisdiction for actions involving foreign citizens is available only where the actions are between citizens of a state and citizens or subjects of a foreign state citizens of different states and in which citizens or subjects of a foreign state are additional parties.the statute does not confer federal jurisdiction when foreign entities oppose each other unless the parties on both sides include united states citizens.the district court also held that the case did not arise under the patent law,accepting bonzel assertions,and the counts of the complaint,that the only issues were in contract and tort.
upon return to the minnesota state court,that court then dismissed the suit on the ground of forum non conveniens,with leave for bonzel to refile in germany or other more convenient forum.the state court was of the view that germany is the best place to locate the evidence and that it would be preferable for a german judge to resolve the issues of german law raised in interpreting a contract that by its terms is governed by german law.the minnesota state court left itself open to serve as a forum if bonzel is not able to obtain jurisdiction in germany.bonzel pfizer,no.judicial dist.july,counts of the first amended complaint are hereby severed and dismissed without prejudice as against all defendants in favor of a german forum.the court required the defendants to waive any claim to a statute of limitations as to the german forum.
bonzel appealed to the minnesota court of appeals,which observed that the contract is to be interpreted according to german law that the witnesses who negotiated the contract reside outside of minnesota the federal district court had stated that they reside in new york,massachusetts,germany,switzerland,and england that the dispute does not have a significant connection with minnesota and that there would be unwarranted administrative cost to the citizens of minnesota to try this case.the court stated 
the district court judge looked at the entirety of this case and decided two things there are not significant connections with minnesota,and german law is best interpreted and applied by german courts.both of these conclusions are reasonable after examination of this record,we can not conclude the district court abused its discretion nor erred as a matter of law.
bonzel pfizer,no,wl.july.
after this decision,bonzel filed a new action in the united states district court in minnesota.in distinction from his previous federal filing,bonzel now stated in his complaint that issues of patent infringement require determination.he also alleged,as before,that the schneider and scimed companies and pfizer had breached agreement v by failing to notify him of the patent infringement and failing to pay him the required share of the settlement,and various commercial torts related to these charges.he asserted subject matter jurisdiction under,general federal question under,diversity under,and supplemental jurisdiction under.
the district court held that there was no basis for federal jurisdiction,and alternatively that the suit would be dismissed for forum non conveniens for the reasons given by the minnesota state court.on these bases the federal district court dismissed this action with leave to refile in germany,observing that the minnesota state court had agreed to accept the case if jurisdiction is not available in germany.
bonzel appeals,arguing that the case is properly in a united states federal court because it raises a substantial question of united states patent law,and that he is entitled to a united states forum when a united states patent is central to the dispute and the principal parties in interest are united states companies.
