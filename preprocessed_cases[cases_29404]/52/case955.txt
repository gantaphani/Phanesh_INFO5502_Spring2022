plaintiff solvay solvay appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of delaware in favor of defendant honeywell international honeywell.the district court held that asserted claim of solvay patent the patent was invalid under g.this was so because engineers working at the russian scientific center for applied chemistry rscac first conceived the invention,which was reduced to practice in this country by honeywell personnel pursuant to the rscac instructions,and did not abandon,suppress,or conceal it.
background 
the question at the heart of this appeal is when an invention conceived by a foreign inventor and reduced to practice in the united states qualifies as prior art under g that section provides,a person shall be entitled to a patent unless before such person invention thereof,the invention was made in this country by another inventor who had not abandoned,suppressed,or concealed it.g.although section g initially was designed for determining priority of invention in interference proceedings,it is settled that the section has independent significance as a basis for prior art outside of the interference context.thomson,quixote,see also solvay honeywell solvay i,fed cir.a patent is invalid under that section if the claimed invention was made in this country by another inventor before the patent priority date.see,solvay i,at describing amendments to g.making the invention requires conception and reduction to practice.while conception is the formation,in the mind of the inventor,of a definite and permanent idea of a complete and operative invention,reduction to practice requires that the claimed invention work for its intended purpose.id.at citing hybritech,monoclonal antibodies.it is also necessary that the invention not be suppressed,abandoned,or concealed.see,apotex usa,merck.
our prior cases have illuminated what is meant by made in this country.see,solvay i,at citing mycogen plant,monsanto,apotex,at.although the inventors may reside in a foreign country and conceive the invention abroad,a reduction to practice made outside the united states is beyond the scope of g prior art.in other words,g allows conception to occur in another country,but in such circumstances requires the work constituting the reduction to practice to be performed in the united states by or on behalf of the inventor however,there is no requirement that the inventor be the one to reduce the invention to practice so long as the reduction to practice was done on his behalf in the united states.in re debaun,ccpa citing litchfield eigen,ccpa.consistent with that principle,a cts by others working explicitly or implicitly at the inventor request will inure to his benefit.donald chisum,chisum on patents.
here,honeywell contends that the invention was conceived by russian inventors outside the united states and reduced to practice in the united states by honeywell personnel following the russian inventors instructions before the patent priority date.it follows,argues honeywell,that the invention qualifies as g prior art.
solvay patent claims an improvement to a method of making a hydrofluorocarbon hfc known as hfc patent ll.hfc belongs to a group of hfcs that do not deplete the ozone layer and for that reason,are legislatively mandated to replace alternatives.hfc is especially useful in preparing polymeric materials commonly used for insulation in refrigeration and heat storage systems.the patent has a priority date of october.
in,before solvay priority date,honeywell and rscac personnel entered into a research contract.pursuant to that agreement,rscac engineers,working in russia,conducted process development studies for the commercial production of hfc.in july,the rscac sent honeywell a report documenting the development of a continuous process capable of producing high yields of hfc by reacting hcc with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of a catalyst.honeywell personnel in the united states used the rscac report to run the same process in this country in,before the patent october priority date 
solvay sued honeywell in the district of delaware,alleging that the process honeywell was using to manufacture hfc infringed certain claims of the patent.independent claim,the only claim at issue on appeal,reads 
in a process for the preparation of hfc comprising reaction of hcc with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of a hydrofluorination catalyst,the improvement which comprises carrying out the reaction at a temperature and under a pressure at which hfc is gaseous and isolating hfc from the reaction mixture by drawing off hfc and hydrogen chloride hcl in a gaseous phase as each of said and hcl is being formed.
honeywell defended,inter alia,on the ground that independent claim and dependent claims,and of the patent were invalid under g.honeywell initial theory was that its engineers had reduced the invention to practice in the united states and that this made the honeywell engineers inventors under g.
in,the district court construed the isolating limitation in claim to read 
the process for making hfc includes a reaction at a temperature and under a pressure whereby hfc and hcl are produced in gaseous form and separated from the reaction mixture in a gas stream that can include other compounds,such as unconverted reactants and chlorofluoropropanes possibly formed by incomplete fluorination of hcc.
emphasis added.the district court thus construed isolating to require separating hfc and hcl from the reaction mixture.id.it did not require separating only those components from the reactor.id.based on that claim construction,the district court ruled on summary judgment that honeywell process infringed claims,and.however,the district court granted summary judgment of invalidity as to claims,and under g on the ground that the honeywell engineers were other inventors who made the invention in this country without abandoning,suppressing,or concealing it 
the district court judgment was appealed to this court.on appeal,we agreed with the district court claim construction of the term isolating in claim,explaining that claim is not limited to isolating only hfc and hcl and residual amounts of other compounds.solvay i,at.we affirmed the district court ruling on summary judgment that claims,and were infringed.however,we reversed the finding that claims,and were invalid under g,explaining that honeywell personnel could not qualify as another inventor because they did not conceive the invention of the patent,but derived it from others,specifically,the rscac engineers who first conceived the invention in russia.id.at.
on remand,honeywell asserted an alternative theory as to why g applied,arguing that the russian inventors made the invention in this country by sending instructions to honeywell personnel who used the instructions to reduce the invention to practice in this country.the parties did not dispute the fact that,under the district court claim construction,the rscac process corresponded to the invention recited in claim of the patent or that the rscac engineers first conceived the invention and reduced it to practice in russia.but the parties disputed whether the honeywell reduction to practice should be attributed to the russian inventors and whether the russian inventors had disclosed the invention rather than abandoning,suppressing,or concealing it.although the district court held that,as a matter of law,the rscac engineers should be treated as inventors who made the invention in the united states under g,it denied summary judgment on the invalidity of claim because of genuine issues of material fact as to whether the rscac engineers disclosed their invention in a russian patent application rather than abandoning,suppressing,or concealing it.
eventually,a jury determined that,as required by g,the rscac did disclose the invention of claim in the russian patent application such that they did not abandon,suppress,or conceal it.based on the jury verdict,the district court entered judgment for honeywell,finding asserted claim invalid under g solvay appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the priority date for solvay patent is october.the parties do not dispute that if the russians conceived the invention and reduced it to practice in this country before that date without abandoning,suppressing,or concealing it,claim of solvay patent is invalid under g.on appeal,solvay does not dispute that the russians were first to conceive the invention recited in claim or that honeywell reduced it to practice in this country before solvay october,priority date,but challenges the jury finding of nonsuppression,and the district court ruling that the russians made the invention in this country.
as to the first issue,solvay argues that the district court erroneously construed claim and that the resulting instructions tainted the jury finding that the russians disclosed the invention in a russian patent application and,therefore,did not suppress or conceal it.in other words,solvay argues that the application did not satisfy g because the application did not disclose the full scope of the claims if they were properly construed.before addressing the merits of solvay claim construction contention,we consider whether solvay has waived its objection by failing to request in the district court the construction it now advocates.
the general rule is that an appellate court does not give consideration to issues not raised below.hormel helvering,see also singleton wulff.the doctrine of waiver has been applied to preclude a party from adopting a new claim construction position on appeal.interactive gift express,compuserve.a claim construction argument is considered new if a party change s the scope of the claim construction rather than clarifying or defending the original scope of its claim construction or supporting its existing claim construction position with new citations to the specification.id.
according to solvay,claim requires that hfc and hcl be removed from the reaction mixture permanently so that the hfc and hcl are not recycled back into the reactor.claim reads 
in a process for the preparation of hfc comprising reaction of hcc with hf in the presence of a hydrofluorination catalyst,the improvement which comprises carrying out the reaction at a temperature and under a pressure at which hfc is gaseous and isolating hfc from the reaction mixture by drawing off hfc and hcl in a gaseous phase as each of said hfc and hcl is being formed.
patent ll.emphasis added.
when this case was first appealed,this court upheld the district court construction of the term isolating in claim of the patent to mean drawing off or separating hfc and hcl from the reaction,but not necessarily purifying the material.solvay i,at.as a result,the gas stream conveying hfc from the reactor can include other compounds from the reaction mixture,not only hfc and hcl.the parties did not raise,and this court did not address,the issue of whether the hfc and hcl could return to the reactor after being drawn off initially.
near the end of the validity trial,however,a disagreement between the parties arose as to whether the reaction products had to be permanently isolated from the reaction mixture.solvay argued that isolating the reaction products necessarily required keeping them separated.in response,honeywell argued that requiring permanent separation contradicted the district court claim construction,affirmed by this court,as well as the plain language of the claim.
the district court held that,based on claim language,specification references,and this court construction of the term isolating,the reaction products did not have to be permanently isolated from the reaction mixture.the court granted honeywell request for a standard jury instruction that the term comprising means that the claim is not limited to a process that includes only what is in the claim and nothing else.at trial,honeywell argued that the patent could read on processes in which hfc and hcl return to the reaction mixture through additional steps after the initial separation.
solvay contends that the district court instruction reflected an erroneous interpretation of isolating.according to solvay,if given the correct interpretation,the jury might well have found that the russian application did not disclose solvay invention because in the rscac process,some gaseous hfc condenses back into a liquid and drips back into the reaction mixture after the initial separation.reply br.
the problem is that solvay did not ask the district court to modify the claim construction or accompanying jury instruction to require isolating to mean isolating permanently.when the issue surfaced at trial,it was raised by honeywell in response to solvay questioning of its expert witness.honeywell argued that solvay was attempting to make improper claim construction arguments to the jury.in response,solvay insisted that the isolating limitation necessarily implied permanence notwithstanding the ambiguity that the disagreement between the parties made apparent.the district court,which had not previously been asked to consider the issue of permanence,asked the parties to submit briefs on the issue.solvay,in its brief,still did not request any modification or clarification of the claim construction,reassert ing that it agree d with the court proposed construction.because solvay failed to object to the court construction or jury instruction with respect to the term isolating,it waived the issue and can not now raise novel arguments to redefine the scope of claim.see lizardtech,earth res.mapping,a party that agreed to the district court construction at the time can not on appeal argue against that claim construction simply because it resulted in an adverse ruling 
even if the claim construction issue had been properly raised,we see no error in the district court construction.claim construction is a question of law reviewed de novo.cybor fas.the conclusion that isolating means separating,and therefore does not preclude additional steps that could occur after the initial isolation,is consistent with the claims and specification.claim of the patent uses the transitional term comprises to define the bounds of the patented improvement.see patent.the meaning of comprising in a method claim indicates that the claim is and allows for additional steps.invitrogen biocrest,fed cir citing vivid,am.sci.eng g.
we agree with the district court that nothing in the claims or specification overcomes the meaning of comprises as a transitional term allowing for additional steps.solvay supports its position by pointing to a portion of the specification stating that i t is advantageous to separate the hfc and the hcl from the reaction mixture as they are being formed and to keep in,or return to,the reactor the unconverted reactants,as well as the chlorofluoropropanes possibly formed by incomplete fluorination of hcc.patent to.on its face,the statement pertains to recycling reactants,not reaction products,and does not expressly or impliedly preclude recycling reaction products to the reaction mixture as well.
solvay attempts to buttress its argument by pointing out that the reference in the specification corresponds to a statement in the patent prosecution history that purportedly shows that the isolation limitation was intended to distinguish the invention from the prior art,specifically the patent.reply br.according to solvay,it amended claim to avoid rejection in view of the patent and thus explained to the examiner that its invention enables hfc to be easily separated from the reaction mixture,which is an advantage as it makes it possible to retain or to return to the reactor the unconverted reactants and products of incomplete fluorination.as with the specification reference,the statement pertains only to recycling reactants and incomplete reaction products and does not require or hcl to be isolated once and for all time when they first leave the reaction mixture in gaseous form.it does not follow that distinguishing a process on the basis of the continuous removal of reaction products also requires such removal to be permanent.continuous removal pertains to the status of the reaction and does not connote or require permanence with respect to steps occurring after products are formed and removed while the reaction is still ongoing.we find no legal error in the court claim construction.under this claim construction,solvay does not on appeal contest that the russian patent application sufficiently disclosed the invention 
solvay urges that,even under the district court claim construction,the requirements of g are not satisfied.solvay does not dispute that honeywell fully performed the rscac process for making hfc in the united states before the patent october priority date.nor is it disputed that,under the district court claim construction,the rscac process corresponds to the invention claimed by the patent.instead,solvay argues that the doctrine of inurement,defining when the activities of others inure to the benefit of the inventor,controls the question of whether honeywell work can be attributed to the rscac engineers,and the undisputed facts do not establish inurement because the rscac engineers did not expressly ask the honeywell researchers to perform the inventive process.
assuming that the inurement doctrine governs,inurement does not require that the inventor expressly request or direct the to perform reductive work.to be sure,no inurement can arise from a third party unwarranted and hostile use of another invention,burgess wetmore.comm r pat,no inurement of reduction to practice built by rival applicant,but an express request or direction is not required.the request may be implicit.cooper goldfarb.in hogue cowling,ccpa,a third party reduction to practice inured to the benefit of the inventor,who disclosed his idea for a confection making apparatus to the manager of a popsicle company and suggested that the latter sketch the invention.the manager did not merely make a sketch,but built and tested a working device,believing he was acting in accordance with the inventor wishes.id.at.the inventor knew nothing about the third party work,but was still able to claim it as his own to establish the priority of his invention.
similarly,in learned thompson,ccpa,an inventor benefited from work performed by a third party with whom he had no direct communication.the inventor,learned,disclosed his invention and offered it to the united states government,which then turned the disclosure over to an employee,who reduced the invention to practice.id.at.the employee even filed his own patent application for improvements he made,although he later abandoned that application in the first inventor favor.id.at.the court treated the reduction to practice as the inventor because he had given authorization to the government to use his invention.id.at.the inventor authorization was sufficient even though he never asked the government or its employee to reduce the invention to practice nor supervised the reductive work.
in kendall searles,ccpa,as with honeywell and the rscac,fafnir and westinghouse had a joint program of development.the inventor,an official at fafnir,conceived the invention and communicated his conception to westinghouse,which conducted tests necessary to establish the inventor reduction to practice and the priority of his invention.id.at.although it appears that the inventor did not have anything to do with the tests conducted by westinghouse,those tests were held to inure to his benefit.id.at.
thus,our case law does not support solvay contention that an inventor must make an express directive or request to benefit from a third party reduction to practice.rather,inurement exists if the inventor authorizes another to reduce his invention to practice.here,the research agreement between the rscac and honeywell confirms that the rscac authorized honeywell to practice its invention in the united states and contemplated that honeywell would do so.the contract stated that rscac will assist honeywell in the development of manufacturing processes for hydrofluorocarbon compounds hfcs or hydrofluorocarbon ethers hfc ethers.pursuant to that agreement,honeywell promised to provide yearly compensation,information,and equipment,while the russians agreed to produce kg of hfc,develop production processes,and send regular reports to honeywell detailing their results and progress.while title and rights to inventions would belong to honeywell,the rscac could make,use,and sell those inventions in russia.the collaborative research arrangement between honeywell and the rscac thus parallels the joint development program in kendall,at.
solvay does not suggest that the rscac did not intend for honeywell to use the information it sent or that it did not authorize honeywell to reproduce the process it described.the undisputed facts show that the rscac authorized honeywell to practice its invention and specifically contemplated that it would do so under the companies joint research agreement aimed at developing commercial processes for the production of hfc.the rscac engineers gave honeywell personnel the information they needed to perform the inventive process in this country in july,and honeywell relied on that information in so doing.as we noted in our earlier decision,in early,honeywell replicated the russian process by following the information provided by rscac,thereby practicing the invention in the united states before the patent priority date.solvay i,at emphasis added.
solvay argues that there can be no inurement here because honeywell independently benefited from performing the rscac process.solvay in particular points to honeywell subsequent filing of its own patent application and notes that in burgess,the existence of a rival patent application was held,in part,to defeat inurement.but learned shows that the mere filing of a related patent application does not in itself preclude inurement.here,the russians applied for and received a patent in russia,while honeywell filed a patent application in the united states.the parties did not view these applications as rivals,providing that honeywell was entitled to exclusive rights to inventions resulting from the collaboration while the russians were entitled only to sublicenses.
we therefore agree with the district court that the process invented by the russian engineers was made in this country when honeywell successfully performed the process because the russians authorized honeywell personnel to practice the invention and specifically contemplated that they would do so we affirm the district court judgment that the patent is invalid under g 
the court today creates a new class of secret prior art,holding that a privately performed experiment,without publication or public knowledge or use or sale or inclusion in a united states patent application,is invalidating prior art.heretofore the role of secret prior art has been carefully circumscribed.the new general rule here adopted contravenes the policy and the letter of patent law,wherein inventors are charged only with knowledge of what is known or knowable as defined by statute,subject to special limited circumstances.
the panel majority holds that private secret activity in this case honeywell evaluation of russian technology that had been invented in russia and placed in an unpublished russian patent application is prior art against all others,thereby invalidating the solvay patent.the panel majority does not recognize the unavailability of an interference contest,for there is no united states counterpart to the russian patent application.
in the prior appeal of this case,solvay honeywell int l,solvay i,this court confirmed that the russian invention was conceived and reduced to practice in russia,and that honeywell repetition of the process in the united states was not an invention made in the united states.testing the invention of another is not an act of invention by the tester.this aspect was finally resolved in solvay i,the court describing honeywell work in the united states as a derivation of the russian invention.the matter was finally decided it is not open for redetermination.
undaunted,the panel majority now rules that honeywell activity was a reduction to practice of the russian process.the duplication of the prior invention of another does not convert either that prior invention or its duplication into prior art.the issue here is not priority between th
