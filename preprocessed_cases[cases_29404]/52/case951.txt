mckesson hboc,an american corporation,owns a minority interest in an iranian dairy.following iran islamic revolution,the dairy cut off the flow of capital and other material to mckesson,froze out mckesson board members,and stopped paying mckesson dividends.after years of litigation,including two appeals to this court,the district court granted summary judgment for mckesson,holding the islamic republic of iran liable for expropriating mckesson equity in the dairy.following a bench trial on the value of mckesson holdings,the district court ordered iran to pay over million in compensation for,among other things,expropriated equity and withheld dividends.in this appeal,iran argues that federal courts lack jurisdiction over it,that material issues exist as to its liability for expropriation,and that the district court erred in valuing mckesson assets.mckesson,challenging the district court assessment of simple rather than compound interest.we affirm in most respects.jurisdiction exists pursuant to the foreign sovereign immunities act exception for commercial acts of a foreign sovereign that cause direct effects in the united states.the district court careful consideration of the valuation evidence easily survives review.and although the district court may have erred in finding that international law precludes awards of compound interest,it acted well within its broad discretion to grant simple interest.but because we find that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether iranian corporate law excused the dairy withholding of dividends,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on the issue of iran liability for expropriating mckesson equity and remand that portion of the case for trial.
for many years prior to iran islamic revolution,mckesson hboc,appellee and,contributed capital and personnel to sherkat sahami labaniat pasteurize pak,an iranian dairy pak dairy.mckesson representatives made up a majority of pak dairy board of directors.
following the revolution,mckesson ties with pak dairy began to weaken.it no longer received its standard yearly dividends,and soon lost control of the dairy board,withdrawing its last two directors in october.since then,mckesson has neither participated in pak dairy business nor received shareholder communications or compensation for its investment,even though it still owns a percent interest in the dairy.
in,mckesson,along with its insurer,the overseas private investment corporation opic,filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia alleging that the islamic republic of iran,appellant and,illegally expropriated mckesson interest in pak dairy.pursuant to executive order,fed.reg,mckesson claim was transferred to the newly created states claims tribunal which,by virtue of the algiers accords which settled the iran hostage crisis,had exclusive jurisdiction over suits involving american claims to frozen iranian assets.see generally declaration of the government of the democratic and popular republic of algeria.although the claims tribunal decided that iran interference with mckesson rights had not amounted to an expropriation by january,the tribunal jurisdictional date,it did find that pak dairy had illegally withheld mckesson and dividends.foremost tehran,iran,cl.trib.the tribunal awarded mckesson in excess of as compensation for withheld dividends,plus approximately for related claims.id.at.
renewing its claim in district court,mckesson argued that iran had expropriated its equity in pak dairy after the tribunal jurisdictional date.iran moved to dismiss,arguing primarily that the foreign sovereign immunities act of fsia,rendered it immune from suit in federal court.the district court denied this motion,and we affirmed in part and remanded in part.see,islamic republic of iran,mckesson i.in doing so,we held that mckesson had provided adequate evidence of federal jurisdiction pursuant to the fsia exception for suits based on commercial activity that causes a direct effect in the united states.a see mckesson i,at.subsequently,iran again challenged federal jurisdiction,arguing among other things that an intervening supreme court decision,republic of argentina weltover,d,undermined mckesson mckesson islamic republic of iran,mckesson ii.distinguishing weltover and deferring to mckesson i,we affirmed the district court denial of iran renewed motion to dismiss.id.at.
with the jurisdictional issue as we shall soon see,not,both parties moved for summary judgment on liability.granting summary judgment for mckesson,mckesson islamic republic of iran,mem.op.at,wl june,the district court scheduled a bench trial to determine damages.just before trial,iran once again moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that the international guaranty agreement iga,which governs the resolution of claims against iran to which the united states government and its instrumentalities are subrogated,requires arbitration rather than litigation.the district court denied the motion,heard several weeks of testimony on valuation,and then issued findings valuing mckesson equity in pak dairy,dividends,and simple just over million.mckesson islamic republic of iran,mem.op.at,d.the district court denied mckesson subsequent motion for reconsideration of the court assessment of simple rather than compound interest.mckesson islamic republic of iran,mem.op.at.
iran now appeals the grant of summary judgment on liability as well as the district court valuation of mckesson holdings in pak dairy.iran also appeals the district court rejection of its fsia and iga jurisdictional arguments.mckesson the denial of its motion for reconsideration of the decision to award only simple interest.
we begin with iran jurisdictional arguments.a foreign nation entitlement to sovereign immunity raises questions of law reviewable de novo.princz fed.republic of germany.
the fsia immunizes foreign sovereigns,as well as their agents and instrumentalities,from federal court jurisdiction,see a,unless the case falls within one of several exceptions specified in the act,see id.see also argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d t he fsia provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this country.mckesson argues,and the district court held,that jurisdiction over iran exists pursuant to the fsia exception for any case in which the action is based upon a commercial activity of the foreign state that causes a direct effect in the united states.a b.
this court has twice considered whether the commercial activity exception applies to mckesson claim,holding both times that the alleged effects of iran the of the constant flow of capital,management personnel,engineering data,machinery,equipment,materials and packaging between the two companies,mckesson i,at,as well as the abrupt end of mckesson role as an active investor,mckesson ii,at sufficiently direct to create federal jurisdiction.it is true,as iran stresses,that our two earlier decisions found mckesson jurisdictional showing sufficient only to survive a motion to dismiss,id.at,whereas this time we review a district court order granting summary judgment.though we do not here assume the validity of mckesson factual assertions,see united states gaubert,d,this distinction makes no difference,for iran does not dispute the particular facts on which our two earlier decisions relied.indeed,the district court,reviewing the record without obligation to assume the veracity of either party assertions,cited the same facts that mckesson i and mckesson ii found sufficient for direct effects jurisdiction.see mckesson islamic republic of iran,mem.op.at,wl june.because we are presented with jurisdictional facts identical to the ones relied on by our two earlier decisions,and because iran does not challenge the veracity of those facts it challenges only their sufficiency,the law of the case doctrine requires us to follow those two decisions.mckesson ii,at l doctrine holds that decisions rendered on the first appeal should not be revisited on later trips to the appellate court.quoting crocker piedmont aviation,internal quotation marks omitted.as we said in mckesson i,the alleged effects of american corporations in their ownership of pak dairy are at least as substantial and direct as effects alleged in prior cases in which this court and other circuits have found direct effects.mckesson i,at.
iran argues that even if some elements of its expropriation had direct effects in the united states,federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction over one particular aspect of that claim pak dairy withholding of mckesson dividends.in support of this proposition,iran argues first that in kingdom of saudi arabia nelson,d,the supreme court established an exclusionary principle under which no fact that could not have independently served as grounds for jurisdiction may serve as a basis for a foreign state liability,and second,that the direct effects exception to claims based on commercial transactions does not apply where,as here,the place of payment lies outside the united states.in our view,the first argument has no merit,thus rendering the second irrelevant.nelson held that jurisdiction can not exist unless the commercial activity that forms the basis for jurisdiction also serves as the predicate for the plaintiff substantive cause of action.see at.here,mckesson extensive showing of direct effects flowing from the commercial activity on which its cause of action rests establishes the nexus found lacking in nelson.regardless of whether denial of dividends alone would give rise to federal court jurisdiction under the fsia exception,because the net effect of pak dairy of commercial ties included not just nonpayment,but also the cessation of the flow of capital,management personnel,engineering data,machinery,equipment,materials and packaging,mckesson i,at,the district court rightly considered the dividends issue both in determining that iran had expropriated mckesson equity interest and in awarding damages for that expropriation.
iran alternative jurisdictional argument rests on the international guaranty agreement arbitration clause a ny claim against the government of iran to which the government of the united states may be subrogated as a result of any payment under such guaranty shall be the subject of direct negotiation between the two governments.agreement on guaranty of private investments.according to iran,this clause applies to opic claims because opic insured mckesson interest in pak dairy,thus precluding federal court jurisdiction.acknowledging that opic is a government instrumentality within the meaning of the iga,mckesson argues that iran has waived its iga argument.as mckesson points out,iran has actively litigated this case for nine years,never once mentioning the arbitration clause nor attempting to begin iga arbitration proceedings.iran responds that jurisdiction can not be waived.
we need not determine whether iran waived this defense,however,for in our view,although the iga might well bar opic from proceeding,it has no effect on the district court jurisdiction over mckesson claims.even though opic has compensated mckesson for part of its loss,mckesson still owns title to its equity in pak dairy and to its unpaid dividends,and it is that where an insured party holds title to confiscated property,the title holder is the appropriate party to bring a claim for compensation.see mobile montgomery ry.jurey.foremost tehran,cl.trib.at t he governing law of the settlement agreements,that of the district of columbia,like other common law systems,provides that an insured party who assigns a limited interest to its insurer is the proper party to bring a claim for compensation for the entire loss.restatement second of trusts.the settlement agreement between mckesson and opic states that mckesson will maintain the legal title in and to all of the aforesaid items for the benefit of and in trust for opic.foremost tehran,cl.trib.at quoting august,settlement agreement between opic and mckesson.relying on this language,the claims tribunal held that mckesson is legally entitled to pursue a claim for recovery of the insured portion of its losses as well as the uninsured portion r ecovery by mckesson of a measure of compensation from its insurers can not affect its title to the claim against iran.id.at.the iga thus presents no bar to federal court jurisdiction in this case.
this brings us to iran contention that the district court prematurely granted summary judgment on liability in mckesson favor.a court may grant summary judgment only when it finds no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.to defeat a motion for summary judgment,the opposing party for purposes of this issue,iran must demonstrate the existence of disputed issues by reference to affidavits or other materials that set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.e.the court must resolve any doubts and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the opposing party.abraham graphic arts int l union.we review grants of summary judgment de novo.summers dep t of justice.
iran first challenges the district court conclusion that an agreement between iran and the united states,the treaty of amity,gave mckesson a right to recover its expropriated property.although treaties are the supreme law of the land,const.art.vi,cl,they provide no basis for private lawsuits unless implemented by appropriate legislation or intended to be,see libyan arab republic,bork,concurring,cert.denied,d.if a treaty contains language clearly indicating its status as,courts regard that language as conclusive.see cardenas smith,see also,at bork,concurring noting that treaties that speak in terms of individual rights may be regarded as.the treaty of amity contains just such language it explicitly creates property rights for foreign nationals,see treaty of amity,economic relations,and consular rights,art.iv,cl,p roperty of foreign nationals shall not be taken except for a public purpose,nor shall it be taken without just compensation,and contemplates judicial enforcement of those rights,see id.art.iv,cl.each high contracting party shall assure that the lawful contractual rights of foreign nationals are afforded effective means of enforcement.
iran does not dispute that the treaty of amity creates enforceable rights,but instead contends that its clause stating that p roperty of nationals and companies of either high contracting party,including interests in property,shall receive the most constant protection and security within the territories of the other high contracting party,treaty of amity art.vi,cl,only confers a right of action on an iranian citizen in a court,appellant opening br.at.as the district court convincingly observed,however,although this language suggests that one party will receive protections within the territory of the other party,it does say that those protections can only be enforced in the territory of the other party.mckesson islamic republic of iran,mem.op.at,wl june.such a limited interpretation,moreover,flatly conflicts with the treaty property of because iran courts can not provide adequate remedies for claims.see rockwell int l systems,citibank,cir noting that federal courts have consistently rejected the proposition that the iranian court system can afford adequate remedies to claimants.
iran next argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because it raised genuine issues of material fact as to whether pak dairy refusal to pay mckesson dividends was justified by mckesson failure to comply with iranian corporate,the requirement that shareholders must come to the company to collect their dividends.though skeptical of this requirement,the district court granted summary judgment because,even if the requirement existed,mckesson compliance with it would have been futile.this is a tricky issue,but reviewing the record ourselves,we think iran has raised genuine issues of material fact sufficient to survive summary judgment on liability.
we begin with iran contention that its corporate law requires shareholders to come to the company that is,to physically appear at a company order to collect dividends.mckesson argues that this requirement merely reflects custom and therefore tha
