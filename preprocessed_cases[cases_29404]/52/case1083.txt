an action seeking recognition and enforcement of a foreign money judgment under the uniform foreign recognition act is subject to the statute of limitations applicable to actions on sister state judgments code of civil procedure section,subdivision,rather than to the statute of limitations in code of civil procedure section.
factual and procedural background 
on december,renato guimaraes,a brazilian lawyer,filed a complaint against northrop grumman corporation.guimaraes sought recognition and enforcement of a judgment for attorney fees rendered in brazil.guimaraes filed his first amended complaint,and summons was issued and filed on the first amended complaint,on may.
the judgment guimaraes sought to enforce was rendered in brazil on june.the judgment occurred in a lawsuit filed after the crash of a brazilian aircraft in october,in which persons were killed.many of the families of crash victims filed lawsuits in orange county,but northrop obtained a stay of those cases on forum non conveniens grounds,and agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the brazilian courts.guimaraes and another brazilian lawyer,irineu strenger,then brought an action in brazil.the brazilian court rendered a judgment in favor of the families,concluding the initiating cause of the crash was a malfunction of a thrust reverser manufactured by northrop.the judgment awarded damages against northrop aggregating more than million,and included an award of attorney fees in the amount of percent of the damages.northrop appealed the judgment,and subsequently reached settlements with many of the families.
guimaraes complaint seeking recognition of the judgment for attorney fees alleged that,under brazilian law,the award of attorney fees is a judgment in favor of the attorneys,not the families.it vests immediately and is not subject to any appeal in brazil with respect to any of the cases that have settled.guimaraes asked the court,under the uniform foreign recognition act uniform act,to recognize and enforce the judgment to the extent that judgment awards attorneys fees,by entering a domestic judgment in a dollar amount equivalent to the amount of the brazilian judgment,with interest,costs,and fees as appropriate.
northrop demurred to guimaraes first amended complaint on two grounds first,it was barred by the statute of limitations and second,strenger,the other attorney in whose favor attorney fees were awarded,was an indispensable party without whom the action could not proceed.the trial court concluded the action was by the statute of limitations in code of civil procedure section.the court,in the alternative,dismissed the action without prejudice for failure to join strenger as an indispensable party.
guimaraes moved for reconsideration based on new facts presented through the declaration of clito fornaciari fornaciari,a professor of civil procedure and former president of the sao paulo state attorneys association,stated that a judgment for attorney fees is not final and enforceable in brazil while the judgment is on appeal.thus,even if the statute of limitations for filing an action under the uniform act were four years,the judgment for attorney fees as to any particular family case would not become final and enforceable,and guimaraes cause of action under the uniform act therefore did not accrue,until that family concluded a settlement.guimaraes contended he could amend his complaint to allege that numerous settlements occurred within four years of his filing this action.he also presented a declaration from his attorney showing that strenger had agreed to join the litigation as a plaintiff.
a week after guimaraes moved for reconsideration,the trial court signed and entered a judgment dismissing his action with prejudice.guimaraes motion for reconsideration,as well as a subsequent motion to set aside the judgment and for a new trial,were denied,and northrop objections to guimaraes expert declarations on brazilian law were sustained.
guimaraes filed a timely appeal.this court granted a request by benedon serlin,a law firm active in the representation of businesses and individuals who have brought collection actions in california involving foreign judgments,to file an amicus curiae brief in support of guimaraes.
discussion 
this case presents a question of first impression in california what statute of limitations is applicable to an action,brought under the uniform act,for the recognition and enforcement of a foreign money judgment the parties and amicus curiae offer three different answers 
northrop contends a supreme court case decided in provides the answer.dore thornburgh cal,held that an action to recover on a judgment rendered by an english tribunal was subject to the statute of limitations applicable to actions not hereinbefore provided for code civ.
guimaraes contends the statute of limitations on an action for recognition and enforcement of a foreign money judgment is years,based on the uniform act code civ,and code of civil procedure section section states that a foreign money judgment is enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state which is entitled to full faith and credit,and section,subdivision,sets a limitations period for a n action upon a judgment or decree of any court of the united states or of any state within the united states.
amicus curiae argue that an action under the uniform act is timely so long as it is enforceable in the country where the judgment was rendered.
we conclude the trial court erred in applying the statute,and instead should have applied the statute of limitations applicable to actions on judgments of courts of the united states and sister state courts before turning to that issue,we briefly describe the contours of the law applicable to the recognition and enforcement of foreign money judgments.
a.the uniform act.
foreign money judgments may be enforced in california if they meet the requirements of the uniform act and the creditor brings an action in california to obtain a domestic judgment.see renoir redstar th,d renoir.the pertinent provisions of the act are these 
the act applies to any foreign judgment that is final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered even though an appeal therefrom is pending or it is subject to appeal.
unless specified grounds for of the foreign money judgment exist,t he foreign judgment is enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state which is entitled to full faith and credit.the only exception is that foreign judgments may not be enforced under the registration procedure used for the enforcement of sister state judgments.see.
the court may stay the action if the defendant satisfies the court that an appeal of the foreign judgment is pending or that the defendant is entitled and intends to appeal.
the act is to be so construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those states which enact it.
guimaraes action for recognition and enforcement of the brazilian judgment for attorney fees is subject to the statute of limitations applicable to actions on sister state judgments.
in this case,we address the continued vitality of our supreme court decision in dore thornburgh,supra,cal.at pages,applying the statute of limitations for actions not hereinbefore provided for to an action to recover on a foreign judgment.we conclude the legislature enactment,more than years after dore thornburgh,of a statute of limitations for an action on a sister state judgment,and its subsequent passage of the uniform act in,making a foreign judgment enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state,effectively eliminated dore basis for applying the statute to foreign judgments.in other words,in,an action on a foreign judgment was not embraced in any limitations period prescribed by the legislature,and therefore necessarily fell within section.dore thornburgh,supra,cal.at.the same circumstances do not exist today.the legislature enactment of a limitations period for a sister state judgment,and its decision to make foreign judgments enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state,changed the fundamental underpinnings of dore thorn
