westfall act immunity 
the panel affirmed the district court dismissal,due to plaintiff failure to exhaust her administrative remedies,of her action after the district court,pursuant to the westfall act,substituted former officials of the president george bush administration for the united states as the sole defendant.
plaintiff alleged that former officials of the president george bush administration engaged in the war against iraq in violation of the alien tort statute.the district court held that plaintiff had not exhausted her administrative remedies as required by the federal tort claims act.
the panel held that the individual defendants were entitled to official immunity under the westfall act,which accords federal employees immunity from tort claims for acts undertaken in the course of their official duties.applying the plain language of the westfall act and district of columbia respondeat superior law to the facts alleged in the operative complaint,the panel held that the individual defendants alleged actions fell within the scope of their employment.the panel further held that the treaties and charters cited by plaintiff did not alter its conclusion that the westfall act,by its plain terms,immunized defendants from suit.finally,the panel held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff an evidentiary hearing to challenge the attorney general scope certification wherein the attorney general determined that the employees were acting within the scope of their employment and transformed the action into one against the united states.
the panel rejected plaintiff argument that defendants could not be immune under the westfall act because plaintiff alleged violations of a jus cogens norm of international law.a jus cogens norm is recognized by the international community as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law.the panel held that congress can also provide immunity for federal officers for jus cogens violations pursuant to the reasoning in siderman de blake argentina,cir.holding that congress can provide immunity to a foreign government for its jus cogens violations,even when such immunity is inconsistent with principles of international law.
graber,circuit judge 
plaintiff sundus shaker saleh sues several individuals who served as officials in the administration of president george bush.plaintiff claims that the former officials conspired to engage in,and did engage in,a war of aggression against iraq and that,in doing so,they violated the law of nations within the meaning of the alien tort statute ats.the district court substituted the united states for the officials as the sole defendant pursuant to the westfall act,d,and then dismissed the case because plaintiff had not exhausted her administrative remedies as required by the federal tort claims act ftca.plaintiff argues that substitution of the united states was improper because the former officials are not entitled to official immunity.because we conclude that the individual defendants are entitled to official immunity under the westfall act and that the united states properly was substituted as the sole defendant,we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
in,kurdish army troops forced plaintiff and her family to leave their home in jalawla,iraq,and flee to baghdad.the troops,who were aligned with the united states,were taking part in what has become known as the iraq war,a military action that officially began on march,but that,plaintiff claims,defendants had been planning for years.plaintiff endured many hardships in baghdad.eventually she was forced to leave iraq and move to jordan.in this case,she seeks to represent a class of persons consisting of all innocent iraqi civilians who,through no fault of their own,suffered damage from the iraq war.
plaintiff claims that defendants cheney,rumsfeld,and wolfowitz began advocating for an invasion of iraq and for the removal of iraqi president saddam hussein from power as early as.in january,rumsfeld and wolfowitz sent president clinton a letter urging him to implement a strategy for removing saddam regime from power,which included a willingness to undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing.emphasis in complaint.they sent a similar letter to speaker of the house newt gingrich and senate majority leader trent lott later that year.
defendant bush became president in january,and appointed the other defendants to positions within his administration.according to plaintiff,defendants almost immediately began to discuss a possible invasion and occupation of iraq,with defendant rumsfeld stating at an early national security council meeting that what we really want to think about is going after saddam.as secretary paul later put it 
from the start,we were building the case against hussein and looking at how we could take him out and change iraq into a new country.and,if we did that,it would solve everything.it was all about finding a way to do it.that was the tone of it.the president saying,fine.go find me a way to do this.
emphasis in complaint.
according to plaintiff,the september,attacks provided defendants with a pretext to launch an invasion of iraq.defendants wolfowitz and rumsfeld openly pushed for war against iraq on the day of the attacks,despite the lack of evidence tying iraq to the attacks.defendant bush was less eager to take action without evidence of a link between iraq and the september attackers.he asked various officials to go back over everything to try to find evidence that saddam hussein had been involved with al qaeda.over the course of the next year or so,defendants began planning for the invasion of iraq,even as they struggled to find such a link.
beginning around august,defendants allegedly mounted a coordinated campaign to convince the public,the congress and the allies of the need to confront the threat from saddam hussein.as part of that campaign,defendants and others continually used fabricated intelligence from unreliable sources in order to prep the public for an invasion of iraq.for instance,defendant bush claimed in his state of the union address that iraq had tried to obtain large quantities of uranium from africa,despite the fact that this claim was unconfirmed and highly unlikely.during that time period,defendants also continued to plan for an invasion of iraq.according to plaintiff,defendants were committed to the invasion whether or not the united nations approved of the action and whether or not united nations inspectors uncovered evidence that iraq was developing nuclear weapons.
on march,international atomic energy agency director general mohamed elbaradei reported to the un security council that there was no indication of resumed nuclear activities,that iraq has attempted to import uranium,or that iraq has attempted to import aluminum tubes for use in centrifuge enrichment.nonetheless,less than two weeks later,the united states invaded iraq.congress authorized the use of military force to defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq.authorization for use of military force against iraq resolution of,pub,stat.authorization for use of military force,but defendants did not secure united nations authorization for the war.
plaintiff brought this action in.she alleges that defendants conduct in planning and executing the iraq war amounted to the crime of aggression and a conspiracy to commit the crime of aggression which she claims was a violation of the law of nations within the meaning of the ats.after she filed an amended complaint in september,the united states filed a certification that defendants had been acting within the scope of their federal office or employment at the time of the incidents at issue in this matter.under d,the united states was then substituted as the sole defendant.thereafter,the amended complaint was dismissed because plaintiff had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as required by the ftca,a.plaintiff filed a second amended complaint.the united states again filed a scope certification,and the district court again substituted the united states and dismissed the action,this time with prejudice.the district court also denied plaintiff motion for an evidentiary hearing to challenge the scope certification.plaintiff timely appeals both the dismissal of the action and the denial of her motion for an evidentiary hearing.

discussion 
the alien tort statute grants district courts original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.not every violation of the law of nations gives rise to a claim that can be brought under the ats.rather,any claim based on the law of nations must rest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the paradigms that the drafters of the ats had in mind violation of safe conducts,infringement of the rights of ambassadors,and piracy.sosa.the set of ats torts violations of norms of international law giving rise to claims cognizable under the ats is,therefore,not frozen in time,but the supreme court has instructed us to be wary of adding to that set.see id.at t he door to further independent judicial recognition of actionable international norms is still ajar subject to vigilant doorkeeping,and thus open to a narrow class of international norms today.perhaps not surprisingly,only a few new ats torts have been recognized by federal appellate courts since sosa was decided.see,doe i nestle usa,cir.holding that a violation of the prohibition against slavery gives rise to a claim under the ats abdullahi pfizer,cir.concluding that a violation of the prohibition against nonconsensual human medical experimentation is an ats tort.
plaintiff asks us to recognize a violation of the norm against aggression as an ats tort.we need not decide that issue.assuming,without deciding,that engaging in aggression constitutes an ats tort plaintiff claims against defendants nonetheless fail,because congress has granted defendants official immunity from those claims.the only proper defendant in this case is therefore the united states,and plaintiff claims against the united states are barred because plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by the ftca.
we first address the question whether defendants are entitled to immunity under the terms of the westfall act.we then address plaintiff argument that,even if the westfall act purports to confer immunity on defendants,immunity can not attach because plaintiff has alleged that defendants violated a jus cogens norm of international law 
defendants official immunity under the westfall act 
the concept of the immunity of government officers from personal liability springs from the same root considerations that generated the doctrine of sovereign immunity.while the latter doctrine that the king can do no wrong did not protect all government officers from personal liability,the common law soon recognized the necessity of permitting officials to perform their official functions free from the threat of suits for personal liability.scheuer rhodes,abrogated on other grounds by harlow fitzgerald.t he scope of absolute official immunity afforded federal employees is a matter of federal law,to be formulated by the courts in the absence of legislative action by congress.westfall erwin,internal quotation marks omitted,superseded on other grounds by pub,stat,codified at d.the purpose of such official immunity is not to protect an erring official,but to insulate the decisionmaking process from the harassment of prospective litigation.id.
the westfall act which was enacted in response to the supreme court decision in westfall,accords federal employees absolute immunity from tort claims arising out of acts they undertake in the course of their official duties.osborn haley.the immunity extends to both negligent and wrongful act s or omission s of any employee acting within the scope of his office or employment.b.the act does not set out a test to determine whether an employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment rather,congress intended that courts would apply the principles of respondeat superior of the state in which the alleged tort occurred in analyzing the issue.pelletier fed.home loan bank of,cir.the same analysis was employed before passage of the westfall act to determine whether the united states could be liable for an employee torts under the ftca.id.at.
the westfall act provides a procedure by which the federal government determines whether an employee is entitled to immunity.when a current or former federal employee is sued and the employee believes that he is entitled to official immunity,he is instructed to deliver all process served upon him to his immediate supervisor or other designated official,who then furnish es copies of the pleadings and process therein to the united states attorney for the district embracing the place wherein the proceeding is brought,to the attorney general,and to the head of his employing federal agency.c.the attorney general then determines whether the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.id.d.if so,the attorney general issues a scope certification,which transforms an action against an individual federal employee into one against the united states.hui castaneda.the united states shall be substituted as the party defendant,d,and the employee is released from any liability the remedy against the united states is exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding for money damages by reason of the same subject matter against the employee whose act or omission gave rise to the claim or against the estate of such employee.any other civil action or proceeding for money damages arising out of or relating to the same subject matter against the employee or the employee estate is precluded without regard to when the act or omission occurred.id.b.

but plaintiff argues that defendants actions were not taken within the scope of their employment and that,therefore,they are not entitled to immunity under the westfall act in the first place.plaintiff argument embraces two distinct theories.the first theory is that defendants in this case acted outside the scope of their employment because they started planning the attack on iraq before they ever took office,attacked iraq out of personal motives,and were not employed to instigate an unlawful war.the second theory is that the inquiry under the westfall act must be conducted with an eye toward the united states treaty obligations.that is,the statute should not be construed to allow an act to be deemed official when the united states has entered into treaties condemning that same act.we will address those two theories in turn,and we will then address plaintiff challenge to the district court denial of her request for an evidentiary hearing concerning the scope certification.
the attorney general decision regarding scope of employment certification under the westfall act is conclusive unless challenged.accordingly,the party seeking review bears the burden of presenting evidence and disproving the attorney general decision to grant or deny scope of employment certification by a preponderance of the evidence.green hall,cir.per curiam citation and footnote omitted.to rebut the scope certification,a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts that,taken as true,would establish that the defendant actions exceeded the scope of his employment.wuterich murtha,cir.brackets omitted quoting stokes cross,cir.w here a plaintiff fails to allege sufficient facts to rebut the certification,the united states must be substituted as the defendant id.
as noted above,when determining whether a federal officer actions fall within the scope of his office or employment for purposes of the westfall act,we apply the principles of respondeat superior of the state in which the alleged tort occurred.pelletier,at.we agree with the parties that the respondeat superior law of the district of columbia applies in this case.
district of columbia courts routinely look to the restatement second of agency in determining whether an employee actions fall within the scope of employment.rasul myers,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,vacated,reinstated in relevant part,cir.per curiam.the restatement provides that conduct of a servant is within the scope of employment if,but only if a it is of the kind he is employed to perform b it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits c it is actuated,at least in part,by a purpose to serve the master and d if force is intentionally used by the servant against another,the use of force is not unexpectable by the master.conduct of a servant is not within the scope of employment if it is different in kind from that authorized,far beyond the authorized time or space limits,or too little actuated by a purpose to serve the master.council on am.islamic relations ballenger,cir.per curiam quoting restatement second of agency.district of columbia law liberally construes the doctrine of respondeat superior,at least with respect to the first prong of the restatement.kashin kent,cir.ellipses omitted quoting stokes,at.the test for scope of employment is an objective one,based on all the facts and circumstances.ballenger,at brackets omitted quoting weinberg johnson,cir.
plaintiff claims that defendants particularly wolfowitz and rumsfeld were not acting within the scope of their employment in carrying out the iraq war because they started planning the war before taking office.there are at least two problems with this argument.first,the alleged tortious acts of aggression the invasion of iraq took place after defendants occupied public office,and what took place in the late was not planning,but only advocacy.during most of that time,neither wolfowitz nor rumsfeld could have known that he would soon be in a position to help implement his policy preferences.second,statements of intent or belief do not take the later acts of public officials outside the scope of their employment.under plaintiff theory,every time a politician honors a campaign promise,she could be considered to be acting outside the scope of her employment.or,if a passionate advocate for voting rights were appointed to head the civil rights division of the department of justice,his or her bringing a lawsuit to enforce voting rights would be viewed as outside the scope of his or her employment.
plaintiff makes a similar argument with respect to defendants motives,which bear on the third prong of the restatement test whether an employee actions were actuated,at least in part,by a purpose to serve the master.plaintiff asserts that she has alleged that defendants were solely motivated by personal,selfish purposes,but that assertion is not borne out by the factual allegations in the second amended complaint.plaintiff conflates a policy preference or worldview which is personal in the sense that it may be deeply felt or tied to one sense of morality or identity that motivates one to advocate for certain positions,with a desire to serve one individual interests.a federal official would act out of personal motives and not be actuated by a purpose to serve the master if,for instance,he used the leverage of his office to benefit a spouse business,paying no heed to the resulting damage to the public welfare.but that is not what plaintiff has alleged.rather,she has alleged that defendants were committed to certain foreign policy objectives in which they believed.even if those alleged objectives or beliefs were misguided or in contravention of international norms,the motives were not personal in the sense defendants conduct was actuated,at least in part,by a purpose to serve the master,the united states.ballenger,at.
finally,plaintiff argues that defendants were not employed to execute a war.but defendants,as members of the executive branch,were charged broadly with guiding the united states foreign policy and with ensuring national security.dep t of navy egan.and congress authorized defendant bush to use the armed forces of the united states as he determine d to be necessary and appropriate in order to defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq.authorization for use of military force a.the actions that defendants took in connection with the iraq war were part of their official duties,even if some defendants had hoped to be able to take those actions years before taking office.
in summary,reading the westfall act in a straightforward manner and applying district of columbia respondeat superior law to the facts alleged in the operative complaint,we hold that defendants alleged actions fell within the scope of their employment.
construing the westfall act with an eye toward treaty obligations 
plaintiff next argues that the westfall act should not be interpreted so as to regard as official an act condemned by treaty.plaintiff cites as support for this proposition the united kingdom case of regina bartle the commissioner of police for the metropolis others ex parte pinochet,appeal taken from div l,reprinted in,in which the house of lords ruled that former chilean leader augusto pinochet was not entitled to official immunity for the role that he played in ordering acts of torture and other violations of international law.many of the law lords reasoned that pinochet acts could not be considered official because the convention against torture forbade such acts,and chile was a party to that treaty.at opinion of lord id.at opinion of lord hope id.at opinion of lord hutton id.at opinion of lord saville.the united states has signed several treaties and other international agreements condemning aggressive war and plaintiff argues that interpreting the westfall act to allow for immunity in this case would conflict with those agreements.
this argument suffers from at least two fatal flaws.first,the equivalent of the scope of employment test in the pinochet case was a creature of international law,not a test set out by a domestic statute.the law lords were tasked with determining whether pinochet actions could be considered official as a matter of international law.the effect of a treaty on that analysis has little bearing on that same treaty effect on the analysis under domestic law.
second,although we have suggested that ambiguous statutes should be interpreted to avoid conflicts even with treaties kim ho ma ashcroft,cir,the westfall act is not,in any relevant way,ambiguous.with the westfall act which was enacted after the passage of each of the treaties and agreements to which plaintiff cites congress clearly intended to grant federal officers immunity to the same extent that the united states would have been liable for those employees tortious acts under the ftca subject to exceptions that are not relevant to today analysis.pelletier,at.when the westfall act was passed,it was clear that this immunity covered even heinous acts.see,hoston silbert,cir.per curiam holding that united states marshals were acting in the scope of their employment when they allegedly beat an unarmed,shackled prisoner and left him to die in a holding cell.
in short,the treaties and charters cited by plaintiff do not alter our conclusion that the westfall act,by its plain terms,immunizes defendants from suit.
denial of an evidentiary hearing 
plaintiff next argues that she should have been afforded an opportunity to challenge the scope certification at an evide
