we must decide whether the federal court in guam has jurisdiction in disputes exclusively between aliens.
matao yokeno sued emil lai and sawako sekiguchi in the superior court of guam,asserting claims arising from alleged breaches of fiduciary duty in the course of the parties several business ventures.sekiguchi and lai removed the case to the district court of guam based on diversity of citizenship.
yokeno is an alien admitted to the united states for permanent residence,living in guam lai,a british overseas citizen,and sekiguchi,a japanese citizen,both live in japan.the district court did not examine its jurisdiction and neither party objected to its exercise based on diversity of citizenship.the district court granted summary judgment on the merits,in favor of sekiguchi and lai,and yokeno timely appealed.
yokeno now contests subject matter jurisdiction for the first time,contending that no diversity of citizenship exists in a dispute between aliens.he urges us to dismiss the appeal and to vacate the district court judgment with instructions to remand to the superior court of guam.sekiguchi and lai maintain that diversity jurisdiction exists but instead,curiously,move to dismiss this appeal based on res judicata 
we deal first with yokeno jurisdictional challenge.we have an independent obligation to determine our jurisdiction,see chapman pier imports,cir en banc,and we consider yokeno objection to subject matter jurisdiction even though he raises it for the first time on appeal,see detabali luke,cir.
article iii of the united states constitution extends the judicial power to controversies between citizens of different states and between a state,or the citizens thereof,and foreign states,citizens or subjects.const.art.iii,cl.this clause,the constitutional source of our diversity jurisdiction,supplies jurisdiction even where only minimal diversity of citizenship is present.see state farm fire cas.tashire.in the case of litigation involving an alien,a state or a citizen of a state must be a party.jackson twentyman,pet,hodgson bowerbank,cranch,kavourgias nicholaou,cir.
unlike the constitution,the diversity statute,requires complete diversity of citizenship.see carden arkoma,citing strawbridge curtiss,cranch.we have repeatedly confirmed the application of this rule in alienage cases,refusing to hear disputes between aliens for lack of statutory jurisdiction even when a citizen thus constitutionally required minimal present.see nike,comercial iberica de exclusivas deportivas,cir craig atl.richfield,cir faysound united coconut,cir.
because this is an appeal from the district court of guam,we also consider the unique nature of its jurisdiction.that district court is not an article iii court it was created by the organic act of guam,see,pursuant to article iv of the constitution.see chase manhattan bank ass n acres dev,per curiam.the organic act of guam confers upon the district court of guam the same diversity jurisdiction afforded to article iii courts the district court of guam shall have the jurisdiction of a district court of the united states,including,but not limited to,the diversity jurisdiction provided for in,and that of a bankruptcy court of the united states.b.
in congress amended to include the following clause,known as the deeming clause 
for the purposes of this section,section,and section,an alien admitted to the united states for permanent residence shall be deemed a citizen of the state in which such alien is domiciled 
a,stat.in,but after this case was removed to the district court of guam,congress again amended to delete the deeming clause 
on its face,the deeming clause would seem to confer jurisdiction in cases,like this one,between a resident alien plaintiff and alien defendants,where neither constitutional nor statutory jurisdiction would otherwise exist.this case requires us to determine the effect of the deeming clause on the citizenship of a resident alien suing solely alien defendants a question of first impression.
sekiguchi and lai contend that the district court properly exercised jurisdiction in this case because it is an article iv court,not an article iii court.the organic act itself makes clear,however,that the diversity jurisdiction of the district court of guam is coextensive with the diversity jurisdiction of an article iii district court.see b the organic act does not purport to supply the district court of guam with jurisdiction exceeding that of an article iii district court.instead,it identifies the diversity statute as the source of one aspect of such jurisdiction.the question before us is whether the version of comports with constitutional limits on the jurisdiction of an article iii court the same jurisdiction the organic act confers upon the district court of guam.
statutory interpretation begins with the text of the statute.hughes aircraft jacobson.where the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms,for courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.int l ass of machinists aerospace workers,local lodge bf goodrich aerospace aerostructurers,cir quoting.bank germain,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we do not look at statutory language in isolation,but consider the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil.only if this approach leaves or reveals ambiguity may we turn to extrinsic evidence such as legislative history.see dep t of hous.urban dev.rucker,casey,comm of,burlington,quincy,committee reports and explanatory statements of members in charge made in presenting a bill for passage are only admissible to solve doubt and not to create it.citations omitted united states sioux,cir.
whenever possible,federal statutes are construed to avoid serious doubt of their constitutionality.stern marshall,quoting commodity futures trading comm schor.the avoidance canon,however,does not give us the prerogative to ignore the legislative will in order to avoid constitutional adjudication.id.alteration in original quoting schor,at.
the plain language of the deeming clause instructs us to treat yokeno,a permanent resident alien,as a citizen of guam for purposes of determining statutory diversity jurisdiction.to deem is t o treat something as if it were really something else or it has qualities that it does not have.black law dictionary ed see also oxford english dictionary compact ed defining to deem as to judge,conclude,think,consider,hold.according to the text,we should regard yokeno not as an alien but as a citizen of guam,and statutory diversity jurisdiction should lie in his dispute with alien defendants.in other words,the deeming clause purports to confer statutory jurisdiction in this suit between aliens where neither constitutional nor statutory jurisdiction would otherwise exist.
cases and commentators,however,have suggested that,notwithstanding the plain language,the statute might be unconstitutional in the circumstances presented here because it would exceed the constitutional requirement of minimal diversity as well as the longstanding rule of complete diversity.see,saadeh farouki,a literal reading of the amendment to a would produce an odd and potentially unconstitutional result.singh daimler benz ag,cir noting the potential unconstitutional application of the deeming provision when a permanent resident alien sues as the sole defendant either a permanent resident alien domiciled in another state or a nonresident alien charles wright et,federal practice and procedure,at supp david siegel,changes in federal jurisdiction and practice under the new judicial improvements and access to justice act,noting,in discussing the deeming clause,that t he jurisdictional outer limits set forth in of article iii of the constitution do include a jurisdictional basis consisting only of alien versus alien.
three of our sister circuits have interpreted the deeming clause.none faced,as we do,a case in which the clause would purport to supply statutory jurisdiction in excess of that allowed by article iii though all imply
