joaquin osvaldo appeals the denial of his petition to vacate his conviction and sentence,raising two issues he received ineffective assistance of counsel,and the district court erred in giving a pinkerton instruction to the jury.agreeing with the district court ruling on both issues we affirm.
background 
gallo was arrested in bogota,colombia on january.the united states made a request for his provisional arrest on january,submitting diplomatic note to colombia on march.the note requested gallo extradition on two indictments colombia complied with the request by issuing resolution on july.gallo appealed the extradition proceedings and colombia issued resolution on september,granting gallo extradition for some of the counts alleged in the two indictments,specifically importation of cocaine,distribution of cocaine,and conspiracy to distribute cocaine.resolution also contained the following declaration 
the colombian supreme court of justice has stated,on several occasions,that the violation of title,section,of the united states code does not have an equivalent in colombia,so therefore the extradition shall not be authorized,either,on account of this definition.
prior to trial,gallo filed a motion to enforce rule of specialty,contending that the government could only prosecute him for the offenses authorized by the extradition and could not proceed on any charges based on aid and abet liability under the district court granted gallo motion,rejecting the government position that does not create a separate substantive offense.after this ruling,the government redacted gallo indictment to charge only the counts authorized by resolution.
at trial,the government requested a pinkerton instruction on the importation count the court gave the instruction over gallo objection.after a question from the jury about the coverage of the pinkerton charge,the court gave a supplemental instruction,again over gallo objection,that the pinkerton charge applied to the three distribution counts as well as the importation charge.the jury convicted gallo on the three substantive distribution counts and the importation count,but found him not guilty of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.gallo unsuccessfully moved for a new trial based on the pinkerton charge,asserting that it violated the rule of specialty because it was a theory of constructive liability akin to aid and abet liability.
at sentencing,gallo informed the court of a diplomatic note sent by the colombian government to the state department objecting to the pinkerton charge in his trial.gallo could not produce the note,however,and the court overruled the objection.gallo eventually filed the diplomatic note 
we affirmed gallo conviction and sentence,finding no violation of the specialty doctrine because the jury convicted gallo of the substantive counts authorized by colombia extradition resolution in so holding,we noted the distinction between pinkerton liability and aid and abet liability under.we also found that gallo had waived any dual criminality argument by not raising same in the district court,leaving the record unclear with respect to colombia reasons for extradition.finally,we ruled that diplomatic note had no persuasive or precedential value in this case 
gallo invokes to vacate his conviction and sentence,claiming ineffective assistance of counsel and that the district court erred in giving the pinkerton instruction.the magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing and requested the presentation of evidence.gallo offered diplomatic note.the government presented an expert witness on comparative law who testified that gallo conduct was criminal under colombia law even though he never physically transported the cocaine.
the magistrate judge filed a report and recommendation concluding that gallo lacked standing to assert dual criminality because that doctrine only gives surrendering states the ability to refuse extradition on grounds that the prisoner conduct is not criminal in its jurisdiction.both parties filed objections.gallo disputed the finding and the united states requested two additional alternative findings assuming gallo standing to raise,the pinkerton instruction did not violate the doctrine because gallo acts constituted a crime in colombia,and assuming both standing and a violation,gallo convictions and sentences on the three distribution counts should be upheld because sufficient evidence existed to convict on those counts without the instruction.the government also objected to the magistrate judge failure to rule on gallo new specialty argument and to bar gallo from relitigating that issue.the district court adopted the magistrate judge submission,incorporating the alternative holdings requested by the united states.this appeal followed.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
in order to establish an ineffective assistance claim,a defendant must prove both deficient performance on the part of counsel and prejudice as a result specifically,proof is required that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.defendant must prove deficient performance by a preponderance of competent evidence and the standard is reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.with regard to the prejudice prong of strickland,a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.
applying strickland teachings,we find gallo contentions insufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.he first claims that counsel was deficient for failing to object to the pinkerton instruction on dual criminality grounds.while we find no case law from this circuit directly establishing standing to assert a dual criminality challenge,the mere absence of authority does not automatically insulate counsel failure to object on that basis.other circuits have addressed dual criminality charges on the merits,reflecting that an objection on such grounds was not wholly without precedent 
here,however,counsel failure to object based on dual criminality does not constitute deficient performance.counsel decision to focus on specialty constitutes the type of strategic trial decision that falls outside the purview of deficient performance counsel may well have thought specialty the stronger argument,especially because the aforementioned case law dealt with additional counts or separate factual allegations,not jury instructions on different theories of liability.
we likewise reject gallo assertion,as a basis for deficient performance,that counsel focused his specialty argument on pinkerton similarity to aid and abet liability,rather than colombia specific prohibition of prosecution for conspiracy to import.while it is accurate to state that colombia specifically barred prosecution for conspiracy to import we find that counsel failure to object on this basis falls within the broad range of strategic options available.the resolution prevents conviction on multiple conspiracies,but says nothing about liability for crimes resulting from the one overall conspiracy for which colombia found sufficient acts by gallo.counsel failure to attack the instruction based on conspiracy rather than falls significantly short of deficient performance.finding that gallo has failed to establish deficient performance,we do not address the issue of prejudice.
ii.the pinkerton instruction 
we next consider whether the district court erred in giving a pinkerton instruction on the substantive importation count and the three distribution counts.gallo contends that the court erred because the instruction violated his extradition agreement.we review such an extradition challenge de novo 
in united states pinkerton,the supreme court held that a could be guilty of a substantive offense even though he did no more than join the conspiracy,provided that the offense was reasonably foreseeable and was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy instructing juries on this concept has come to be known as a pinkerton instruction.gallo asserts that by giving this instr
