citizens for peace in space and several of its members citizens appeal from the district court judgment in favor of the city of colorado springs the city.the citizens sought nominal damages under for an alleged violation of first amendment rights.specifically,the citizens alleged that,from october to october,they were unconstitutionally prohibited from protesting in the traditional public forums surrounding the broadmoor hotel broadmoor in colorado springs,colorado.after a bench trial,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order in favor of the city.citizens for peace in space city of colorado springs,wl.july.we exercise jurisdiction over the resulting judgment pursuant to and affirm.
background 
from october through october,the secretary of defense hosted a conference of the defense ministers of nineteen member nations of nato plus nine invitee nations,at the broadmoor hotel in colorado springs.approximately delegates,family and staff attended the conference.the department of defense leased the entire broadmoor facility for the conference,including the international conference center,which is located across the street.
the security plan for the conference included closing public streets and sidewalks and imposing a large limited access area or security zone.this security zone surrounded the broadmoor and extended across public and private property for several blocks in all directions.the perimeter was roughly defined by five checkpoints at roadway intersections surrounding the broadmoor property.the security zone was completely closed to all persons except conference attendees,accredited media,broadmoor employees,individuals residing in the security zone,guests of individuals residing in the security zone,and personnel servicing the broadmoor and the residences within the security zone.
the security plan resulted from the work of a task force that operated pursuant to an international memorandum of agreement.the task force based its planning on worldwide nato protocols.the task force included officials from the air force,the army,the colorado springs police department cspd,the el paso county sheriff department,the fbi,the department of justice,the department of transportation,the department of homeland security,fema,and nato.the task force primary security concern was the threat of a terrorist attack utilizing explosives.the task force envisioned that such an attack might involve explosives driven onto the broadmoor grounds by vehicle and detonated or explosives carried by an individual onto the grounds and detonated.accordingly,the breadth of the security zone ensured that the blast from any such detonation would not get close enough to the broadmoor to endanger any of the delegates.
during the conference,several hundred personnel from the military and various law enforcement agencies,including the cspd,staffed the security zone.five checkpoints,placed at various intersections around the broadmoor,exclusively controlled access to the security zone.security at the checkpoints included screenings by metal detectors and dogs.broadmoor employees were bused into the zone from an staging area,where,like airline passengers,they were by metal detectors and scanners.delegates,and their families and staffs,arrived and departed the conference by motorcade.several hundred members of the national and international media were allowed into the security zone,as well.like the broadmoor employees,members of the media were at an staging area the world arena and bused into the broadmoor.once inside the security zone,members of the media were restricted to an area around the international conference center,across the street from the broadmoor main building.the broadmoor employees,conference delegates,and media all entered the security zone through checkpoint at the intersection of lake avenue and second street.
protocols were also established allowing delivery and repair persons servicing the hotel to enter the security zone at checkpoint.likewise,protocols allowed the residents of private homes located within the security zone to enter as they pleased any time,day or night.furthermore,delivery and repair persons servicing the private residences were allowed to enter and leave the security zone,as well as social guests of the residents living in the homes,all of them passing through security at checkpoint.
the citizens are residents of colorado springs and peace activists.their principal concern is with the militarization of space and the prevention of war.upon learning that the nato conference would be held at the broadmoor,the citizens consulted with the american civil liberties union aclu and authorized it to communicate with the city on their behalf to see if they could be allowed to conduct a peaceful protest within the security zone.specifically,the citizens hoped to conduct their protest on a sidewalk across from the international conference center.an aclu attorney communicated the citizens wishes to the city and explained that the proposed protest would involve six persons who would hold banners on a sidewalk across the street from the international conference center.the citizens proposed a peaceful vigil that would be limited to one hour.they further offered to submit to the same security checks and screenings required of other persons allowed into the security zone.
the city rejected the request,contending that allowing the citizens protest would require it to permit other groups to do the same,which would jeopardize the government ability to maintain security for the conference.instead,the city suggested that the citizens conduct their protest outside the security zone,near checkpoint.the citizens found this location unsatisfactory because the conference delegates and international media,the citizens target audience,could only observe the protest briefly as their vehicles passed by.
nevertheless,the citizens did conduct their protest at checkpoint,standing by the side of the road there were no sidewalks.this location was several blocks from the international conference center there was no direct line of sight between the protest location and the international conference center,and the citizens could barely be seen,if at all,from the broadmoor itself.when the citizens requested that cspd officers inform the conference delegates and international media of their protest at checkpoint,the officers declined.
the citizens contend that even if the international media were alerted to the existence of their protest,security protocols prohibited them from walking down lake avenue to interview the citizens.instead,the citizens contend that members of the international media would have had to leave the international conference center by bus,return to their staging area,and then arrange private transportation to the protest site.in fact,while conducting their protest,the citizens did not have any close,physical interaction with any of the conference delegates or international media.
at trial the city introduced evidence that,based on staffing levels incorporated into the security plan,officers would have been unable to control protests that turned confrontational or unlawful.the staffing levels included,at a minimum,members of the cspd.the cspd officials testified that generally allowing protestors into the security zone would have required doubling the number of cspd officers assigned to the conference.cspd officials stated that any protest,peaceful or otherwise,would require officer observation and escort.
cspd officials,however,conceded that there were sufficient officers to observe and supervise the citizens proposed vigil.the district court expressly found t here were adequate personnel available to assure the peacefulness of a demonstration and the prevention of any disruption to the nato conference.citizens for peace in space,wl,at.the city argued,however,that allowing the citizens into the restricted zone would lead other groups to make similar requests.cspd officials conceded the city could have handled similar requests,under protocols similar to those suggested by the citizens,for groups limited to a small size.

application of the time,place,and manner factors 
content neutrality 
the citizens concede that the city restriction is content neutral.although this concession is not controlling given our special standard of de novo review,we see no reason to disagree.there is no evidence that the city security plan drew any distinction based on the content of speech.instead,it implemented a total ban on public expression within the security zone,regardless of the identity of the speaker or the subject of the message.see menotti city of seattle,cir.accordingly,we hold that the city security plan was content neutral.
significant government interest 
the citizens similarly concede that the city interest in security is significant.the citizens,however,take issue with the nature of the exact security interest asserted by the city,arguing that the city only asserted interest was in keeping explosives away from the conference.a review of the record indicates that the city was concerned with the threat of terrorism generally,including the use of vehicle and explosives,and with the threat posed by disorderly and violent protestors.see ii.at,iii.at.as discussed below,the city security interest is of the highest order and guides our determination of whether the security plan was narrowly tailored and whether there were ample alternative channels of communication.
narrow tailoring 
in this case,the city security plan was narrowly tailored to advance its significant security interest because the security zone,limited to the immediate vicinity of the broadmoor,directly and effectively protected the conference from the threat of terrorism,explosives,and violent protests.as discussed below,the citizens arguments to the contrary are premised on a narrow security interest and an overly strict standard of the relationship between the security zone and the security interest.this appears tantamount to an attempt to impose de facto strict scrutiny review of the city security plan,a standard that does not apply to time,place,and manner restrictions.
government may not regulate expression in such a manner that a substantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals.ward,at.thus,in order to demonstrate that a challenged restriction is narrowly tailored,the government must demonstrate that the restriction serve s a substantial state interest in a direct and effective way.edenfield fane,d internal quotations omitted.absent such proof,a restriction may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government purpose.id.at.quoting central hudson gas pub.serv.comm n,d thus,a regulation is not narrowly tailored when it does not sufficiently serve those public interests that are urged as its justification.grace,at.
in this case,the burden falls on the city to show that its recited harms are real and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.turner broad.fcc,d.it is not enough that the city justify its restrictions based broadly on security.see bl a ck tea soc y city of boston,cir noting that the question of narrow tailoring must be decided against the backdrop of the harms that a particular set of security measures are designed to forfend.this does not mean,however,that the city must show that its restriction is the least intrusive means of promoting its interest.see ward,at.instead,we will give deference to a reasonable judgment by the city as to the best means of providing security at the nato conference.see id.at.the validity of time,place,or manner regulations does not turn on a judge agreement with the responsible decisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant government interests.
in this case,the city asserts that a wide security zone was necessary because of the need to keep the conference outside the blast radius of any explosion that might have been caused by vehicle or explosives.the city also asserts,that given that so many defense leaders were gathered in one location,it needed an extra margin for error.in other words,it needed a deep security zone so that its officers would have more reaction time to fend off any terrorist or other threat before the conference delegates were placed in imminent danger.furthermore,the exclusion of protestors from the security zone allowed the city to devote its officers to maintaining the perimeter and fending off any possible terrorist attacks,rather than having its officers monitor protestors,which would have required the city to staff twice as many officers at the conference.i.at.
the nature of the nato conference bears not only on the conceded significant interest component of the time,place,and manner analysis,but also on the narrowly tailored component.while an extremely important government interest does not dictate the result in time,place,and manner cases,the significance of the government interest bears an inverse relationship to the rigor of the narrowly tailored analysis.see bd.of trus.fox,d noting that there must be a fit between the government means and its desired objective a fit that is not necessarily perfect,but reasonable that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served emphasis added.
in this case,there can be no doubt that the city interest in providing security to a gathering of defense officials is of the highest order.we also can not ignore the fact that the city chosen method of providing security was part of a security protocol that was created by department of defense officials,nato personnel,and various international defense agencies.courts have historically given special deference to other branches in matters relating to foreign affairs,international relations,and national security even when constitutional rights are invoked by a plaintiff.see,ins abudu,d international relations cia sims,d national security o centro espirita beneficiente uniao do vegetal ashcroft,cir en banc mcconnell,concurring international relations 
despite the importance of the city interest,and the obvious conclusion that the security zone certainly advanced the city interest in securing the conference,the citizens advance a number of arguments to show that the security zone was not narrowly tailored.while the city undoubtedly bears the burden of demonstrating narrow tailoring,and it has done so in this case,we think our discussion will be most clear by addressing each of the citizens arguments.those arguments can be summarized as 
the total exclusion of pedestrian demonstrators did not directly and effectively advance the city security interest in protecting against explosives and any argument to the contrary is undermined by the fact that the city allowed numerous other classes of persons into the security zone.
the city failed to demonstrate that it could not have accommodated protestors by simply increasing the number of officers present in the security zone.
the city burdened substantially more speech than was necessary to further its interest.the presence of othe
