this case requires us to consider both the timing and the nature of our review of a decision of the supreme court of guam.specifically,this case presents the following issues whether a petitioner must at that time seek our review of a decision by the supreme court of guam when that decision remands the case to the trial court for further substantive determinations,and whether our review of a decision of the supreme court of guam under requires us to give a degree of deference to a conclusion by the supreme court that the trial court erred in its factual findings.
petitioner alan haeuser seeks review of a judgment denying him back pay despite his wrongful termination from a position with the department of law,government of guam department.the trial court initially found that haeuser fulfilled his duty to mitigate damages and awarded back pay,but the guam supreme court concluded that this factual finding was clearly erroneous and reversed the award.on remand,the trial court entered a judgment denying haeuser back pay,and this judgment was affirmed by the guam supreme court.
haeuser contends that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that he mitigated damages and that the guam supreme court erred in reversing the trial court previous award to him.the department argues that haeuser can contest only the supreme court subsequent decision to affirm the superior court actions on remand and is barred from challenging the supreme court earlier decision because haeuser did not seek review by this court at that time.we conclude that we can properly review the guam supreme court earlier decision.we further hold that because we must defer to the territorial supreme court on matters of local law,we may reverse the supreme court only if it commits manifest error or is inescapably wrong.because we hold that the guam supreme court committed manifest error in this case in reversing the guam superior court findings of fact without completing a review of the evidence upon which those finding were based,we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
this is the second visit by this case to our court.see haeuser dep t of law,cir.alan haeuser obtained a position as an assistant attorney general with the department in february.pursuant to guam code ann,assistant attorneys general were placed in the unclassified service and had a probation period during which they could not appeal an adverse employment action to the civil service commission after fourteen months of employment,the department terminated haeuser,citing unsatisfactory job performance.haeuser timely appealed his dismissal to the civil service commission of guam,but the commission refused to hear the matter based on haeuser unclassified status under.
haeuser petitioned the superior court of guam,a court,for a writ of mandate contending,among other things,that the exemption of assistant attorneys from classified status violated guam organic act the superior court denied haeuser petition,and the district court of guam,appellate division affirmed.we reversed that decision and remanded for further proceedings.see haeuser,at.
on remand,the superior court held that haeuser termination was wrongful and ordered haeuser reinstated to his position within the department.the superior court then held a trial to determine whether haeuser was entitled to back pay for the period that he was unemployed between and.during these six years,haeuser submitted eight applications for legal employment in the public sector but was never hired haeuser performed some work during that time,but his earnings were limited due to his refusal to handle felonies and juvenile cases.haeuser did not apply for a position either in the private sector or in the federal government,and he did not attempt to open a private practice separate from the court appointments.
the superior court ultimately concluded that haeuser reasonably mitigated damages and awarded him back pay with respect to haeuser failure to seek employment with guam private law firms,the superior court stated 
t he court finds that petitioner failure to apply for employment with a private law firm did not constitute a failure to mitigate his damages which would preclude an award of back pay.the court is convinced that it is highly unlikely that petitioner would have been hired to work at a private law firm had he applied based upon his circumstances at the time thus the court will reject the argument presented by the respondent herein which suggested that petitioner intentionally took himself out of the private sector market and thus this constitutes a failure to mitigate.
the department appealed the superior court decision.by this time,guam judicial system had significantly changed.the appeal from the superior court no longer went to the district court of guam,appellate division,but rather to the recently created guam supreme court 
in its opinion,the guam supreme court began by explaining that a trial court findings on mitigation of damages are subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review.haeuser dep t of law haeuser i quoting sellers delgado college,cir,guam,wl.the haeuser i court then concluded 
the fact that haeuser did not apply at any private law firms immediately raises serious concerns with the trial court findings we are unable to find the evidentiary support for the trial court conclusion that haeuser would not have been hired by any private law firm.perhaps,if haeuser had tried to apply to just one private firm and was not hired,the trial court conclusion would be plausible,in light of the record 
we are left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a mistake in its conclusions that haeuser had reasonably mitigated his damages.we have not conducted a review of the evidence as presented to the trial court,but rather we have examined the basis of the trial court conclusions regarding the efforts of haeuser to mitigate his damages and we find that these conclusions were not plausible in light of the entire record.
id.at emphasis added.pursuant to its conclusion that haeuser had,in fact,failed to make reasonable efforts to find employment,the supreme court reversed and remanded the case for findings consistent with its opinion.
on remand,the superior court,stating that it was bound by the supreme court holding,reached the conclusion that haeuser was not entitled to any back pay because he failed to mitigate damages and his failure to mitigate covered the entire period that he was unemployed.haeuser appealed this decision to the guam supreme court,which affirmed.see haeuser dep t of law haeuser ii,guam,wl.this court then granted haeuser petition for writ of certiorari to review the supreme court final decision.
ii.discussion 
scope of our jurisdiction 
the department argues that this court must limit its review to the guam supreme court ruling in haeuser ii because haeuser opportunity to seek review of the supreme court ruling in haeuser i has expired.we do not agree.our jurisdiction to review decisions by the guam supreme court is governed by which provides that we may review by writ of certiorari all final decisions of the highest court of guam from which a decision could be had.emphasis added.because our jurisdiction is limited to final decisions by the guam supreme court,we must determine whether haeuser i was subject to our review at that time.
under circumstances nearly identical to the case at hand,we adopted the united states supreme court analysis in cox broadcasting cohn,d,for purposes of determining when a decision of the highest appellate court of guam is final,although further proceedings on the merits may remain.eie guam v.the supreme court of guam,cir kiaaina jackson,cir holding that in order to determine when a decision by a guam court is final for purposes of our review,we must determine whether the supreme court would review the present case if it were a judgment from a state court.
ordinarily,the supreme court refuses to review a state court judgment where anything further remains to be determined by a state court.cox broadcasting,at.gospel army city of los angeles.explaining that for a judgment of an appellate court to be final and reviewable it must end the litigation by fully determining the rights of the parties,so that nothing remains to be done by the trial court except the ministerial act of entering the judgment which the appellate court directed emphasis added quoting dep t of banking,state of nebraska pink.the guam supreme court in haeuser i remanded the matter to the superior court for findings consistent with its opinion.see haeuser i,guam at.specifically,the superior court had to determine whether haeuser claim was barred due to failure to mitigate damages in each and every year of his unemployment.thus,haeuser i did not fully end the litigation.
this court has also adopted cox broadcasting holding that there are special circumstances where a departure from this requirement of finality is allowed and an appeal can be entertained even though further proceedings are pending in the state courts only some of these exceptions apply to our review of the guam supreme court because this court has authority to review not only federal issues,but also all issues of local law.eie guam,at citing.accordingly,in kiaaina,at,we interpreted the cox broadcasting exceptions in light of our authority to review both federal and local guam issues and concluded that t his court will review decisions when further proceedings are pending only if policy issues involved are of such importance as to demand immediate review,or declining to entertain the appeal would preclude further review.id.
at the time of haeuser i there were neither policy issues of great importance,nor a chance that a failure to entertain an appeal would preclude further review.therefore,because none of the cox broadcasting exceptions to the finality requirement applied,and because haeuser i remand required the superior court to make further determinations,haeuser i was not final for purposes of review by this court.see guam manibusan,cir.accordingly,we may now review not only the guam supreme court decision in haeuser ii,but also the decision in haeuser see coe armour fertilizer works.holding that the united state supreme court could review issues resolved in the state supreme court first decision to remand proceedings despite the plaintiff failure to appeal that first decision because the judgment did not become final until the case returned to the state supreme court a second time and was affirmed.
standard of review 
we now determine what standard of review to apply to the guam supreme court conclusion in haeuser i that the superior court clearly erred in its findings of fact.haeuser argues that we must review the superior court findings of fact for ourselves,citing phoenix engineering and supply,universal electric,cir.in phoenix engineering,we reviewed a conclusion by the appellate division that the superior court findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and explained our approach in the following manner 
as an appellate court,the appellate division can not make findings of fact.thus,the only manner in which we can determine whether the superior court erred in its findings of fact is to review them for clear error.if the superior court did not clearly err in its findings of fact,then we must affirm the appellate division conclusion that the superior court factual findings were not clearly erroneous.
id.at.see also oxford properties finance engle,cir holding that when reviewing the appellate division judgment affirming the trial court conclusions,this court would reverse findings of fact only when they are clearly erroneous.haeuser thus contends that we must disregard the decision of the guam supreme court and determine for ourselves whether the superior court findings are clearly erroneous.if we do not find clear error,he argues,we must reverse the guam supreme court.we do not agree.
in determining that we must conduct our own clear error review of the superior court factual findings,the phoenix engineering court stated 
final decisions of the appellate division are reviewed by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.c.we have previously concluded that we must apply the de novo standard of review to the appellate division interpretation of guam law.people of territory of guam yang,cir en banc.
phoenix engineering,at emphasis added.in the case at bar,however,we review not the appellate division under,but rather,the guam supreme court under.this change is important.first,in contrast to our de novo review of the appellate division,we apply a deferential standard of review to guam supreme court decisions concerning local law.second,our review under must take into account congress clear intent to allow the guam supreme court to develop guam common law.we discuss each of these considerations in turn.
congress enacted a in to provide that the legislature of guam may in its discretion establish an appellate court.see gutierrez pangelinan,cir.guam ultimately decided to accept that invitation and shortly thereafter,the guam legislature created the supreme court of guam and provided that its justices be appointed by the governor of guam and approved by the guam legislature.see comment,guam code ann.guam code ann.in contrast,the appellate division was not a local guam court.it was created by federal statute,and its panel always included one or two judges who were selected from outside guam.see b.we emphasized these characteristics of the appellate division in yang when we held that we should apply a de novo standard of review to the appellate division interpretations of guam law.see yang,at holding that because two of the three appellate division judges are not from guam,there is simply no basis for assuming that visiting judges have any greater familiarity with local guam law.
yang rationale for not deferring to the appellate division therefore does not apply to our review of the guam supreme court.in guam guerrero,cir,we recognized that when reviewing a decision by a territorial supreme court on matters of local concern,appellate courts apply a highly deferential standard of review.see also gutierrez,at we have adopted a deferential standard of review for guam supreme court decisions examining local law citing eie guam,at.oxford properties,at on appeal,we review legal determinations of the appellate division of the united states district court for the territory of guam de novo,even where the questions concern interpretations of the law of guam.phoenix engineering,at same saludes ramos,cir holding that a more deferential standard of review is appropriate only for a separate,insular judicial system and is not required where appeals from the territorial trial court go directly to the federal district court.
this deference to the guam supreme court,however,applies only on matters concerning local law we have defined local law as those decisions that develop guam common law.gutierrez pangelinan,cir see also people of the territory of guam dela rosa,cir defining matters of purely local law as those matters limited to construction of local legislation or to court rulings upon questions dealing with local needs and customs.determining the level of diligence necessary to fulfill a duty to mitigate damages similarly deals with questions of local needs and customs.guam courts must balance guam need to compensate wrongfully terminated workers with concerns that such awards can produce idleness if they are too generously awarded.see,labor relations bd.mercy peninsula ambulance,cir holding that giving back pay to those who had been less than reasonably diligent would run contrary to the purposes of the backpay remedy,encourage idleness and reward slothfulness.such a balance can not be struck without taking into account the unique characteristics of guam insular legal market.we accordingly conclude that because the guam supreme court is in a superior position to divine the needs of guam economy and of its labor market,the issue of whether haeuser made reasonable efforts to mitigate his damages involves the kind of local concern which supports a deferential standard of review.
