danny witherspoon challenges the trial court order a requiring the return to germany of his two children from his marriage with julie witherspoon under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,reprinted at,convention b declaring california an inconvenient forum for adjudicating their custody dispute,and c awarding julie temporary custody of the children pending their return to germany.we conclude the trial court erred in failing to make factual findings regarding certain enumerated exceptions to the children return under the convention,and in awarding temporary custody of the children to julie without considering whether doing so would pose a substantial risk of harm to them.we therefore reverse the order and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
danny was a high school band teacher in california when he began a sexual relationship with julie,one of his students when rumors regarding danny sexual involvement with students surfaced,julie,who was still years old,moved with danny to florida where they lived together.in february,the pair traveled to las vegas where julie,then,married danny,at the time years old.the couple daughter was born in september,and a son was born in june.
in,the couple moved to garden grove,california,where danny again worked as a band teacher in,julie joined the army reserves and later requested and received active duty orders.in august,julie left danny and moved to fort hood,texas,with her children.in december,julie was deployed to germany,and her children followed one month later.the children attended school in germany from january until the end of july.in june,julie was transferred to iraq,and returned to germany in august.during her iraq deployment,julie left the children in the care of a child care provider,assertedly because danny refused to take them.
in july,the children were hospitalized due to gastric problems.when julie arrived to take the children home,the attending physician refused to release them because julie was extremely intoxicated,hostile,and behaving in a bizarre fashion.according to social workers investigating the matter in germany,julie threatened to harm both the children and herself.as a result,the army community services offices and the jugendamt youth welfare office took custody of the children,and julie was involuntarily committed to a mental institution for a brief period.
julie commanding officer then contacted danny and informed him the children had been placed in a foster home because the jugendamt would not release them to julie.the officer informed danny the jugendamt would release the children to him if he went to germany.according to danny,julie also called him and told him to come to germany to pick up the children because they were in foster care and she was restricted to barracks.danny traveled to germany and,after speaking with those involved,returned to the united states.the children were sent to danny shortly thereafter and,commencing in early august,resided with him in orange county.
on august,danny filed for divorce in orange county superior court,seeking sole legal and physical custody of the children,and requested an order denying julie visitation absent treatment for alleged alcoholism and mental health problems.danny included with his petition documents he received from the army social work services department and the jugendamt detailing both the present and past abuse and neglect allegations relating to the children.
these documents included the following information.at some time before julie deployment to iraq,social workers substantiated allegations of mild emotional abuse and mild neglect of both children by julie.in december,while julie was in iraq,social workers opened a case based on allegations the children had been neglected by their male child care provider.the case review committee substantiated these allegations,noting the level of concern was significant due to the apparent of the child care provider.after julie return from iraq in january,she defended her child care provider and disputed the allegations.in november,after julie return to germany from iraq,the children school alleged julie neglected the children because she was never at home leading the daughter to do much of the parenting.although army social services found this neglect allegation unsubstantiated in december,the report noted julie disclosed a history of excessive drinking,confirmed by collateral sources.the case review committee recommended psychiatric,substance abuse,and parenting treatment because it believed the children were at risk.before enrolling in treatment,however,julie was encouraged to develop a viable child care plan.julie chose as the children care provider a male soldier who had alcohol and mental health issues serious enough to prompt a pending discharge from the army.the cochair of the case review committee noted prior to the scheduled start date of the inpatient treatment there was a significant physical altercation which the children witnessed and were involved in.the proposed caretaker was intoxicated,combative and verbally abusive to the children and their mother.a neighbor who attempted to intervene was injured to the extent where his leg was broken and he was hospitalized as a result.
on october,julie filed an order to show cause osc seeking under the convention the return of her children to germany,and requesting the court place the children in protective custody pending the hearing on the osc.in her accompanying declaration,julie accused danny of violence toward the children and repeatedly beating her.she also accused danny of having sex with other underage high school students,and sexually abusing a daughter from a previous marriage.julie declared that danny had met his three previous wives while they were his high school students.julie also alleged that she had spoken with beth,danny daughter from a previous marriage,who claimed danny had molested her and beaten her mother,diane,and that she witnessed danny having sex with high school students.
danny filed a responsive declaration denying his previous wives were ever his students,that he ever beat any of his wives,including julie,or that he was a sexual predator.danny filed supporting declarations from beth,who denied ever speaking with julie or being sexually molested,and diane,who denied she had been danny student or that she had been beaten by him.
in response to julie request,the orange county social services agency ssa placed the children in protective custody,but later released them to danny.at the osc hearing,the trial court granted julie convention petition and ordered the children returned to germany.the court also ruled that under the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act,family code section et,california was an inconvenient forum for adjudicating child custody.the court also assumed temporary emergency jurisdiction under family code section,and removed the children from danny custody.the court determined the children were threatened with mistreatment or abuse in danny care due to the parents extreme difference in age.
in the written findings of fact and conclusions of law findings prepared by julie attorneys,the court directed the children be deposited and held in protective custody and placed at the discretion of the director of the department of child protective services pending their return to germany.at the conclusion of the findings,the order included a paragraph which read.until the time of the children actual return,they shall be held in protective custody and placed according to the discretion of the director of the department of child protective services.the court,however,lined out this paragraph,and either left in place or added the following paragraph.as to california,mother shall have exclusive custody of the children until their return to germany and until such time that germany courts have accepted jurisdiction to adjudicate any rights that father may or may not have there.danny now appeals this order 
discussiona.the trial court did not err in finding julie established a prima facie case for return of the children under the convention 
the trial court based its order in part on the convention,as implemented by the international child abduction remedies act icara,united states code,sections.in an action under the convention,we review the lower court partial findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.see friedrich friedrich cir.
the convention and icara seek to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the state of their habitual residence,as well as to secure protection for rights of access.citation.under article of the convention,the removal or retention of a child is wrongful if a it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and b at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.citation.fn.omitted.whallon lynn cir,whallon.the parent filing a convention petition bears the burden of proving wrongful removal by a preponderance of the evidence.id.at e.if the petitioner demonstrates that the child was wrongfully removed,the court must order the child return to the country of habitual residence unless the respondent demonstrates that one of four narrow exceptions applies.whallon,at a.
the parties do not dispute the children habitual residence is germany,where they had lived continuously for over three and years.danny,however,contends his removal or retention of the children did not breach julie custodial rights under german law.in support,danny notes that german law gives both parents equal de jure custody over a child.see shealy shealy cir,bader kramer cir.danny reasons that because he had equal custodial rights under german law,including the right to determine the children residence,his removal or retention could not have been wrongful.although danny correctly cites german law,he misconstrues its effect under the convention.
under the convention,one parent removal or retention of a child may breach the second parent custodial rights under the law of the children habitual residence,even if such acts do not breach the law itself.as the explanatory report to the convention instructs f rom the convention standpoint,the removal of a child by one of the joint holders without the consent of the other,is wrongful,and this wrongfulness derives in this particular case,not from some action in breach of a particular law,but from the fact that such action has disregarded the rights of the other parent which are also protected by law,and has interfered with their normal exercise.the convention true nature is revealed most clearly in these situations it is not concerned with establishing the person to whom custody of the child will belong at some point in the future,nor with the situations in which it may prove necessary to modify a decision awarding joint custody on the basis of facts which have subsequently changed.it seeks,more simply,to prevent a later decision on the matter being influenced by a change of circumstances brought about through unilateral action by one of the parties.elisa,explanatory report hague conference on private international law,italics added.thus,danny removal or retention of the children is considered wrongful under the convention even if danny actions did not violate german law.see currier currier.
danny contends that julie was not actually exercising her rights of custody at the time of removal or retention because the jugendamt had intervened to take physical custody of the children.article of the convention states that the term rights of custody,shall include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and,in particular,the right to determine the child place of residence the explanatory report notes that in determining whether a parent exercises rights of custody,the law of the child habitual residence is invoked in the widest possible sense,and the sources from which custody rights derive are all those upon which a claim can be based within the context of the legal system concerned.citation.fn.omitted.the report also states that the convention favors a flexible interpretation of the terms used,which allows the greatest possible number of cases to be brought into consideration.citation.whallon,supra,at.
to determine whether julie was exercising her rights of custody despite the jugendamt intervention,we consider the effect of that agency actions upon julie rights under german law.in relevant part,section of the german social code sozialgesetzbuch sgb,book viii authorizes the youth welfare office to take a child into its custody when there is an imminent danger to the of the child,and a the person entitled to legal custody does not contest it,or b a family court decision can not be obtained in a timely manner.sgb viii.in caring for the child,the youth welfare office must take into consideration the presumed will of the persons entitled to custody or the persons entitled to upbringing sgb viii.once the child is in custody,the child welfare office shall immediately inform the persons entitled to custody or the persons entitled to the upbringing of the assumption of custody and shall assess with them the risks of endangerment.in the event that the persons entitled to custody or the persons entitled to upbringing contest the assumption of custody,then the child welfare office shall immediately.return the child or young person to the persons entitled to custody or the persons entitled to upbringing if in the assessment of the child welfare office,there is no threat to the of the child or if the persons entitled to custody or the persons entitled to upbringing are willing and able to avert the threat,or.bring about a decision by the family court with regard to the necessary means for the of the child or young person.sgb viii.
thus,under german law julie retained substantial custodial rights after the jugendamt emergency seizure of her children,including the right to demand their immediate return and,if the children are not returned,to require the jugendamt to obtain a court order.we conclude julie continued to exercise rights of custody under the required flexible interpretation of that term.julie has thus established a prima facie case for return under the convention.
b.the trial court failed to make findings regarding article exceptions to return 
physical or psychological situation 
once a petitioner under the convention has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that removal of a child was wrongful see e,the other parent may assert exceptions that,if proven,will prevent the return of the child.one exception to return exists when there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.convention,this exception must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.e b.
courts have construed the convention article exception as narrowly drawn.in re application of adan cir.as the adan court explains were a court to give an overly broad construction to its authority to grant exceptions under the convention,it would frustrate a paramount purpose of that international,to preserve the status quo and to deter parents from crossing international boundaries in search of a more sympathetic court.citations.as the state department has explained,an intolerable situation was not intended to encompass return to a home where money is in short supply,or where educational or other opportunities are more limited than in the requested state.an example of an intolerable situation is one in which a custodial parent sexually abuses the child.if the other parent removes or retains the child to safeguard it against further victimization,and the abusive parent then petitions for the child return under the convention,the court may deny the petition.such action would protect the child from being returned to an intolerab
