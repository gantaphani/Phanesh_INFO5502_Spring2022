as a teenager,arthur patterson was convicted in a south korean court of destroying evidence in connection with a murder.after serving his prison term,patterson left korea for the united states.the south korean government now seeks to prosecute him for the murder itself and requests that the united states extradite him.over patterson objections,a magistrate judge certified him for extradition.patterson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge the certification order.the district court denied patterson petition.
patterson argues that his extradition would violate the extradition treaty between the united states and south korea and the status of forces agreement governing american military personnel and their dependents in south korea.we conclude that neither the treaty nor the agreement bars extradition.we therefore affirm.
background 
in,arthur patterson,a son of an american serviceman stationed in south korea,was involved in some manner in the murder of a korean college student,cho,in a burger king restroom in seoul.patterson and his friend edward lee followed cho into the restroom and came out covered in blood.afterwards,each accused the other of having stabbed cho.almost twenty years later,south korea seeks to prosecute patterson for murder.its extradition request alleges that cho was stabbed with patterson knife,that patterson threw the knife in a sewer after the stabbing,and that two of patterson friends have stated that patterson told them that he killed cho.
in the immediate aftermath of the murder,south korean authorities accepted patterson claim that lee,not patterson,was the murderer.they prosecuted lee for murder and patterson for destruction of evidence.patterson was convicted of destruction of evidence and served slightly more than a year in prison.in,after his release from prison,patterson left south korea for the united states.lee was convicted of murder,but his conviction was overturned on appeal.the south korean government prosecuted lee again,and he was acquitted.
in,south korean prosecutors obtained a warrant for patterson arrest and sent an extradition request to the united states government.in,the government sought and obtained an arrest warrant and arrested patterson.the government then filed a complaint in federal district court seeking patterson extradition to south korea.patterson opposed extradition.he argued that because the murder occurred in,and because he had already been tried and convicted of a crime related to the murder,two international agreements bar extradition for the prosecution south korea now seeks to bring.
a magistrate judge rejected patterson arguments and certified him for extradition.patterson then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court denied the petition,and patterson timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
extradition 
a state party to an extradition treaty ordinarily must comply with a request of another state party to arrest and deliver a person sought by that state for criminal prosecution.see restatement third of the foreign relations law of the united states supp.extradition rests on the premise that a ll nations have a common interest in the repression of crime.john bassett moore,a treatise on extradition and interstate rendition.

after the united states has sought an arrest warrant for the person to be extradited known as the relator,a federal or state judicial officer must hold a hearing to determine whether to certify the relator for extradition.the role of the judge is very limited.yo,at.the judge must determine whether there is evidence sufficient to sustain the charge under the provisions of the proper treaty or convention,or,in other words,whether there is probable cause.id.quoting citation omitted.if the judge determines that there is probable cause,he or she is required to certify the individual as extraditable to the secretary of state.blaxland,at.the secretary then decides,in the exercise of his or her discretion,whether to extradite the relator to the requesting country.yo,at.

potential bars to extradition 
patterson argues that two agreements between the united states and south korea bar his extradition.first,he argues that his extradition would violate the extradition treaty between the two countries because his prosecution for murder would be barred by the statute of limitations in the united states,and thus would violate the treaty provision.second,he argues that his extradition would violate the provision of the status of forces agreement governing american military personnel,and their dependents,in south korea.we address each argument in turn.
extradition treaty 
patterson first argues that the extradition treaty between the united states and south korea prohibits his extradition because his prosecution would be untimely.the question is whether the treaty provision,which states that extradition may be denied when the prosecution would have been barred by the relevant statute of limitations in the united states,imposes a mandatory bar to extradition.we conclude that it does not impose a mandatory bar.
article of the extradition treaty between the united states and south korea provides,in part 
lapse of time 
extradition may be denied under this treaty when the prosecution or the execution of punishment of the offense for which extradition is requested would have been barred because of the statute of limitations of the requested state had the same offense been committed in the requested state.

the parties agree that patterson has been certified for extradition for a crime for which he can not now be prosecuted in the united states.the magistrate judge certified patterson for extradition only for murder,concluding that the evidence did not support a finding of probable cause for premeditated murder.the magistrate judge then applied the federal statute of limitations for murder,see a,for the purpose of addressing the provision of article.the government challenges neither the finding of probable cause nor the application of the federal statute of limitations.however,the government contends that the provision of article is not judicially enforceable.
we begin with the text of the treaty.medellin texas,the interpretation of a treaty,like the interpretation of a statute,begins with its text.article provides,extradition may be denied.treaty,art.vi emphasis added.the normal reading of may is permissive,not mandatory.the most natural reading of article,therefore,is that untimeliness is a discretionary factor for the secretary of state to consider in deciding whether to grant extradition.that is,the secretary may decline to extradite someone whose pro
