our original opinion in this matter was filed february.the california supreme court granted review on april.while the case was pending before that court,the united states supreme court handed down american ins.ass garamendi,d.the garamendi case held that california holocaust victim insurance relief act was unconstitutional,because it conflicted with express federal policy concerning the recovery of insurance proceeds confiscated by nazi germany.in light of garamendi,the california supreme court transferred this case back to this court,with instructions to vacate our earlier decision and reconsider the matter in light of the federal court garamendi opinion.
the interim has also given us the benefit of deutsch turner cir,a ninth circuit decision holding that the very law at issue before allows former american pow forced to do slave labor for japanese companies during world war ii to sue those unconstitutional because it intrudes on the federal government power to make and resolve war claims.see id.at.that decision was made final only a few weeks ago,with the denial of the pows petition to have the united states supreme court take the case.
we now vacate our prior decision and issue this new opinion in light of both of these two federal court decisions,plus the additional briefing submitted by both sides after the supreme court transferred the case back to this court 
introduction 
before us are claims by surviving american prisoners of war against a number of japanese companies for whom they were forced to do slave labor during world war ii.it is a remarkable case,one in which the attorney general of the united states and the attorney general of the state of california are on opposite sides.
the immediate cause of the litigation is a relatively recent change to our state law which was intended to allow second world war slave labor victims to bring a lawsuit to recover compensation under state law for their labor against private companies who benefited by that labor during the war.code civ.
make no mistake about legislation actually creates new claims that would not otherwise exist.see deutsch turner,supra,at regardless of any law,the california legislature chose to create a specific cause of action for persons subjected to slave labor by the nazis and their allies and sympathizers.as the ninth circuit deutsch decision points out,the law defines a class of plaintiffs who may sue,sets forth a method for measuring damages,and establishes a special rule for corporations affiliated with any nazi ally.ibid.and as should be obvious to anyone,any arguable causes of action under california law which american pow might have possessed against japanese nationals or corporations for conduct during world war ii have long since expired.the only way the plaintiffs in the case before us now could have a viable lawsuit against a japanese corporation for conduct which ended almost years ago is under this new law 
the specific plaintiffs here are survivors of japanese prisoner of war camps who have brought this lawsuit against a group of japanese companies,mainly mitsubishi and mitsui,for which they were forced to work in world war ii.the trial court overruled the demurrers of the mitsui companies and denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings brought by the mitsubishi companies.
ordinarily appellate courts are reluctant to entertain writ proceedings based on erroneously overruled demurrers or improperly denied judgments on the pleadings.however,because the plaintiffs are world war ii veterans,this case clearly merits expeditious consideration.these plaintiffs are heroes,who endured some of the worst privations ever visited on american prisoners.it would be a disservice to them to create a false hope of monetary recovery by permitting a lengthy trial only to reverse the judgment years later because federal law required it.regrettably however,as we explain below,the peace treaty that formally ended world war ii between the united states and japan expressly preempts the state law which would otherwise allow these plaintiffs to sue.
there is no way to avoid confrontation with the terms of the treaty.the united states supreme court garamendi opinion in the holocaust insurance case was a decision,which turned on just exactly how clear a federal policy must be before state action is preempted by the federal government foreign affairs power.much of justice ginsburg dissent in that decision was devoted to making the argument that the executive branch efforts to secure the payment of insurance claims otherwise owed holocaust survivors were simply not express enough,garamendi,supra.at dis.opn.of ginsburg.she,along with justices stevens,scalia,and thomas wanted a clear statement in some formal expression of foreign policy before they would take the step of invalidating a state law.ibid.obviously,the garamendi majority disagreed.for them the conflict between various federal executive agreements and california holocaust insurance relief was sufficiently clear to require finding preemption.at.
along these lines,the plaintiffs,in briefing received after the transfer from the supreme court,build their argument on the premise that the garamendi majority did not go so far as to say that mere field preemption was enough to invalid state legislation which happened to wander into that field.see garamendi,supra.at it is a fair question whether respect for the executive foreign relations power requires a categorical choice between the contrasting theories of field and conflict preemption but the question requires no answer here.rather,the plaintiffs here assert that garamendi relied on an express conflict,and then they say that the only evidence of federal occupation is the treaty,and the treaty does not preclude their lawsuit.so we have no choice but to confront the terms of the treaty.
the very process of explaining the treaty,however,also requires that we recognize the sacrifice of these plaintiffs.that sacrifice deserves to be explicitly recognized by the judiciary of this country,regardless of what the treaty said or the validity of the legal claims they are now,all the more so in light of our determination that the treaty precludes this lawsuit.the unique circumstances of this case,including the special nature of the plaintiffs claims arising out of a world war,compel the conclusion that these plaintiffs be given a forthright,honest explanation why their government waived their rights to seek redress in american courts against the companies that benefited from their slave labor.
ii.background of the treaty 
preliminary considerations 
we must begin by acknowledging the obvious the treaty was made by the federal government of the united states,and it is binding on us as a state court.in fact,the constitution specifically mentions state courts in making treaties the supreme law of the land.article of the united states constitution provides that all treaties made,or which shall be made,under the authority of the united states,shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.as a treaty it therefore trumps any law of the state of california,whether that be framed as a matter of preemption under garamendi or simply because there is an outright conflict.
while treaty analysis obviously begins with the text of the treaty itself,el al israel airlines,tseng,d,federal and state courts regularly look to the historical context of a treaty to elucidate its meaning,particularly where any terms are ambiguous or where the treaty is silent on a point,hosaka united airlines,cir,because warsaw convention was silent on the availability of the doctrine of forum non conveniens,court considered historical context in which particular amendment had been offered bruguier class,looking to historical context of treaty to determine whether a particular indian reservation would continue.
because t reaties are construed more liberally than private agreements,to ascertain their meaning we may look beyond the written words to the history of the treaty,the negotiations,and the practical construction adopted by the parties.air france saks,d accord,chan korean air lines,d recognizing that drafting history may be consulted to shed light on ambiguous text of treaty opinion by scalia.even plain language must be viewed in its historical context.oregon dep t of fish and wildlife klamath indian tribe,d even though legal ambiguities are resolved to the benefit of the indians,courts can not ignore plain language that,viewed in historical context and given a fair appraisal,clearly runs counter to a tribe later claims see also curry forest service,noting that historical context of migratory bird treaty further demonstrated the intent of the treaty beyond its text not to apply to the federal government itself.
in the present case,historical context is particularly important because it eliminates any doubt in the language as to whether the treaty was intended to cover the claims of american pow against private japanese companies.to the degree that the treaty may arguably be vague in the sense that people of ordinary intelligence have to guess at the meaning of words or ambiguous in the sense that words have multiple meanings clarification by reference to the surrounding circumstances under which the agreement was made can serve as a test of the validity of any adjudication of the bare treaty language 
b.the maltreatment of american pow 
the proper place to begin is with the sufferings endured by americans taken prisoner by the japanese in world war ii.
most of the plaintiffs were taken prisoner in the spring after the surrender of bataan in april then came the infamous bataan death march,where prisoners,most weak and ill,were prodded by bayonets to march in the tropical heat for six days and nights without hardly any food and water if they failed to keep up they were run through.
the prisoners were eventually put into hell ships to be taken to japan.pow ships are supposed to be marked,so that one side does not attack its own nationals.the hell ships,however,were unmarked,and in fact a number were sunk by american submarines en route to japan 
the conditions were horrendous,and bespoke gratuitous cruelty.the prisoners were packed like sardines into hatches,which were always sealed sick prisoners could not get air.typically the prisoners were not allowed to empty the oilcans used as latrines more than twice a day,despite the fact that most of them were suffering from diarrhea,and the cans were overflowing 
once in japan,the prisoners were forced into slave labor for private japanese companies usually mining that supplied the japanese war effort.as the plaintiffs themselves now point out,the use of that forced labor was contrary to clearly established international law regarding the use of the labor of prisoners of war 
the experience of frank bigelow,a veteran of corregidor,was typical everyday the japanese army delivered us to a coal mine owned by mitsui,one of the biggest business conglomerates in japan,and we were their slave labor.mitsui mining was right up there in front and we were told to work or hours,short rations.usually,tiny portions of rice and seaweed soup could barely sustain us as we were doing physical,heavy labor.i was skin and bones,and at foot,inches,i weighed just pounds.
there were constant beatings,which would increase whenever the united states won an important battle over of the some americans captured and interned by the japanese military during world war ii died.chinese prisoners of war fared even worse.of the tens of thousands captured,at war end japanese authorities acknowledged having only chinese prisoners 
reactions to that maltreatment 
the enslavement of american pow to benefit the japanese war effort and private japanese companies was well known after the war.in,the british held war crime trials in hong kong,indicting civilian employees of the nippon mining company for the maltreatment of prisoners of war forced to labor in the kinaseki mine in formosa.eight of the nine were found guilty and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment 
then there was the postwar prosecution in american courts of tomoya kawakita for treason.kawakita was an american citizen who had been hired to work for a private mining company interpreting communications with pows who were mostly from bataan and who were forced to work in his company mines.see kawakita united states.kawakita returned to the united states in,but was recognized by former american pow,arrested,and tried for treason.id.at.reviewing the evidence,the federal district court had said in that by his brutal,tactics,kawakita had added many tons of nickel ore to japan war effort that never otherwise would have been mined or smelted by american prisoners of war.united states kawakita.
after the war,assets in the united states and its territories were seized by the office of alien property,which operated under the auspices of the united states justice department.state department estimates place the total amount seized at about million the proceeds were placed in a war claims fund for ultimate distribution to the pow.it amounted to a day for missed meals and per day for lost wages 
considerations leading to the peace treaty 
when most americans think of the end of the war with japan they think of the formal surrender ceremony on the battleship missouri that took place in september shortly after the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki.most do not realize that it was not until the early,in the midst of another war,that the treaty formally ending world war ii with japan was finally negotiated and concluded.
there can be no doubt that the korean war gave a special impetus to concluding the treaty with japan.the main theme of president truman opening address to the conference on the japanese peace treaty,held at the same san francisco opera house where the united nations was founded,was the need to restore a sovereign japan to the company of american allies so that it could help serve as a bulwark against communist aggression in korea.see public papers of the presidents of the united states,harry truman,printing office at hereinafter truman papers.
in his address truman recounted the changes which had occurred in japan in the short span of six years.the secret police had been abolished.the japanese people had a new constitution with a bill of rights.universal suffrage had been established.there were now free and independent labor unions.it was time to restore full sovereignty to the japanese people.truman papers,supra,at.
truman then stressed the urgency of the task by alluding to recent military offensives launched in korea.unfortunately,today,the world is faced with new threats of aggression.many of the countries represented here are now engaged in a hard fight to uphold the united nations against international lawbreaking.there are thugs among nations,just as among individuals.id.at.
truman also spoke about the subject of reparations,in words that have particular significance to the case at bar.he reminded his audience that the united states had not forgotten bataan truman papers,supra,at.but he juxtaposed that thought with another one,going in the opposite direction the new treaty did not contain the seeds of another war,at.the tenor of truman remarks was that japan was being welcomed into the company of allied nations despite what had happened during world war ii.
the reference to seeds of another war was an obvious allusion to the versailles treaty that had ended world war john foster dulles,the chief american negotiator of the treaty that ended world war ii with japan,had himself been at the versailles negotiations,and had in fact served on the reparations commission.historians,of course,may debate the causes of world war ii forever,and in particular the role heavy reparations against germany may have played we need not enter that fray.however,it is clear that the key american decision maker involved in the treaty,john foster dulles,accepted the conventional wisdom of his day that heavy reparations against germany had played a major part in bringing about the rise of hitler and the subsequent war 
the need to spare the japanese economy from heavy reparations was also a major reason the senate foreign relations committee was willing to go along with the treaty.in its report recommending approval of the treaty,the committee said obviously insistence upon the payment of reparations in any proportion commensurate with the claims of the injured countries and their nationals would wreck japan economy,dissipate any credit that it may possess at present,destroy the initiative of its people,and create misery and chaos in which the seeds of discontent and communism would flourish,sess,emphasis added.
besides the need to cultivate japan as an american ally against communist aggression and the concomitant need to protect its economy from heavy reparations,there was another motivating force for the treaty,though not one mentioned by truman the danger of a cycle of recriminations when each side perceives itself to have been the object of grievous wrongs.there was a need for a mutual release of war claims so bygones could be bygones.
we have already mentioned the suffering of american prisoners of war endured at the hands of the japanese army and at the hands of private japanese companies.what we have not mentioned to this point is that the japanese felt that they too had claims.few americans are aware that in a japanese court,in what has become known as the shimoda case,held that the united states had violated international law by bombing hiroshima and nagasaki regardless of whether one agrees with that decision in fact,in an ironic twist,in the shimoda case the japanese government took the american side and argued that the united states had violated international law,the main significance of the case for our purposes is what the court actually did.it found against the plaintiffs because even though the shimoda court was willing to say that the united states had in fact violated international law,it also said that japan had waived the right of its nationals to recover against the united states because of the treaty.
the use of nuclear weapons at hiroshima and nagasaki and the treatment of american pows in japan were not unrelated events.in fact,one of the main reasons given by president harry truman for the use of nuclear weapons on hiroshima and nagasaki was the mistreatment of american prisoners of war.in a radio address to the american people on the very day of the nagasaki bombing truman said having found the bomb we have used it.we have used it against those who attacked us without warning at pearl harbor,against those who have starved and beaten and executed american prisoners of war,against those who have abandoned all pretense of obeying international laws of warfare.
without a waiver of all war crime claims that could have been brought by either side,japan and the united states might have wrangled endlessly about liabilities arising out of the war 
iii.the text of the treaty 
with that context as a backdrop,we now turn to the text of the treaty itself.the actual language of a treaty is,after all,the ultimately dispositive source of judicial decisionmaking,chan korean air lines,supra,at.we must thus be governed by the text.
allied prisoners of war were the subject of article of the treaty.that provision states as an expression of its desire to indemnify those members of the armed forces of the allied powers who suffered undue hardships while prisoners of war of japan,japan will transfer its assets and those of its nationals in countries that were neutral during the war,or which were at war with any of the allied powers,or,at its option,the equivalent of such assets,to the international committee of the red cross,which would liquidate such assets and distribute the resultant fund to appropriate national agencies,for the benefit of former prisoners of war and their families on such basis as it may determine to be equitable.treaty of peace with japan,at,peace treaty.it was article that created the fund from which,as senator hatch would later term them,meager payments to american pow would be made 
article covered the subject of allied claims against japan and is at the center of the current controversy.article begins by explicitly recognizing that japan could pay for all the damages and suffering it had caused it is recognized that japan should pay reparations to the allied powers for the damage and suffering caused by it during the war.nevertheless it is also recognized that the resources of japan are not presently sufficient,if it is to maintain a viable economy,to make complete reparation for all such damage and suffering and at the same time meet its other obligations.peace treaty,supra,at,emphasis added.
the next paragraph,article b contains the waiver language.here is its complete text except as otherwise provided in the present treaty,the allied powers waive all reparations claims of the allied powers,other claims of the allied powers and their nationals arising out of any actions taken by japan and its nationals in the course of the prosecution of the war,and claims of the allied powers for direct military costs of occupation.peace treaty,supra,at,emphasis added.
iv.pow claims were covered by the treaty 
pow claims arose because of japan prosecution of the war 
in light of the historical circumstances mentioned above,a number of the questions inherent in the text of article b are readily resolved.the united states government was fully aware of the heinous treatment of american pow truman had,in fact,justified the use of atomic weapons precisely because of that treatment.recompensing the pow would be ruinous to the japanese economy,as recognized by truman in his speech and by the senate foreign relations committee report,and impliedly in the first part of article,which stressed the need to develop a viable japanese economy.it logically follows that even allowing pow to pursue private claims against the large japanese companies who had exploited their labor would be ruinous as well.an economy dominated by these zaibatsu would suffer greatly if they could be subjected to such claims,particularly if litigated in american courts in front of american juries.these were large companies,dominating the japanese economy.to allow claims against them would stifle whatever prospects there were for a prosperous japan in the postwar world.
by the same means the argument that pow claims for forced labor did not arise in the course of the prosecution of the war effort is resolved as well.it may not have been legal to force american pow to do work for the japanese war effort,but it surely created other claims which,if litigated and properly compensated in american courts,would have a devastating effect on the japanese economy.it bears repeating in this regard that the plaintiffs were members of the american armed forces taken prisoner by the japanese army after pearl harbor during the war in the pacific.all were forcibly held in pow camps maintained by the japanese army during the war.they could have done no work for any private person except as compelled to do so by the japanese army in wartime.when they tell the stories of their existence in the japanese pow camps,their days invariably began with being marched by the japanese army to some facility operated by a private company.and their work,as the federal district court noted when the kawakita treason case was tried,added many tons of nickel ore to japan war effort.see united states kawakita,supra.at.it is telling,in that regard,that the first named defendant in this case was part of the conglomerate that made the zero the name comes from mitsubishi type,japan main fighter plane.
indeed,no other result would be consistent with the kawakita treason case as it was finally decided by the united states supreme court in.as mentioned above,kawakita was an american who worked as an interpreter in a private mine,namely the oeyama nickel industry.when he was prosecuted for treason,his main defense was that he had already renounced his citizenship by virtue of accepting employment for the company,which he claimed was the performance of duties under the government of japan.see kawakita united states,supra,at.
the supreme court rejected that defense.kawakita did work for the government.though he took orders from the military,he wore an insignia showing that he was a civilian he had no duties to perform toward the pow except as an interpreter.the fact that the company was part of the japanese war economy did not change his status from private to governmental.kawakita united states,supra,at.even so,the united states supreme court upheld kawakita treason conviction precisely because his conduct toward his fellow american citizens in the mines,even as a private employee of a japanese company,still gave aid and comfort to the japanese war effort 
the overt acts which formed the basis of the conviction included incidents straight out of the complaints in the case before us.kawakita regularly swore at the prisoners,beat them,threatened them,and punished them if they showed the least bit of tiredness.in one instance,he kicked an american pow when,after becoming ill and dizzy,he slowed down in lifting pieces of ore rocks from the tracks.in another,he struck a prisoner who was weak and emaciated to make him carry two buckets of lead instead of one.kawakita united states,supra,at.in yet another,he ordered a pow to carry a heavy log up an slope.when the prisoner fell,kawakita delayed his removal back to the pow camp for five hours.id.at.there were another five such instances of cruel treatment of american pow as slave laborers.
the supreme court upheld the treason conviction because these were acts that gave aid and comfort to the enemy.kawakita united states,supra,at.as the high court said,they showed conduct which actually promoted the cause of the enemy.they were acts which tended to strengthen the enemy and advance its interests.these acts in their setting would help make all the prisoners fearful,docile,and subservient these acts would tend to give the enemy the heart and courage to go on with the war.all of the overt acts tended to strengthen japan war efforts all of them encouraged the enemy and advanced its interests.id.at.
if the maltreatment of american pow by a civilian employee of a civilian company was sufficient aid and comfort to the japanese during wartime that it constituted treason if committed by an american citizen,there can be no denying that the plaintiffs claims are,in a horrible sense,the same facts as the kawakita case except viewed from the vantage of the american prisoners,not one of their in the course of the prosecution of the war for purposes of the treaty.
confirming our conclusion is what the ninth circuit noted in the deutsch case.it noted that the california legislation under which the plaintiffs have brought this suit is framed strictly in terms of what happened during world war ii.see deutsch,supra,at.and in fact the ninth circuit also noted there was really no dispute that the companies sued here were operating for the benefit of our wartime enemy,japan.ibid.
the most natural reading of the prosecution is thus one which is not limited to merely lawful acts.claims,after all,almost always arise out of unlawful or wrongful acts.
b.the difference in language between article and article makes no difference 
next there is the matter of the difference in language between article where the allies waived claims and article where the japanese waived claims.as the plaintiffs correctly point out here,article is broader.article a of the treaty provides japan waives all claims of japan and its nationals against the allied powers and their nationals arising out of the war or out of actions taken because of the existence of a state of war,and waives all claims arising from the presence,operations or actions of forces or authorities of any of the allied powers in japanese territory prior to the coming into force of the present treaty.
moreover,in explaining what is encompassed by the waiver provisions of the article first paragraph,article b makes an explicit reference to the claims of japanese pows.the foregoing waiver includes any claims arising out of actions taken by any of the allied powers with respect to japanese ships between september,and the coming into force of the present treaty,as well as any claims and debts arising in respect to japanese prisoners of war and civilian internees in the hands of the allied powers,but does not include japanese claims specifically recognized in the laws of any allied power enacted since september.the plaintiffs lay heavy emphasis on the fact that article contains a specific reference to japanese pow whereas its counterpart,article,does contain a specific reference to allied pow.
it is an argument that has force,and is supported by the venerable legal principle that in specifically mentioning one thing you impliedly exclude another.expressio unius est exclusio alterius.
on balance,however,it can not carry the day in light of the text of article,specifically dealing with allied pow,and the basic facts in the historical record we have already mentioned.the specific provisions for allied prisoners of war in article of the treaty would lead one to the natural conclusion that the fund being set up in that article was intended to serve as the main source of compensation for them.any doubt is removed in the senate foreign relations committee report and the clear expression of intent in article a to protect the viability of the japanese economy.
remember that in there was no california statute yet limiting the value of american prisoner of war claims to just the value of their forced labor.to the degree that they had existing claims for battery,torture,and intentional infliction of emotional distress of the worst sort,those claims would easily justify punitive damages,and such punitive damages could have resulted in the bankruptcy of the japanese companies involved.
we need only contemplate the enormity of the sacrifices of the plaintiffs in this case to recognize what would have happened if an american jury had one of the japanese corporate defendants in front of it and was not limited to just the value of the forced labor.what had the senate foreign relations committee report said insistence on paying reparations in any proportion commensurate with those claims would wreck japan economy.
thus particularly given how horribly the plaintiffs in this case were treated,it must be assumed that the united states government knew that properly compensating them would be economically impossible.the strong indicia of intent to protect the japanese economy as expressed by the key players on the american side must necessarily carry more weight than the asymmetry between articles and,which,we must acknowledge,cuts the other way.
article does not apply to individual claims 
plaintiffs further contend that article,which can be described as the most favored nation clause,allows them to maintain their claims.article says japan will be prepared to conclude with any state which signed or adhered to the united nations declaration of january,and which is at war with japan,or with any state which previously formed a part of the territory of a state named in article,which is not a signatory of the present treaty,a bilateral treaty of peace on the same or substantially the same terms as are provided for in the present treaty,but this obligation on the part of japan will expire three years after the first coming into force of the present treaty.should japan make a peace settlement or war claims settlement with any state granting that state greater advantages than those provided by the present treaty,those same advantages shall be extended to the parties to the present treaty.
preliminarily,we must note that the most favored nation argument based on article tacitly acknowledges that article would otherwise preclude the lawsuit.the most favored nation argument only makes sense if you first say that,yes,the united states did get as good a deal under the terms of the treaty as some other nation got outside the treaty.
the allegation is that because so many of its citizens had lost property when the japanese invaded dutch indonesia,the government of the netherlands would not have signed the peace treaty with japan unless it got a side deal with japan for some compensation to those citizens the side deal involved the government of japan paying private dutch citizens allied nationals under the terms of article about million in reparations.
the most favored nation argument fails because,by its terms,article creates no private rights.the key phrase is those same advantages shall be extended to the parties to the present treaty.individual american citizens are not parties to the treaty,only the united states is.see henman cir,it is up to the offended nations to determine whether a violation of sovereign interests occurred and requires redress.thus even if we assume private dutch citizens got compensation from the japanese government where american pow had,it was the responsibility of the american government to enforce the article by making the japanese government pay something to them.there is nothing in article that makes it.rather,it requires one of the parties to enforce it.
there are other fatal flaws in the most favored nation argument as well.even if the united states were to obtain as favorable a side deal as the dutch allegedly got,what would that be only direct reparations from the government of japan,which is not the subject of this litigation.there is no indication that private dutch citizens were allowed to sue private japanese companies in dutch court for loss of property.
v.there is express conflict between california law and the treaty 
the ninth circuit,in the deutsch case,came to the same conclusion we come to now,but did so without examining the terms of the treaty.we believe we have taken the more conservative course,because a treaty is as formal an expression of american foreign policy as it is possible to imagine.it is the product of both the federal executive and legislative branches.if a treaty does not allow a state to create or entertain preexisting claims on the part of pow,then the matter is final.there can be no room,such as justice ginsburg found in her dissent in garamendi,for state action because the federal policy was not clear enough.
the treaty is clear enough.short of the clairvoyance which would explicitly predict in what the california legislature would do in,the treaty is succinctly precludes the claims of american nationals against japanese nationals arising out of the war 
vi.application of the treaty to the pow claims against japanese nationals is constitutional 
finally,there is the argument that even if the treaty did clearly preclude or preempt,for purposes of our discussion now,the distinction is immaterial the plaintiffs lawsuit,it could not do so constitutionally.the theory behind the argument is that a treaty can not diminish individual rights otherwise guaranteed by the constitution,and the treaty has done so.thus in their posttransfer briefing,the plaintiffs point to a footnote in garamendi and argue that preemption is subject to the constitution guarantees of individual rights,see garamendi,supra.at,fn,implying that among their individual rights is the right to sue japanese companies for wartime forced labor.in supplemental briefing the plaintiffs are even plainer the treaty should not be read to take away from private american citizens their right to sue private japanese interests for the deprivations perpetrated on them during the war years.
essentially,what the plaintiffs are saying is that the united states government can not constitutionally take away the right of american nationals to sue japanese nationals for claims arising out of world war ii.perhaps plaintiffs believe that the federal government can surrender its own claims against foreign nationals,but they do not believe that it can surrender the claims of its nationals against foreign nationals.senator hatch also said as much in the hearings before the united states senate judiciary committee on the pow claims referenced in fn,ante 
we do not,in this opinion,address the question of any claims other than the ones these specific plaintiffs have against japanese nationals,claims which arise out of their being taken prisoners of war in world war ii.but as to those claims,the argument that a peace treaty could not prevent their assertion in a state court is clearly untenable.
if there is one thing that the united states constitution is clear about,it is that only the federal government has the power to make war and peace with foreign nations,and that power specifically includes the authority to make peace treaties.specifically 
article i,section the congress shall have power to provide for the common defense to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas,and offences against the law of nations to declare war,and make rules concerning captures on land and water.
article i,section no state shall enter into any treaty,alliance,or confederation no state shall,without the consent of congress,enter into any agreement or compact with a foreign power,or engage in war,unless actually invaded,or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.
article ii,section the president shall have power,by and with the advice and consent of the senate,to make treaties.
article vi a ll treaties made,or which shall be made,under the authority of the united states,shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.
the power to make war and then conclude it with a peace treaty is an undeniable incident of the very fact of having a national government.the united states supreme court once went so far as to say that even if the constitution had not explicitly committed those powers exclusively to the federal government,those powers would be exclusive to the federal government anyway the powers to declare and wage war,to conclude peace,to make treaties,to maintain diplomatic relations with other sovereignties,if they had never been mentioned in the constitution,would have vested in the federal government as necessary concomitants of nationality.united states export.
it is therefore inescapable that the claims of american nationals arising out of duly declared war against foreign nationals as part of the prosecution of that war may be constitutionally compromised in a peace treaty.it is the nature of war,after all,for the combatants to do things that,in peace time,would otherwise constitute torts in most legal systems.if the united states government did not have the constitutional power to resolve claims arising out of war by american citizens against foreign nationals,then it would not have the power to conclude a genuine peace treaty.a state legislature could elect to keep on fighting a war indefinitely by allowing its courts to be used to civilly prosecute enemy combatants,particularly if it did not like the deal that the federal government made in the peace treaty.garamendi,supra,at the basic fact is that california seeks to use an iron fist where the president has consistently chosen kid gloves.and that would be totally inconsistent with the constitution of the united states.california is not allowed to have its own foreign policy.
if there be any doubt concerning our analysis,it is dispelled by the garamendi decision itself.garamendi,as mentioned above,arose out of california legislation imposing certain requirements,specifically disclosure requirements,on german insurance companies that had issued policies to victims of the holocaust.the majority opinion noted that these disclosure requirements were far more sweeping than the arrangements worked out by the federal executive via an international commission to process those claims.see garamendi,supra,at.
it is thus important to note that garamendi,like the case before us,involved private claims by americans against foreign versus national claims.in a major passage in the opinion,the garamendi majority made it quite clear that such claims arising out of war can be constitutionally compromised by the federal government,despite state law to the contrary.that passage bears quotation here,our emphasis added 
the executive agreements at issue here do differ in one respect from those just mentioned insofar as they address claims associated with formerly belligerent states,but against corporations,not foreign governments.but the distinction does not matter.historically,wartime claims against even nominally private entities have become issues in international diplomacy,and three of the postwar settlements dealing with reparations implicating private parties were made by the executive alone.acceptance of this historical practice is supported by a good pragmatic reason for depending on executive agreements to settle claims against foreign corporations associated with wartime experience.as shown by the history of insurance confiscation mentioned earlier,untangling government policy from private initiative during war time is often so hard that diplomatic action settling claims against private parties may well be just as essential in the aftermath of hostilities as diplomacy to settle claims against foreign governments.while a sharp line between public and private acts works for many purposes in the domestic law,insisting on the same line in defining the legitimate scope of the executive international negotiations would hamstring the president in settling international controversies.garamendi,supra.at,fn.omitted.
not surprisingly then,the court would go on to declare that securing private interests is an express object of diplomacy today,and v indicating victims injured by acts and omissions of enemy corporations in wartime is thus within the traditional subject matter of foreign policy in which national,not state,interests are overriding garamendi,supra.at.
if,in garamendi,the high court would see no constitutional impediment to the federal executive efforts to compromise property claims of civilian holocaust victims,then a fortiori there can be no constitutional impediment where a treaty not just the unilateral efforts of one administration compromises claims of american combatants for actions taken against those combatants as prisoners of war by a foreign government and its nationals during time of war as part of the the foreign government overall war effort.
vii.conclusion 
the united states constitution directly binds state court judges where treaties are concerned.the treaty is express in not allowing the claims of the plaintiffs.that does not in any way diminish the heroism of these plaintiffs.it does mean,though,that we can not provide any satisfaction of their claims in california state courts.
we are therefore required to let a peremptory writ issue commanding the superior court to vacate its orders overruling the demurrers and denying the motions for judgment on the pleadings in these cases,and enter a new and different order dismissing the cases.
in the interests of justice each side will bear its own costs.
subdivision b of code of civil procedure section provides in pertinent part any second world war slave labor victim may bring an action to recover compensation for labor performed as a second world war slave labor victim from any entity or successor in interest thereof,for whom that labor was performed,either directly or through a subsidiary or affiliate.all further statutory references in this opinion are to the code of civil procedure,and specifically to section of that code.
the statute was enacted in.structurally,subdivision b of section see fn,above creates the claim,while subdivision c makes clear that the statute of limitations does not run on it until.subdivision c provides any action brought under this section shall not be dismissed for failure to comply with the applicable statute of limitation,if the action is commenced on or before december.in this opinion we do not deal with the question of whether the state legislature,consistent with the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions,can revive state tort claims,battery that had long ago expired under their applicable statute of limitations.
there are three areas of the treaty that might arguably fit these definitions.one,in article b of the treaty,the victorious allied nations waive claims of their nationals arising out of the prosecution of the war against japan and japanese nationals.according to the plaintiffs,the word waive should not be construed to extinguish actions brought in american state courts under state law because the reference to the claims of the allied powers and their nationals necessarily implicates international claims only.along those same lines,the argument is that the reference to japanese nationals raises the question of whether the word should be construed to include corporate entities,such as the defendants here,which have,in the era,grown into large multinational,article b uses the phrase prosecution of the war.according to the plaintiffs,the word prosecution should not be interpreted to include actions which are contrary to international law.in particular,they point out that while the geneva convention specifically article allowed pows to be forced to do labor,that labor can not have any connection with the operation of the war such as putting pows to work making munitions.they reason that since their own labor was in connection with the japanese war effort,it was illegal under the geneva convention and therefore not part of the prosecution of the,plaintiffs place great stress on the differences between article allied claims are does not parallel article the japanese waive their claims against the allied powers and their nationals.what more,the japanese waiver in article contains a specific reference to japanese pow,yet the allied waiver in article contains no specific reference to allied pow.for the plaintiffs,the asymmetry is itself significant,in that it shows that the claims of allied pow,unlike the claims of japanese pow,were not being waived.
it is clear from the tenor of the plaintiffs arguments that they believe there should be a trial as to the circumstances of the treaty.but at least the broadest circumstances behind the treaty can not seriously be disputed.thus,ironically enough,most of the discussion in this opinion about the historical circumstances of the treaty draws either from a sources of which the plaintiffs themselves have asked us to take judicial notice,such as a senate report that was clearly the product of hearings favorably disposed to the plaintiffs claims and a new york times article b sources which explicitly advocate the plaintiffs position mainly the holmes book referenced in footnote below c a united states supreme court case the kawakita opinion or d the presidential papers of president harry truman.
the plaintiffs have helpfully provided the record of the hearings of the united states senate judiciary committee entitled former world war ii pow a struggle for justice,dated june,see hearing before com.on judiciary,sess.hereafter senate report.the senate report contains the testimony of a number of the surviving pows.we take judicial notice of this report.
