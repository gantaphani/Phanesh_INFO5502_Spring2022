kent frank was convicted of traveling and engaging in illicit sexual conduct with three minor girls in cambodia,of traveling with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct,and of purchasing the girls in order to produce sexually explicit visual depictions of them,in violation of b,c and b a.on appeal,frank raises the following issues whether the district court correctly denied his motion to suppress statements obtained by foreign officials in cambodia whether applies extraterritorially whether the district court correctly denied his motion for judgment of acquittal as to the sufficiency of evidence for purchase under b and illicit sexual conduct under c whether the district court erred in instructing the jury as to the definition of purchase under b and sexual act under b whether there was reversible error in the prosecutor opening and closing statements whether the district court plainly erred in imposing concurrent sentences for counts,and whether the district court violated federal rule of criminal procedure in giving supplemental jury instructions at the defense request and whether frank confession was properly admitted.after thorough review of the briefs and the record,and with the benefit of oral argument,we affirm frank convictions.
background 
in january,frank,a united states citizen and resident,was detained in cambodia by the cambodian national police cnp based on a tip that deputy chief keo of the cnp trafficking and juvenile protection office received concerning unusual activities in frank room at the golden bridge hotel.four girls exited the hotel,and keo detained them for questioning keo suspected that the girls were between fourteen to seventeen years old from their appearance and stated astrological signs.based upon the information he learned from the girls,keo went to frank hotel room,searched it,and seized various items 
keo then took frank to the cambodian police station,suspecting him of violating cambodian laws.that night,frank was not placed in a jail cell but was permitted to sleep on a cot in keo office.the next morning,seng leena,an interpreter,was brought in,and frank was interviewed.frank admitted that he had engaged in sexual conduct with and had taken sexually explicit photographs of minors a,b,c,and d on multiple occasions.he confessed to paying the girls or to either photograph them or have sex with them.
at some point during the interview,gary phillips,the assistant united states immigration and customs enforcement attach in bangkok,thailand,arrived to meet with chief meng say of the cnp,but did not participate in frank interview.in a separate room,agent phillips reviewed the evidence cambodian officials had seized from frank hotel room.the day after frank interrogation by cambodian officials,agent phillips attempted to interrogate frank after providing him miranda warnings,but was interrupted when cambodian officials arrived to bring frank before a cambodian judge to face charges against him.without notifying agent phillips,cambodian officials released frank after resolution of these charges.frank then traveled to vietnam,where he was arrested by united states officials.
in,frank was charged with traveling in foreign commerce and engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor,in violation of c counts purchasing or otherwise obtaining custody or control of a minor with the intent to promote the engaging in of sexually explicit conduct by the minor for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct,in violation of b a counts and traveling in interstate and foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor,in violation of b count 
at trial,the government introduced evidence that during two trips in late,frank paid the minor girls listed in the indictment to engage in sexual acts with frank and to take sexually explicit pictures of him.from the first trip,photographs were retrieved,of which were not deleted.from the second trip,which culminated in frank arrest by cambodian officials,law enforcement found pictures,of which were not deleted.among other things,the pictures depicted frank engaging in sexual conduct with minor a,minor b holding an oraquick hiv test and posing in a sexually explicit manner on christmas day,and minors c and d dressed in various outfits on new year eve.on new year day,frank took the four girls to a swimming pool and then back to his hotel to have sex with them or to take sexually explicit pictures of them.
the government also presented expert witnesses to testify as to the age of the girls.one expert witness testified that minor b was fifteen to seventeen years old,that minors a and c were fourteen or fifteen years old,and that minor d was eleven or twelve years old.another expert witness testified that the girls were under sixteen years of age.frank defense at trial was that he reasonably believed the girls to be eighteen years or older at the time of the offense,that he did not purchase the girls,and that he traveled to cambodia for business and not to engage in illicit sexual conduct.the jury found frank guilty of counts,and.a mistrial was declared as to counts and,which concerned minor 
frank was sentenced to concurrent terms of months imprisonment on counts,and,with years supervised release.he was sentenced to months imprisonment on counts,and,running concurrently,and years supervised release.
ii.discussion 
a.the district court properly denied frank motion to suppress 
a district court denial of a motion to suppress is a mixed question of law and fact.united states ramos,cir per curiam citing united states nixon,cir.we review factual findings for clear error,but we review the district court application of the law to those facts de novo.id.
cambodian law enforcement officers detained and interrogated frank without reading him miranda warnings.the district court denied frank motion to suppress his statements obtained from the interrogation because it found that miranda warnings were not needed and that frank confession was voluntary.generally,statements obtained by foreign officers conducting interrogations in their own nations have been held admissible despite a failure to give miranda warnings to the accused.united states heller,cir citing kilday united states,cir the reasoning behind this rule is that the exclusion of evidence by an american court has little to no deterrent effect on foreign police practices.united states morrow,cir.that is,our constitution can not compel such specific,affirmative action by foreign sovereigns.kilday,at.two exceptions to this general rule are if the foreign officers conduct shocks the conscience of the american court and if american officials participated in the foreign interrogation,or if the foreign authorities were acting as agents for their american counterparts,also known as the joint venture doctrine.heller,at citing morrow,at united states behety,cir.
frank concedes that his arguments are foreclosed by our precedent first,frank statements do not fall under the joint venture doctrine.american officials did not know of frank presence in cambodia until after he was arrested and did not participate in frank detention or interrogation.when agent phillips attempted to interrogate frank,after giving him miranda warnings,he was cut short when cambodian officers came in to bring frank before a judge.at all times,the cambodian officers acted out of their own interest in determining whether frank violated cambodian laws.the officers then released frank and allowed him to travel to vietnam without notifying the united states.consequently,there is no evidence that the cambodian officers acted as agents of the united states 
second,frank interrogation does not shock the judicial conscience.frank was not held in a jail but allowed to sleep overnight in keo office.the interview lasted less than two hours.frank was treated with respect,offered food and water,and was not beaten or threatened in any way.based on these facts,we also find that frank confession was voluntary.see martin wainwright,cir,modified on other grounds,cir finding that defendant confession was voluntary when officers interrogated him for five hours,cursed him,discussed the death penalty,and provided him with false information.as such,the district court did not err in denying frank motion to suppress his statements resulting from interrogation by cambodian officials.
applies extraterritorially to reach frank conduct 
frank argues that does not apply extraterritorially,meaning that it does not reach conduct that occurs wholly outside the united states.pursuant to b a and c,w hoever purchases a minor with intent to promote the engaging in of sexually explicit conduct by such minor for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct,and in the course of the conduct described the minor or the actor traveled in or was transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce is guilty of an offense punishable by fine and not less than years imprisonment or for life.
congress has the power to apply its laws extraterritorially,but whether it has done so is a matter of statutory construction that is subject to plenary review foley filardo.united states macallister,cir per curiam united states baker,cir.
we presume that statutes only apply domestically,and give extraterritorial effect where congressional intent is clear.macallister,at.however,in united states bowman,the supreme court held that extraterritorial application can be inferred in certain cases even absent an express intention on the face of the statute.we have interpreted bowman to hold that extraterritorial application may be inferred from the nature of the offense and congress other legislative efforts to eliminate the type of crime involved.baker,at see also macallister,at.crimes fall under the bowman exception when limiting their locus to the strictly territorial jurisdiction would be greatly to curtail the scope and usefulness of the statute and leave open a large immunity for frauds as easily committed by citizens in foreign countries as at home.united states plummer,cir quoting bowman,at.at.thus,we have upheld extraterritorial application of statutes where the nature of the activities warranted a broad sweep of power.baker,at 
we must determine whether congress intended to apply to united states citizens engaged in conduct wholly outside of the united states.to date,no circuit court has decided this issue after considering the language of the statute,the nature of the offense covered by,and congress other efforts to combat child pornography,we find that applies extraterritorially to reach frank conduct.
congress intended to apply extraterritorially 
section requires that in the course of the prohibited conduct,the defendant or minor travel in interstate or foreign commerce,making plain congress intent that the statute sweep broadly and apply extraterritorially.c emphasis added see,united states hill,cir inclusion of a travel in interstate or foreign commerce provision makes plain the intent of congress to apply the law internationally and strongly suggests that congress intended to cast a broad net and apply the statute to all offenders,whether or not they are found in the united states united states noriega,upholding extraterritorial application due to the broad purpose and language of the travel act,which punishes travel in interstate or foreign commerce with intent to promote unlawful activity.travel in foreign commerce should logically be read to include traveling from the united states to a foreign country,and then purchasing a minor in that country for use in child pornography c.for example,c,which punishes anyone who travels in foreign commerce,and engages in any illicit sexual conduct,has been applied extraterritorially.united states clark,cir holding that the title of the statute,engaging in illicit sexual conduct in foreign places,and the requirement that the defendant travel in foreign commerce,evinced congressional intent to apply the statute extraterritorially martinez,d at same united states strevell,cir,at,june,holding that the language and history of c undercuts any argument that the statute does not apply extraterritorially.
furthermore,extraterritorial application is supported by the nature of and congress other efforts to combat child pornography.section is part of a comprehensive scheme created by congress to eradicate the sexual exploitation of children and eliminate child pornography,and therefore warrants a broad sweep.see united states thomas,cir citing.since,congress has passed numerous statutes to combat child pornography and the sexual exploitation of children as part of this effort,was included in the child protection and obscenity enforcement act of,title vii,subtitle n,stat.act the statute falls under chapter of title of the united states code,which punishes offenses dealing with the sexual exploitation and other abuse of children.
courts have applied other child pornography statutes found in this chapter extraterritorially on the authority of bowman,further evincing the broad sweep of these statutes.see,united states harvey,cir applying a b extraterritorially thomas,at applying a extraterritorially.in united states kapordelis,cir,we adopted the reasoning of thomas to apply a,which punishes similar conduct as,extraterritorially id.citing thomas,at.these courts examined the legislative history and purposes behind the child pornography statutes in question to determine that the nature of the activities covered by these statutes warrants a broad sweep of power moreover,as the court in harvey found,a primary motivation for expanding the pornography laws was that many of the sources of child pornography never came within the purview of federal investigators.at quoting,at see also statement of joseph biden,hearing on child pornography protection act of,available at wl june,stating that congress has kept a sharp eye on the problem of child pornography,and where it ha s found gaps in the coverage of the criminal law,it ha s moved quickly to fill them.
congress has also amended its laws to allow for extraterritorial application when it has discovered loopholes in its statutory scheme.see,baker,at finding support in the fact that the comprehensive drug abuse prevention and control act of contained a variety of provisions explicitly covering extraterritorial acts.for instance,congress amended in to eliminate the requirement that the government had to prove the intent to engage in sexual activity,and instead allowed prosecution where the defendant traveled in foreign commerce and actually engaged in illicit sexual activity with a minor.see protect act,stat.at,codified as amended at c.congress noted that this legislation would close significant loopholes in the law that persons who travel to foreign countries seeking sex with children are currently using to their advantage in order to avoid prosecution.additionally,congress enacted c to clarify that acts covered under a applied extraterritorially.see,at.implying that the enactment of c was partly in response to thomas.
the language of requiring travel in foreign commerce,the broad sweep warranted by child pornography offenses,and congress repeated efforts to prevent exploiters of children from evading criminal punishment demonstrate that congress intended to apply extraterritorially.
exercise of jurisdiction over frank comports with international law 
before we can give extraterritorial effect as congress intended,we must determine whether doing so would violate international law.macallister,at citation omitted describing five general principles that permit the exercise of criminal jurisdiction.jurisdiction exists under the nationality principle,which allows a country to exercise criminal jurisdiction over one of its nationals.plummer,at citing rivard united states,cir.because frank is a united states citizen,the united states properly exercised jurisdiction over him.see united states reeh,cir citing united states mitchell,cir a state may punish the wrongful conduct of its citizens no matter where it takes place.therefore,we find that applies extraterritorially to reach frank conduct outside of the united states.
c.there was sufficient evidence that frank engaged in illicit sexual conduct and purchased minors 
frank appeals the district court denial of his rule motion for judgment of acquittal,arguing that there was insufficient evidence that he engaged in illicit sexual conduct with the minor girls,in violation of c,and purchased the minor girls,in violation of b.we review the sufficiency of evidence supporting a criminal conviction de novo,with the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the government and all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in the government favor.united states calderon,cir citing united states harris,cir.a conviction must be upheld unless the jury could not have found the defendant guilty under any reasonable construction of the evidence.united states chastain,cir.
illicit sexual conduct under c 
frank challenges the sufficiency of the evidence convicting him of three counts of engaging in illicit sexual conduct in violation of c,which punishes one who travels in foreign commerce,and engages in any illicit sexual conduct with another person.in frank case,the illicit sexual conduct was a commercial sex act with a person under years of age.f frank contends that there was insufficient evidence that he engaged in a sex act with minors a,c,and d because his confession does not state which girl or girls had sex with him,rather than only posing for nude pictures.
frank confessed that he took these young girls to his hotel room to have sex with them,or to take nude pictures pornographic of them.at.frank confession goes on to state,a s for the four young girls police brought here with me,i have taken them to the hotel many times,and among the four,i know the girl named dieu.the other three i know their faces because these four girls came for the pictures and to have sex together.at.the other three girls were minors a,c,and d.the government also presented photographs that frank took of the minor girls in sexually explicit poses on the bed and,in some photographs,holding hiv testing kits.furthermore,viagra medication,condoms,lubricant,and sexually explicit images of other minors were found in frank hotel room at the time of his arrest.
frank statement that the minor girls came to his hotel for the pictures and to have sex together,taken into account with the other evidence presented,allowed the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that frank engaged in illicit sexual conduct with minors a,c,and 
purchase of minors under 
as a matter of first impression,we must determine whether paying a minor directly for sex constitutes a purchase of a minor,as that term is used in b.the jury was instructed that to purchase is to buy or to obtain or acquire in exchange for money or its equivalent,or by paying a price.at.frank argues that there was insufficient evidence that he purchas ed a minor,as required by b,because the term purchase requires that a defendant purchase a minor from a third party,rather than from the minor herself and the phrase purchase or otherwise obtain custody or control requires that purchase must be a form of control,which frank argues is only achieved through sexual slavery,such as forced prostitution or captivity for the purpose of producing child pornography.we disagree.
we interpret words that are not defined in a statute with their ordinary and plain meaning because we assume that congress uses words in a statute as they are commonly understood we give each provision full effect.united states veal,cir see also smith united states,d.review of legislative history is unnecessary unless a statute is inescapably ambiguous.veal,at quoting dep t of justice,cir per curiam.
section b a punishes w hoever purchases or otherwise obtains custody or control of a minor with intent to promote the engaging in of sexually explicit conduct by such minor for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct.purchase,as used in b,is not defined.therefore,we must construe the term in accordance with its ordinary meaning.the dictionary defines purchase as to get into one possession or to obtain something desired by an outlay.webster third new international dictionary philip babcock gove et.obtain is defined as to gain or attain possession or disposal or hold,keep,possess,occupy.id.at.possession is defined as the act or condition of having in or taking into one control or holding at one disposal.id.at.by contrast,the word hire is defined as to engage the personal services of for a fixed sum.id.at.a fashion designer,therefore,would not say that she purchased a clothing model for a photo shoot because that relationship lacks the requisite element of taking into one control.rather,the designer would say that she hired a clothing model because the relationship is contractual,not possessive.
the phrase purchase a woman,however,can be used synonymously with prostitution.see,teela sanders,maggie,jane pitcher,prostitution sex work,policy politics sage publications janice raymond,legitimating prostitution as sex work un labour organization ilo calls for recognition of the sex industry part one,available at last visited,stefan zweig,the world of yesterday university of nebraska press.this use of the word purchase is indicative of the complicated nature of prostitution,an act that some argue blurs the very line between possession and free will.see dorchen leidholt,coal.against trafficking in women,sex trafficking is contemporary slavery statement presented to the united nations general assembly,available at last viewed.for this reason,it has been suggested that selling onself for money is a form of temporary enslavement.see id.an understanding of the phrase purchases a minor to include paying a minor for sex,therefore,is acceptable under b,despite the word purchase not generally being associated with payment for services in other contexts.see smith,at.at holding that the most common definition of a word does not preclude other accepted alternatives.for this reason,we find frank narrow interpretation of purchase,which would only apply to situations where a third party sells a minor against her will to the defendant,to be at odds with its plain meaning and the context of.
purchase does not require the sale of a minor from a third party to the defendant.in the context of child prostitution,the minor herself is turned into an object or commodity,by selling her body to be used by the defendant for a certain purpose.a minor can not separate her services from herself because she lacks the capacity to do so.congress used the term purchase alone,rather than purchase from the minor herself,purchase a minor services,or purchase from another,to encompass situations where money is paid to a third party and where money is paid directly to the minor.see,smith,at.at holding that use of a firearm included the exchange of a gun for drugs and noting that simply because use as a weapon is the first example to come to mind when the phrase uses a firearm is uttered does not preclude us from recognizing that there are other uses that qualify as well united states murrell,cir inducing a person to engage in prostitution encompassed situations where a person communicated with a third party.if congress intended to use a narrower construction,it could have expressed that intent in the language.smith,at.at.however,it did not,and we will not impose an additional requirement that a middleman be involved.see id.
furthermore,the context of purchase in mandates a broad interpretation.viewed in isolation,purchase may seem to imply ownership obtained from a third party,but the context of purchase in does not allow such a restrictive construction.see id.at language,of course,can not be interpreted apart from context.the meaning of a word that appears ambiguous if viewed in isolation may become clear when the word is analyzed in light of the terms that surround it.section b punishes a person who purchases or otherwise obtains custody or control of a minor.custody or control,in turn,is defined broadly as includ ing temporary supervision over or responsibility for a minor whether legally or illegally obtained.emphasis added.control does not require the exchange of a minor from a third party to the defendant.for example,one can obtain control over a minor by ki
