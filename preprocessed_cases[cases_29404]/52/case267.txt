the united states appeals from a default judgment entered by the united states district court for the southern district of new york victor marrero,judge against defendant the zimbabwe african national front for violations of the alien tort claims act atca,the torture victim protection act of tvpa,stat.codified at note,and international human rights norms.plaintiffs from the district court dismissal,for lack of jurisdiction,of a host of similar claims brought against individual defendants robert mugabe and stan mudenge.the appeal and both turn on questions of immunity.the district court held that mugabe and mudenge were entitled to diplomatic and immunity,but that their immunity did not protect them from service of process as agents for,private entity.accordingly,in the district court view,was properly served with process and thus subject to a default judgment upon failure to appear in this litigation.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court dismissal of the claims against mugabe and mudenge but reverse its judgment against and remand for entry of a judgment dismissing plaintiffs claims against.
background 
is a private political party whose members have ruled zimbabwe since.at all relevant times,robert mugabe was the president of zimbabwe and the president and first secretary of,and stan mudenge was the zimbabwean foreign minister and a official.in september,mugabe and mudenge visited new york city as delegates to the united nations millennium summit.during their visit,they attended and mugabe spoke at a private political rally and at a church in event that was sponsored by a organization called friends of.just before he entered the church,mugabe was served with two copies of the complaint in this action,one in his personal capacity and the other on behalf of.the next day,mudenge was served with a copy of the same complaint on the street outside the zimbabwe mission building.
the complaint sought redress against mugabe,mudenge,and others for alleged violations of the atca,the tvpa,and international human rights norms.plaintiffs all of whom are zimbabwean nationals allege that they their family members were subjected to torture,assault,execution,and other acts of violence at the hands of members and upon the orders of officials,including mugabe and mudenge.mugabe and mudenge were sued in their individual,not official,capacities.none of the defendants appeared before the district court at any stage of the ensuing litigation.
several months after mugabe and mudenge were served with process,the united states filed a suggestion of immunity pursuant to in which it asserted that the claims against the two men should be dismissed on grounds of diplomatic and immunity.the government further argued that the claims against should be dismissed because under both the head of state and diplomatic immunity doctrines,mugabe and mudenge had personal inviolability and could not be served with legal process in any capacity,including on behalf of.at suggestion of immunity submitted by the united states of america,dated february.
in response to the government suggestion,plaintiffs argued that the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,to the government suggestion of immunity determinations concerning heads of state the fsia does not afford mugabe and mudenge immunity in this case because the two are alleged to have committed human rights violations in their capacities and mugabe and mudenge were not entitled to diplomatic immunity during the course of their trip to new york city and,thus,could be both sued individually and served with process as agents for.
on october,the district court issued an order and decision dismissing the claims against mugabe and mudenge on immunity grounds but entering a default judgment against.see tachiona mugabe,d tachiona i.the court concluded that the executive branch suggestion of immunity,not the fsia,governed immunity for heads of state,and that the suggestion mandated dismissal of the claims against mugabe and mudenge.see id.at.it also held,in the alternative,that diplomatic immunity precluded plaintiffs suit against mugabe and mudenge.see id.at.but the district court found that neither immunity nor diplomatic immunity shielded foreign officials from service of process as agents for a private entity and,therefore,that mugabe and mudenge could be served as agents for.see id.at.thus,in the district court view,had been properly served and,having failed to appear in the action,was subject to a default judgment.
the government moved for reconsideration and to intervene for purposes of appeal.on february,the district court denied the government motion for reconsideration,but granted its motion to intervene.see tachiona mugabe,d,tachiona ii.in a final judgment dated december,following a damages inquest,the court held liable for in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.
discussion 
in its appeal,the government argues that the district court erred in determining that neither immunity nor diplomatic immunity protected mugabe and mudenge from service of process as agents for.plaintiffs respond in the alternative,asserting that the government lacks standing to appeal the district court judgment against in the absence of own demand for review of the judgment and on the merits,the default judgment against should be upheld.they also the district court dismissal of the claims against mugabe and mudenge.our authority to review the merits depends on whether the government has standing to appeal we therefore address that issue first.
because article iii of the constitution permits the adjudication of cases or controversies only,litigants appearing before federal courts must demonstrate that they have standing to invoke the court jurisdiction.see,arizonans for official english arizona,d.to claim standing,a litigant must have suffered an invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent.id.quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks omitted.the article iii standing requirement must be met by persons seeking appellate review,just as it must be met by persons appearing in courts of first instance.id.citing diamond charles,d.to have standing at the appellate stage,however,a litigant must demonstrate injury caused by the judgment rather than injury caused by the underlying facts.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed see also diamond,at.t he decision to seek review must be placed in the hands of those who have a direct stake in the outcome,not in the hands of concerned bystanders.citations omitted.
the government sought the district court permission to intervene for purposes of appeal pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,and the district court granted that request.although the government motion was both proper and prudent,see marino ortiz,d per curiam a seeking to appeal a judgment of the district court should first seek leave to intervene for purposes of appeal in the district court,a district court grant of a motion to intervene for purposes of appeal does not,by itself,confer standing on the intervenor to appeal in the absence of the party on whose side intervention was permitted.diamond,at.here,of course,is not appealing.resolution of the standing question entails a separate inquiry into whether the government asserted injury and interest fulfill the requirements of article iii.id.
plaintiffs argue that the government has no standing to bring this appeal because it is not bound by the judgment of the district court and because,even if res judicata effect is not a prerequisite to standing,the government purported interests are too amorphous to confer standing although plaintiffs arguments are not without some force,we ultimately find them to be unpersuasive.
as plaintiffs note,it is well established that a party not bound by a judgment can not appeal a district court decision on the sole ground that the decision sets a precedent unfavorable to the appellant.see boston tow boat united states.more generally,a party not bound by a judgment will,in the usual case,have difficulty showing that it meets the article iii standing requirement.see,arizonans for official english,at.expressing grave doubts as to whether parties who were not bound by the judgment of the district court had article iii standing to appeal.but that is not because there is a per se bar against appeals by parties not bound by the judgment rather,it is because such parties normally will not have sustained a legal injury,actual or threatened,as a result of the judgment.see edward hines yellow pine trs.united states.cited in boston tow boat,at.by contrast,we think the asserted injury to the government interests in this case,caused by the district court judgment,is sufficiently concrete to give it standing to bring this appeal.
the government claims that the district court judgment invaded its legally protected interests in two ways it placed the united states in violation of certain international treaties and it usurped the executive branch exclusive authority to set the terms upon which the united states receives foreign ambassadors.as to the first,the government argues that the district court decision interferes with its obligation to ensure that the united states complies with the vienna convention on diplomatic relations,entered into force in,hereinafter vienna convention,and the convention on the privileges and immunities of the united nations,ratified by the,hereinafter convention on privileges and immunities.the existence of the asserted interest can hardly be disputed pursuant to article ii of the constitution,the president has the power,by and with the advice and consent of the senate,to make treaties.const.art.ii,cl.a corollary to the executive power to enter into treaties is its obligation to ensure that the united states complies with them.
here,the district court was called upon to interpret the convention on privileges and immunities and the vienna convention.the government claim that the district court interpretation contravenes the intent of the treaties signatories,placing the united states in breach of its international obligations,alleges a concrete invasion of the executive legal interest.see,roeder iran,cert.denied,d.in roeder,the district of columbia circuit considered whether the united states had standing to intervene as a defendant in a lawsuit against the iranian government.although the court questioned whether a must satisfy the article iii standing requirement,see id.at,it assumed the requirement applied,and concluded that because the government had established that it was in imminent danger of suffering injury in breach of its obligations under the algiers accords,it had standing,id.at.see also,sanitary dist.united states.the united states has a standing in this suit to carry out treaty obligations to a foreign power,and no statute is necessary to authorize the suit by the attorney general.united states county of arlington,cir united states had standing to initiate action to seek relief from conduct that would,inter alia,cause treaty violation.the only apparent distinction between the foregoing cases and this one is that here it is the district court decision,and not the action of any party,that threatens a breach of the united states treaty obligations.for purposes of standing,that is a distinction without a difference.
the government next argues that the district court decision upholding service of process on mugabe and mudenge as agents for usurped the executive branch constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs and to send and receive ambassadors.plaintiffs do not dispute that the power to conduct foreign affairs is vested principally in the executive branch.indeed,article ii,section of the constitution assigns to the president the authority to receive ambassadors and other public ministers,while as discussed above article ii,section gives the president the power to make treaties,albeit with the advice and consent of the senate.
taken together with the command of article ii,section that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed,these constitutional provisions have come to be regarded as explicit textual manifestations of the inherent presidential power to administer,if not necessarily to formulate,the foreign policy of the united states.
lawrence tribe,american constitutional law,at ed see,dep t of navy egan,d the court has recognized the generally accepted view that foreign policy was the province and responsibility of the executive.quoting haig agee,d.courts have long construed this executive authority to encompass a power to dictate the terms upon which foreign diplomats are received in this country.see,petrochemical of iran v.the stolt sheaf,cir noting that an incident to the executive constitutional powers is the president exclusive authority to recognize or refuse to recognize a foreign state or government and to establish or refuse to establish diplomatic relations with it see also united states,cir holding that state department certification that an individual was not entitled to diplomatic immunity was conclusive evidence of lack of entitlement because of the executive power to send and receive ambassadors citing in re baiz,and ex parte hitz.
plaintiffs contend nevertheless that the alleged injury to the government authority to receive foreign ambassadors is too abstract to permit the government to appeal the decision below.to support this proposition,they rely on the supreme court decision in raines byrd,d,in which individual members of congress were held to lack standing to challenge a veto statute because they alleged no injury to themselves as individuals and the institutional injury they alleg ed was wholly abstract and widely dispersed.id.at.but raines is distinguishable in crucial respects from the instant case.first,raines involved a constitutional challenge to an action taken by one of the other two branches of the federal fact that the court believed merited an especially rigorous standing inquiry because it implicated the overriding and concern about keeping the judiciary power within its proper constitutional sphere.id.at.here,by contrast,we are not being asked to review the actions taken by another branch,but rather to determine whether a component of our own branch of government,the district court,has overstepped its bounds.that kind of review is the standard grist of appellate courts.
second,the basis for the supreme court denial of standing in raines was that the individual members of congress had not alleged any personal injury to themselves,and their alleged institutional,that the veto,irrespective of whether it was used by the president,altered the meaning and effectiveness of the members votes,id.at.wholly abstract and widely dispersed.here,the executive branch institutional interest in protecting its authority to conduct foreign affairs and receive foreign ambassadors is not abstract because the direct effect of the district court ruling would be to permit service of process upon mugabe and result that,if the government is correct,would violate executive norms and treaty obligations.
the court in raines was careful to distinguish the situation in which,for example,a legislator vote is nullified,see coleman miller.state senators had standing to challenge ratification of a constitutional amendment which had been effected,despite senate deadlock,when the lieutenant governor cast the deciding vote,from a situation,like the one in raines,where the only injury claimed is an abstract dilution of institutional legislative power that resulted from the president discretion to exercise a veto.raines,at.the executive interest in this case is more akin to that in coleman the allegation is not that the district court decision may have resulted in dilution of the executive constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs,but that it interfered in a direct,articulable way with that authority.see also united states ex rel.chapman fed.power comm n.holding that the secretary of interior had standing to bring an action challenging the federal power commission authority to grant a license because the license conflicted with the secretary statutory duties.
we conclude that the asserted adverse effects of the district court decision on the government interests in ensuring that the united states does not violate its treaty obligations,and guarding its authority to set the terms upon which foreign ambassadors are received,are sufficient to confer standing on the government to appeal the district court ruling upholding the service of process on mugabe and mudenge as agents for.assuming arguendo that the government must also establish that it has standing to defend the district court ruling concerning mugabe and mudenge immunity from suit,roeder,at,the two interests it has asserted suffice for that purpose as well the,no less than the appeal,implicates the executive branch constitutional powers and responsibilities in the arena of international relations.the threshold standard having been met,we now turn to the merits of the appeal and.
ii.the merits 
the government argument on mugabe and mudenge were shielded from service of process as agents for the correctness of the district court ruling that the two individuals enjoyed diplomatic immunity if the two were not immune from suit,then they could not claim that their protected status also shielded them from service of process as agents for a entity.logic therefore compels us to first consider the merits of plaintiffs challenging the district court immunity finding before addressing the government appeal.
diplomatic immunity 
the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims against mugabe and mudenge because,inter alia,it concluded that the two were entitled to diplomatic immunity under the convention on privileges and immunities and the vienna convention.we affirm for substantially the same reasons articulated by the district court.
the immunities afforded temporary representatives like mugabe and mudenge who visit the united states for a conference are set forth in article iv,section of the convention on privileges and immunities 
representatives of members to the principal and subsidiary organs of the united nations and to conferences convened by the united nations,shall,while exercising their functions and during their journey to and from the place of meeting,enjoy the following privileges and immunities 
immunity from personal arrest or detention and from seizure of their personal baggage,and,in respect of words spoken or written and all acts done by them in their capacity as representatives,immunity from legal process of every kind 
inviolability for all papers and documents 
the right to use codes and to receive papers or correspondence by courier or in sealed bags 
exemption in respect of themselves and their spouses from immigration restrictions,alien registration or national service obligations in the state they are visiting or through which they are passing in the exercise of their functions 
the same facilities in respect of currency or exchange restrictions as are accorded to representatives of foreign governments on temporary official missions 
the same immunities and facilities in respect of their personal baggage as are accorded to diplomatic envoys,and also 
such other privileges,immunities and facilities not inconsistent with the foregoing as diplomatic envoys enjoy,except that they shall have no right to claim exemption from customs duties on goods imported otherwise than as part of their personal baggage or from excise duties or sales taxes.
convention on privileges and immunities,supra,art.iv.the only part of this section that expressly addresses the immunity from legal process afforded temporary representatives is section a.standing alone,section a would not protect mugabe and mudenge from suit based on any acts of violence they perpetrated in zimbabwe,because such acts are not acts done by them in their capacity as representatives.section g,however,extends to temporary representatives such other privileges,immunities and facilities not inconsistent with sections a to f as diplomatic envoys enjoy.
the vienna convention,which governs the privileges and immunities that are extended to diplomatic envoys,provides for a much more robust form of immunity from legal process than that afforded by section a of the convention on privileges and immunities.with limited exceptions,it broadly immunizes diplomatic representatives from the civil jurisdiction of the united states courts 
plaintiffs argue that reading section g of the convention on privileges and immunities to extend to mugabe and mudenge the full measure of immunity set forth in article of the vienna convention would be inconsistent with section a of the convention on privileges and immunities because section a expressly limits the scope of immunity from legal process that temporary representatives can enjoy.in plaintiffs view,
s ection g should not be read to override sections a to f,but should instead be read to be a reference to privileges,immunities,and facilities afforded to diplomats but not specifically referenced in sections a to f,such as the right to use the representative national flag on his means of transport vienna convention.
reply br.of,at.
we join the district court in declining to adopt plaintiffs overly narrow interpretation of section g.when interpreting a treaty,we begin with the text of the treaty and the context in which the written words are used.airlines,floyd,d quoting volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft schlunk,d internal quotation marks omitted.t reaties are construed more liberally than private agreements,and to ascertain their meaning we may look beyond the written words to the history of the treaty,the negotiations,and the practical construction adopted by the parties.id.at.quoting air france saks,d internal quotation marks omitted.further,in construing treaty language,r espect is ordinarily due the reasonable views of the executive branch.el al israel airlines,tsui yuan tseng,d see sumitomo shoji,avagliano,d although not conclusive,the meaning attributed to treaty provisions by the government agencies charged with their negotiation and enforcement is entitled to great weight.but where the text of the treaty is clear,courts have no power to insert an amendment.chan korean air lines,d.
applying these principles,we conclude,as a preliminary matter,that the text of section of the convention on privileges and immunities is ambiguous.it is not clear what would make a particular immunity or privilege inconsistent with any of the privileges and immunities specifically enumerated in section.would the proposed immunity or privilege have to render the exercise of an enumerated privilege or immunity impossible or would it be enough as plaintiffs assert for it to negate certain limitations or conditions that otherwise would attach to the exercise of an enumerated privilege or immunity the answer is not evident from the face of the treaty.therefore,we must resort to other interpretive tools.
plaintiffs argue that ordinary principles of statutory construction do not permit a reading of section g that would expand the circumstances under which immunity from legal process attaches.first,they point out that reading section g as a grant of immunity from suit would render section a result not favored by principles of statutory construction.see circuit city stores,adams,d.second,they cite the rule that,where a statutory text lists a number of items seriatim as in sections a to f,the specific qualifications in one provision can not be overridden by a general clause like section g.see id.at.general phrases are controlled and defined by reference to the enumerated categories varity howe,d.
these arguments are not without force.but while general principles of statutory construction may be brought to bear on difficult or ambiguous passages of a treaty,schlunk,at,the understandings of the treaty signatories and the views of the executive branch are at least as important in resolving ambiguity.see saks,at.see also hakala deutsche bank ag,cir general principles of statutory construction are notoriously unreliable.here,those understandings and views overwhelmingly support an interpretation of section g that would accord the full protection of article of the vienna convention to temporary representatives.
first,the united states government officials who ratified the convention on privileges and immunities plainly believed that it would afford full diplomatic immunity to temporary representatives.two excerpts from a report of the senate committee on foreign relations,which was charged with considering whether the united states should ratify the convention on privileges and immunities,are particularly relevant see generally comm.on foreign relations,convention on the privileges and immunities of the united nations,exec,at,hereinafter senate report.the first is a statement by state department legal advisor john stevenson during hearings before the committee on march.he said 
at the present time resident representatives are already granted full diplomatic privileges and immunities under the headquarters agreement nonresident representatives,on the other hand,are only covered by the international organizations immunities act and that grants them immunities relating to acts performed by them in their official capacity.
under the convention on privileges and immunities,the nonresident representatives would also receive full diplomatic privileges and immunities.
m any of the nonresident representatives are distinguished parliamentarians who come to new york for very short periods of time and we believe they should be treated with the same respect as the permanent representatives.
id.app.at stat.of john stevenson,legal advisor,dep t of state.the second excerpt is a statement of the senate committee itself 
with regard to representatives of members,currently only resident representatives of permanent missions to the have full diplomatic immunities.nonresident representatives enjoy only functional immunities that is,immunities with respect to their official acts.under the convention on privileges and immunities,these nonresident representatives will also be entitled to full diplomatic immunities.
as evidenced by these excerpts,the senate committee on foreign relations and the state department both believed that the convention on privileges and immunities would confer more than just functional immunity,the type of immunity described in section a,on temporary representatives they understood that such representatives would be afforded full diplomatic immunities.id.that section g was intended to supplement the protection provided by section a is further supported by a table submitted by state department legal advisor stevenson during the march,hearings,the purpose of which is to illustrate the effect of the convention on privileges and immunities in certain typical civil and criminal situations involving nonofficial activities.id.app.at table.the table indicates that,in contrast to prior law,nonresident temporary representative s would be immune from suit or prosecution under g.id.emphasis added.
this inclusive interpretation of section g was also adopted by former kurt waldheim in a opinion concerning immunity from legal process 
section of the convention specifies the more important immunities attaching to the representatives of members,including immunity from legal process of every kind,and,in subsection g thereof,explicitly extends to representatives,in addition,such other privileges,immunities and facilities not inconsistent with the foregoing as diplomatic envoys enjoy in other words,taken as a whole,section of the convention in fact confers diplomatic privileges and immunities on the representatives of members.
jurid,emphasis added.taken together,waldheim opinion,the senate report excerpts discussed above,and the broad interpretation of section g advanced by the government in this litigation which is accorded great weight,see sumitomo shoji,at,persuade us that section g extends to temporary representatives like mugabe and mudenge the full range of immunity from legal process afforded by article of the vienna convention.
one potential obstacle remains,however,to affording mugabe the full protection of article of the vienna convention section of the convention on privileges and immunities stipulates that the immunities described therein,including the diplomatic immunities set forth in section g,apply only while the representative is exercising his functions and during his journey to and from the place of meeting.convention on privileges and immunities,supra,art.iv,prefatory language.whereas mudenge was served with process outside of the zimbabwe mission building and,therefore,squarely within the parameters set forth in section,mugabe was served with process while attending a rally,a private activity unrelated to his duties as a representative.plaintiffs argue that because mugabe was not acting in his capacity as a representative when he was served with copies of the complaint,he can not claim immunity under section.
taking our cue from former waldheim,we decline to read the prefatory language of section so narrowly.waldheim,recognizing that representatives traveling to conferences typically engage in activities ancillary to their actual representative functions,interpreted the words while exercising their functions to mean during the entire period of presence in the state for reasons of the conference in question.jurid,quoting int l comm.at.waldheim explained that to interpret the prefatory words so as to limit them to times when the person concerned is actually doing something as part of his functions as a representative leads to absurd and meaningless results making such an interpretation wholly untenable.id.
we can imagine hypothetical situations in which section prefatory language might foreclose a temporary representative entitlement to the immunities set forth in section for example,if a representative were served with process months after the completion of a conference while traveling in the united states for purely personal reasons.but this is not such a case mugabe was served while the millennium summit was still in progress.under the circumstances,he was entitled,through section g,to the full protection of article of the vienna convention.
having determined that mugabe and mudenge are subject to the terms of article,we now consider whether any of the exceptions found in that article apply.article provides 
a diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving state.he shall also enjoy immunity from its civil and administrative jurisdiction,except in the case of 
a a real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the receiving state,unless he holds it on behalf of the sending state for the purposes of the mission 
b an action relating to succession in which the diplomatic agent is involved as executor,administrator,heir or legatee as a private person and not on behalf of the sending state 
c an action relating to any professional or commercial activity exercised by the diplomatic agent in the receiving state outside his official functions.
vienna convention,supra.while plaintiffs concede the inapplicability of these exceptions to mudenge,they assert that subsection c deprives mugabe of immunity from legal process because the rally that he attended had nothing at all to do with his official functions as a representative of zimbabwe to the br.of,at.the key words in subsection c,however,are activity in the receiving state.plaintiffs lawsuit falls outside the scope of subsection c because plaintiffs claims do not relat e to mugabe activities at the rally they relate to his activities in zimbabwe.
plaintiffs nevertheless attempt to identify a nexus between their lawsuit and the rally by arguing that 
the rally seemed specifically designed to combat the extensive international outrage directed toward mugabe personally and against as an triggered specifically by the murderous tactics that inflicted on its political opponents,such as the plaintiffs in this case.
br.of,at.we decline to adopt this exceedingly broad conception of relating to.although the term relating to or related to,when used in statutes,is typically defined more broadly than the term arising out of,it still connotes a connection with,reference to,or associat ion with its object.see coregis ins.am.health,cir qu
