blendi haxhiaj seeks review of the district court denial of habeas relief from a certification of extradition declaring that haxhiaj is eligible to be extradited to italy to serve a sentence imposed in by an italian court as a result of a drug trafficking conviction.haxhiaj contends that there was insufficient evidence presented to the extradition court to establish probable cause that he committed the underlying drug offense,and hence the certification should not have issued.see west supp.as explained below,we conclude that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the extradition court finding of probable cause.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of haxhiaj habeas petition.
haxhiaj is an albanian national who was charged in italy with various crimes arising from his participation in a large organization that transported heroin and other illegal drugs from albania into italy between and august.in,italian law enforcement agents arrested numerous participants in this conspiracy,including haxhiaj sister,doriana.haxhiaj avoided arrest,however,by fleeing to the united states in november and subsequently applying for asylum here.
in june,haxhiaj was convicted in absentia by the court of milan on three counts in a indictment relating to the conspiracy he was acquitted on seven counts.in july,haxhiaj convictions were affirmed by the court of appeal of milan and became final on october,whereupon haxhiaj was sentenced to a prison term of twelve and years.the court of appeal of milan then issued a warrant for haxhiaj arrest as a fugitive.
meanwhile,haxhiaj was living and working in madison,wisconsin.in february,apparently unaware that haxhiaj was a fugitive from italy when he arrived here or that he had been convicted by an italian court for international drug trafficking since his arrival,the united states granted haxhiaj asylum from albania.the department of homeland security dhs learned of haxhiaj fugitive status the following year and,on october,took haxhiaj into custody as he was the united states after an overseas trip.on november,pursuant to the bilateral extradition treaty between the united states and italy the treaty or extradition treaty,the united states attorney for the eastern district of virginia filed a formal extradition request for haxhiaj on behalf of italy.see extradition treaty between the government of the united states of america and the government of the republic of italy,art.i see establishing extradition proceedings in the united states.
the treaty imposes mutual obligations upon the united states and italy to extradite to each other persons whom the authorities of the requesting party have charged with or found guilty of an extraditable offense.extradition treaty,art.i.an extraditable offense under the treaty is an offense that is punishable under the laws of both contracting parties by deprivation of liberty for a period of more than one year,art.ii,including a ny type of association to commit such offenses and conspiracy to commit such an offense,art.ii.
the government seeks extradition based on haxhiaj three counts of conviction,describing them as follows having unlawfully kept for distribution purposes kilograms of heroin on june,f rom approximately through august,in milan,bergamo,naples,brindisi and ravenna,italy,and in albania,having associated with others for the purpose of trafficking in illegal drugs,namely heroin,cocaine and marijuana and f rom about july,to august,in naples,italy,having purchased,received and kept with the intent to distribute approximately kilograms of marijuana.in support of its extradition request,the government offered a certified copy of the judgment issued by the court of appeal of milan affirming haxhiaj conviction.
the magistrate judge conducted an extradition hearing pursuant to to determine whether the crime s are extraditable and there is probable cause to sustain the charge s.ordinola hackman,cir.traxler,concurring internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.as for whether haxhiaj was charged with extraditable crimes,the magistrate judge noted that it was essentially uncontested that t he drug trafficking crimes for which haxhiaj surrender is sought are covered by the terms of the treaty,and haxhiaj does not challenge this conclusion now.however,the magistrate judge determined that the government failed to submit sufficient evidence of probable cause and refused to certify haxhiaj for extradition.the magistrate judge reasoned that,unlike evidence of a conviction where the fugitive was present at trial,mere evidence of an in absentia conviction,by itself,will not sustain a finding of probable cause as required by.instead,the magistrate judge was looking for evidence of the kind adduced at the trial in absentia in order to make an independent assessment of probable cause.
finding no such evidence,the magistrate judge denied the request for a certificate of extradition however,instead of dismissing the extradition complaint,the magistrate judge permitted the government to supplement the record.the government then submitted a statement from procuratore generale bruno fenzia,an italian magistrate who performs a prosecutorial function in the italian system of criminal justice.fenzia statement summarized the evidence supporting haxhiaj conviction,including the testimony of one of the investigators as well as the results of wiretaps and physical surveillance.in support of his summary,fenzia cited relevant portions of the written opinion of the court of appeal of milan affirming haxhiaj conviction.the government,however,did not submit trial transcripts of the investigator testimony or any evidence underlying such testimony,like transcripts of the wiretapped phone conversations or documents created during the investigation of haxhiaj and his.additionally,fenzia statement did not explain the basis for his summary of the evidence,and thus it is unclear whether fenzia related this information based on personal knowledge or whether he gleaned it solely from the court of appeal opinion or some other source.
on august,the magistrate judge concluded that,in view of the additional information submitted by the government,there was probable cause to believe that haxhiaj committed the crimes identified in italy extradition request.accordingly,the magistrate judge issued a certificate of extraditability.see see also ordinola,at if the extradition judge concludes that there is,in fact,probable cause,he is required to certify the individual as extraditable to the secretary of state.internal quotation marks omitted traxler,concurring.
because the extradition statute does not allow the fugitive to seek direct review of an extradition certification,haxhiaj next petitioned for habeas review pursuant to.see ordinola,at explaining that the fugitive has but one means of judicial a habeas petition kastnerova united states,cir there is no direct appeal in extradition proceedings.see also cherif bassiouni,international extradition united states law and practice ed.an extradition order is not a final order within the meaning of title and therefore there is no direct appeal from the decision of the judicial officer conducting the extradition proceedings.the district court,noting the narrow scope of habeas review in the extradition context,recognized that it was not permitted to disturb the decision of the magistrate judge to issue an extradition certification as long as there was any evidence in the record supporting the finding of probable cause.the district court,after reviewing the record,found that there was indeed evidence supporting the probable cause determination 
although the magistrate judge correctly found that a conviction in absentia is not sufficient by itself to meet the probable cause requirement of the treaty and the statute,the evidence contained in the record through the detailed opinion of the court of appeal of milan is much more than the mere fact of conviction.the opinion methodically described each offense charged against each defendant and detailed the wire tap and surveillance evidence that supported the conviction of the various members of the conspiracy.
the district court,therefore,rejected the notion that actual evidence in the form of witness testimony,affidavits,or transcripts of wiretaps was required for a probable cause determination.observing that there was no difference between the evidence originally submitted and the evidence before the magistrate judge after the government supplemented the record,the district court opined that the magistrate judge erred in not finding probable cause on the basis of the appellate opinion presented in the original extradition request.because the magistrate judge ultimately found that there was probable cause,however,the district court denied the habeas petition and refused to disturb the certification of extraditability.
subsequently,the district court issued an order clarifying the record.the court explained that the detailed summary of the trial evidence by the court of appeal of milan had not been among the materials presented to the magistrate judge in the original request and was submitted only with the government supplemental materials.based on this clarification,the district court concluded that the magistrate judge was correct in his initial finding that the record at the time of the first extradition hearing was insufficient to establish probable cause.the clarification,however,did not alter the district court ultimate conclusion that the full record as supplemented was sufficient to support the magistrate judge finding of probable cause.
habeas review of an extradition certification is quite narrow,limited to consideration of whether the extradition court properly exercised jurisdiction,whether the crime upon which extradition is sought qualifies under the relevant treaty as an extraditable offense,and whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support the extradition court probable cause determination.see fernandez phillips.see also sidali ins,cir united states wiebe,cir.neither the magistrate judge jurisdiction nor the extraditability of the underlying offense are matters of dispute in this appeal we focus solely on the magistrate judge probable cause determination.
during the extradition hearing,the magistrate judge applies the same probable cause standard that applies in federal preliminary hearings,meaning that the magistrate judge role is merely to determine whether there is competent evidence to justify holding the accused to await trial.ordinola,at traxler,concurring internal quotation marks omitted.the extradition hearing is not to serve as a trial and serves simply to permit a limited inquiry into the presence of probable cause to believe that there has been a violation of one or more of the criminal laws of the extraditing country.peroff hylton,cir.section therefore requires the extradition court to conduct essentially the same preliminary inquiry typically required for issuance of a search warrant or an arrest warrant for crimes committed in this familiar task for any magistrate judge.see eain wilkes,cir explaining that an extradition request must be supported by sufficient evidence to show that there is sufficient justification for the individual arrest had the charged crime been committed in the united states.
in reviewing the extradition court finding of probable cause under,a federal habeas court applies a standard of review that is at least as deferential,if not more so,than that applied to a magistrate judge decision to issue a search warrant.ordinola,at traxler,concurring.just as the magistrate judge underlying determination is not a on the guilt or innocence of the fugitive,habeas review should not duplicate the extradition hearing.id.at.accordingly,our limited function in performing habeas review of the decision to issue a certificate of extradition is to determine whether there is any evidence in the record supporting the probable cause finding of the magistrate judge.prushinowski samples,cir emphasis omitted quoting fernandez,at.see kastnerova,at.
the evidence submitted in support of the extradition request consists of the written opinion of the court of appeal of milan affirming haxhiaj conviction and the statement of italian magistrate fenzia summarizing the evidence.as previously explained,the district court concluded that these documents satisfied the any evidence standard and that the appellate opinion,even standing alone,provided a sufficient basis for the probable cause finding because it methodically described each offense charged against each defendant and detailed the wire tap and surveillance evidence that supported the conviction of the various members of the conspiracy.
haxhiaj insists,however,that the government evidence was insufficient to satisfy even the generous any evidence standard that applies in habeas review.haxhiaj argues that mere evidence of an in absentia conviction,without more,is insufficient to support a probable cause determination by the extradition court.rather,he maintains that the government was required to submit actual evidence that would permit the extradition court to make its own independent assessment of probable cause,such as trial testimony,documents created by investigators,transcripts of wiretapped conversations or affidavits from law enforcement officials with personal knowledge of the evidence against haxhiaj.
haxhiaj appears to derive his actual evidence requirement for probable cause from two sources.first,he contends that the language of the extradition treaty requires the requesting nation to submit such evidence in order to establish the probable cause required for extradition.second,haxhiaj looks to the extradition statute,see,as well as various judicial interpretations of what proof is required to satisfy the probable cause standard for an extradition request based on an in absentia conviction,see,gallina fraser,cir.we conclude,as explained below,that neither basis requires actual evidence as haxhiaj defines that support a finding of probable cause.
we first look to the language of the extradition treaty to determine whether it mandates that an extradition request based on an in absentia conviction be supported by actual evidence establishing a reasonable basis to believe that haxhiaj committed the crime for which he is sought.although the probable cause requirement for the issuance of a certification of extradition is a matter of statute,see ordinola,at noting that courts have uniformly interpreted the statutory language to require a finding of probable cause traxler,concurring,the applicable extradition treaty often bears upon the scope of probable cause by establishing what constitutes an adequate evidentiary showing.see bassiouni,supra at noting that t he finding of probable cause is specifically required by legislation in and is also embodied in united states treaties.
as reflected by article x of the extradition treaty,the united states and italy agreed upon specific documentary support that must accompany an extradition request between the two countries.paragraph of article x requires that all extradition requests be accompanied by documents,statements or other information identifying the individual sought,including,if available,physical description,photographs and fingerprints a brief statement of the facts of the case,including the time and location of the offense and the texts of the laws setting forth the elements of the offense for which extradition is sought,the punishment for such offense,and the applicable limitations period,if any.see extradition treaty,art.x.
there are additional requirements,depending on whether or not the person sought to be extradited has already been convicted of the subject offense in the courts of the requesting nation.for those who have been convicted already,paragraph of article x requires the extradition request to be accompanied by a copy of the judgment of conviction a copy of the sentence and a statement as to the duration of the penalty still to be served and documents demonstrating that the person sought is the person convicted,art x.when extradition is sought for a person who has been charged but not convicted of an offense,however,more detailed information is required under paragraph,including a certified cop
