stroitelstvo bulgaria stroitelstvo,a bulgarian construction company,entered into a loan contract with the credit bank bank.the bank later claimed that stroitelstvo breached the contract and demanded the full amount due on the loan.stroitelstvo denied any breach but eventually settled by paying a large chunk of the bank claim.the execution of the contract,alleged breach,and settlement payment all took place in bulgaria.
then,stroitelstvo came to federal court and sued the bank and its parent,the enterprise fund baef,for the bank alleged predatory lending practices.now the question arises,why should a district court decide this dispute over a bulgarian loan contract the district court could find a good answer and so dismissed stroitelstvo case on the ground of forum non conveniens.because we agree with the district court that bulgaria is a better forum than the united states to resolve this dispute,we affirm.
background 
the facts,as alleged in stroitelstvo complaint,describe a classic predatory lending scheme.in march,stroitelstvo entered into a loan contract with the bank to finance a residential construction project in sofia,bulgaria.the contract required the bank to disburse a total of about million euros to stroitelstvo through various stages of the project.several months into the loan,when the bank had disbursed only of the total million euros,the bank asserted that stroitelstvo breached the loan contract by,among other things,failing to turn over certain advance payments on residential units.the bank suspended stroitelstvo credit and claimed a right to recover euros,equal to the euros already disbursed plus the total interest and fees due under the loan.
according to stroitelstvo,the bank claimed breach was pretextual and designed to pressure stroitelstvo into paying the bank more than it deserved under the loan contract.the bank went to the sofia city court ex parte and obtained a judgment in the amount of the euros purportedly owed,a judgment that the bank used to freeze stroitelstvo assets.with its assets frozen,stroitelstvo could afford to wait two or three years while it pursued a separate action in bulgarian court to overturn the bank judgment.so instead,stroitelstvo agreed to pay the bank euros,less than the euros claimed by the bank but more than what stroitelstvo thought that it owed under the contract.
in april,stroitelstvo sued the bank and baef,the bank parent,in the district court for the district of columbia.stroitelstvo claimed that baef and the bank had conducted a scheme to extort and blackmail several bulgarian businesses,including stroitelstvo,and that this scheme was a racketeering activity giving rise to a civil remedy under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act.stroitelstvo complaint also contained several contract and tort claims,most based in american law,but one alleging a violation of the bulgarian obligations and contracts act.
the defendants successfully moved the district court to transfer the case to the northern district of illinois,as baef is headquartered in chicago.the district court then took up the defendants motion to dismiss based on,among other things,the doctrine of forum non conveniens,in which the defendants argued that bulgaria was a more convenient forum than the united states to resolve the parties dispute.the parties offered the testimony of experts in bulgarian law,who addressed the adequacy of the bulgarian courts to adjudicate stroitelstvo claims.stroitelstvo experts,maria slavova and vladimir skochev,generally doubted that bulgarian law would provide adequate substitutes for all of the claims raised in stroitelstvo complaint.they also described a public perception of corruption in the bulgarian legal system.the defendants expert,silvy chernev,thought that bulgarian law would provide a remedy for all of the conduct alleged in stroitelstvo complaint,even though not all of stroitelstvo claims had exact bulgarian equivalents.chernev also acknowledged problems of judicial corruption but nonetheless insisted that the bulgarian courts were generally adequate.
after carefully considering the expert testimony and stroitelstvo arguments against dismissal,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds.the court thought that resolving stroitelstvo case in bulgaria,rather than in the united states,would better serve the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice.stroitelstvo appeals,which it may,since a forum non conveniens dismissal is a final,appealable judgment even though it does not end the litigation.abad bayer,cir.
ii.analysis 
the common law doctrine of forum non conveniens allows a federal district court to dismiss a suit over which it would normally have jurisdiction in order to best serve the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice.clerides boeing,cir citing in re,cir.we review the district court dismissal of a case on forum non conveniens grounds for an abuse of discretion.abad,at.
a.the adequacy of bulgaria as an alternative forum 
a threshold requirement for any forum non conveniens dismissal is the existence of an alternative forum that is both available and adequate.kamel,cir.an alternative forum is available if all of the parties are amenable to process and within the forum jurisdiction.id.at.stroitelstvo does not dispute that bulgaria is an available forum.the bank,which operates in bulgaria,and baef,which maintains an office in sofia,are both amenable to process and within the bulgarian courts jurisdiction.moreover,baef has consented to the bulgarian courts jurisdiction as a condition of forum non conveniens dismissal.
the adequacy of a bulgarian forum,on the other hand,is the central dispute in this appeal.an alternative forum is adequate if it provides the plaintiff with a fair hearing to obtain some remedy for the alleged wrong.id.it is not necessary that the forum legal remedies be as comprehensive or as favorable as the claims a plaintiff might bring in an american court.see id.instead,the test is whether the forum provides some potential avenue for redress for the subject matter of the dispute.see id.
at least some substantial expert testimony in this case indicated that stroitelstvo could expect a fair hearing in the bulgarian courts.as the experts recognized,bulgaria gained admission to the european union in,and one requirement for eu membership is that the nation have a stable legal system that guarantees the rule of law.the defendants expert,chernev,also stated that bulgaria has an independent judiciary that provides full and fair consideration of commercial disputes.
it is true that all of the experts lamented a public perception of corruption in the bulgarian courts,and skochev,stroitelstvo expert,even claimed that the bulgarian legal system was incapable of providing a fair hearing.still,the experts made no attempt to quantify this purported corruption or document particular plaintiffs or claims that were treated unfairly.their generalized,anecdotal complaints of corruption are not enough for a federal court to declare that an eu nation legal system is so corrupt that it ca serve as an adequate forum.see tuazon reynolds tobacco,cir finding the plaintiff anecdotal evidence of corruption and delay in the philippine courts insufficient to show inadequacy in re arbitration between monegasque de reassurances nak naftogaz of,cir refusing to pass value judgments on the adequacy of justice and the integrity of ukraine judicial system on the basis of no more than bare denunciations and sweeping generalizations leon millon air,cir requiring the plaintiff to substantiate allegations of serious corruption or delay with significant evidence documenting the partiality or delay typically associated with the adjudication of similar claims.
the expert testimony also showed that bulgarian law provides some remedy for the subject matter of this dispute,the bank alleged breach of the loan contract and predatory lending practices.chernev cited several provisions of the bulgarian obligations and contracts act that enforce contractual obligations and provide for damages against a commercial party who f
