appellant gordon carey carey filed suit against united airlines the airline for damages arising out of an incident between him and a flight attendant while flying from costa rica to los angeles.carey brought claims of intentional infliction of emotional and mental distress,negligent infliction of emotional and mental distress,and false imprisonment.carey appeals the magistrate judge order granting the airline motion for summary judgment.we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
carey and his three daughters were flying from costa rica to los angeles,en route to their home in portland during the flight,two of carey children began to suffer earaches.one of them left her seat in coach class and came to carey,who was sitting in first class,seeking medicine for her pain.a flight attendant warned carey that his children were not permitted to come into the first class cabin.carey responded by stating that his children were ill,but the flight attendant made some reference to federal airline administration faa regulations.
another daughter then walked from coach to first class seeking carey assistance.the same flight attendant reprimanded carey again and told him that an faa representative was on board who could arrest him.upon hearing this,carey believed that he had to send his daughter back to coach class even though she was in pain and in tears.
carey later confronted the alleged faa representative,who refused to show carey his identification a heated exchange between carey and the faa representative followed this exchange included insults and profanity.in response to carey request that she give him the name of this faa representative,the flight attendant refused and then proceeded to humiliate carey in front of the other passengers.
in addition to alleging his emotional and mental distress,carey alleged that he suffered physical manifestations including nausea,cramps,perspiration,nervousness,tension,and sleeplessness.carey sought to recover damages under state law for his emotional and mental distress.however,the magistrate judge concluded that the warsaw convention governed carey claims,that carey allegations of intentional misconduct did not exempt his claims from the warsaw convention application,and that the warsaw convention was carey exclusive remedy.because the magistrate judge concluded that carey alleged injury did not satisfy the conditions for carrier liability under the warsaw convention,the court granted the airline motion for summary judgment.
on appeal,carey argues that the warsaw convention is not his exclusive remedy.according to carey,because his claims against the airline arose out of intentional misconduct,they fall outside the scope of the warsaw convention.he further argues that,even if the warsaw convention is his exclusive remedy,his injury satisfied the conditions for carrier liability under the warsaw convention.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.
iii.analysis 
the warsaw convention is a comprehensive international treaty,signed in,governing liability in all international transportation of persons,baggage,or goods.in signing the warsaw convention,t he contracting states in believed that limitations on liability would promote the development of the fledgling commercial air industry by allowing the airlines to predict their exposure to monetary damages and thereby obtain needed capital and adequate insurance coverage.
only a few articles of the warsaw convention are pertinent in this case.article of the warsaw convention provides that a carrier shall be liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by the passenger,if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.articles and,respectively,cap a carrier liability at per passenger and preclude all liability if the carrier has taken all necessary or possible measures to avoid the damage however,article provides that a carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this convention which exclude or limit his liability,if the damage is caused by his willful misconduct.
exclusivity of the warsaw convention 
the magistrate judge held that carey claims were governed solely by the warsaw convention and that he could not maintain any independent state law claims against the airline.we agree.
in el al israel airlines,tseng the plaintiff filed suit to recover damages for emotional and mental distress that she suffered as a result of a detention and body search conducted by the airline before she boarded.the court of appeals held that plaintiff could not recover under the warsaw convention because there was no accident under article,but concluded that the warsaw convention was not tseng exclusive remedy the supreme court reversed,holding that the warsaw convention precluded a passenger from maintaining an action for damages under local law when the claim arises out of an international flight and it can not satisfy the warsaw convention conditions for carrier liability 
although tseng appears to dispose of his state law claims,carey argues that,because the warsaw convention does not apply to claims arising out of intentional misconduct,tseng should not be read to hold that the warsaw convention is the exclusive remedy for such claims against an air carrier.to come to a different conclusion,he argues,would deprive plaintiffs who are victims of the most egregious conduct on international flights of recovery for their injuries.that,according to carey,could not have been the intent of the drafters of the warsaw convention.we reject his argument because it rests on a faulty view of the warsaw convention liability scheme.
carey argument assumes that the term accident in article is defined by its everyday caused by carelessness,but not caused on purpose.however,an accident,as that term is defined for purposes of the warsaw convention,can include intentional misconduct.in air france saks the supreme court defined the term accident as including any unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger.nothing in this definition suggests that an accident encompasses only negligent or reckless conduct,as opposed to intentional misconduct in fact,there is no mention of the carrier motive or mental state whatsoever.moreover,the saks court cautioned that its definition should be flexibly applied.
we are further convinced that intentional misconduct can be an accident under article by a subsequent warning issued by the supreme court in tseng.tseng argued to the court,just as carey does to us,that air carriers will escape liability for their intentional torts if passengers are not permitted to pursue personal injury claims outside the terms of the warsaw convention tseng argument to the court was premised on the same argument that she had advanced before the second willful misconduct can not be an accident.in direct response to tseng concern,the supreme court cautioned that the definition of accident is an unusual event external to the passenger and that it should be flexibly applied.however,tseng chose not to challenge the second circuit conclusion that no accident had occurred and the court also determined that tseng had waived any challenge to the district court finding on the absence of willful misconduct in her case for these reasons,the court response is dictum.nonetheless,the court response indicates that a carrier intentional misconduct can fall under the definition of accident,provided that the conduct otherwise meets the standard laid out in saks.
a deeper look into the rationale behind tseng supports the conclusion that the warsaw convention applies to claims arising out of intentional misconduct.if carey view of the warsaw convention were correct,then international air carriers would face two sources of warsaw convention and local on the nature of their actions.but that is precisely the scenario that the tseng court rejected.the cardinal purpose of the warsaw convention is to achieve uniformity of rules governing claims arising from international air transportation.given that purpose,the court stated that it would be hard put to conclude that the delegates at warsaw meant to subject air carriers to the distinct,nonuniform liability rules of the individual signatory nations.
moreover,contrary to what carey argues,nothing in article suggests that the warsaw convention does not apply to claims arising out of intentional misconduct.article states that t he carrier shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of this convention which exclude or limit his liability,if the damage is caused by his willful misconduct.it does not state that the entire warsaw convention is inapplicable to damage caused by willful misconduct.
subsequent conduct by the contracting parties to the warsaw convention provides further confirmation that a finding of willful misconduct under article was not intended to remove the plaintiff from the ambit of the convention.the hague protocol of and the montreal protocol of,which were significant amendments to the warsaw convention accomplished two things increased the limit of liability under article doubling the original amount and narrowed the conditions that establish willful misconduct.several courts have concluded that these protocols merely clarified article to make it explicit that the limits on liability lifted in the event of willful misconduct are only the monetary limits contained in article.there is no indication that these protocols were meant to remove a plaintiff claim from the ambit of the warsaw convention altogether if willful misconduct is shown.
likewise,three of our sister circuits have held that a finding of willful misconduct under article does not authorize an award of punitive damages under the warsaw convention.in doing so,each emphasized that,notwithstanding article removal of the limitations and exclusions on a carrier liability,the rest of the convention still governs the action,including articles and,which they determined barred awards finally,courts have consistently understood that claims against international air carriers that allege willful misconduct can be brought under the warsaw convention,noting that the carrier willful misconduct lifts article cap on damages 
despite this weight of authority against him,carey points to the following statement by the tseng court we accept that el al actions did not constitute willful misconduct and thus we confront no issue under article of the convention.according to carey,this statement indicates that tseng did not address intentional misconduct and,as a result,should have no impact on his state law claims.that argument is unpersuasive.
the tseng court framed the issue before it as whether the warsaw convention provides the exclusive cause of action for injuries sustained during international air transportation.at the outset,the court stated that w e therefore hold that recovery for a personal injury suffered on board an aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking,if not allowed under the convention,is not available at all.that holding is is no exception for an injury suffered as a result of intentional misconduct.
moreover,the court also stated,immediately before this statement regarding willful misconduct,that w e accept it as given that el al search of tseng was not an accident within the meaning of article.the combined effect of these statements emphasizes the fact that the parties did not dispute that the warsaw convention conditions for liability were not met.in other words,had tseng asserted on appeal that there was willful misconduct,the court dictum indicates that it may have concluded that such conduct was an accident under article and that therefore the warsaw convention conditions for liability were met.this would have eroded the factual premise for its holding.
based on the supreme court interpretation of the term accident in article and the history of article,including cases interpreting its provisions,we see no basis for concluding that the warsaw convention does not apply to claims arising out of intentional misconduct.because the warsaw convention does apply to such claims,carey has a remedy.under tseng,it is his only one.thus,the district court was correct to conclude that carey was required to satisfy the warsaw convention conditions in order to recover for his alleged injuries.
liability under the warsaw convention 
carey argues that the district court erred in finding that he did not satisfy the bodily injury requirement in article of the warsaw convention.although he has not alleged that he suffered a bodily injury during the incident with the airline flight attendant,carey claims that the physical manifestations of his emotional and mental distress satisfy the bodily injury requirement,thus qualifying him for recovery.we conclude that physical manifestations of emotional and mental distress do not satisfy the bodily injury requirement in article.
in eastern airlines,floyd the supreme court held that article of the warsaw convention did not allow recovery for mental injury that is unaccompanied by physical injury in floyd,all three engines of an airplane had failed shortly after takeoff,at which point the crew notified the passengers that they would ditch the plane in the ocean.fortunately,the crew managed to restart an engine and land safely.
however,unlike the plaintiffs in floyd,carey claims that he also suffered physical manifestations of his emotional and mental distress,including nausea,cramps,perspiration,nervousness,tension,and sleeplessness.carey is correct that floyd left open the question of whether such physical manifestations satisfy the bodily injury requirement in article.however,we are persuaded,in accordance with the third circuit decision in terrafranca virgin atlantic airways that they do not.
in terrafranca,the plaintiff sought recovery for her extreme emotional distress,in the form of posttraumatic stress disorder,over a bomb scare incident.she alleged that her condition was complicated by anorexia,that she had lost seventeen pounds,and that these physical manifestations of her emotional injury were sufficient to be considered a bodily injury under floyd the third circuit concluded,based on the floyd court careful examination of the french term lesion corporelle,which translates into bodily injury,the intent of the signatory nations,and the warsaw convention legislative history,that there was no support for the argument that the plaintiff physical manifestations of her emotional injury satisfied the bodily injury requirement because the plaintiff could not demonstrate direct,concrete,bodily injury as opposed to mere manifestation of fear or anxiety,the court held that she did not satisfy the conditions for liability under article and thus could not recover for her emotional distress 
for reasons similar to those articulated by the third circuit in terrafranca,we hold that physical manifestations of emotional and mental distress do not satisfy the bodily injury requirement in article most importantly,we would undermine floyd if we concluded that the drafters of the warsaw convention did intend to compensate passengers who merely suffered physical manifestations of their emotional and mental distress,because plaintiffs would then be able to skirt floyd bar on recovery for purely mental injuries simply by alleging that they suffered some physical manifestations of those injuries,no matter how slight or remote.as a practical matter,floyd would thus be converted into an easily satisfied pleading formality,and a back door would be impermissibly opened to recovery for purely psychological injuries so long as plaintiff could allege nausea and the like.
moreover,the floyd court took pains to attach a relatively narrow meaning to bodily injury in order to respect the primary purpose of the contracting parties to the convention in limiting the liability of air carriers in order t
