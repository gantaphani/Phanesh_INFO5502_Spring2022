seyed mahmood mousavi appeals from his federal criminal convictions for,among other things,willfully providing services to iran in violation of the international economic emergency powers act ieepa,and the iranian transaction regulations itr,commonly referred to as the united states trade embargo against iran.mousavi argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to allow any rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of willfully violating the itr.we conclude,viewing the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the government,that evidence sufficiently supports mousavi conviction under and.see jackson virginia,
mousavi immigrated to the united states from iran in the late,becoming a legal permanent resident in and a naturalized citizen in.at times relevant to this appeal,mousavi and his wife owned mousavi digital services,doing business as global digital services,a partnership that installed television satellite systems.at the same time,mousavi was president of the hejrat educational center,a organization that provided services to the islamic community,and also ran a business that organized travel packages to mecca for the hajj pilgrimage by obtaining necessary visas and arranging flights,hotels,and meals.
in january,agents of the internal revenue service irs discovered evidence of concealed income on mousavi personal and business tax returns.in the resulting investigation,agents found evidence that some of mousavi undisclosed income was from a kuwaiti company,al mal kuwaiti company al mal,which had entered into an agreement with mousavi to provide consulting services related to business ventures in iran.based on this evidence,a grand jury returned an indictment against mousavi in march,charging him with,among other things,conducting unlawful dealings with iran in violation of ieepa and the itr.a jury trial commenced in district court in april.
at trial,the government presented evidence showing that mousavi contracted with al mal to provide consulting services directed at establishing business ventures in iran.to that end,the government produced a document entitled agreement,signed by mousavi and mohammad al sager,chairman and managing director of al mal,dated june,and two attached documents one entitled incentive plan,also dated june,and the other a letter from al mal assistant general manager to akbar torkan,chairman and managing director of petroparts,in tehran,iran,dated august.
the agreement provides,in relevant part 
the two parties agreed on the following 
al mal will hire mousavi consultant to help al mal in its endeavor to do the following 
a to bid for gsm license jointly with iran electronic development company.
b to help establishing a bank and leasing with industrial development renovation organization of iran idro.
the consultants responsibilities will be to follow up with the authorities and concern parties all required steps to help establish and accomplish our planed projects.
al mal will hire the consultant for a period of six months for a remuneration of fifty thousand only to be paid in advance and after reaching a memorandum of understanding mou with each party with the last project getting an extra total.
al mal will appoint mousavi in one of company established jointly by the iranian partners.
an incentive plan will be drafted and agreed upon separately in case that mousavi accomplished any of the above joint companies.
the attached incentive plan provides for additional commissions to be paid in the event of success in several projects.for example,section b of the incentive plan provides gravell project al mal will pay mousavi after successfully completing the purchase of ship and establishing the company jointly with the iranian partner.section states also,mousavi will be exclusive to al mal on iran and will not approach other parties for these projects.
the attached letter from al mal to petroparts references a meeting in tehran regarding al mal interest in investing in the iranian market,and notes al mal particular interest in exploring further the feasibility of a project for commissioning a gas pipeline from the republic of iran say,from kharg island to kuwait.in the letter,al mal nominates mahmoud al mousawi as our liaison for this project.
in addition to the agreement,incentive plan,and letter,the government introduced evidence showing a course of dealings between mousavi and al mal.the documents introduced at trial included mousavi iranian and united states passports with stamps indicating travel to kuwait and iran in late april and early june,as well as a boarding pass from iran air dated april,found in the same file as the agreement.the government introduced bank statements showing wire transfers from al mal into mousavi personal account during the same time period.the statements showed transfers of on april,on june,and on june,for a total of.mousavi personal tax return,also introduced by the government,did not report any income from al mal.instead,it indicated a total income of only,all from mousavi digital services.
finally,the government presented evidence to demonstrate that mousavi was a sophisticated businessman,whose ties to iran and organization of travel in the area would have made him familiar with the united states restrictions on trade with that country.this evidence included mousavi naturalization application and resume,indicating that mousavi grew up in iran and was engaged in business there during the period following the embargo.mousavi had contacts in iran and continued to travel to iran regularly after moving to the united states.in addition,evidence indicated that mousavi ran a business that provided travel packages to persons traveling to mecca for the hajj pilgrimage.in making travel arrangements for clients seeking to visit iran as part of their pilgrimage,mousavi sought visas from the pakistani embassy using that embassy is required,the government witness testified,because there is no iranian embassy in the united states as a result of the trade embargo and diplomatic sanctions.mousavi likewise was forced to coordinate his own and others travel to iran through countries because there are no direct flights to iran from the united states as a result of the embargo.
also at trial,an employee of the treasury department office of foreign assets control ofac,the agency charged with administering the itr,testified that,in his opinion,dealings such as those reflected in the agreement would be a violation of the itr absent a license from ofac.the ofac employee testified that mousavi never applied for or received a license to conduct such business with iran.
following the close of the government case,mousavi moved under federal rule of civil procedure for a directed verdict,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support the charges against him.specifically,the defense argued that the government failed to provide sufficient evidence that mousavi violated the itr,or if he did so failed to prove that he acted willfully.the court reserved ruling on the motion until after the verdict.the defense presented no evidence.
the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts.defense counsel renewed his motion under rule,which the court denied as to mousavi convictions under ieepa and the itr.mousavi filed a timely notice of appeal,contending that evidence presented at trial was constitutionally insufficient to support his conviction.
we begin with a review of the relevant law.ieepa authorizes the president to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat,which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the united states,to the national security,foreign policy,or economy of the united states a.in relevant part,it authorizes the president to impose trade embargoes against foreign countries with which the united states has engaged in hostilities.see id.a.a violation of an embargo imposed under ieepa is a criminal offense.specifically,a provides that it is unlawful for a person to violate,attempt to violate,conspire to violate,or cause a violation of any license,order,regulation or prohibition issued under this chapter.id.a.one who commits or attempts to commit such a violation willfully can be fined or imprisoned.id.c 
in response to the seizure of the american embassy in tehran in,president carter issued a series of executive orders authorizing ofac to promulgate regulations blocking transactions with iran.dames moore regan.consequently,ofac promulgated the itr,which provide,in relevant part 
a except as otherwise authorized pursuant to this part no united states person,wherever located,may engage in any transaction or dealing in or related to 
goods or services of iranian origin or owned or controlled by the government of iran or 
goods,technology,or services for exportation,reexportation,sale or supply,directly or indirectly,to iran or the government of iran.
b for purposes of paragraph a of this section,the term transaction or dealing includes but is not limited to purchasing,selling,transporting,swapping,brokering,approving,financing,facilitating,or guaranteeing.
the itr also prohibit attempts to violate these restrictions any transaction that evades or avoids,or has the purpose of evading or avoiding,or attempts to violate,any of the prohibitions contained in this part is hereby prohibited.the itr provide for a process by which one may obtain a license from ofac to conduct transactions otherwise prohibited by the itr.see.
mousavi makes two arguments as to why the evidence introduced by the government at trial was insufficient to allow any reasonable jury to convict him of a violation of ieepa.first,he argues that the government failed to prove any violation of the itr at all.second,mousavi argues that even if his acts constituted a violation of the itr,the government failed to introduce sufficient evidence that such violation was willful.
our review of the sufficiency of evidence to support a criminal conviction is governed by jackson virginia,which requires a court of appeals to determine whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.at.jackson establishes a inquiry for considering a challenge to a conviction based on sufficiency of the evidence.united states.nevils,cir en banc.first,a reviewing court must consider the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the prosecution without considering how it would have resolved the conflicts,made the inferences,or considered the evidence at trial.id.second,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,we must determine whether this evidence,so viewed,is adequate to allow any rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.quoting jackson,at brackets omitted.we review the evidence presented at mousavi trial under this standard.
we first turn to mousavi contention that the evidence presented at trial is constitutionally insufficient to support his conviction because the government failed to prove any violation of the itr.according to mousavi,the government proved at most that mousavi entered into an agreement to provide future services to a kuwaiti company that sought to do business in iran.mousavi argues that because,the itr at issue,does not proscribe an agreement to take steps in the future,the conduct alleged by the government does not fall within the scope of the regulation.furthermore,mousavi argues that is not clearly applicable to agreements with companies that are not located in iran.at a minimum,mousavi argues,is ambiguous with respect to its applicability to agreements for prospective services with kuwaiti companies,and the rule of lenity demands that such ambiguity be construed in defendants favor.accordingly,mousavi claims that because there was no evidence that he either engaged in a transaction with iran or attempted to do so,the government evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction for violation of ieepa and the itr.
we disagree.the relevant provision of the itr prohibits any transaction or dealing in or related to providing g oods,technology or services to iran or its government,whether directly or indirectly.further,the itr indicate that any transaction that attempts to violate the prohibition against entering into the specified business transactions is prohibited.contrary to mousavi argument,these provisions are not ambiguous rather,they broadly prohibit any transaction that is related to providing goods or services to iran,and any attempt to engage in such a transaction.the plain language of this regulation prohibits an agreement to provide future services to iran such an agreement would both be a transaction related to providing services to iran,as well as an attempt to violate the prohibition against providing such services.see.moreover,the regulation bars transactions or dealings to provide goods,technology or services directly or indirectly to iran,which would preclude transactions or dealings with companies for that purpose.because there is no ambiguity in the regulation,the rule of lenity is inapplicable.see rewis united states.
in light of this clear prohibition,the evidence presented by the government,viewed in the light most favorable to its case,was sufficient to establish a violation of the itr.see nevils,at.the jury could reasonably determine that the agreement between mousavi and al mal,in conjunction with the incentive plan and the august,letter,constituted a transaction related to the provision of services,directly or indirectly,to iran.see.moreover,in light of these documents,a juror could reasonably conclude that mousavi agreed to help al mal engage in several specified transactions with its iranian partners,including assisting al mal bid for a license jointly with iran electronic development company,and establishing a bank and leasing company with the industrial development and renovation organization of iran.moreover,a jury could reasonably conclude that the correlation between the wire transfers from al mal and the evidence of travel to iran during the time frame in which the agreement was finalized indicated that the payments and trips were related to each other,and that mousavi had actually assisted al mal in providing services to iran.
mousavi next argues that the government failed to introduce sufficient evidence that mousavi violation of the itr was willful,as required for the imposition of criminal liability under ieepa.as noted above,under c,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted willfully in committing or attempting to commit a violation of pertinent regulations.see a,c.mousavi argues that to prove willfulness in this context,the government must prove that he was aware of the itr licensing requirements and knew that entering into the agreement without a license issued by ofac was unlawful.according to mousavi,the government must prove his knowledge of the licensing scheme,not just prove that mousavi knew he was violating the law,because ieepa and the itr establish highly technical requirements,which under the reasoning of cheek united states,and ratzlaf united states,require proof of a defendant knowing violation of a specific provision of law.because the government failed to provide any evidence that mousavi knew of the relevant licensing provision,mousavi argues,the evidence was insufficient to convict him.
neither this court nor the supreme court has previously addressed the definition of willful under ieepa,c.as the supreme court has noted,the term willfully is a word of many meanings whose construction is often dependent on the context in which it appears.bryan united states,internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court jurisprudence in this area has evolved over time,but now appears to establish two standards,one higher than the other,for willfulness in the criminal context.see safeco ins.of am.burr,see,cheek,at ratzlaf,at bryan,at.in the context of criminal statutes,the word willful generally indicates a requirement of specific intent.united states henderson,cir.as a general matter,when used in the criminal context,a willful act is one undertaken with a bad purpose.br
