house of prince,a danish corporation hop,appeals an order denying its motion to compel arbitration of the application application of the state of california state to the superior court for enforcement of the master settlement agreement msa,to which hop and state are parties.hop contends the trial court erred by concluding the msa arbitration clause does not require arbitration of the claims asserted by state in the application.
factual and procedural background 
on november,the attorneys general of state,other states,the district of columbia,the commonwealth of puerto rico,and four united states territories together the settling states entered into the msa with four manufacturers of tobacco products,known as the original participating manufacturers opms,to contractually settle certain of the settling states pending and potential civil claims against the opms.on august,hop became a party to the msa as one of the subsequent participating manufacturers spms.
under the msa provisions,opms and spms must make annual payments to the settling states based on their respective market shares of cigarettes sold in the united states.the msa requires each opm and spm to annually report to the designated independent auditor auditor its sales of tobacco products,and the auditor then calculates the market share and required annual payment of each by applying the msa formula the msa also provides for the entry of consent decrees permanently enjoining opms and spms from marketing tobacco products to persons under the age of years and from engaging in certain other marketing activities.the msa provisions apply to all opms and spms in their corporate capacit ies acting through their respective successors and assigns,directors,officers,employees,agents,subsidiaries,divisions,or other internal organizational units of any kind or any other entities acting in concert or participation with them.
on february,state filed the application against hop with the trial court,alleging,inter alia,that 
house of prince riga hereafter,riga manufactures cigarettes to be shipped and sold in the united states on behalf of,and under the supervision and control of,hop.riga is located in latvia.at the time hop executed the msa,riga was its subsidiary.riga remained a subsidiary of hop until sometime in august of when the parent company of hop effected a corporate reorganization whereby hop and riga became sister companies or affiliates.hop manufactures and sells cigarettes in the united states through contractual arrangements between riga and hop united states distributors.hop united states distributors are carolina tobacco and leonidias trading company.leonidias trading company is an affiliate of cigarettes cheaper.
on hop behalf,and under hop supervision and control,riga made cigarettes for sale in the united states.however,hop,as a signatory to the msa,did not report the sales of those cigarettes to auditor,as required under the msa 
hop is avoiding the obligations and restrictions of the msa,and is avoiding,or substantially decreasing,its financial obligations to state and the other settling states by utilizing riga resources to produce cigarettes intended to be sold in the united states and then failing to report those cigarettes to auditor and otherwise treating those cigarettes as outside the msa.by failing to treat cigarettes made by riga as subject to the provisions of the msa,hop has failed to fulfill its obligations under the msa.
the actions of hop impermissibly threaten to circumvent the application of the msa advertising and marketing restrictions implemented to protect the health of the citizens of state and the other settling states on the cigarettes at issue in this application.this conduct also results in annual payments by hop that are substantially less than actually owed to state and the other settling states under the msa.
auditor calculation of hop payments due under the msa should have included,but because of hop failure to report did not include,payments attributable to cigarettes sold in the united states that were manufactured by riga.for the years through,hop has withheld from the settling states approximately million.of this amount,state is entitled to over million pursuant to the terms of the msa.
in the application state seeks a trial court enforcement order directing hop to treat all cigarettes manufactured by riga and sold in the united states as subject to the msa restrictions on marketing activities provide an accounting of all cigarettes manufactured by riga and sold in the united states and pay all amounts hop should have but has not paid pursuant to the terms of the msa.the request for payment was based on hop alleged failure to report to the auditor cigarettes manufactured by riga and sold in the united states.
on august hop,by special appearance,filed a motion to compel arbitration of the claims asserted in the application.hop argued that the msa arbitration clause requires those claims be arbitrated.hop cited section xi c of the msa,which provides 
resolution of disputes.any dispute,controversy or claim arising out of or relating to calculations performed by,or any determinations made by,auditor including,without limitation,any dispute concerning the operation or application of any of the adjustments,reductions,offsets,and allocations described in subsection ix j or subsection xi i shall be submitted to binding arbitration before a panel of three neutral arbitrators,each of whom shall be a former article iii federal judge.each of the two sides to the dispute shall select one arbitrator.the two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator.the arbitration shall be governed by the united states federal arbitration act.italics added.
in support of its motion,hop submitted a declaration of its counsel,jonathan weis,to which was attached a september,letter sent to hop by attorney laurie loveland,whom weis states was counsel for the settling states.
state opposed hop motion to compel arbitration,arguing the plain language of the msa arbitration clause shows the claims asserted by state in the application are not subject to arbitration.state argued that pursuant to section vii a of the msa,the trial court has exclusive jurisdiction to interpret the msa and decide state claims asserted in the application.section vii a of the msa provides 
jurisdiction.each opm and spm and each settling state acknowledge s that the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action identified in exhibit d in such settling state and over each opm and spm shall retain exclusive jurisdiction for the purposes of implementing and enforcing the msa and the consent decree as to such settling state and except as provided in subsections ix d,xi c and xvii d and exhibit o,shall be the only court to which disputes under the msa or the consent decree are presented as to such settling state 
state argued the claims it asserted in the application did not aris e out of or relat e to calculations performed by auditor pursuant to the msa arbitration clause,but rather involved the issue of whether hop obligations under the msa apply to cigarettes manufactured by riga and sold in the united states.state argued its claims depend entirely on interpretation of section vii e of the msa,which provides 
applicability.the msa and the consent decree apply only to the opm and spm in their corporate capacit ies acting through their respective successors and assigns,directors,officers,employees,agents,subsidiaries,divisions,or other internal organizational units of any kind or any other entities acting in concert or participation with them.the remedies,penalties and sanctions that may be imposed or assessed in connection with a breach or violation of the msa or the consent decree or any declaratory order or enforcement order issued in connection with the msa or the consent decree shall only apply to the opm and spm,and shall not be imposed or assessed against any employee,officer or director of any opm or spm,or against any other person or entity as a consequence of such breach or violation,and the court shall have no jurisdiction to do so.
state argued the trial court must determine whether riga is a subsidiary,or other entity acting in concert or participation,with hop.if so,the cigarettes in question are subject to the msa payments.
in its reply,hop argued state interpretation of the msa arbitration clause was not supported by either its language or applicable law.it argued that because any determinations made by auditor were subject to arbitration,the claims asserted by state in the application were necessarily subject to the msa arbitration clause.hop also argued that if the msa arbitration clause is reasonably susceptible of both state and hop proffered interpretations,the trial court should resolve any ambiguity in favor of arbitration.in support of its reply,hop attached another declaration of weis,to which was attached a february,memorandum sent by loveland to the technical working group regarding the msa.
on september the trial court issued its tentative ruling denying hop motion to compel arbitration,stating 
t he arbitration clause at issue is expressly limited in scope and does not require arbitration of the particular issue raised in this case.
in light of the clear language of the arbitration clause phrase which defines the types of disputes that require arbitration,namely calculations performed or any determinations made by,auditor,the meaning of the arbitration clause is plain and clear only disputes involving calculations or determinations made by auditor require arbitration.had the arbitration clause not contained any defining language restricting its scope,the clause could be read broadly enough to encompass the issues presented by the instant action.however,the clause clearly contains such restricting language and can not therefore be fairly read to include within its scope any issues,other than,accounting or financial issues,addressed or made by auditor.
here,it is uncontested that auditor has not made any calculations or determinations.just as important,auditor has not made any calculations or determinations not because state has failed to submit the necessary information to auditor,but rather because hop itself refused to submit the required information to the auditor.as a result,hop actions or omissions have given rise to this case.
following oral argument,the court issued an order confirming its tentative ruling.
hop timely filed a notice of appeal in addition to the parties briefs,we have accepted and reviewed amici curiae briefs from brown williamson tobacco corporation,reynolds tobacco company,lorillard tobacco company and philip morris usa in support of hop appeal and from states,the district of columbia,and the commonwealth of puerto rico in support of state position

interpretation of the msa arbitration clause 
hop contends the trial court erred by concluding the plain language of the msa arbitration clause did not require arbitration of the claims asserted by state in the application.hop argues the msa arbitration clause clearly requires arbitration of those claims or,if not,it is at least ambiguous,requiring an interpretation favoring arbitration.
to determine whether a contractual arbitration clause requires arbitration of a particular controversy,the controversy is first identified and the issue is whether that controversy is within the scope of the contractual arbitration clause.
state alleges in the application that hop has not reported riga annual cigarette sales,as required by the msa,and seeks an enforcement order directing hop to treat all cigarettes manufactured by riga and sold in the united states as subject to the msa restrictions on marketing activities provide an accounting of all cigarettes manufactured by riga and sold in the united states and pay all amounts hop should have but has not paid pursuant to the terms of the msa,because it did not report to the auditor cigarettes manufactured by riga and sold in the united states.the crux of state case is whether the msa applies to riga tobacco product sales through section vii e of the msa,which provides that the msa applies to hop in its corporate capacity acting through its respective successors and assigns,directors,officers,employees,agents,subsidiaries,divisions,or other internal organizational units of any kind or any other entities acting in concert or participation with it.state entitlement to the relief requested in the application is dependent on a favorable determination of that question.therefore,the controversy raised in the application is the interpretation of section vii e of the msa and its application to hop in the context of riga tobacco product sales.
the issue in this appeal is whether that controversy is within the scope of the msa arbitration clause.section xi c of the msa provides for arbitration of certain controversies 
resolution of disputes.any dispute,controversy or claim arising out of or relating to calculations performed by,or any determinations made by,auditor including,without limitation,any dispute concerning the operation or application of any of the adjustments,reductions,offsets,and allocations described in subsection ix j or subsection xi i shall be submitted to binding arbitration italics added.
in interpreting section xi c of the msa,it is considered in the context of all of the other provisions of the msa.the whole of a contract is to be taken together,each clause helping to interpret the other.language in an agreement must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.producers dairy delivery sentry ins.cal d,fn.furthermore,contractual language is interpreted in its popular and ordinary sense unless the parties expressed a contrary intent.courts will not adopt a strained or absurd interpretation in order to create an ambiguity where none exists.reserve insurance pisciotta cal d.
section vii of the msa deals with enforcement of the parties obligations under the msa and the resulting consent decrees.section vii a provides the trial court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction for the purposes of implementing and enforcing the msa.italics added.section vii a further provides the trial court shall be the only court to which disputes under the msa are presented as to state,except as provided in section xi c and certain other specific provisions.section vii c provides a general rule that disputes regarding the msa may be resolved by actions filed in the trial court 
except as provided in section xi c,any settling state,state or opm or spm may bring an action in the court,the trial court in this case to enforce the terms of the msa or for a declaration construing any such term declaratory order with respect to disputes,alleged violations or alleged breaches within such settling state,state.italics added.
the msa provides a general rule that all disputes relating to the msa,including disputes regarding the proper interpretation of the msa terms and provisions,are to be resolved through actions filed in the trial court.accordingly,the controversy of whether hop obligations under the msa apply to riga tobacco product sales may be resolved through an action filed by state in the trial court,unless another provision,section xi c provides otherwise.
under the msa,auditor is charged with calculating and determining the amount of annual payments hop owes under the msa and the allocation of the aggregate annual payments made by the opm and spm including hop payments among the settling states.auditor duties under the msa consist of collecting information from the opms,spms and settling states and,based on that information,calculating and determining payments owed by hop and the opms and other spms under the msa and payments allocated to state and the other settling states from the aggregate payments received from the opms and spms.
the controversy raised by the application is the interpretation of section vii e,which provides that the msa is applicable to the opms and spms in their corporate capacit ies acting through their respective successors and assigns,directors,officers,employees,agents,subsidiaries,divisions,or other internal organizational units of any kind or any other entities acting in concert or participation with them.section vii e in the circumstances of this case does not involve the calculations and determinations that have been made by auditor pursuant to section xi and the other provisions of the msa.rather,interpretation of section vii e involves the question of whether hop is responsible for tobacco products manufactured by riga and sold in the united states therefore,independently construing section xi c in the context of the msa as a whole and in the circumstances of this case,we conclude the plain meaning of section xi c does not require arbitration of the controversy raised by the application,producers dairy delivery sentry ins,supra,cal d at,fn.because the msa language is clear and explicit that arbitration of the instant controversy is not required,that language governs and state properly sought resolution of the controversy by filing the application in the trial court,bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,the trial court properly denied hop motion to compel arbitration.
although hop presents several arguments in support of its position that the controversy raised by the application is subject to the msa arbitration clause,those arguments are not persuasive.
hop argues arbitration of the application controversy is required because section xi c of the msa requires arbitration of a ny dispute,controversy or claim arising out of or relating to calculations performed by,or any determinations made by,auditor.hop reasons that because the enforcement order sought by the application could result in different calculations being made by auditor regarding the amount of annual payments owed,or to be owed,by hop,the application controversy necessarily arises out of or relates to auditor calculations or determinations.however,the application does not challenge any calculation or determination made by auditor.rather,it challenges hop decision to exclude riga tobacco product sales from hop obligations under the msa,including the msa marketing restrictions and hop obligation to provide annual sales reports to auditor.the application expressly alleges hop and riga acted in concert and participation with one another within the meaning of section vii e of the msa,thereby making the msa obligations applicable to riga tobacco product sales.that is the controversy raised by the application.after that controversy is resolved,the relief sought by the application simply involves either enforcement or nonenforcement of the msa obligations as to riga tobacco product sales.if that controversy is resolved favorably to state,the application seeks issuance of an enforcement order directing hop to treat all riga tobacco product sales as subject to the msa marketing restrictions and provide an accounting of those sales and pay amounts it should have but has not paid under the msa.hop argues that if the latter relief were awarded,it necessarily would relate to calculations or determinations made by auditor.however,in so arguing,hop puts the cart before the horse.the application does not challenge any calculation or determination that has been made by auditor.rather,the controversy raised by and the relief requested in the application relate to hop decision not to include riga tobacco product sales within its msa obligations.any relief ordered pursuant to the application will,at most,result in future calculations or determinations being made by auditor regarding hop payment obligations under the msa.section xi c language does not require arbitration of the controversy raised by the application 
hop also argues because section vii of the msa allows the trial court to decide only those disputes arising within california,the controversy raised by the application necessarily is subject to arbitration under the msa.however,section vii a provides the trial court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction for the purposes of implementing and enforcing the msa and the consent decree as to state and shall be the only court to which disputes under the msa or the consent decree are presented as to state.section vii c provides that if the trial court finds hop or an opm or another spm has violated or breached the msa,state may request an order restraining such violation or breach,ordering compliance within state an enforcement order.hop argues because under the msa the trial court is restricted to resolving disputes under,and enforcing,the msa as to state and issuing orders for compliance only within state,the trial court can not address any issues involving the msa unitary hop suggested adjective system for payments by opms and spms,which necessarily involves only one annual payment by hop for all of its united states tobacco product sales.
assuming arguendo the msa involves a unitary payment system,section vii of the msa nevertheless provides for court actions in each settling state for alleged violations or breaches of the msa.in the circumstances of this case,the application alleges hop has treated riga tobacco product sales as outside the msa provisions and thereby has avoided the msa marketing restrictions and annual sales reporting obligations as to riga tobacco product sales.hop apparently concedes the msa allows state to bring an action against hop in the trial court to enforce the msa marketing restrictions as to hop potentially including,as alleged in the application,riga operations and sales in california therefore,hop assertion that state can not bring an action against hop in the trial court to enforce other provisions of the msa is inconsistent with section vii general rule that state may bring an action against hop in the trial court for an order of compliance with the msa.
if hop chooses to exclude sales of its subsidiaries or other affiliates from the msa provisions whether regarding marketing restrictions,reporting obligations,or otherwise,section vii of the msa authorizes state to bring an action to enforce the msa provisions although section vii c restricts those enforcement actions to disputes,alleged violations or alleged breaches within state,hop does not show,as a matter of law,the allegations in the application do not involve such a dispute or alleged violation or breach of the msa within california.instead,hop argues the application alleges violations or breaches of the msa that affect all the settling states,including state,and therefore can not be the subject of an enforcement action in a california court.assuming arguendo the application allegations include violations affecting not only hop actions within california but also within other settling states,we conclude it is a matter for the trial court in this case to consider in the first instance whether or how it should limit the issues and any relief granted to state pursuant to the application.we can not presume the trial court will order any relief that may be beyond its jurisdiction or authority.
hop also argues state does not have a direct claim against hop for any underpayments due state resulting from riga alleged cigarette sales,because state must obtain payments due it under the msa through the agent that receives the annual payments from the opms and spms,which payments are based on calculations made by auditor.because the application alleges state has not received over million from hop because of hop exclusion of riga tobacco product sales,hop argues state claims and requests for relief can not be considered by the trial court,but must be arbitrated because only auditor can make those payment determinations.again,hop misconstrues the msa and places the cart before the horse.state does not dispute any calculation or determination that has been made by auditor,but challenges hop unilateral decision to exclude riga tobacco product sales from hop obligations under the msa.
hop also argues the controversy raised by the application must be arbitrated because section xi d of the msa allows state or hop to dispute any aspect of auditor preliminary calculations including,but not limited to,disputing the methodology that auditor employed,or the information on which auditor relied,in preparing such calculations italics added.however,to the extent that provision allows disputes regarding the information on which auditor relied in making its payment calculations to be arbitrated under section xi c,the controversy raised by the application is not subject to arbitration because auditor could not,and did not,rely on information regarding riga tobacco product sales in making its calculations hop omitted those sales from its annual sales reports.hop also cites section xi a,which provides auditor shall promptly collect all information necessary to make such calculations and determinations.hop and state shall provide auditor,as promptly as practicable,with information in its possession or readily available to it necessary for auditor to perform such calculations.hop argues because state had an obligation to provide auditor with information regarding riga tobacco product sales that state alleges was necessary for auditor payment calculations,yet state did not provide that information to auditor,the instant dispute must be arbitrated.assuming arguendo state possessed information it could have but did not provide to auditor regarding riga tobacco product sales,hop does not cite any provision in the msa that requires arbitration of the dispute or otherwise penalizes state based on its failure to provide auditor with that information.furthermore,in so arguing,hop apparently attempts to divert attention from its own alleged failure to provide information to auditor.based on the application allegations,it can be presumed information regarding riga tobacco product sales was more fully and directly available to hop than to state.
hop also argues because there are strong presumptions in favor of arbitration under california law and the federal arbitration act,the controversy raised by the application must be arbitrated.in this state,as under federal law citation,doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues are to be resolved in favor of arbitration.citations.therefore,in the absence of indication of contrary intent,and where the arbitration clause is reasonably susceptible of such an interpretation,claims will be deemed subject to arbitration.ericksen,arbuthnot,mccarthy,kearney walsh,oak street,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted.i n applying general principles of contract interpretation to the interpretation of an arbitration agreement within the scope of the federal arbitration act,citation,due regard must be given to the federal policy favoring arbitration,and ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself resolved in favor of arbitration.volt info.sciences leland stanford,supra,at.however,those presumptions in favor of arbitration do not apply if contractual language is plain that arbitration of a particular controversy is not within the scope of the arbitration provision.there is no public policy favoring arbitration of disputes which the
