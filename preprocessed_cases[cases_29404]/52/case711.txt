appellant,douglas barry kent,is a senior foreign service officer seeking to avoid exposure to personal liability for an automobile accident that occurred in russia while he was driving home from work in his personal vehicle.kent sought certification from the department of justice that he was acting within the scope of employment at the time of the accident,which,if granted,would substitute the united states for kent as the defendant in the action.the department of justice refused to grant the certification.kent also petitioned the district court for certification.the district court,applying the restatement second of agency,concluded that kent was not acting within the scope of employment,and denied kent petition for certification.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse.we conclude in this interlocutory appeal that district of columbia law governs the question of whether kent was acting within the scope of employment.applying district of columbia law,we hold that kent was acting within the scope of employment when he was involved in the automobile accident.we therefore grant kent petition for certification.
in october,kent served as the consul general of the united states to the republic of russia in the far east consular largest consular district in russia.as the consul general,kent was the highest ranking united states representative in that district.he was fully accredited as a diplomat and entitled to the fullest extent of consular immunity,including immunity from criminal prosecution.
the united states department of state leased an apartment for kent and provided him with a private driver and vehicle that kent could use for any purpose,whether work or personal.when kent first arrived in russia,he used the private driver for all transportation.however,the budget and fiscal officer at the moscow embassy informed kent that the department of state wished to reduce the expenses of its missions overseas and indicated that the overtime expenses for kent personal driver were high due to kent late hours at work.complying with the request that he reduce expenses,kent had his personal vehicle shipped to russia.the department of state agreed to reimburse kent for all mileage that he drove in his personal vehicle.see foreign affairs manual fam formerly fam.
days after kent vehicle arrived in russia,kent was involved in an automobile accident.driving home from work late one evening,kent stopped at a gym located on his way home.after leaving the gym,kent pulled out in front of another vehicle,which had just picked up a,aleksandr nikolaevich kashin.the two vehicles collided,sending the vehicle in which kashin was riding crashing into a third vehicle.kashin was seriously injured by the impact with the third vehicle.
immediately after the accident,the department of state dispatched its duty officer to the accident scene.pursuant to orders from the senior regional security officer at the united states embassy in moscow,the duty officer instructed kent not to submit to a blood alcohol test on the ground of his diplomatic department of state prohibits foreign service officers from being injected with a needle by a foreign official.the morning after the accident,the consulate regional security officer conducted an investigation of the accident,and the consulate later hired a local attorney to resolve the dispute between kashin and kent.
the local attorney did not resolve the dispute in russia.kent attributes that failure to international politics 
p olitical forces in russia launched a campaign to use the accident as an opportunity to discredit the united states.false allegations that i was intoxicated and that i laughingly escaped the scene of the accident to a nearby nightclub were promulgated in both the local and official press.the matter,thus fraudulently characterized,allegedly was presented to the russian duma which purportedly passed a resolution condemning the united states for the manner in which it was handling the matter.
in an orchestrated political action,including staged rallies by citizens portending outrage at the united states,comparisons were made between me and a georgian diplomat who had collided with a family in the district of columbia while driving drunk,killing one member of the family.the georgian diplomat was stripped of his diplomatic immunity at the request of the united states and was criminally prosecuted in washington.the russian protesters and press were proclaiming the hypocrisy of the united states in the kashin matter,all borne of a longstanding unhappiness with how the united states had treated the georgian diplomat.
after the russian dispute resolution process failed,kashin filed a lawsuit against kent,the united states,and the department of state in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the district court dismissed the united states and the department of state,concluding that sovereign immunity insulated them from suit.this dismissal left kent as the sole defendant.the district court then transferred the action to the eastern district of virginia due to a lack of venue in pennsylvania.the eastern district of virginia transferred the action to the southern district of california,kent state of domicile.
on january,kent filed a petition for certification in the southern district of california.a month later,kent sought from the department of justice certification that he was acting within the scope of employment at the time of the accident.the department of justice denied the certification request on march.
on august,the district court also denied kent petition for certification.although kent argued that the district court should apply the respondeat superior law of state of district court applied instead the general united states tort laws as embodied in the restatement second of agency.applying this law,the district court determined that kent was not acting within the scope of employment at the time of the accident.it also denied kent request for an evidentiary hearing.
kent appeals the district court rulings.
the attorney general decision regarding scope of employment certification is subject to de novo review in both the district court and on appeal.where facts relevant to this inquiry are in dispute,however,we review the district court factual findings for clear error.green hall,cir per curiam citation omitted.t he party seeking review bears the burden of presenting evidence and disproving the attorney general decision to grant or deny scope of employment certification by a preponderance of the evidence.id.
we are presented with a single question was kent acting within the scope of employment when the automobile accident occurred because the federal tort claims act ftca is silent on what law to apply when the tort occurs in a foreign country,and no federal court in the united states has addressed that issue,we must first determine what law to apply.
before proceeding to the choice of law issue,we note that it is unusual that the united states government is the party opposing kent petition for certification at the district court and now on appeal,rather than kashin,the plaintiff.as the supreme court aptly noted in a similar case where the tort occurred in a foreign country,
the federal employee claim is one the united states attorney has no incentive to oppose win or lose,the united states retains its immunity hence,were the united states to litigate scope of employment against its own consuming the local united states attorney precious litigation would be litigating solely for the benefit of the plaintiff.
gutierrez de martinez lamagno,d.accordingly,win or lose,the government faces no liability in this action.we can,however,comprehend that the government may in some circumstances,possibly as a matter of relations with foreign sovereigns or their citizens,wish to enforce its view that its officers or employees should not escape responsibility for particular tortious conduct committed abroad.the united states reasons for participating in this case are unknown to us.they are also irrelevant.
the ftca permits suits against the united states for injuries caused within a government employee scope of employment.see b.the westfall act amended the ftca to provide that if the attorney general certifies that a federal government employee was acting within the scope of employment when the tort occurred,then the united states shall be substituted as the defendant in a tort suit against the employee.d.upon certification,the government employee is dismissed from the suit,and is immune from other civil actions arising from the alleged tort.b.if the attorney general refuses to certify,the employee may petition the district court to certify that he was acting within the scope of employment.d.either party may immediately appeal the district court decision.see pelletier fed.home loan bank of san francisco,cir.
the ftca,however,does not waive the sovereign immunity of the united states if the tort was committed in a foreign country.k.where,as here,the tort was committed abroad,the scope of employment analysis remains the same,and,if the department of justice or the court certifies that the employee was acting within the scope of employment,the united states is substituted as the defendant.however,because the united states retains its sovereign immunity,the action will be dismissed.thus,a grant of certification sounds the death knell for lawsuits involving foreign torts.
accordingly,the lynchpin question in ftca cases is whether the employee was acting within the scope of employment at the time of the allegedly tortious act.the law applicable to determine whether a government employee was acting within the scope of employment is the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.b.this law is generally the respondeat superior law of the state in which the alleged tort occurred.see green,at.however,congress expressed its intent that foreign law not apply.see sosa,d.thus,where the alleged tort occurred in a foreign country,the threshold question is what law to apply.
kent argues that we should apply the law from the defendant state of domicile,california in this case.the district court rejected that argument and applied instead the restatement second of agency.we disagree with both kent and the district court and apply instead district of columbia law.our decision to apply district of columbia law relies partially upon the department of state location in the district of columbia and partially upon a process of elimination.
kent employer,the department of state,is located within the district of columbia.the department of state foreign actions are inextricably bound up with the district of columbia in its role as the nation capital.rasul rumsfeld,d,internal quotation marks omitted applying district of columbia respondeat superior law under the ftca in a lawsuit filed against the secretary of defense and a number of members of the armed forces where the alleged torts occurred on guantanamo bay naval base.for example,the decision to send kent to russia and the decision to reduce the expenses of overseas missions,leading to kent use of his personal vehicle,were most likely made in the district of establishing a nexus,albeit tenuous,to the tort that occurred in russia.
we decline to adopt the district court rationale underlying its decision to apply the restatement second of agency.recognizing that the ftca is silent on what law to apply,the district court looked to the military claims act,which has a choice of law provision similar to that of the ftca.see kashin kent,d.both statutes are silent on what law to apply if the alleged tort occurred in a foreign country.however,the regulations promulgated under the military claims act provide,in claims arising in a foreign country,liability of the united states will be assessed by reference to general principles of tort law common to the majority of united states jurisdictions.b.the district court concluded,in the absence of clear precedent regarding choice of law in ftca cases where the act or omission occurred abroad,the court looks to the choice of law regulations promulgated pursuant to the mca.kashin,d at.accordingly,the district court found that the restatement second of agency is a standard legal publication containing general tort principles of the united states.id.
we conclude that the regulations enacted under the military claims act carry no weight as to congress intent concerning the ftca.the military claims act regulations were promulgated by the secretaries of army and air force to fill in the blank left by congress.see b,a.the regulations therefore express the intent of the secretaries and,consequently,provide no insight as to the intentions of congress concerning the ftca.
moreover,district of columbia law has one substantial advantage over applying the restatement in provides a single,cogent body of law rather than multiple state and federal decisions that grant sometimes conflicting interpretations to the restatement.by looking to a single forum interpretation of the scope of employment,we add legitimacy to the process of determining whether an employee was acting within the scope of employment otherwise,courts would have carte blanche to pick and choose among various conflicting cases from multiple forums.
applying district of columbia law also has a substantial advantage over kent suggestion of applying law from the defendant state of.if we applied the respondeat superior law from the defendant state of domicile,a lawsuit arising from a single tortious act but implicating multiple tortfeasors could arrive at conflicting results,based upon each tortfeasor state of domicile.on a close factual scenario,those tortfeasors domiciled in a state with a broad interpretation of scope of employment would be protected from personal liability while those tortfeasors domiciled in states with a narrow interpretation of scope of employment would be saddled with personal liability,even though they were involved in the same tortious incident as their.
therefore,until congress provides further guidance,we conclude that district of columbia law governs the question of whether kent was acting within the scope of employment.
the government contends that kent was not acting within the scope of employment at the time of the accident.it argues that kent allegedly tortious conduct did not involve an activity that kent was hired to driving nor exercising at the gym was part of kent duties as the consul general.the government therefore contends that the district court properly denied kent petition for certification.we disagree.
district of columbia law concerning the scope of employment is rooted in the restatement second of agency.see schecter merchs.home delivery.restatement states that an employee conduct is within the scope of employment if a it is of the kind he is employed to perform b it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits and c it is actuated,at least in part,by a purpose to serve the master.district of columbia law liberally construes the doctrine of respondeat superior,at least with respect to the first prong of the restatement stokes cross.
although the determination of scope of employment is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each case,penn cent.transp.reddick,the district of columbia court of appeal has announced a general rule 
w hatever is done by the employee in virtue of his employment and in furtherance of its ends is deemed by the law to be an act done within the scope of his employment,and in determining whether the servant conduct was within the scope of his employment,it is proper to inquire whether he was at the time engaged in serving his master.
id.citation omitted.several factors are indicative of whether an employee conduct falls within the scope of employment.district of columbia davis.the court evaluates whether the employer at the time had the right to control and direct the employee in the performance of his work.id.the court evaluates also the employee state of mind to determine whether the employee subjectively believed that he was acting within the scope of employment.id.
although no reported district of columbia case has a factual scenario involving a senior foreign service officer committing a tort abroad,we conclud
