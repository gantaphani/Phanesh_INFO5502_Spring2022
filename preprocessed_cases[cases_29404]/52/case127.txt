these appeals,heard in tandem,challenge two orders entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york carter,and rakoff,holding that the separate entity rule precludes a court from ordering a garnishee bank with branches in new york to turn over or restrain assets of judgment debtors held in foreign branches of the bank.in both cases,the plaintiff judgment creditors plaintiffs contend that the decision of the new york court of appeals in koehler bank of bermuda,makes clear that relief under article of the new york civil practice law and rules cplr is dependent only on personal jurisdiction over the garnishee banks,and therefore its remedies are available to reach property of judgment debtors held in foreign branches of those banks.the defendant garnishee banks defendants argue that koehler did not silently overrule new york longstanding separate entity rule as applied to banks with branches in new york and other countries.
these appeals present the following unresolved questions of new york law 
first,whether the separate entity rule precludes a judgment creditor from ordering a garnishee bank operating branches in new york to turn over a debtor assets held in foreign branches of the bank and 
second,whether the separate entity rule precludes a judgment creditor from ordering a garnishee bank operating branches in new york to restrain a debtor assets held in foreign branches of the bank.
because these unresolved questions implicate significant new york state interests and are determinative of these appeals,we reserve decision and certify these questions to the new york court of appeals.
background 
cplr article and the separate entity rule 
cplr article governs the enforcement and collection of money judgments in new york.see et mckinney.sections and b apply to third parties that possess assets in which a judgment debtor has an interest.section authorizes the issuance of a restraining notice to prohibit a third party from disposing of a debt owed to the judgment debtor for one year after service of the restraining notice or until the judgment is satisfied or vacated,whichever comes first section b allows a judgment creditor to commence a proceeding to order a third party to turn over the judgment debtors assets as the new york court of appeals explained in koehler,article postjudgment enforcement involves a proceeding against a person its purpose is to demand that a person convert property to money for payment to a creditor.at.accordingly,personal jurisdiction is the linchpin of authority under section b.commw.of the mariana islands canadian imperial bank of commerce,nmi.
nevertheless,new york courts have long applied the separate entity rule to garnishee banks operating branches both in new york and elsewhere.the rule provides that even if a bank is subject to personal jurisdiction due to the presence of a new york branch,the other branches of the bank will be treated as separate entities for certain purposes,such as attachments,restraints,and turnover orders indeed,as the rule has been historically applied,even branches of a bank located in the same city are separate entities for purposes of attachment although the rule has no apparent mooring in the text of the cplr,the principle that branches of banks are regarded as separate entities for some purposes is reflected in new york uniform commercial code 
the original rationale for the rule was that e ach time a warrant of attachment is served upon one branch,every other branch and the main office would have to be notified,plac ing an intolerable burden upon banking and commerce,particularly where the branches are numerous,as is often the case.cronan schilling,aff,dep t.in digitrex.johnson,the southern district of new york knapp,concluded that the separate entity rule was outdated in light of technological advances in the banking industry,holding restraining notice served on bank main office sufficient and legally effective,as applied to assets in branch of bank.state and federal courts applying new york law have limited digitrex reach,however,and apply its exception to the separate entity rule only where the restraining notice is served on the bank main office the main office and the branches where the accounts in question are maintained are within the same jurisdiction and the bank branches are connected to the main office by computers and are under its centralized control.in re union fire ins.of pittsburgh emp concepts,dep t emphasis in original accordingly,courts have routinely applied the separate entity rule to proceedings involving branches of banks in different sovereign nations 
tire engineering and distribution,bank of china.
on october,the district court for the eastern district of virginia entered a judgment in favor of tire engineering and distribution,tire engineering against six foreign companies based in china and dubai the judgment debtors for copyright infringement and conversion.the fourth circuit affirmed in part,upholding the jury million damages award.see tire eng g,llc shandong linglong rubber,cir.the judgment debtors have refused to pay the judgment.
tire engineering eventually learned that one of the judgment debtors had assets at the bank of china boc.boc is controlled and owned,at least in part,by the people republic of china.boc operates two branches in new york city.
on december,tire engineering filed this action in the southern district of new york seeking a turnover order against boc pursuant to cplr b,alleging that boc possesses assets of at least one of the judgment debtors.tire engineering asked that boc be ordered to turn over all money or other personal property in its possession in which one or more of the j udgment d ebtors have an interest,regardless of whether boc possesses that money or other personal property in new york,china,the united arab emirates,or elsewhere.first amend.compl.tire engineering also served a restraining notice on boc pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a and cplr,prohibiting it from selling,assigning,or transferring any property of the judgment debtors in its possession.the district court carter,j.entered an order directing boc to show cause as to why a preliminary injunction should not be granted.
in response,boc confirmed it had no accounts or property belonging to any of the judgment debtors in its new york branches.boc filed a motion to dismiss,arguing,among other things,that the separate entity rule precluded the relief tire engineering requested.further,it argued that a preliminary injunction was inappropriate due to the substantial harm that freezing assets belonging to the judgment debtors would cause boc.in support,boc submitted declarations of two professors,explaining that chinese banking laws prohibit chinese commercial banks from complying with u.court orders by freezing customer bank accounts in china and that accordingly boc could face regulatory sanctions and civil litigation in china if it complied with the turnover order.
on april,the district court granted boc motion to dismiss,holding that the separate entity rule precluded tire engineering request for relief.the district court granted tire engineering request for a stay pending appeal,permitting the restraining notice to remain in place until the appeal was decided.
motorola credit standard charter bank 
between april and september,members of the uzan family the uzans induced motorola credit corporation motorola to loan more than billion to a turkish company they controlled.see motorola credit uzan,d.the uzans diverted much of these funds.id.on july,the district court rakoff,entered a judgment against the uzans in favor of motorola for compensatory damages in the amount of.id.at.in addition,on june,the district court awarded motorola billion in punitive damages.see motorola credit uzan,d.
the uzans have attempted to avoid paying these judgments.see motorola credit uzan,cir finding the uzans have persistently endeavored to evade the lawful jurisdiction of the district court and undermine its careful and determined work.indeed,the uzans remain in contempt of court for failure to comply with the district court orders and are subject to arrest if they enter the united states.see id.at.motorola has accordingly pursued collection of the judgment through independent investigation and discovery,and the district court has conducted proceedings ex parte and under seal.on february,the district court issued a restraining order pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure and and cplr,enjoining the uzans,their agents,and anyone with notice of the order from selling,assigning,or transferring their property the restraining order.the restraining order prohibited any parties served with it from disclosing the restraining order or its contents to the uzans.
motorola served the restraining order on standard chartered bank scb.scb is a foreign banking corporation,incorporated under the laws of and headquartered in the united kingdom,with branches in many countries,as well as a branch in new york.scb did not find any uzan property in its new york branch.after a global search in late april,however,scb identified relevant assets connected with its branches in the united arab emirates.motorola asked scb to freeze the assets.as scb sought to comply with the restraining order,regulatory authorities in jordan and the intervened.the central bank of jordan sent an auditor to seize documents from scb branch office in jordan.the central bank debited scb account with its bank.
on may,scb filed a motion for relief from the restraining order.scb argued,among other things,that placing a restraint on the repayment of the interbank placements is contrary to the law in the and subjects scb to legal and regulatory risk.further,it argued that,in light of the separate entity rule,the restraining order should not have extraterritorial reach.finally,scb argued that subjecting its foreign branches to the restraining order violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment by exposing scb to double liability.
in a sealed order dated may,the district court found,in relevant part,that the separate entity rule precludes motorola from restraining assets held by scb foreign branches.noting that the law was unsettled as to the viability of the separate entity rule,the district court stayed the release of the restraint on the assets pending appeal.the district court subsequently issued a sealed opinion,explaining its order in more detail.
these appeals followed.

application 
we conclude that these appeals turn on unsettled and important questions of new york law.accordingly,we certify those questions to the new york court of appeals.
the absence of controlling precedent 
the new york court of appeals has never addressed whether the separate entity rule applies to enforcement proceedings.indeed,it has not explicitly addressed the separate entity rule in any context.instead,it has affirmed,without opinion,intermediate courts application of the separate entity rule in cases that did not involve enforcement proceedings.see mccloskey chase manhattan bank,affirming denial of plaintiff request for order of attachment against deposit account at bank branch in germany by serving warrant of attachment on bank office in new york city chrzanowska corn exch.bank,dep t,aff,interpreting provisions of new york banking law and finding different branches were as separate and distinct from one another as from any other bank.accordingly,despite its application by lower courts discussed above,the new york court of appeals has never unequivocally approved or disapproved of the separate entity rule.
the new york court of appeals has instructed that in determining the expanse of section b the starting point is the language itself,giving effect to the plain meaning thereof.nmi,at quoting majewski broadalbin perth cent.sch.as plaintiffs point out,the plain language of sections and b supports the authority of new york courts to order garnishee banks subject to personal jurisdiction in new york to turn over or restrain judgment debtors assets.article makes no specific references to foreign banks operating new york branches,and the separate entity rule is not the product of a textual analysis of the cplr.instead,it is a judicially created doctrine reflecting policy considerations over time,as discussed below.accordingly,while we are mindful that the new york court of appeals has determined that the failure of the legislature to include a term in article is a significant indication that its exclusion was intended,nmi,at,we find this principle inapposite for a wholly judicially created doctrine not tethered to the cplr text.
plaintiffs contend that the decision of the new york court of appeals decision in koehler settles the issues we face here.in koehler,the court addressed the question,certified by this court,whether a court sitting in new york may order a bank over which it has personal jurisdiction to deliver stock certificates owned by a judgment debtor or cash equal to their value to a judgment creditor,pursuant to cplr article,when the stock certificates are located outside new york.koehler,at.answering the question in the affirmative,the koehler court explained that the legislature intended cplr article to have extraterritorial reach and the key to the reach of the turnover order is personal jurisdiction over a particular defendant.id.at.in short,the koehler court concluded that a new york court has the authority to issue a turnover order pertaining to extraterritorial property,if it has personal jurisdiction over a judgment debtor in possession of the property.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.plaintiffs urge us to find that this holding in koehler definitively forecloses the application of the separate entity rule to enforcement proceedings.while we acknowledge that koehler may be so read we decline to reach the issue.
the separate entity rule was briefed in koehler.see br.of the clearing house ass as amicus curiae in support of respondent,koehler,wl at the court should not answer the certified question in a manner that conflicts with the separate entity rule.the deeply divided koehler court did not,however,address the issue.in light of the longstanding application of the separate entity rule in new york,as discussed above,we doubt that the court of appeals intended to silently overrule the doctrine new york courts considering the rule application to enforcement orders after koehler have so held 
moreover,on the facts before it,the court in koehler did not need to address the separate entity rule.the defendant in koehler was a foreign bank that had consented to personal jurisdiction in new york through the service of its wholly owned new york subsidiary.koehler,at.further,the judgment creditor in koehler sought the
