in this appeal we consider whether an arrest warrant issued by a foreign court that no longer has jurisdiction over the accused,nor the power to enforce the warrant,can provide an adequate basis for the extradition of a united states citizen.this is a question of first the fact that this issue has not been previously decided should not be surprising.it is a rare circumstance where the very document that provides the basis for an extradition request turns out to have been issued by an entity that no longer has lawful authority over the matter.while the factual and procedural history of this case is extraordinary,our resolution of it requires only that we apply the plain meaning of the provisions of the relevant treaty.the treaty authorizes the extradition of an individual who has been charged with a crime and requires that an arrest warrant and supporting materials be provided in order to obtain that extradition.because the arrest warrant at issue in this case was issued by a court that neither has jurisdiction over the matter nor authority to enforce the warrant,the requirement of the treaty that an individual be charged with an extraditable offense has not been satisfied.this defect falls within the narrow category of issues that is cognizable on habeas review of an extradition order we therefore reverse the order of the district court denying the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
background 
muhamed sacirbey,also known as muhamed sacirbegovic,was born in in sarajevo,yugoslavia.at that time,the communist regime led by josip broz tito controlled yugoslavia,and sacirbey parents opposed tito authoritarian government.for their dissenting political beliefs,sacirbey parents were imprisoned for a time.in the,the sacirbey family fled yugoslavia and immigrated to the united states,where they settled in ohio.on april,at the age of sixteen,sacirbey became a naturalized citizen of the united states.during the years that followed,sacirbey attended tulane university on a football scholarship he earned a bachelor degree and a degree in law at tulane and a master of business administration degree at columbia university.after his admission to the bar of the state of new york,sacirbey worked as a lawyer for a new york law firm.in the,he left his law firm to work in the financial sector,first as a vice president at standard and poor,the rating agency,and later as vice president of an investment bank.
on april,the republic of bosnia and herzegovinia bosnia declared its independence from yugoslavia.the united states officially recognized bosnia independence two days later,and bosnia was admitted to membership in the united nations on may.shortly thereafter,bosnian president alija izetbegovic,a leader of the muslim community of bosnia,appointed sacirbey to serve as bosnia ambassador to the united nations.despite international recognition,bosnian serbs continued to oppose independence and,with the support of the government of neighboring province in the former a violent campaign to partition the country along ethnic lines.according to the united states department of state,t he conflict continued through most of,and many atrocities were committed,including acts of genocide committed by members of the bosnian serb armed forces in and around srebrenica from july,where approximately bosnian muslim men and boys were killed.bureau of european and eurasian affairs,dep t of state,background note bosnia and herzegovina,available at www.state.gov r pa ei bgn.htm last visited december.sacirbey,appointed bosnian foreign minister upon the assassination of his predecessor in,represented bosnia at peace talks held in outside of dayton,ohio those talks lead to the dayton peace accords,which were formally signed on december,in paris and which ended the war in bosnia after more than three years and ensured bosnia independence under the supervision of a high representative selected by the united nations security council.id.
sacirbey continued to represent bosnia at the united nations until.during his tenure as bosnia first united nations ambassador,sacirbey opened the permanent mission to the united nations and the general consulate of bosnia in new york the mission,promoted the creation of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia the icty and managed the legal team in an action against yugoslavia for genocide in the international court of justice icj for much of this period,the finances of the mission were in disarray.sacirbey claims that he received no salary for his services and that he had to open the mission using his personal resources,including fees from his speaking engagements,and by soliciting contributions from sympathetic nations.as sacirbey concedes,funds earmarked for one project were often spent on another,and personal bank accounts were used to house those funds.see affidavit of muhamed sacirbey,at 
sacirbey resigned from his ambassadorship and returned to private life in the united states in december.after his resignation,sacirbey claims to have learned that bosnian foreign minister zlatko lagumdzija,a perceived political adversary of sacirbey and allegedly a former official in the communist party,had launched an investigation of him.in early,the foreign ministry requested that the cantonal prosecutors office in sarajevo investigate alleged financial irregularities at the mission during sacirbey tenure.on april,the cantonal prosecutor submitted a demand for investigation to the cantonal court,alleging that sacirbey had abused his office in violation of bosnian law.specifically,the prosecutor alleged that sacirbey had embezzled and there was a million shortfall in an investment account over which sacirbey had signature authority see sacirbey guccione,cv,wl,dist.lexis,at,sacirbey ii.in response to the prosecutor application,the cantonal court issued a decision to investigate sacirbey on august,and later,on december,a decision for detention and an international arrest warrant for sacirbey.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
bosnia sought the extradition of sacirbey in a formal request to the united states department of justice dated january.bosnia request was made pursuant to an extradition treaty executed in by the united states and the kingdom of serbia the treaty which provides,in part,that 
the government of the united states and the government of servia sic mutually agree to deliver up persons who,having been charged with or convicted of any of the crimes and offenses specified in the following article,committed within the jurisdiction of one of the high contracting parties,shall seek an asylum or be found within the territories of the other provided,that this shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality as,according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found,would justify his or her apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime or offense had been committed there.
treaty for mutual extradition of fugitives from justice,art.i,date of ratification by the president,stat,bevans.under article ii of the treaty,e mbezzlement by public officers is among the offenses specified for extradition.id.in order to secure extradition of a fugitive who is merely charged with crime,article iii of the treaty requires the requesting government to provide a duly authenticated copy of the warrant of arrest in the country where the crime has been committed,and of the depositions or other evidence upon which such warrant was issued article iv provides that in advance of the presentation of formal proofs,complaint on oath shall be made by an agent of the government of servia sic before a judge or other magistrate authorized to issue warrants of arrest.in addition,the treaty provides that n either of the high contracting parties shall be bound to deliver up its own citizens or subjects under the stipulations of this treaty,id.at art.v,and that offense s of a political character may not lead to extradition under the treaty,id.at art.vi.
while the treaty expressly authorizes the united states to decline to extradite sacirbey because he is a citizen,the department of state is authorized by statute to extradite citizens who otherwise come within the scope of the relevant extradition treaty.see if the applicable treaty or convention does not obligate the united states to extradite its citizens to a foreign country,the secretary of state may,nevertheless,order the surrender to that country of a united states citizen whose extradition has been requested by that country if the other requirements of that treaty or convention are met.the department of state appears to have chosen to exercise its discretion in this case by requesting sacireby extradition.on march,the department of justice filed a complaint for arrest with a view towards extradition of sacirbey in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.sacirbey was arrested in march and detained for over a year until he was released on bail in july 
procedural history 
the matter was assigned to magistrate judge frank maas for a determination of whether sacirbey should be extradited pursuant to bosnia request.see in re the extradition of muhamed sacirbegovic,crim.misc,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,sacirbey i.judge maas held a hearing on december,during which the government introduced the following evidence in support of extradition the cantonal court august,decision to investigate the cantonal court december,decision for detention and international arrest warrant for sacirbey the sworn statements of three witness and an affidavit from robert dalton,the assistant legal adviser for treaty affairs at the united states department of state,briefly explaining the history of the treaty.see id.at,dist.lexis,at appellees br.
sacirbey opposed extradition on the grounds that there was no valid extradition treaty between the united states and bosnia,the offense of abuse of office or authority for which extradition was sought failed to meet the treaty requirements,bosnia had failed to charge him formally with an extraditable offense bosnia had failed to establish probable cause to believe that he committed any crimes,and his conduct fell within a treaty exception for crimes of a political character.sacirbey i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.in support of his case,sacirbey offered his own testimony,as well as the testimony of paul robert williams,a former state department employee and current professor of law,and the declaration of michael hartmann,then an adviser to the state department on matters of criminal prosecution in afghanistan,as an expert on bosnian criminal law.sacirbey testified that the finances of the mission were haphazard during his tenure and that his political adversaries were using a criminal investigation to retaliate against him.id.at,dist.lexis,at.professor williams corroborated sacirbey claims,testifying that after sacirbey left office,the party controlling the bosnian government changed hands,and the new party,which was the former communist party,essentially recloaked,had a very specific motive in going after members of the former regime to discredit them for political reasons.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
in an opinion and order dated january,magistrate judge maas granted the extradition request.rejecting sacirbey arguments,magistrate judge maas concluded that bosnia had succeeded to the treaty,see id.at,dist.lexis,at the offense of abuse of authority was sufficiently equivalent to embezzlement by public officers to warrant extradition under the treaty,see id.at,dist.lexis,at a formal criminal charge is not required by the treaty,see id.at,dist.lexis,at probable cause had been established by the affidavits submitted in support of the extradition request,see id.at,dist.lexis,at and the exception did not apply to allegations of embezzlement,see id.at,dist.lexis,at.on january,judge maas issued a certification of extraditability and order of commitment.a 
three months later,sacirbey filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the united states district court for the southern district of new york barbara jones,judge observing that the scope of its review was limited to determining whether the magistrate judge had jurisdiction,the charged offense fell within the treaty and there was a reasonable ground to believe the accused guilty of the charged offense,the district court denied sacirbey petition.see sacirbey ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at citing fernandez phillips.
in his habeas petition,sacirbey did not challenge magistrate judge maas jurisdiction over bosnia extradition request,so that ground for habeas relief was effectively conceded.see id.at,dist.lexis,at.instead,he pressed the two other claims cognizable on habeas review,and made several constitutional challenges to the adequacy of the proceedings before magistrate judge maas.
with respect to the second claim cognizable on habeas review,sacirbey failed to persuade the district court that he was not charged with an extraditable offense sacirbey argued,inter alia,that legal reforms in bosnia had deprived the cantonal court of jurisdiction over this matter,thereby nullifying the arrest warrant for sacirbey.at oral argument before the district court,counsel for sacirbey emphasized,the cantonal court is done.it does not exist the old system under which my client was charged has disappeared.tr.of proceedings.in light of the government concession that t here is ambiguity as to whether the cantonal court has jurisdiction over the investigation of sacirbey,tr.of proceedings,the district court authorized the parties to submit additional briefing on the question of whether a court had jurisdiction over the investigation of sacirbey.
pursuant to the district court authorization,sacirbey submitted declarations from his bosnian lawyer,zlatan terzic,and from michael hartmann,the same expert who had previously filed a declaration in opposition to the government application to extradite sacirbey.the terzic declaration stated that,based on terzic personal inquiries,neither the cantonal court nor the court of bosnia and herzegovina the national court has been seized of the case against sacirbey.therefore,there is no forum available to us to approach for resolution,to petition for appropriate remedies,or to challenge the propriety and legality of this allegedly ongoing investigation,decl.of zlatan terzic.the hartmann declaration stated flatly that,by the admissions of the bosnian government neither the national nor cantonal court,nor the cantonal prosecutor,have possession of the case.the only state organ not denying possession of the case but rather affirming its possession is the office of the national prosecutor,decl.of michael hartmann.sacirbey argued that,because no court had jurisdiction over his case,he was not charged with a crime,but only the target of an investigation 
in response,the government submitted two letters written by amra kosovic,counselor to the bosnian embassy in washington,kosovic first letter,dated october,stated that the national court will proceed in the matter of sacirbey if the request for extradition would be approved by the appropriate authorities of the united states,letter of amra kosovic.a second letter,dated november,was more equivocal on the question of whether the national court had jurisdiction over the case.kosovic letter stated in relevant part 
the cantonal court exists and hears all cases that are within its jurisdiction.during the period of justice system reforms,the national court was established and the national court can,on request of the parties in a case,decide to hear this case of extradition or any other case if the necessary requirements according to the bosnian criminal procedure code are met.as you were informed,the prosecutor office of bosnia has sent notice that it took the investigation which was previous ly held by the prosecutor office of canton sarajevo.
letter of amra kosovic emphasis added.recognizing that these letters do not elaborate on the relationship between the cantonal court,which originally issued the arrest warrant and demand for investigation against sacirbey,and the national court,which now appears to be seized of jurisdiction over sacirbey case,the government argued that these letters nevertheless demonstrated that a bosnian court would handle sacirbey proceeding upon his extradition,letter of assistant united states attorney anjan sahni.
the district court agreed with the government.explaining that the issue arises because of bosnia change from a civil law to a common law system since the issuance of the original demand against sacirbey,the district court found that the investigative functions which had been vested in bosnia civil law courts were transferred to independent prosecutors at the cantonal and national levels,and a national court system was established,equivalent to the united states federal court system,and a new national criminal code was adopted.sacirbey ii,wl,dist.lexis at.the district court concluded that,by the time the united states government filed the complaint,the investigative office of the cantonal court that had issued the warrant order no longer had any power to enforce it.id.these developments were quite beside the point,in the view of the district court,because a ll that is required is that sacirbey be charged,which he had been at the time his extradition was sought,and continues to be.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
relying on authority from the seventh circuit and a district court in our circuit,the district court observed that t he term charge,in this context,has been interpreted by courts to require something less than a formal charge for example,the requirement has been deemed satisfied where a subject is accused,or the requesting nation intends to prosecute him.id.at,dist.lexis,at quoting in re assarsson,cir assarsson i borodin ashcroft,d,brackets omitted.the district court held that the evidence showed bosnia intent to prosecute sacirbey for abuse of authority.this determination was based on the record developed in the proceedings before judge maas and on the two letters written by kosovic,the bosnian embassy counselor,which demonstrated to the district court a present intent to prosecute sacirbey in the national court of bosnia.sacirbey ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at emphasis added.
the district court also determined that the charged offense,abuse of authority,fell within the treaty enumerated,the offense of embezzlement.see id.at,dist.lexis,at citing art.ii of the treaty.it further held that the requirement of dual criminality,that the alleged conduct constitute a criminal offense in both easily satisfied because there are numerous federal crimes for which sacirbey could have been charged in the united states based on the allegations against him.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the political offense exception set forth in article vi of the treaty did not bar sacirbey extradition,according to the district court,because the exception applied to political political figures,id.at,dist.lexis,at,and the financial misconduct at issue here did not constitute a political offense.accordingly,the district court concluded that the charged offense fell within the scope of the treaty.
turning to the third claim cognizable on habeas review of an extradition order,the district court determined that there was a reasonable basis to believe sacirbey was guilty of the charged offense.the district court listed the evidence against sacirbey 
i there were significant shortfalls in the mission account,over which sacirbey had signature authority ii sacirbey refused to explain certain expenditures to ministry representatives,even though bosnian procedures do not allow for confidential expenditures iii president izetbegovic expressly denied that sacirbey had been authorized to spend bosnian funds on the icj and icty cases iv sacirbey represented that he would be able to restore some of the missing funds,but then failed to do so v he may have evaded the efforts of bosnian authorities to question him about the accounting problems and vi he failed to account properly for personal advances that he had taken against the mission account.

the district court also rejected sacirbey constitutional challenges to the adequacy of the proceedings before magistrate judge maas.first,sacirbey argued that the government refusal to produce evidence relating to the role of united states officials in preparing or pursuing the extradition request violated brady maryland,d.the district court disagreed,explaining that e ven if brady can be said to apply in the extradition context brady would not extend to sacirbey discovery requests because sacirbey requests were directed not at exculpatory evidence,but rather information regarding the political motivations,if any,behind bosnia request for his extradition.sacirbey ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at emphasis in original.second,sacirbey challenged magistrate judge maas refusal to reopen the extradition hearing to allow the submission of a reply declaration in response to an expert declaration submitted by the government.the district court rejected the challenge because sacirbey failed to show prejudice.id.at,dist.lexis,at.third,sacirbey urged the district court to consider the danger and deprivation of due process he would face if extradited to bosnia.citing the rule of into the legal procedures of a country requesting extradition pursuant to a treaty,the district court did not entertain this challenge.id.at,dist.lexis,at see ahmad wigen,cir a consideration of the procedures that will or may occur in the requesting country is not within the purview of a habeas corpus judge.
having made these determinations,the district court denied sacribey habeas corpus petition.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,sacirbey reiterates the arguments that he presented to the district court,including that he was not charged with an extraditable offense under the treaty.this argument presents a question of first impression for our court,requiring us to examine a relatively undeveloped area of law 
standard of review 
the basis for sacirbey petition for habeas corpus is that,by means of the extradition proceedings against him in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,he has been placed in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.c.our review of the denial of a petition for habeas corpus in extradition proceedings is narrow in scope.murphy united states,cir.a reviewing court can consider only three issues whether the judge below had jurisdiction whether the offense charged is extraditable under the relevant treaty and whether the evidence presented by the government established probable cause to extradite.cheung united states,cir see also fernandez,at.
we are not at liberty to second guess the determination of the magistrate judge to issue an order certifying a request for extradition.under our precedents,h abeas corpus is not a writ of error,and it is not a means of rehearing what the extradition judge or magistrate already has decided.ahmad,at accord united states,cir a writ of habeas corpus can not be used to hear for a second time the findings of the court which conducted the initial hearing.as has been said often,habeas corpus can not take the place of a writ of error.
it is nevertheless our duty to ensur e that the applicable provisions of the treaty and the governing american statutes are complied with.ex rel.petrushansky marasco,cir marshall,see also murphy,at the function of habeas review in this context is to test only the legality of the extradition proceedings.internal quotation marks omitted.
with these principles in mind,we review the factual findings of the district court for clear error and its legal determinations de novo.see drake portuondo,cir providing the general standard for review of habeas corpus petitions armstrong guccione,cir reviewing de novo a petitioner legal under his confinement for civil contempt violated the fifth amendment and several federal statutes.
sacirbey was not charged with an extraditable offense under the treaty.
sacirbey argues that he has not been charged with an extraditable offense pursuant to the terms of the treaty on sacirbey reading of the record,the evidence shows that an investigative warrant for his arrest was issued in,but the issuing court was subsequently dissolved,with the consequence that no c ourt in bosnia is currently seized of the matter.appellant br.emphasis in original.in sacirbey view,the putative interest that bosnia asserted in correspondence can not remedy the inadequacy of the warrant that underlies bosnia extradition request.the government responds that the treaty does not condition extradition on formal charges,and all that need be shown is that the requesting nation intends to prosecute the extraditee.appellees br.under the government reading of the record,bosnia has repeatedly and unambiguously indicated its intention to prosecute sacirbey.id.at.as noted above,the district court agreed with the government view of the evidence.relying on precedents construing similar language in other treaties,the district court observed that t he term charge,in this context,has been interpreted by courts to require something less than a formal charge for example,the requirement has been deemed satisfied where a subject is accused,or the requesting nation intend s to prosecute him.sacirbey ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at internal citations omitted.
in one of the cases on which the district court relied,assarsson i,the petitioner argued that because a formal document,called a charge in the swedish criminal code,ha d not yet been filed against him,he could not be extradited.at.the seventh circuit rejected this argument on the grounds that t he filing of formal charges is not stated anywhere in the treaty as a prerequisite to extradition,id.at and courts are not empowered to review compliance with foreign criminal procedure in the course of ordering extradition pursuant to a valid treaty,id.at.the eighth circuit reached the same conclusion in a case involving the brother of the petitioner in assarsson i.in re assarsson,cir assarsson ii.the eighth circuit adopted the seventh circuit holding that,where t he filing of formal charges is not stated anywhere as a prerequisite to extradition,we may not review the magistrate determination that the extraditee was charged under the terms of the treaty.assarsson ii,at quoting assarsson i,at.
the government informs us that the reasoning of assarsson i and assarsson ii,has been adopted by the ninth circuit as well.appellees br.see emami dist.court for the dist.of,cir.like the seventh and eighth circuits,the ninth circuit determined that,where an extradition treaty does not condition extradition on the filing of formal charges,it would not read such a requirement into the treaty.that court explained,we refrain from interpreting the requirements of german criminal procedure with respect to the filing of a public charge both out of respect for german sovereignty and because we recognize the chance of erroneous interpretation is much greater when we try to construe the law of a country whose legal system is not based on common law principles.id.at 
similar arguments have been rejected by other courts,including district courts in this circuit.these courts have also addressed the question of how to establish that a crime has been charged for the purposes of an extradition treaty,holding that a demonstrated intent to prosecute on the part of the country requesting extradition is sufficient.see borodin ashcroft,d,american courts can not become enmeshed in the technicalities of foreign criminal processes,and the charge requirement is satisfied by a requesting nation intent to prosecute as evidenced by the record.emphasis added in re la salvia,cr.misc,wl,dist.lexis,at,t he reference to persons charged in the treaty is a generic term referring to those persons whose extradition is sought so that they may be brought to trial.emphasis added in re extradition of lehming,s ufficient evidence of an intent to prosecute exists making extradition proper under these circumstances.emphasis added.
the government interprets these precedents to stand for the following proposition when extradition treaties state that an individual must be charged with a crime in order to be extradited,but do not require the filing of an accusatory instrument,a state seeking extradition need show only an intent to prosecute the individual in order to satisfy the requirement that he be charged with a crime.this proposition appears reasonable insofar as it gives meaning to treaty language stating that an individual must be charged with an offense in order to be extradited,while avoiding unwarranted incursions into the fine details of foreign criminal procedure.see,jhirad ferrandina,cir it is not the business of our courts to assume the responsibility for supervising the integrity of the judicial system of another sovereign nation.such an assumption would directly conflict with the principle of comity upon which extradition is based.applying that teaching to this case,the government urges us to conclude that,because the treaty requires that an individual be charged with a crime but does not require that formal charges be brought,a clear intent to prosecute is sufficient to satisfy the terms of the treaty.appellees br.
sacirbey responds that one additional proposition follows from the cases cited by the district court and the government that there at least be a judicial body in the requesting state seized of the matter,to which the extraditee can petition for relief.appellant reply br.sacirbey observes that,in all of these cases,an instituted judicial proceeding,id.was underway in the requesting country.see emami,at bochum local court in germany assarsson ii,at malmo district court in sweden assarsson i,at malmo district court in sweden borodin,d at proceedings before a swiss examining magistrate in re extradition of lehming.at saarbrucken district court in germany in re la salvia,wl,at,dist.lexis,at federal court of first instance in penal and correctional matters in argentina.based on this observation,sacirbey argues that the treaty should be read to require a showing of t he presence of a judicial authority conducting proceedings toward prosecution of the potential extraditee.appellant br.in the absence of such a requirement,sacirbey fears that an extraditee may be handed over to political officers of a foreign country for arbitrary and potentially brutal prosecution.id.at.he urges us to conclude that,because no existing c ourt has issued a warrant for his arrest or assumed responsibility for his prosecution or protection,he has not been charged with a crime under the treaty.appellant reply br.
we appreciate the force of sacirbey concerns.indeed,he may be right that extradition treaties should contain provisions ensuring that a judicial body in the requesting country stand ready to ensure procedural regularity upon the transfer of custody over the accused.whether or not the united states should condition the extradition of its own such safeguards is not,however,a question over which this court has jurisdiction.t he question of the wisdom of extradition remains for the executive branch to decide.murphy,at internal quotation marks omitted.our power,by contrast,is limited to ensuring that the applicable provisions of the treaty and the governing american statutes are complied with.petrushansky,at.
in keeping with that limited authority,we examine the requirements of the extradition treaty in this case.in construing a treaty,as in construing a statute,we first look to its terms to determine its meaning.united states,d see also kahn lucas lancaster lark int l,cir treaties are construed in much the same manner as statutes,and their interpretation must account for the full text,language as well as punctuation,structure and subject matter.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.a basic canon of statutory interpretation,which is equally applicable to interpreting treaties,is to avoid readings that render statutory language surplusage or redundant.filler hanvit bank,cir restatement second of contracts a a n interpretation which gives a reasonable,lawful,and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable,unlawful,or of no effect.in addition,we have observed that the meaning of one term may be determined by reference to the terms it is associated with,and that where specific words follow a general word,the specific words restrict application of the general term to things that are similar to those enumerated.city of new york beretta,cir brackets and internal quotation marks omitted restatement second of contracts c s pecific terms and exact terms are given greater weight than general language.
in the instant case,our review focuses on whether the offense charged is extraditable under the relevant treaty.cheung,at emphasis added.article i of the treaty sets forth a foundational principle that the states parties mutually agree to deliver up persons who hav e been charged with or convicted of any of the crimes and offenses emphasis added,which are supplied in article ii.the remaining articles of the treaty define the contours of the broad agreement in article i,including certain limitations on the breadth of the term charged.most important to the instant case,article iii of the treaty imposes a requirement that when a fugitive is merely charged with crime,a duly authenticated copy of the warrant of arrest in the country where the crime has been committed,and of the depositions or other evidence upon which such warrant was issued,shall be produced.treaty art.iii emphases added.in other words,the warrant of arrest is a formal legal instrument that is required by the treaty to show that a person has been charged with an extraditable crime.see art.iv describing the article iii warrant requirement as a presentation of formal proofs emphasis added.accordingly,we interpret these provisions to mean that the proof required under the treaty to establish that an individual has been charged with a crime is a valid arrest warrant and the evidence submitted in order to obtain that warrant.any other reading would ignore the express terms of article iii.filler,at stating that courts should avoid readings that render statutory language surplusage.
under this construction of the treaty,bosnia can satisfy the requirement that sacirbey be charged with a crime only if it can provide,inter alia,a valid warrant for his arrest.bosnia seeks the extradition of sacirbey pursuant to an international arrest warrant issued by the cantonal court in sarajevo.however,as the district court found,the cantonal court currently lacks jurisdiction over the investigation of sacirbey alleged crimes and no longer ha s any power to enforce the arrest warrant.sacirbey ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at such a issued by a court lacking jurisdiction to enforce been described in another context by the supreme court as a dead letter.united states,d rejecting an argument that a warrant issued by a magistrate in the united states would have force in mexico see also in re terrorist bombings of embassies in,cir describing the power conferred by a valid search warrant.the arrest warrant for sacirbey was never otherwise a bosnian court with jurisdiction over this case accordingly,the existence of this arrest by a court ousted of jurisdiction and no longer able to enforce satisfy the treaty requirement that bosnia demonstrate a charge by producing a valid arrest warrant.
consistent with its interpretation of the precedents discussed above,the government maintains that the defect in bosnia application can be remedied by official statements indicating bosnia intent to prosecute sacirbey for his alleged crimes.the government points to letters from various bosnian officials that allegedly show an intention to prosecute sacirbey,but proof of such an intention is not what the treaty requires even if it did,these letters are equivocal,at best,on the question of whether bosnian authorities intend to prosecute sacirbey for his alleged crimes.the letter dated october,from assistant united states attorney danya perry to magistrate judge mass states t he cantonal prosecutor,mustafa bisic,confirmed that there is an ongoing criminal investigation against sacirbey and that the bosnian government sought extradition to further that investigation.the virtually illegible attachment to the october letter also refers to an investigation against sacirbey but does not indicate an intention to prosecute,rather than merely investigate,him.id.at.
the letters from amra kosovic,counselor to the bosnian embassy in washington dc,similarly confirm only that sacirbey is under investigation in bosnia,not that the bosnian government seeks to prosecute him.her letter of october,states ambiguously that the court of bosnia and herzegovina will proceed in the matter of mohamed sacirbegovic if the request for extradition would be approved.id.at.this statement does not hint at how the bosnian court will is,whether by immediate prosecution or by permitting the prosecutor to undertake further investigation.kosovic letter of november,does nothing to clarify the matter.in that letter,she states that the cantonal one that issued the warrant and demand for investigation of muhamed not abolished by the justice system reforms,and she confirms that the court exists and hears all cases that are within its jurisdiction.of course,we know that sacirbey case is no longer within that court jurisdiction pursuant to bosnia judicial reforms.sacirbey ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.perhaps recognizing this fact,the letter notes that the court of bosnia and herzegovina was established and can,on request of the parties in a case,decide to hear this case of extradition.emphasis added.contradicting this conditional statement regarding the bosnian court jurisdiction,kosovic reiterates,verbatim from her earlier letter,that t he court of bosnia and herzegovina will proceed in the matter of mohamed sacirbegovic if the request for extradition would be approved.id.emphasis added.in addition,she observes that the prosecutor office of bosnia and herzegovina took the investigation which was previously held by the prosecutor office of the canton sarajevo.id.again,the letter is devoid of any statement that sacirbey is sought for prosecution in bosnia 
that nothing more than a criminal investigation of sacirbey is now pending in bosnia finds further support in a letter,dated march,from the cantonal court in sarajevo stating that no indictment against sacirbey has been brought before the municipal court sarajevo or the cantonal court in sarajevo.id.at.this letter states that the criminal investigation against him was referred to the cantonal prosecutor office sarajevo on for appropriate action.id.while formal charges are not required to grant an extradition request,this letter corroborates that an investigation of sacirbey in the prosecutor than a prosecution in court is pending in bosnia.based on our review of this evidence,we are dubious that bosnia seeks to prosecute sacirbey for a crime 
in any event,whether bosnia has an intent to prosecute sacirbey is not the relevant inquiry.as explained above,the treaty requires a valid arrest warrant as proof that an individual sought for extradition has been charged with a crime.that requirement is not satisfied by a demonstration of intent to prosecute.the necessary showing has not been made in this case.all of the formal charges cases cited by the government indicate the existence of a valid arrest warrant issued by a foreign tribunal.see emami,at arrest warrant issued by a german court assarsson ii,at arrest declaration issued by swedish court assarsson i,at arrest declaration issued by swedish court borodin,d at arrest warrant issued by swiss magistrate in re extradition of lehming.at arrest warrant issued by a german court in re la salvia,wl,at,dist.lexis,at arrest warrant issued by argentina court.none of those cases involve a situation where the issuing tribunal subsequently lost jurisdiction over the case owing to a constitutional reorganization,regime change,or any other reason,such that the arrest warrant was no longer valid.
because the record contains no evidence of a valid warrant authorizing the arrest of sacirbey,sacirbey has not been charged with an extraditable offense pursuant to the terms of the treaty.this defect falls within the narrow category of issues that is cognizable on habeas review of an extradition order,see cheung,at,and we therefore grant sacirbey petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we conclude that sacirbey has not been charged with an extraditable offense pursuant to the terms of the extradition treaty between the united states and bosnia.he is therefore entitled to habeas relief.
we also note,in passing,that,if bosnia renews its request to extradite sacirbey,the department of state is authorized by the extradition treaty and by statute to refrain from extraditing sacirbey because he is a citizen of the united states.an exercise of that discretion might be warranted if bosnia renews its extradition request and the department of state determines that the investigation into sacirbey tenure as united nations ambassador is motivated by a political vendetta,or that sacirbey faces mistreatment if he is delivered into bosnian custody,or for any of the other grounds available to the department to decline,indeed,for no reason at all,as the treaty does not require any justification for declining to extradite citizens.see treaty for mutual extradition of fugitives from justice,art.v,date of ratification by the president,stat,bevans neither of the high contracting parties shall be bound to deliver up its own citizens or subjects under the stipulations of this treaty.that determination rests,of course,with the executive branch of government,not the judiciary.
accordingly,the order of the district court denying the petition is reversed,and sacirbey petition for a writ of habeas corpus is hereby granted.the restrictions imposed on sacirbey liberty are vacated and he shall not be extradited to bosnia pursuant to the formal requests that have been made.
it is so ordered.
i respectfully dissent from the majority decision to overturn the district court denial of the habeas corpus petition of muhamed sacirbey,which sought to forbid his extradition from the united states to the republic of bosnia and herzegovina hereinafter generally bosnia.extradition was requested by bosnia in on the ground that sacirbey,while serving as its ambassador to the united nations,abused his official position by misappropriating in official bosnian funds to his own private account.there is no dispute that embezzlement by a public official is a criminal offense for which a person who is so charged or convicted may be extradited pursuant to the treaty between bosnia,as a successor to the kingdom of serbia,and the united states,see treaty for the mutual extradition of fugitives from justice,art.i,stat.treaty the parties mutually agree to deliver up persons who have been charged with or convicted of any of the crimes and offenses specified in the following article id.art.ii,para.extradition shall be granted for embezzlement by public officers.nor do sacirbey and the majority appear to suggest that it is not within the competence and authority of the court of bosnia and herzegovina the national court or court to adjudicate such a charge of embezzlement and the majority recognizes that under the treaty,formal charges are not required to grant an extradition request,majority opinion ante at.
the majority,however,concludes that sacirbey is not charged with any the majority finds a that the arrest warrant at issue in this case was issued by a court that neither has jurisdiction over the matter nor authority to enforce the warrant,majority opinion ante at,and that a warrant issued by a court lacking jurisdiction to enforce it is a nullity,id.at and b that the representation by bosnia ministry of justice that the court of bosnia and herzegovina will proceed in the matter of muhamed sacirbe y letters from amra kosovic,counselor in the embassy of bosnia and herzegovina in washington,to the united states department of state and the united states department of justice dated october,october bosnian embassy letter,and november,november bosnian embassy letter collectively the bosnian embassy letters,leaves the majority dubious that bosnia seeks to prosecute sacirbey for a crime,id.at emphasis added,because,the majority says,t his statement does not hint at how the bosnian court will is whether by immediate prosecution or by permitting the prosecutor to undertake further investigation,id.at emphasis in original.i disagree with the majority rationales.i discuss them in reverse order.
the notion that the bosnian court intends merely to permit investigation 
the majority speculation that the bosnian national court may intend merely to permit further investigation of sacirbey,rather than to entertain his prosecution,is belied by the course of the prior proceedings in bosnia and by the provisions of the criminal procedure code of bosnia and herzegovina bosnia cpc or cpc,adopted in as part of nationwide judicial reforms.in,bosnia operated under a system in which investigations of possible criminal acts were conducted by regional courts in bosnia cantons.in april,the sarajevo cantonal prosecutor office asked the sarajevo cantonal court to investigate allegations that sacirbey had abused his official position by misappropriating public funds.in august,the cantonal court issued a decision to investigate sacirbey,based on a suspicion that during his tenure as bosnia ambassador to the united nations,sacirbey abused his official position by,inter alia,transferring various specified sums of bosnian united nations mission money,totaling,to his own private accounts.in december,the cantonal court issued a decision for detention and a warrant for the arrest of sacirbey,the former ambassador of bosnia at the permanent mission of bosnia with the un,because there is a suspicion that he committed the criminal act of abuse of official position or authority.in january,bosnia submitted to the united states a request for sacirbey extradition.
in,bosnia converted from the system to a system,and investigative functions that had been vested in the courts were transferred to independent prosecutors.in august,the sarajevo cantonal court transferred the sacirbey matter to the sarajevo cantonal prosecutor office for appropriate action.the bosnian court reforms also included the establishment of the national court,which serves functions similar to those of the federal courts in the united states.because sacirbey was alleged to have abused his position as a representative of the bosnian nation,the sacirbey investigation,which had been transferred by the sarajevo cantonal court to the sarajevo cantonal prosecutor,was then transferred from the cantonal prosecutor to the office of the national prosecutor.
the majority notion that the bosnian ministry of justice representation that the bosnian national court will proceed in sacirbey case bosnian embassy letters means that the court may merely conduct or permit further investigation,majority opinion ante at,is belied by the facts that,pursuant to bosnia judicial reforms,the investigation of sacirbey had already been transferred from court to independent prosecutor,and under the bosnia cpc,adopted in as part of the judicial reforms,the court plays no role in investigations.the provisions of the cpc set forth the rules of the criminal procedure that are mandatory for the proceedings of the national court and the conduct of criminal matters by the national prosecutor.bosnia cpc.under the cpc,t he term investigation refers to all activities,including collection and preservation of information and evidence,undertaken by the prosecutor or by authorized officials in accordance with this code,id.j.a uthorized official s are defined as various law enforcement personnel such as members of the state border service,military police,and police bodies of the responsible ministries of the bosnian regions,id.g those officials are supervised by the prosecutor,see id.all of the investigative procedure s set forth in the cpc describe powers and duties of the prosecutor and the officials he or she supervises.see id.there are no cpc provisions placing investigative functions,or the supervision of such functions,in the courts.the investigative procedures section of the cpc begins by stating that public officials are bound to,and private citizens are entitled to,report the commission of a criminal offense,id,and that t he report must be filed with the prosecutor,id.emphasis added.further clarifying that investigations are within the sole province of the prosecutor,not the court,the cpc provides that 
i f the report of suspected criminal conduct is filed with the court,authorized official or some other court or prosecutor in bosnia and herzegovina,they shall accept the report and shall immediately submit the report to the prosecutor.
id.emphasis added.there is no provision giving the court authority to say whether or not an investigation may be pursued.
i thus see no principled reason to infer that the bosnian ministry of justice statement that the national court will proceed in sacirbey case means that the court may merely permit the prosecutor to undertake further investigation,majority opinion ante at.and surely it disserves the interests of international comity for a court of the united states to forbid extradition on the basis of a mere suspicion that the national court of the requesting nation intends to proceed in a manner not authorized by that nation criminal procedure code.
in contrast to the dubiety expressed here by the majority,the district court found that the evidence,including the bosnian embassy letters,demonstrates that bosnia intends to prosecute sacirbey for the offense of abuse of authority.sacirbey guccione,cv,wl,at,see also id.the letters plainly indicate a present intent to prosecute sacirbey in the national court.while the effectuation of that intent is conditioned on sacirbey extradition,the intent nevertheless presently exists.emphasis in original.i can not view the district court finding that bosnia intends to prosecute sacirbey as clearly erroneous.it is supported not only by the bosnian embassy letters,but also by a the fact that the sacirbey matter,including the sarajevo cantonal court finding of a wellfounded suspicion that sacirbey misappropriated in bosnian funds,was transferred to the office of the national prosecutor,and b the cpc provision that if there is evidence that a criminal offense has been committed,the national prosecutor,unless otherwise stated by the cpc,is obligated to initiate a prosecution,bosnia cpc emphasis added.
the majority view that the arrest warrant is a nullity 
the majority also reasons that,although the sarajevo cantonal court issued a warrant for sacirbey arrest in,the fact that that court no longer has jurisdiction to enforce the warrant makes the warrant a dead letter,majority opinion ante at,quoting united states,d an opinion that observed that a warrant issued by a magistrate in the united states would have no force outside the united states,id.at.i do not see the applicability of that to a warrant potential extraterritorial the circumstances here,which involve changes in institutional functions resulting from court reforms within a single country.
further,the majority apparently assumes that the bosnian court reforms automatically divested the sarajevo cantonal court of jurisdiction to entertain a prosecution of sacirbey and assumes that a loss of jurisdiction in the cantonal court means that no court has jurisdiction.in my view,neither assumption is correct.although i agree that the sarajevo cantonal court no longer has jurisdiction,it appears to me,given the provisions of the bosnia cpc,that the divesture of jurisdiction was not automatic but instead results from the decision of the bosnian national court to take the case.i see no the majority does not a nation court reforms can not entail the transfer of cases from one court to another and it appears that the bosnia reforms envision the retention of jurisdiction by the cantonal courts in some cases and the transfer to the national court of other cases of which the national court wishes to take jurisdiction.the cpc provides that 
c ases falling within the competence of the national court which are pending before other courts or prosecutor offices and in which the indictment is not legally effective or confirmed,shall be finalized by these courts unless the national court,ex officio or upon the reasoned proposal of the parties or defense attorney,decide to take such a case.
cpc emphases added.i read shall be finalized by these courts to mean that even the sarajevo cantonal court could have proceeded to adjudicate sacirbey case if the national court had not decided to take the case.and i read the unless the court ex officio clause to mean that the national court is entitled,simply by virtue of being the national court,to take jurisdiction of the case.this interpretation is consistent with that of the bosnian ministry of justice,which is bosnia central body for ensuring legislative and justice system harmony and best practice,law on ministries and other bodies of administration of bosnia and herzegovina.the ministry of justice is identified in the november bosnian embassy letter as the source of the information a that the national court can hear sacirbey case pursuant to cpc,and b that if the united states grants extradition of sacirbey,the national court will proceed.thus,while i agree with the majority that the sarajevo cantonal court no longer has the power to proceed in the matter of sacirbey,i reach that conclusion because the bosnia national court has decided to take the case.i do not agree with the majority that extradition should be denied on the theory that,rather than having been transferred to the national court,the original warrant for sacirbey arrest has become a dead letter,majority opinion ante at internal quotation marks omitted.
replies to the majority objections to this dissent 
in response to this dissent,the majority makes several assertions that i find untenable unpersuasive.for example,it asserts that the cantonal court was dissolved,majority opinion ante at.that contention was advanced in the district court by sacirbey,but it was explicitly contradicted by the bosnian government 
the ministry of justice of bosnia and herzegovina can not accept the statement that the cantonal one that issued the warrant and demand for investigation of sacirbey was abolished by the justice system reforms.the mentioned court exists and hears all cases that are within its jurisdiction.
november bosnian embassy letter.
in addition,the majority states that no bosnian authority has provided a clear statement as to whether there is a prosecution now pending in a bosnian court,majority opinion ante at first emphasis in original second emphasis mine.i can not see that this provides a basis for requiring the district court to forbid extradition the majority itself acknowledges that,under the treaty,formal charges are not required to grant an extradition request,id.at.
as to the majority further suggestion that there is no evidence that the original warrant for sacirbey arrest was transferred to the national court,majority opinion ante at,i see nothing in the record to indicate that the arrest warrant was not transferred as part of the transfer of the case.further,even if the warrant was not transferred,there is nothing in the record to indicate that the warrant is not still extant,given to the majority notion that the cantonal court was dissolved,majority opinion ante at bosnian ministry of justice says that the cantonal court was not abolished and still exists november bosnian embassy letter.i thus do not see the validity of the majority holding that there is no valid arrest warrant in the present case a s a matter of law,id.at.
finally,the majority finds that bosnia representation that the bosnia national court will proceed is ambiguous,majority opinion ante at,as the majority believes this may mean that that court will merely permit the prosecutor to undertake further investigation,id.at,and i t is that ambiguity which makes the majority unable to derive from the bosnian embassy letters an active intent to prosecute,id.at.i have three major difficulties with this aspect of the majority opinion.first,as discussed above,i do not see any provision in the bosnia cpc giving the national court author
