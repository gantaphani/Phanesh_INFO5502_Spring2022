in a matter of first impression before this court,zuriel lavie lavie,an israeli bankruptcy receiver,appeals the district court denial of his petition for recognition under chapter of the bankruptcy code of an ongoing,involuntary bankruptcy proceeding pending in israel,for debtor yuval ran ran.in particular,the petition sought recognition of the israeli bankruptcy proceeding as a foreign main or nonmain proceeding.if granted,that recognition would have entitled lavie to the protections of a variety of bankruptcy code provisions.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the district court denial of lavie petition for recognition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
factual and procedural background 
ran was a israeli businessman and promoter when he encountered financial difficulties in the late.in fact,he was a director or shareholder in almost one hundred israeli companies,some of them.the largest company in which ran had a controlling interest was israel credit lines supplementary financial services credit lines,a public company that was by ran and for which he served as ceo.credit lines raised millions of dollars from investors and owned interests in numerous other companies.it is now in liquidation through an israeli bankruptcy proceeding,and its receiver has asserted claims against ran for millions of dollars in damages.on june,an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding was commenced against ran,in the israeli district court of tel.lavie was initially appointed as temporary receiver of ran assets and later,on november,lavie was appointed permanent receiver.
in april,before the involuntary bankruptcy proceeding was commenced,ran left israel and has never returned.after leaving,ran moved to houston,texas,in may or june of,where he and his family have since resided continuously.ran wife and five children are united states citizens,and ran is a legal permanent resident of the united states and is currently seeking united states citizenship.ran and his wife own a home in houston and are both employees of a furniture company in the area.after leaving israel,ran temporarily assisted in collecting debts owed to credit lines,but ceased doing so when receivership and liquidation proceedings began for credit lines in.currently,ran carries out no business activity in israel,and has not done so since.
on december,nearly a decade after ran and his family emigrated from israel and more than eight years after being appointed receiver of ran estate,lavie filed a petition seeking recognition of the israeli bankruptcy proceeding as a foreign main or nonmain proceeding under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas.on may,the bankruptcy court denied the petition.the bankruptcy court order was the subject of two appeals to the district court,the first resulting in a remand for additional findings and the second resulting in an order affirming the denial of lavie petition for recognition.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court affirmance of a bankruptcy court decision by applying the same standard of review to the bankruptcy court decision that the district court applied.in re martinez,cir.we thus generally review factual findings for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.id.at quoting in re oca,cir internal quotation marks omitted.while a determination of whether ran bankruptcy proceeding is a foreign main or nonmain proceeding is inherently a inquiry,the facts in this case are not in dispute and the appeal to the district court was de novo,as is the appeal to this court.see,in re belsome,cir see also,william schrag,william heuer,robert cortes,insolvencies and chapter recent case law determining whether a foreign proceeding is main or nonmain or neither,bankr.prac,art.noting that t he determination of whether a foreign proceeding is main or nonmain is.
chapter framework 
the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa enacted chapter of the bankruptcy code,so as to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with cases of insolvency.a.it replaced former section of the bankruptcy code and incorporate s the model law on insolvency drafted by uncitral,the united nations commission on international trade law,which in turn,is based upon the european union convention on insolvency proceedings the eu convention.see a et see also in re exch.the statutory intent to conform american law with international law is explicit in the text of section a,and also is expressed in section,which states that i n interpreting this chapter,the court shall consider its international origin,and the need to promote an application of this chapter that is consistent with the application of similar statutes adopted by foreign jurisdictions.see also house report on the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,pt.i,at,reprinted in,chapter incorporates the model law on insolvency to encourage cooperation between the united states and foreign countries with respect to transnational insolvency cases hereinafter house report alan resnick henry sommer,collier on bankruptcy ed.explaining the basis for chapter.

such foreign proceeding for which recognition is sought is a foreign main proceeding or foreign nonmain proceeding within the meaning of section 
the foreign representative applying for recognition is a person or body and 
the petition meets the requirements of section.

this statutory mandate is subject to a narrow public policy exception which permits a court to refuse recognition if the action would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the united states.but,the exception is intended to be invoked only under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the united states.see in re iida,cir.in re atlas shipping,in re ernst young.nevertheless,recognition under section of the bankruptcy code is not a rubber stamp exercise.in re basis yield alpha fund master.even in the absence of an objection,courts must undertake their own jurisdictional analysis and grant or deny recognition under chapter as the facts of each case warrant.see in re bear stearns structured credit strategies master fund.the ultimate burden of proof on the requirements of recognition is on the foreign representative.see id.at.
although listed as the third element,the first requirement for recognition under section is purely procedural in nature that is,the petition must meet the pleading requirements of section.see a.section establishes several pleading requirements.first,it requires that the foreign representative has filed a petition for recognition.id.a.second,section requires the petitioner to establish that a foreign proceeding exists,and that the petitioner has been appointed as the foreign representative.id.b.the first two paragraphs of this subsection provide for what constitutes sufficient evidence,and specify that the petitioner may satisfy this requirement by providing a certified copy of the decision commencing such foreign proceeding and appointing the foreign representative and a certificate from the foreign court affirming the existence of the foreign proceeding and the appointment of the foreign representative.id.third,section requires that the petition for recognition must be accompanied by a statement identifying all foreign proceedings with respect to the debtor that are known to the foreign representative.id.c.lavie has satisfied all of these procedural requirements.thus,section a has been satisfied.lavie has also met the requirements of the second element of section a because the foreign representative applying for recognition is a person or body.id.a.
because the second and third requirements set forth in section a are indisputably met,the only substantive issue before the court becomes the first delineated requirement of section a whether the foreign proceeding for which recognition is sought,here ran ongoing,involuntary bankruptcy proceeding pending in israeli,is a foreign main or nonmain proceeding.if the foreign proceeding is neither then it is simply ineligible for recognition under chapter.see in re bear stearns,at see also in re sphinx,aff.
determining status as a foreign main proceeding 
a foreign main proceeding is a foreign proceeding pending in the country where the debtor has the center of its main interest.emphasis added.the phrase center of main interest comi is a term of art,which the bankruptcy code does not define explicitly.chapter,however,does provide that i n the absence of evidence to the contrary,the debtor registered office,or habitual residence in the case of an individual,is presumed to be the center of the debtor main interests.id.c.this presumption can be rebutted by evidence to the contrary.see in re exch,at.thus,to determine where ran presumptive comi lies,we must determine the location of his habitual residence and then determine if any evidence to the contrary was presented by lavie to rebut the presumption that ran habitual residence is his comi.if so,our inquiry does not end and we must consider all evidence to determine the location of ran comi.
the code does not define habitual residence,but it has been analyzed recently by foreign courts as virtually identical to the more commonly used,at least in the united states,concept of domicile.under our law,domicile is established by physical presence in a location coupled with an intent to remain there indefinitely.texas florida.one acquires a domicile of origin at birth,and that domicile continues until a new one a domicile of choice is acquired.mississippi band of choctaw indians holyfield.to defeat the presumption of continuing domicile and establish a new domicile,an individual must demonstrate residence in a new state and an intention to remain in that state indefinitely.acridge evangelical lutheran good samaritan soc y,cir.similarly,according to foreign courts,the existence of a habitual residence largely depends on whether the debtor intends to stay in the location permanently.see,pinna caisse allocations familiales de la savoie,ecj france.other factors pertinent to a finding of an individual habitual residence include the length of time spent in the location the occupational or familial ties to the area and the location of the individual regular activities,jobs,assets,investments,clubs,unions,and institutions of which he is a member.see,see also george rosenberg,israeli tax reform,int l tax,wl at april geveran trading skjevesland,wl ch.bankruptcy eng.israel doran tal golan,aging,globalization,and the legal construction of residence the case of old age pensions in israel,elder.
here,it is evident that when lavie filed the petition for recognition,ran habitual residence was in houston,texas.our conclusion is supported by our review of the record which reveals that ran left israel nearly a decade prior to the filing of the petition,has no intent to return,and has established employment and a permanent residence in houston.ran is a legal permanent resident of the united states and his children are united states citizens.and the record also reflects that ran maintains his finances exclusively in texas.the totality of the circumstances before us indicates that the united states is ran habitual residence and thus his presumptive comi.
before the district court,lavie introduced evidence to rebut the presumption that ran comi is located in the united states.because of this,we can not rely solely upon section c presumption.instead,in order to determine ran comi we must consider all evidence,while keeping in mind that it is lavie burden to persuade the court by a preponderance of the evidence that ran comi is in israel.see in re bear stearns,at see also fed.evid.explaining that a party rebuttal of a presumption does not shift the burden of proof rather,the risk of nonpersuasion remains upon the party on whom it was originally this case,ran in re exch,at discussing the c presumption schaflein comm of the european,case ecr ecj chamber noting that although an individual habitual residence is presumed to be his comi,this presumption is not outcome determinative if other evidence suggests the debtor comi is elsewhere see also guide to enactment of the uncitral model law on insolvency noting that the presumption does not prevent,in accordance with applicable procedural law,calling for or assessing other evidence if the conclusion suggested by the presumption is called into question by the court or an interested party.
neither chapter nor the model law on insolvency describes the factors that may be relevant to a determination of the debtor comi in a case where it is disputed.but,the sphinx court suggested the following list of factors to be considered when a debtor comi is in dispute 
various factors,singly or combined,could be relevant to such a determination the location of the debtor headquarters the location of those who actually manage the debtor which,conceivably could be the headquarters of a holding company the location of the debtor primary assets the location of the majority of the debtor creditors or a majority of the creditors who would be affected the case the jurisdiction whose law would apply to most disputes.
at,aff.in sphinx the court was concerned with the comi of a debtor corporation.it noted that in the absence of evidence to the contrary,the comi of a corporation is presumed to be the place of its registered office which it equated with the corporation principal place of business.id.at.considering the above listed factors,the court then determined that the statutory presumption regarding comi had been overcome and that the debtor corporation comi was not the place of its registered office.id.
while the factors set forth in sphinx offer a useful analytical framework to determine the disputed comi of a corporate debtor,the relevant factors to determine the disputed comi in the case of an individual debtor who has no registered office,headquarters,or holding company may be somewhat different.nevertheless,in in re loy,the only case to address the concept of comi with respect to an individual debtor,the court noted that factors such as the location of a debtor primary assets the location of the majority of the debtor creditors and the jurisdiction whose law would apply to most disputes,may be used to determine an individual debtor comi when there exists a serious dispute.in other words,the loy court considered factors which are normally applied to the determination of a corporate debtor comi in order to determine the disputed comi of an individual debtor.after weighing the evidence before it concerning each factor,the bankruptcy court concluded that loy comi was england.id.
the applicability vel non of the sphinx factors to the determination of the disputed comi of an individual debtor is an argument that we need not address today.even assuming arguendo their applicability to the instant case our review of the record reveals that lavie evidence,while sufficient to rebut the presumption that ran comi was in the united states,was nevertheless insufficient to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that israel is the location of ran center of main interests.
lavie proffered the following evidence before the district court to establish that ran center of main interests lies in israel ran creditors are located in israel ran principal assets are being administered in bankruptcy pending in israel and ran bankruptcy proceedings initiated in israel and would be governed by israeli law.these factors,however,when weighed against the following ran along with his family left israel nearly a decade prior to the filing of the petition ran has no intent to return to israel ran has established employment and a residence in houston,texas ran is a permanent legal resident of th
