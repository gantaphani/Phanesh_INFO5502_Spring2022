this appeal arises from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york paul gardephe,judge that denied a motion to dismiss filed by the republic of argentina argentina.in that motion,argentina sought dismissal,on,inter alia,foreign sovereign immunity grounds,of a petition to confirm an arbitration award filed by blue ridge investments,blue ridge.because the denial of argentina motion to dismiss is an interlocutory order,we must first decide whether,and to what extent,we have jurisdiction to consider the issues raised in this appeal.
argentina asserts that we have jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to consider whether the district court erred in concluding that argentina had waived its foreign sovereign immunity and we should exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction to consider whether the district court erred in concluding that blue ridge,as an assignee,could state a claim to confirm the underlying award of the international centre for the settlement of investment disputes icsid.we conclude that we do have jurisdiction to consider the district court foreign sovereign immunity decision pursuant to the collateral order doctrine,but we decline to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the district court decision that blue ridge could state a claim to confirm the icsid award because that issue is not inextricably intertwined with the foreign sovereign immunity decision.see swint chambers cnty.comm n,d.
because our appellate jurisdiction is limited to reviewing the district court foreign sovereign immunity decision,we reach the merits of that issue only and hold that the district court correctly found that argentina waived its immunity from suit under two exceptions to the foreign sovereign immunities act the implied waiver exception,described a and the arbitral award exception,described in a 
accordingly,we affirm the september,order of the district court insofar as it concluded that argentina waived its foreign sovereign immunity,and we remand the cause to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a.the underlying dispute 
the following facts are drawn from the written may,arbitration award of the icsid and,unless otherwise noted,are undisputed by the parties.
in,argentina undertook several economic reforms,including the privatization of several industries.one of those industries was the gas transportation industry.a consequence of this privatization was that gas del estado,a entity,was divided into two gas transportation companies and eight gas distribution companies one of the new gas transportation companies was transportadora de gas del norte tgn.in,investment in tgn as well as in the other companies was opened to investors.as relevant to this case,cms gas transmission company cms purchased shares of tgn from the argentine government in,acquiring a ownership interest in tgn 
pursuant to the legislation and regulations enacted during this period of privatization in argentina,licensees of public utilities,like tgn,were able to adjust gas tariffs every six months in accordance with the united states producer price index.joint app x.but in late,following argentina economic crisis of the late the argentine government called a meeting with representatives of the gas companies in order to discuss a temporary suspension of the united states producer price index adjustment on gas tariffs.id.at.although the gas companies agreed to a temporary suspension of the adjustment of gas tariffs for a period of six months,the agreement reached with the argentine government provided that the costs of the deferral of the adjustment date would be recouped within a year id.the argentine government did not indemnify the losses,however,and instead froze the united states producer price index adjustment of gas tariffs indefinitely.argentina ultimately terminated the rights of licensees of public utilities to adjust tariffs at all.
on july,cms initiated arbitration before an icsid tribunal to recover the income lost by the decrease in gas tariff revenue following argentina suspension of the adjustment of gas tariffs.in particular,cms asserted that argentina had breached its obligations to cms as a investor in argentina,including the obligation to accord it fair and equitable treatment.see treaty concerning the reciprocal encouragement and protection of investment,treaty doc.hereinafter,treaty.the treaty holds argentina to certain standards of conduct toward investors and provides for the resolution of certain disputes between investors and argentina through arbitration administered by the icsid.
on may,the icsid tribunal entered an award in favor of cms,requiring argentina to pay compensation in the amount of million plus interest the award.in particular,the icsid tribunal found that argentina breached its obligations to accord cms the fair and equitable treatment guaranteed in article ii a of the bilateral investment treaty and to observe the obligations entered into with regard to the investment guaranteed in article ii c of the treaty.joint app x.on september,argentina sought to have the award annulled,but the icsid annulment committee rejected argentina application and instead confirmed the award.
b.the initial district court proceedings 
in march,cms filed a petition to enforce foreign arbitral award in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,and sought to attach certain argentine assets.the proceedings took place before judge loretta preska.during the course of that proceeding,judge preska determined that cms had not identified the assets it sought to attach with the specificity required by the fsia.as a result of that ruling,cms filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a a i 
in june,blue ridge notified argentina that it had purchased cms interest in the award and,on march,it filed a petition to confirm the award in the southern district of new york.the case was assigned to judge gerard lynch.in,blue ridge informed judge lynch chambers that it did not intend to move forward with the confirmation proceeding at that time,and wished to withdraw its petition without prejudice.on august,judge lynch,noting that the parties stated they had reached a settlement in principle,issued a order,which stated that this action is dismissed without costs and without prejudice to restoring the action to the court calendar,provided the application to restore the action is made within thirty days.
c.the present confirmation petition 
on january,blue ridge filed the present petition to confirm the award pursuant to article of the convention on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states,the icsid convention.argentina then moved to dismiss the petition on several grounds,arguing that it was immune from suit pursuant to the fsia blue ridge,as an assignee,could not state a claim under the icsid convention to confirm the award the petition was barred by res judicata because blue ridge prior confirmation petition had been dismissed with prejudice pursuant to the order issued by judge lynch and the petition was under new york applicable statute of limitations.judge gardephe,now presiding,denied argentina motion to dismiss and rejected each of its arguments.see blue ridge,llc republic of argentina,d.
with regard to argentina foreign sovereign immunity defense,judge gardephe held that argentina had waived its immunity from suit pursuant to two exceptions to the fsia the implied waiver exception,see a,and the arbitral award exception,see id.a.blue ridge,d at.specifically,he found that argentina had waived its foreign sovereign immunity under the implied waiver exception because it had signed the icsid convention,which provides for the automatic recognition and enforcement of awards in contracting states.id.he also found that argentina had waived its foreign sovereign immunity under the arbitral award exception because argentina agreement to submit its dispute with cms to an arbitration governed by the icsid convention constituted a waiver of immunity under section a b with respect to the recognition and enforcement of the award.id.
with regard to argentina other arguments,judge gardephe held that blue ridge,as an assignee,could state a claim to confirm the award because nothing in the language of the icsid convention prevented an assignee from doing so,and because,under new york law the award is assignable the petition was not barred by res judicata because the previous dismissals were without prejudice,inasmuch they did not provide the clarity required of a dismissal with prejudice under.a and the petition was not because the appropriate period is twenty years pursuant to cplr b.blue ridge,d at.
argentina filed this appeal,and subsequently sought a certificate of appealability pursuant to b in the district court to date,the district court has not issued a certificate of appealability,and therefore our initial inquiry must be whether and to what extent we have jurisdiction to consider the district court denial of argentina motion to dismiss under the collateral order doctrine.see liberty synergistics microflo,cir discussing the collateral order doctrine.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
argentina first asserts that we have jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to review the district court conclusion that argentina waived its foreign sovereign immunity it then asserts that we should exercise pendent appellate and review whether the district court erred in concluding that blue ridge,as an assignee,could state a claim to confirm the award because,in argentina view,the latter issue is inextricably intertwined with the former.in other words,argentina contends that a s a foreign state,it is presumptively immune from suit and n either the icsid convention,nor any other instrument that blue ridge has invoked,contains a waiver express or implied by argentina of its immunity with respect to blue ridge claim,which is based on an assignment of an icsid award.reply br.
i.the collateral order doctrine 
our appellate jurisdiction is limited to final decisions of district courts.the purpose of this rule is to provide the parties with an opportunity for a single review of all the questions raised at the trial level and thereby to avoid the waste of time and the delay in reaching trial finality which ensue when piecemeal appeals are permitted.nelson unum life ins.of,cir quoting paliaga luckenbach,cir.
although the district court decision concluding that argentina waived its foreign sovereign immunity is an interlocutory order,argentina argues that we have jurisdiction to review that decision under the collateral order doctrine,which provides for appellate jurisdiction over a small class of collateral rulings that do not terminate the litigation in the court below but are nonetheless sufficiently final and distinct from the merits to be appealable without waiting for a final judgment to be entered.microflo,at see cohen beneficial indus.loan.describing the collateral order doctrine as permitting appeals from a small class of orders which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,and which are too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.the requirements for collateral order appeal have been distilled down to three conditions that an order conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.will hallock,d brackets in original internal quotation marks omitted see also digital equip.desktop direct,d.
we previously have held that a denial of foreign sovereign immunity satisfies the conditions necessary to invoke the collateral order doctrine.see usaa cas.ins.permanent mission of republic of namibia,cir kensington int l itoua,cir.other circuits have arrived at the same conclusion.see,abelesz erste grp.bank ag,cir terenkian republic of iran,cir hansen pt bank negara indonesia persero,tbk,cir.
despite this general rule,blue ridge argues that the circumstances of this appeal do not satisfy the collateral order doctrine because the justifications for the doctrine,allowing a foreign sovereign to avoid trial and the attendant burdens of litigation are not relevant here insofar as the underlying proceeding only involves confirming the award.put another way,blue ridge contends that w here the denial of immunity subjects the sovereign simply to entry of a judgment,the sovereign can just as easily and effectively appeal after entry of a final order.blue ridge br.
blue ridge argument relies on three cases from this circuit.see kensington int l republic of congo,cir transaero,la fuerza aerea boliviana,cir caribbean trading fid.nigerian petroleum,cir.in kensington and caribbean trading,we declined to exercise jurisdiction over appeals from orders requiring foreign governments to post security for costs.see kensington,at caribbean trading,at.in doing so,w e distinguished between claims of fsia immunity from suit under section,denials of which are appealable collateral orders,and claims of fsia immunity from attachment,denials of which are not appealable.kensington,at.in transareo,we held that we lacked jurisdiction to consider the denial of a motion to vacate a default judgment under rule b holding that the sovereign right not to be subject to a binding judgment may be effectively vindicated following final judgment.at.
despite the surface appeal of blue ridge arguments,we are not persuaded by them because,unlike the circumstances presented here,kensington,caribbean trading,and transareo did not involve a threshold determination of fsia immunity from suit.reply br.this case therefore is more akin to our recent decision in figueiredo ferraz e engenharia de projeto ltda.republic of peru,cir,which addressed whether the denial of foreign sovereign immunity in a confirmation proceeding was an appealable order under the collateral order doctrine.id.at.in that case,we specifically noted that t he appellants filed an interlocutory appeal from the denial of their motion to dismiss,predicating appellate jurisdiction on the collateral order doctrine,which is applicable to an order denying a motion to dismiss that had sought fsia immunity.id.the fact that figueiredo ferraz involved a confirmation proceeding did not factor into our analysis.
accordingly,in light of the general rule that the denial of foreign sovereign immunity is immediately appealable and our recent decision in figueiredo ferraz,we conclude that we have jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to review the district court threshold determination that argentina waived its foreign sovereign immunity pursuant to a the implied waiver exception and a the arbitral award exception.
ii.pendent appellate jurisdiction 
having concluded that we have jurisdiction to review the district court conclusion that argentina waived its foreign sovereign immunity,we next consider argentina request for us to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction and consider whether the district court erred in concluding that blue ridge,as an assignee,could state a claim to confirm the award.as we have noted,we have discretion to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over related rulings that are otherwise unappealable as long as the related rulings are inextricably intertwined with an issue over which the court properly has appellate jurisdiction.lamar adver.of penn,llc town of orchard park,cir quoting swint chambers cnty.comm n,d.
pendent appellate jurisdiction is available only when an issue is inextricably intertwined with a question that is the proper subject of an immediate appeal or when review of a jurisdictionally insufficient issue is necessary to ensure meaningful review of an immediately appealable issue.swint,at.these conditions are not met when we are confronted with two similar,but independent,issues,and resolution of the order would require us to conduct an inquiry that is distinct from and broader than the inquiry required to resolve solely the issue over which we properly have appell
