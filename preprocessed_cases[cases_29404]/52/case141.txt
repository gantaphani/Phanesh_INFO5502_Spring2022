lee jen fair appeals the grant of a petition brought by her husband abdollah naghash souratgar for repatriation of their son from new york to singapore.in may,lee removed the boy to dutchess county,new york,in direct violation of a singapore court order.the united states district court for the southern district of new york castel,judge granted souratgar petition pursuant to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction convention,and its implementing statute,the international child abduction remedies act.souratgar lee jen fair,cv pkc,wl.
the principal issue on appeal is whether lee affirmative defenses to repatriation should have prevailed in the district court.we find the district court correctly applied the convention and affirm its order of repatriation.
background 
the boy at the center of this case,now shayan,was born in singapore in january to lee and souratgar,who are both residents of that country.souratgar is an iranian national who has owned a business in singapore since.lee is a malaysian national who worked as an airline attendant,saleswoman,and retail manager in singapore.she converted to islam,souratgar faith,just prior to their marriage in singapore in.shayan is a citizen of malaysia with malaysian and iranian passports.
the parties marital relationship has been stormy.at the district court hearing,they traded accusations and denials of domestic abuse.souratgar accused lee,among other things,of biting him,repeatedly threatening him with a knife and chopper,having suicidal tendencies,and inflicting injuries on herself.lee asserted in her testimony more serious allegations that souratgar repeatedly slapped,beat,shook,and kicked her,and that he forced her to perform sex acts against her will.the district court carefully checked these assertions against the various police reports,medical records,and legal papers entered into evidence and,while it could not verify the most severe claims of abuse and found both parties testimony to be incredible in certain instances,it did credit the accounts it could corroborate the district court found spousal abuse by souratgar,including shouting and offensive,and several incidents of physical abuse in which he kicked,slapped,grabbed,and hit lee souratgar,wl,at.
the district court found no credible evidence of any harm directed against the child.both parties,despite their acrimonious contest over his custody,acknowledge the other love for shayan,and it is not disputed that the boy dearly loves both of his parents.
the district court also found souratgar and lee to be intelligent,sophisticated individuals who were able to make use of legal proceedings in singapore,malaysia,and the united states.in april,when shayan was two,lee filed an ex parte application in the singapore high court for sole custody.she cited concern that souratgar would take shayan from the country and cut her off from the boy.on may,the subordinate court of singapore issued an ex parte order directing souratgar to hand over shayan passports and personal documents to lee and barring souratgar from removing the child from singapore without court approval and lee knowledge or consent.souratgar complied with the order,denied lee charges,and for sole custody.while the custody proceedings were pending in singapore,lee moved out of the marital home with shayan and refused to disclose their whereabouts to souratgar.he eventually found them in malaysia,where lee denied him access to the boy.souratgar then filed a custody application in the syariah court of malaysia,which granted joint custody to the couple in early july.thereafter,lee succeeded in obtaining a dismissal of that order from the malaysian syariah court for lack of jurisdiction.
after lee and shayan returned to singapore,the custody proceedings in singapore subordinate court resumed.following a mediation session on july,the subordinate court barred either parent from removing shayan from singapore without the other consent and ordered interim supervised visitation for souratgar of two hours per week at singapore centre for family harmony.following another mediation session on february,both parties agreed to a consent order by the subordinate court to have custody decided by the syariah court of singapore in the meantime,shayan remained in lee care,while souratgar visitation time was doubled.
on may,lee removed shayan from singapore,in violation of the singapore subordinate court order.souratgar,through a private investigator,eventually located lee and shayan in dutchess county,and on october,filed an ex parte application in the district court under the convention for shayan return to singapore.
after ex parte hearings,the district court ordered souratgar to surrender his passport and post bond,and transferred custody of the child to souratgar.the district court then appointed a guardian ad litem to represent shayan interests and ordered souratgar to make the child available to lee for five sessions of visitation per week,with not less than three hours per session,during the pendency of the proceedings.the district court heard testimony from nine witnesses over a evidentiary hearing,and on december,granted souratgar petition.this petition was temporarily stayed pending emergency appeal.we stayed enforcement of the repatriation order,imposed an expedited briefing schedule,and granted leave for the filing of amicus briefs.
ii.discussion 
a.the framework of the hague convention 
the hague convention,a multilateral treaty,is designed to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal by establish ing procedures to ensure their prompt return to the state of their habitual residence,abbott.abbott,quotation marks and emphasis omitted,so that the rights of custody and of access under the law of one contracting state are effectively respected in the other contracting states,chafin chafin,quotation marks omitted.the convention remedy of repatriation is designed to preserve the status quo in the child country of habitual residence and deter parents from crossing international boundaries in search of a more sympathetic court.blondin dubois blondin ii,cir quotation marks omitted.
the removal of a child under the convention is deemed wrongful when it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal.abbott.at quotation marks omitted.under the convention,when a parent wrongfully removes a child from one contracting state which is the child country of habitual residence to another contracting state,the other parent may initiate a proceeding to repatriate the child to the first state in the united states,the petitioning party bears the burden of proving that the child was wrongfully removed.e a.once the petitioner establishes that removal was wrongful,the child must be returned unless the respondent can establish one of four defenses.blondin ii,at quotation marks omitted see also a.the decision concerning repatriation shall not be taken to be a determination on the merits of any custody issue.blondin ii,at quotation marks omitted mota castillo,cir t he convention focus is simply upon whether a child should be returned to her country of habitual residence for custody proceedings.
the parties do not dispute either that singapore is the country of shayan habitual residence or that his removal from singapore was wrongful under the convention.the issue on appeal is whether the two affirmative defenses that lee raised under articles b and of the convention preclude repatriation.under article b,
the judicial or administrative authority of the requested state is not bound to order the return of the child if the party opposing repatriation establishes that there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.
at.under article,repatriation also may be refused if this would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested state relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.id.
the respondent parent opposing the return of the child has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that one of the exceptions set forth in article or of the convention applies.e a.subsidiary facts may be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.see in re lozano,d.the district court is vested with considerable discretion under the convention.indeed,even where the grounds for one of these narrow exceptions have been established,the district court is not necessarily bound to allow the child to remain with the abducting parent.blondin ii,at.

lee article b defense 
lee contends that returning shayan to singapore would expose him to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him in an intolerable situation and that the district court finding to the contrary was error.the harms he could face upon return,she asserts,are exposure to spousal abuse direct abuse from his father or the loss of his mother.after carefully reviewing the record,we find that lee arguments are permeated with conjecture and speculation and that there was no error in the district court determination that lee had failed to meet her burden to establish the article b defense.
under article b,a grave risk of harm from repatriation arises in two situations where returning the child means sending him to a zone of war,famine,or disease or in cases of serious abuse or neglect,or extraordinary emotional dependence,when the court in the country of habitual residence,for whatever reason,may be incapable or unwilling to give the child adequate protection.blondin iv,at quotation marks omitted.the potential harm to the child must be severe,and the t he level of risk and danger required to trigger this exception has consistently been held to be very high.norden powers beveridge,d,citing cases.the grave risk involves not only the magnitude of the potential harm but also the probability that the harm will materialize.van de sande van de sande,cir.
this grave risk exception is to be interpreted narrowly,lest it swallow the rule.simcox simcox,cir blondin ii,at warning that permissive invocation of the affirmative defenses would lead to the collapse of the whole structure of the convention by depriving it of the spirit of mutual confidence which is its inspiration quotation marks and citation omitted.
risk from exposure to spousal abuse 
many cases for relief under the convention arise from a backdrop of domestic strife.spousal abuse,however,is only relevant under article b if it seriously endangers the child.the article b inquiry is not whether repatriation would place the respondent parent safety at grave risk,but whether so doing would subject the child to a grave risk of physical or psychological harm.charalambous charalambous,cir per curiam.
the exception to repatriation has been found where the petitioner showed a sustained pattern of physical abuse a propensity for violent abuse that presented an intolerably grave risk to the child.laguna avila,cv env,wl,at may.evidence of p rior spousal abuse,though not directed at the child,can support the grave risk of harm defense,rial rijo,cv rjh,wl,at,as could a showing of the child exposure to such abuse,elyashiv elyashiv,d.evidence of this kind,however,is not dispositive in these cases.
sporadic or isolated incidents of physical discipline directed at the child,or some limited incidents aimed at persons other than the child,even if witnessed by the child,have not been found to constitute a grave risk.see in re filipczak,d,granting repatriation petition even though the child had witnessed one incident of spousal abuse as a rial,wl at ordering return of child despite evidence that petitioner was verbally and sometimes physically abusive to respondent lachhman lachhman,cv cps,wl,at,concluding that evidence of petitioner previous arrest,but not conviction,on domestic abuse charges was insufficient to establish grave risk where there was no evidence that petitioner had ever harmed child.in this case,the district court found that,while lee was subjected to domestic abuse on certain occasions albeit less than she claimed,at no time was shayan harmed or targeted.
we have held that article b relief could be granted if repatriation posed a grave risk of causing unavoidable psychological harm to the child.see blondin iv,at affirming denial of petition to repatriate after an expert psychologist opined that returning the boy and girl to france,where they had been abused by their father,would likely trigger recurrence of ptsd,and that no arrangement could mitigate this risk.the holding in blondin iv depended on the fact,due to the nature of the potential harm at issue recurrence of ptsd that would occur as soon as the children entered france there was nothing the courts could do to prevent it.in this case,there is nothing in the record beyond speculation that shayan would suffer unavoidable psychological harm if returned to singapore.neither party nor the guardian ad litem requested a psychological evaluation of the boy,and the guardian ad litem reported,after observing shayan interactions with both parents and interviewing him separately,that the boy appeared to be an active and happy child,who seemed distressed about the difficulties between his parents.shayan expressed unqualified love for both parents and indicated that he was never physically disciplined and never saw or heard either parent hit the other or try to hurt the other parent.these observations are consistent with the reports to the singapore subordinate court by singapore centre for family harmony,which supervised and reported on souratgar visits with the boy.in contrast,the girl in blondin iv had herself been abused and expressed fear of her father.
the circuit court cases affirming denial of repatriation cited by lee are distinguishable in that the petitioning parent had actually abused,threatened to abuse,or inspired fear in the children in question.see khan fatima,cir daughter told social worker she was scared of her father simcox,at father subjected children to repeated beatings,hair pulling,ear pulling,and and psychological abuse van de sande,at father spanked daughter and threatened to kill wife and children walsh walsh,cir one child diagnosed with ptsd as a result of physical abuse and father repeatedly violated court orders blondin ii,at father tied cord around daughter neck and threatened to kill mother and daughter see also baran beaty,cir despite the absence of any evidence of past abuse of the child by the father,the father was found to be frequently drunk,emotionally unstable,and to have threatened the child and verbally and physically abused the mother in the child presence danaipour mclarey,cir father may have sexually abused the daughter.in distinguishing the foregoing cases,we do not mean to suggest that only evidence of past parental abuse of the child,past parental threats to the child or the child fear of a parent can establish a successful article b defense.we only hold that in this case,the evidence,which does not match the showing in those cases,does not establish that the child faces a grave risk of physical or psychological harm upon repatriation.
lee contends that the district court erred in discounting the likelihood that shayan would be exposed to renewed domestic strife and suffer grievous psychological harm upon his return to singapore.she also faults the district court for refusing to credit expert testimony characterizing souratgar as having a coercive and controlling personality type with a tendency to hurt women and children.at the hearing,the district court heard the psychological expert testimony of cling,who described abusive spouses of the coercive control type and of the situationa
