plaintiffs in this case attempted to serve process on an english defendant by using ordinary first class mail to send a summons and complaint from the united states to england.we join the second circuit in concluding that the convention on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents hague convention,or the convention does not,in the words of the convention,does not interfere with service of process by international mail.but this conclusion tells us only that the hague convention does not prohibit such service.for service by international mail to be effective in federal court,it must also be affirmatively authorized by some provision in federal law.
federal rule of civil procedure governs service of process in federal district court.in this case,after determining that the hague convention does not prohibit service by international mail,the necessary next step is to analyze rule f to determine whether it affirmatively authorizes such service.the plaintiffs attempted service fails because they failed to follow the requirements of that rule.we therefore reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to vacate the judgment.
background plaintiffs attempts to serve process 
ronald brockmeyer is the owner of the trademark,under which he publishes and distributes adult entertainment media and novelties.on august,brockmeyer and his company,eromedia,filed suit against marquis publications,marquis and several other defendants in federal district court in the southern district of new york,alleging trademark infringement and various causes of action.marquis is a company registered under british law.plaintiffs counsel made two attempts to serve on marquis.
plaintiffs counsel made his first attempt on october.he sent the summons and complaint,together with a request for waiver of service,by ordinary first class mail to a post office box in england.marquis did not respond.
on april,the district court in new york transferred the suit to the central district of california.on october,the district court in california entered an order to show cause osc why the suit should not be dismissed for lack of prosecution.plaintiffs were required to respond to the osc by october.
plaintiffs counsel made his second attempt at service four days before the osc deadline,on october.this time,instead of sending the summons and complaint together with a request for waiver of service,he sent only the summons and complaint.he sent them by first class mail to the same post office box in england to which he had previously sent the request for waiver.marquis still did not respond.
default was entered by the court clerk against several defendants not including marquis on november.default was entered against marquis a year later,on november.on february,the district court entered a default judgment of,plus attorneys fees and costs,against marquis and two german defendants.
the german defendants moved to set aside the default judgment against them.on june,the district court granted the motion on the ground that they had not been properly served under the hague convention and german law.the court ordered plaintiffs to serve the german defendants properly within days or face dismissal.the district court subsequently gave plaintiffs a extension until november.seven days before the expiration of the extended deadline,plaintiffs counsel finally submitted documents to the german central authority for service.the central authority rejected the documents the same day for failure to comply with german law.almost two months later,plaintiffs counsel resubmitted documents to the german central authority.nothing in the record indicates whether these resubmitted documents complied with german law.on january,the district court dismissed the suit against the german defendants for failure to serve process within the time allowed under the extended deadline.plaintiffs have not appealed that dismissal.
marquis moved independently to set aside the default judgment against it.among other things,marquis contended that international mail service must be made by certified or registered mail.on june,the district court denied marquis motion,holding that plaintiffs second attempt at service had been successful.it ruled that mail service is not forbidden by the hague convention,and that service on an english defendant by ordinary international first class mail is proper.
marquis appeals the district court denial of its motion to set aside plaintiffs default judgment.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.once service is challenged,plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing that service was valid under rule.charles wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.supp see also butcher union local sdc,cir.
ii.discussion 
a.the hague convention 
the resolution of this appeal depends on whether marquis was properly served.because service of process was attempted abroad,the validity of that service is controlled by the hague convention,to the extent that the convention applies.volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft schlunk,d c ompliance with the convention is mandatory in all cases to which it applies.
the hague convention,ratified by the united states in,regularized and liberalized service of process in international civil suits.the primary means by which service is accomplished under the convention is through a receiving country central authority.the convention affirmatively requires each member country to designate a central authority to receive documents from another member country.see hague convention.the receiving country can impose certain requirements with respect to those documents for example,that they be translated into the language of that country.see.if the documents comply with applicable requirements,the convention affirmatively requires the central authority to effect service in its country.see.
the convention also provides that it does not interfere with other methods of serving documents.article a of the convention recites 
provided the state of destination does not object,the present convention shall not interfere with 
a the freedom to send judicial documents,by postal channels,directly to persons abroad.
emphasis added.american courts have disagreed about whether the phrase the freedom to send judicial documents in article a includes within its meaning the freedom to serve judicial documents.
one line of cases follows bankston toyota motor,cir.in bankston,the eighth circuit held that the meaning of the word send in article a does not include serve that is,it held that send permitted the sending of judicial documents by mail,but only after service of process was accomplished by some other means.in nuovo pignone storman asia,cir,the fifth circuit similarly held that a strict reading of the hague convention did not permit an italian plaintiff who filed suit in the united states to serve an italian defendant in italy by federal express.
a second line of cases follows ackermann levine,cir,in which the second circuit approved a german plaintiff service of process by mail,when the plaintiff filed suit in germany and served by registered mail a defendant in the united states.ackermann relied primarily on the purpose and history of the convention to interpret the word send in article a to include the meaning serve.see id.
whether service by mail is permitted under the hague convention is an open question in our circuit.we briefly discussed article a in lidas,united states,cir,but we did not confront the question whether article a allows service by mail.district courts within our circuit are split.compare griggs group filanto spa,send includes serve meyers asics,same and newport components nec home electronics,same with anbe kikuchi,i send does not include serve and mateo kiso,same.
today we join the second circuit in holding that the meaning of send in article a includes serve.see ackermann,at.in so doing,we also join the essentially unanimous view of other member countries of the hague convention.see,case,srl.italo fenocchio,court of justice of the european communities article a of the hague convention allows service by post.integral energy envtl.eng g schenker of canada,wl alberta queens bench article a of the hague convention provides that if the state of destination does not object,judicial documents may be served by postal channels,rev on other grounds,re recognition of an italian judgment,wl thessaloniki court of appeal,greece it should be noted that the possibility of serving judicial documents in civil and commercial cases through postal channels is envisaged in article a of the hague convention.
we agree with the second circuit that this holding is consistent with the purpose of the convention to facilitate international service of judicial documents.see hague convention,t he present convention shall apply in all cases,in civil or commercial matters,where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.emphasis added see also moore federal practice d stating that it comports with the broad purpose of the hague convention to construe send to mean serve.
commentaries on the history of negotiations leading to the hague convention further indicate that service by mail is permitted under article a.according to the official rapporteur report,the first paragraph of article of the draft convention,which except for minor editorial changes is identical to article of the final convention,was intended to permit service by mail.see bruno ristau,international judicial assistance,at quoting the service convention negotiating document translated from french by ristau.a handbook published by the permanent bureau of the hague convention,which summarizes meetings of a special commission of experts,states that to interpret article a not to permit service by mail would contradict what seems to have been the implicit understanding of the delegates at the special commission meeting,and indeed of the legal literature on the convention and its predecessor treaties.permanent bureau of the hague convention,practical handbook on the operation of the hague convention of november on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters.as further evidence of the understanding of the parties at the time the hague convention was signed,the united states delegate to the hague convention reported to congress that article a permitted service by mail.see exec,at statement by philip amram.
the united states government,through the state department,has specifically disapproved the eighth circuit holding in bankston.on march,the deputy legal advisor of the state department wrote a letter to the administrative office of the united states courts after discussing article a and noting that japan did not object to the use of postal channels under article a,the letter concluded 
we therefore believe that the decision of the court of appeals in bankston is incorrect to the extent that it suggests that the hague convention does not permit as a method of service of process the sending of a copy of a summons and complaint by registered mail to a defendant in a foreign country.
the letter also emphasized that,while courts in the united states have final authority to interpret international treaties for the purposes of their application as law of the united states,they give great weight to treaty interpretations made by the executive branch.see also united states,cir en banc.
state department circulars also indicate that service by mail is permitted in international civil litigation.see,dep t of state,circular service of process abroad,in selected materials in int l litig.and arbitration.the state department circular tailored to the united kingdom specifies that mail service by international registered mail is allowed.state dep t,judicial assistance in the united kingdom england,scotland,wales,and northern ireland,in selected materials in int l litig.arbitration.
the purpose and history of the hague convention,as well as the position of the state department,convince us that send in article a includes serve.we therefore hold that the convention,in the words of the convention,does not interfere with service of process by international mail,so long as the receiving country does not object.
rule f service upon individuals in a foreign country 
article a does not itself affirmatively authorize international mail service.it merely provides that the convention shall not interfere with the freedom to use postal channels if the state of destination does not object to their use.as the rapporteur for the convention wrote in explaining article a,it should be stressed that in permitting the utilization of postal channels,the draft convention did not intend to pass on the validity of this mode of transmission under the law of the forum state in order for the postal channel to be utilized,it is necessary that it be authorized by the law of the forum state.ristau,at emphasis added quoting service convention negotiating document see also id.at even though a contracting state may not object to methods of service of foreign judicial documents in its territory in a manner other than as provided for in the convention it is still necessary that the law of the state where the action is pending authorize the particular method of service employed.emphasis added.
in other words,we must look outside the hague convention for affirmative authorization of the international mail service that is merely not forbidden by article a.any affirmative authorization of service by international mail,and any requirements as to how that service is to be accomplished,must come from the law of the forum in which the suit is filed.
federal rule of civil procedure h directs that service on a foreign corporation,if done outside of the united states,shall be effected in any manner prescribed for individuals by subdivision f except personal delivery as provided in paragraph c i thereof,unless a waiver of service has been obtained and filed.no waiver of service under rule d was obtained in this case.to determine whether service of process was proper,we therefore look to federal rule of civil procedure f.as will be seen,no part of rule f authorizes service by ordinary international first class mail.
rule f authorizes service by those methods of service authorized by international agreements,including the hague convention.it provides 
f unless otherwise provided by federal law,service upon an individual from whom a waiver has not been obtained and filed may be effected in a place not within any judicial district of the united states 
by any internationally agreed means reasonably calculated to give notice,such as those means authorized by the hague convention on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents.
the hague convention affirmatively authorizes service of process through the central authority of a receiving state.rule f,by incorporating the convention,in turn affirmatively authorizes use of a central authority.however,rule f does not go beyond means of service affirmatively authorized by international agreements.it is undisputed that brockmeyer did not use either the central authority under the hague convention or any other internationally agreed means for accomplishing service.rule f,therefore,does not provide a basis for service in this case.
rule f c ii 
explicit,affirmative authorization for service by international mail is found only in rule f c ii previously rule i d.this rule authorizes service abroad by mail for which a signed receipt is required,when such mail is addressed and mailed by the clerk of the federal district court in which the suit is filed.it provides 
f s ervice may be effected in a place not within any judicial district of the united states 
if there is no internationally agreed means of service or the applicable international agreement allows other means of service,provided that service is reasonably calculated to give notice 
c unless prohibited by the law of the country,by 
ii any form of mail requiring a signed receipt,to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the party to be served.
emphasis added.
it is undisputed that the plaintiffs in this case did not comply with the requirements of rule f c ii,as notice was not sent by the clerk of the district court,nor by a for
