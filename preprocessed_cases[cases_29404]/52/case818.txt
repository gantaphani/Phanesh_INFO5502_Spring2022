this consolidated appeal arises from several wrongful death actions brought by the survivors of passengers killed in the crash of a mcdonnell douglas aircraft,operating as west caribbean airways flight,in the mountains of venezuela.all of the,plaintiffs in the proceedings below plaintiffs,are natural persons and residents of martinique,a department of the republic of france,and represent the deceased passengers of flight the,defendants below defendants,are west caribbean airways,a colombian corporation operating the chartered plane that crashed,two florida corporations,newvac and go galaxy,and the president of newvac and go galaxy,jacque cimetier newvac is the entity that chartered the west caribbean plane for flights from martinique to panama.after entering into the charter contract with west caribbean,newvac contracted with globe trotter agency,a martinique travel agency,and agreed to provide the aircraft it had chartered,as well as hotel,transportation,and sightseeing services,for excursions between martinique and panama.these excursion packages were then to be sold by globe trotter to individual passengers in martinique.
newvac moved to dismiss the suit on the basis of forum non conveniens and the district court granted the motion,finding that martinique was the more convenient forum for resolution of the survivors claims plaintiffs appeal that ruling,arguing that the doctrine of forum non conveniens does not apply because the international treaty that regulates the liability of carriers to passengers on international flights,the convention for the unification of certain rules for international carriage by air the montreal convention or convention,precludes application of the doctrine as a matter of international law alternatively,plaintiffs argue that,even if the convention permits application of the doctrine,the district court abused its discretion in applying it here.
the doctrine of forum non conveniens permits a court with venue to decline to exercise its jurisdiction when the parties and court own convenience,as well as the relevant public and private interests,indicate that the action should be tried in a different forum.a defendant seeking dismissal for forum non conveniens bears the burden of demonstrating 
i that an adequate alternative forum is available,ii that relevant public and private interests weigh in favor of dismissal,and iii that the plaintiff can reinstate his suit in the alternative forum without undue inconvenience or prejudice.pertinent private interests of the litigants include relative ease of access to evidence in the competing fora,availability of witnesses and compulsory process over them,the cost of obtaining evidence,and the enforceability of a judgment.relevant public interests include the familiarity of the court s with the governing law,the interest of any foreign nation in having the dispute litigated in its own courts,and the value of having local controversies litigated locally.

plaintiffs argue that the district court was precluded from applying this doctrine by the montreal convention,which is the exclusive means by which international air travel passengers can seek damages for death or personal injury in cases covered by it chapter iii of the convention is entitled liability of the carrier and extent of compensation for damage.article,located in chapter iii,is the jurisdictional provision which specifies in which fora such suits can be brought 
an action for damages must be brought,at the option of the plaintiff,in the territory of one of the states parties,either before the court of the domicile of the carrier or of its principal place of business,or where it has a place of business through which the contract has been made or before the court at the place of destination.
in respect of damage resulting from the death or injury of a passenger,an action may be brought before one of the courts mentioned in paragraph of this article,or in the territory of a state party in which at the time of the accident the passenger has his or her principal and permanent residence and to or from which the carrier operates services for the carriage of passengers by air 
thus,under article of the convention,suits for damages by passengers on international flights can be filed in a limited number of fora,including,inter alia,the domicile of the carrier or the principal place of business of the carrier.in the case of damage resulting from the injury or death of a passenger,suit may be brought in the passenger permanent residence if the carrier operates air carriage services to or from that location.
the term carrier is undefined in the convention.however,chapter v of the convention,entitled carriage by air performed by a person other than the contracting carrier,addresses situations in which there is both a contracting carrier and an actual carrier.article,located in chapter v of the convention,provides the definitions for contracting carrier and actual carrier 
the provisions of chapter v apply when a person hereinafter referred to as the contracting carrier as a principal makes a contract of carriage governed by this convention with a passenger or consignor or with a person acting on behalf of the passenger or consignor,and another person hereinafter referred to as the actual carrier performs,by virtue of authority from the contracting carrier,the whole or part of the carriage,but is not with respect to such part a successive carrier within the meaning of this convention.such authority shall be presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary.
these definitions are significant because article,in chapter v,provides that i f an actual carrier performs the whole or part of carriage which,according to the contract referred to in article,is governed by this convention,both the contracting carrier and the actual carrier shall,except as otherwise provided in chapter v,be subject to the rules of this convention,the former for the whole of the carriage contemplated in the contract,the latter solely for the carriage which it performs.
in turn,article provides that a plaintiff may bring an action for damages under the convention against the actual carrier or the contracting carrier,or against both together or separately,and article specifies the fora in which a plaintiff may bring such a suit.article provides that a ny action for damages contemplated in article must be brought,at the option of the plaintiff,in the territory of one of the states parties,either before a court in which an action may be brought against the contracting carrier,as provided in article,or before the court having jurisdiction at the place where the actual carrier has its domicile or its principal place of business.the district court found that newvac go galaxy was the contracting carrier for the flight at issue,and thus the lawsuit was filed in an appropriate forum pursuant to the convention 
the district court next found,however,that although it had jurisdiction,the convention did not preclude application of forum non conveniens.in so holding,the district court relied on article of the convention,which provides that q uestions of procedure shall be governed by the law of the court seised of the case.the district court reasoned that because the doctrine of forum non conveniens is part of united states civil procedure,the convention unambiguously permits its application in accordance with the law of the forum.the district court also concluded that the shared expectation of the states party to the convention was that those states which recognized the doctrine could continue to apply it.we find no error in these conclusions.
when interpreting a treaty,we begin with the words of the treaty in the context in which the words are used.volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft schlunk,d.plaintiffs concede that the starting point of treaty interpretation is the relevant text and recognize that the treaty expressly provides that q uestions of procedure are governed by the law of the forum in which the case is validly brought.they argue,however,that because the convention does not
