citi brought an action in the southern district of new york to enjoin the arbitration,citing the finra code of arbitration procedure for customer disputes finra code,which provides that a finra member consents to arbitration with its customers.after a bench trial,the district court ruled that abbar,who purchased no goods or services from citi and had no account with it,therefore lacked the indicia of a customer.accordingly,the injunction was issued.we affirm.
background 
the following facts are drawn from the district court opinion and the undisputed portions of the parties pleadings and filings.
in late to early,ghazi abbar private banker,mohanned noor,left deutsche bank and joined citigroup private bank in geneva,bringing with him the business of the abbar family.in the following months,abbar family trusts through the defendant investment vehicles purchased complex options in london from citi uk.
the structure of the option transactions was as follows with some blessed simplification.citi uk set up two reference funds to hold the investment assets.abbar contributed to the reference funds and citi uk agreed to contribute between and million in leverage funds citi uk held ownership of all the assets in the reference funds,including abbar contribution.in exchange for abbar contribution and certain fees,citi uk issued options to the abbar family trusts that entitled them to the value of the assets held in the reference funds,less the leverage funds.under this arrangement,the abbar family trusts were allowed to keep percent of any upside,but had to bear the first million in losses.if the reference funds lost more than the million,the additional loss was borne by citi uk 
while citi uk owned the reference funds,they were managed by abbar with oversight from new york by citi ny.abbar served as the investment advisor and selected the funds investments,subject to review and approval by citi ny.the voting rights in the reference funds were held by citi ny,which retained the right to remove abbar as investment advisor and eventually did.
the work of structuring and negotiating the options was done mainly by citi personnel working in a citigroup division known as the hybrids group.such fund derivatives were within that division area of specialty,whereas london traders at citi uk typically arranged investments in different financial products.
providing expertise to citigroup colleagues elsewhere was routine for citi personnel.the arrangement was desired by abbar,who wanted his private banker noor to be able to walk the corridors of the entire citigroup,and have access to the entirety of citigroup wherever the best people were.citigroup global,abbar,d cgmi abbar.abbar had frequent communication with the personnel at citi ny,paid little attention to which citigroup entity employed the people he was working with,and interacted with employees of citigroup divisions and offices in geneva as well as in london and new york.
under the two option agreements one with each of the defendant investment vehicles,the citigroup counterparty to the option transactions was citi uk.the terms of the options were set forth in confirmations between citi uk and abbar investment vehicles.the transactions were recorded on citi uk books of account.
the option agreements themselves included no forum selection or clause,but citi uk and abbar entered into an additional agreement that did.two letters contained abbar agreement to pay citi uk for setting up the investment,and these included and clauses providing that any disputes which may arise out of or in connection with this letter agreement would be adjudicated in english courts under english law.
after the transactions closed in may,citi personnel continued to monitor the risk to citi uk and helped prepare monthly reports on the status of the funds.citi performed due diligence on assets to assess citi uk leverage and exposure.as holder of the funds voting rights,citi had final say over investment decisions.these services were performed by citi more for the benefit of citi uk than for abbar.the setup allowed citi to override abbar decisions as investment advisor and,in that way,protect citi uk very considerable interest.
the interrelationship between citi uk and citi was set out in internal citigroup documents,and was formalized in powers of attorney,including one that granted citi authority to sign the transaction confirmations for citi uk.accounting adjustments reflected the value of services each affiliate performed for the other.
the option transactions came under stress in.citi removed abbar as investment advisor early in.in the fall of,citi employees participated in workout efforts with abbar.those efforts failed,and abbar lost his entire investment.
abbar filed a statement of claim with finra in august on behalf of himself,his father abdullah mahmoud abbar,and their investment vehicles.he requested arbitration against citi ny.
the statement of claim,which alleged losses from the option transactions,also complained of a failed million private equity loan facility extended to abbar by citibank switzerland sa and the geneva branch of citibank na.the march loan supplied abbar with funds he needed to meet capital calls on his hedge fund investments.pursuant to the loan agreement,abbar transferred control of million worth of hedge fund investments to the swiss citigroup entities.the financial crisis wiped out the hedge fund investments,and abbar blamed the losses on the swiss banks mismanagement of the funds.although citi personnel played no role in negotiating the loan,abbar testified that the loan facility and the option transactions were a package deal,and that the workout discussions proposed consolidation of the two transactions.abbar therefore claimed that citi was responsible for the million loss,and sought recovery in the finra arbitration.
abbar lost million on the option transactions,million on the private equity loan facility,and an additional million that he injected into these transactions at various points.all told,abbar lost million.
citi brought this action in the southern district of new york to enjoin the finra arbitration,and named as defendants abbar,abbar father,and their investment vehicles.because citi had no written arbitration agreement with abbar,the finra rules mandate arbitration only if abbar is a customer of citi ny.citi argued that abbar was a customer of citi uk,but not of citi ny.
judge stanton granted the injunction following almost two years of motions and a trial with thousands of pages of documents and scores of exhibits admitted in evidence.the opinion explains how this threshold question became so ramified 
that is because the question whether abbar was a customer of citi ny was seen to require examining and evaluating the substance,nature,and frequency of each interaction and task performed by
