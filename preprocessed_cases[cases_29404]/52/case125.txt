this appeal presents important questions regarding the extraterritorial reach of antitrust law.the plaintiff,a taiwanese electronics manufacturing company with facilities in china,alleges that the defendants,a group of five competing electronics firms,have attempted to leverage their ownership of certain key patents to gain control of a new technological standard for usb connectors and,by extension,to gain monopoly power over the entire usb connector industry.in considering whether these allegations suffice to state a viable claim under the sherman act,we must decide whether the restrictions congress has imposed on antitrust claims based on foreign conduct under the foreign trade antitrust improvements act ftaia,are jurisdictional in nature whether the defendants in this case have waived the requirements of the ftaia by contract whether the defendants alleged anticompetitive conduct has a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic or import commerce under the ftaia,id.and whether any such effect gives rise to the plaintiff claims,id.
we hold that,under the principles articulated in a line of recent supreme court decisions extending from arbaugh y h,to sebelius auburn regional medical center,the requirements of the ftaia are substantive and nonjurisdictional in nature.because congress has not clearly state d,id.at quoting arbaugh,at,that these requirements are jurisdictional,they go to the merits of the claim rather than the adjudicative power of the court.in so holding,we overrule our prior decision in filetech france telecom,cir,in this respect.however,although the ftaia requirements are nonjurisdictional and thus potentially waivable,we reject the plaintiff argument that the defendants somehow have waived them by contract in this case.
we further hold that foreign anticompetitive conduct can have a statutorily required direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic or import commerce even if the effect does not follow as an immediate consequence of the defendant conduct,so long as there is a reasonably proximate causal nexus between the conduct and the effect.we thus reject the interpretation of direct effect advanced by the ninth circuit in united states lsl biotechnologies,cir,which the district court followed below,in favor of the interpretation advocated by amici curiae the united states of america and the federal trade commission ftc and adopted by the seventh circuit in its en banc decision in minnchem,agrium,cir en banc.
we need not decide,however,whether the plaintiff here has plausibly alleged the requisite direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect under the proper standard.that is because the ftaia contains a second limitation,under which the aforementioned domestic effect must give rise to the plaintiff claim.here,regardless of what effect the defendants conduct has on domestic or import commerce,any such effect did not give rise to the plaintiff claim.to the contrary,in the causal chain the plaintiff alleges,the plaintiff exclusion from the relevant market actually precedes the alleged domestic effect.
accordingly,we affirm on alternative grounds the judgment of the district court dismissing the plaintiff claims.
background 
factual background 
the pertinent facts,resolving all ambiguities and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor,are as follows.
plaintiff appellant lotes,lotes is a taiwanese corporation specializing in the design and manufacture of electronic components for notebook computers,including universal serial bus usb connectors.usb connectors are used primarily to connect computer peripherals,such as printers,keyboards,and external hard drives,to personal computers,smart phones,and other electronic devices.usb connectors are among the most successful connectors in the history of personal computing,having achieved adoption from device and peripheral makers.
lotes manufactures usb connectors in factories located in china.from there,it typically sells the connectors to other taiwanese firms with facilities in china known as original design manufacturers odms.odms make and assemble computer products incorporating usb connectors for many computer brands,such as acer,dell,hp,and apple.those computer products,in turn,make their way into the hands of consumers and businesses around the world,including in the united states.according to industry sources and press reports,as of,roughly of global notebook computers were assembled by a small number of taiwanese vendors,primarily odms maintaining production facilities in china.
the defendants are a group of companies that compete with lotes in making and selling usb connectors.they also are involved in making,assembling,and distributing electronic components and devices that incorporate usb connectors.defendant appellee hon hai precision industry,hon hai is a taiwanese corporation that is one of the world largest manufacturers of electronic components,including usb connectors.defendant appellee foxconn international holdings,is a cayman islands corporation specializing in the design and manufacture of components for consumer electronics products,and is one of the largest exporters from china.defendant appellee foxconn international,is a california corporation that receives products from other foxconn companies for distribution within the united states.defendant appellee foxconn electronics,is another california corporation that designs and manufactures components for consumer electronics.defendant foxconn kunshan computer connector,foxconn kunshan is a chinese odm although the corporate relationships among the defendants are not clear from the complaint,lotes often refers to the foxconn defendants collectively,and alleges that hon hai has invested in foxconn international holdings to manufacture goods in china and other places.
the dispute in this case arises out of the development of the latest industry standard for usb connectors,known as usb.this standard represents a major technological advance over prior standards,including a significant increase in data transmission speeds.when lotes filed its complaint in this case in late,usb connectors were expected to replace the previous generation of usb connectors entirely within a year time.
common technological standards like usb carry benefits and anticompetitive risks.on the side,common standards enable different firms to produce products that are compatible with one another,promoting innovation and competition.because products can interoperate with many other products,they can be more valuable,providing greater benefits to consumers and simulating increased investment from manufacturers.standardized products also reduce the need for customization,which facilitates economies of scale and enables downstream manufacturers to switch suppliers more easily.these effects promote price competition and drive down costs.
at the same time,t here is no doubt that the members of associations often have economic incentives to restrain competition and that the product standards set by such associations have a serious potential for anticompetitive harm.allied tube conduit indian head.the process of developing standards,for example,requires extensive cooperation and coordination among competitors,which can be subverted to anticompetitive ends.see id.technical standardization also creates effects and raises the specter of patent.the third circuit has described this kind of abusive scheme as follows 
a organization may complete its lengthy process of evaluating technologies and adopting a new standard,only to discover that certain technologies essential to implementing the standard are patented.when this occurs,the patent holder is in a position to hold up industry participants from implementing the standard.industry participants who have invested significant resources developing products and technologies that conform to the standard will find it prohibitively expensive to abandon their investment and switch to another standard.they will have become locked in to the standard.in this unique position of bargaining power,the patent holder may be able to extract supracompetitive royalties from the industry participants.
broadcom qualcomm,cir.
to guard against these risks,organizations restrain the behavior of parties participating in the standard by contract.of particular relevance here,organizations typically secure agreements wherein parties who contribute proprietary technology to the standard promise to license that technology on reasonable and nondiscriminatory rand terms.absent such an agreement,the organization will omit the technology in question from the standard.rand licenses are thus part of a quid pro quo,representing the consideration contributing parties give to organizations in exchange for the competitive benefits they will receive from gaining acceptance of their preferred technologies.
the organization responsible for developing standards for usb connectors is the usb implementers forum,usb if,a organization founded by intel in.to protect against anticompetitive risks,the usb if required parties contributing to the usb standard to sign the usb contributors agreement the contributors agreement.lotes and the defendants have signed this agreement.lotes and the defendants also signed usb adopters agreement within the required adoption period.lotes and the defendants thus are both contributors to and adopters of the usb standard.
as relevant here,paragraph of the contributors agreement,entitled limited patent licensing obligations in contributions,obligates contributor s to grant to any adopter a license under any necessary claim of a patent or patent application on a basis and under otherwise reasonable and nondiscriminatory rand zero terms emphasis omitted.under this provision,the defendants are obligated to provide rand zero licenses to lotes for all patent claims needed to practice the usb standard.
in addition to this rand zero provision,the contributors agreement also contains other provisions designed to prevent the usb if from becoming a forum for antitrust violations.paragraph provides in pertinent part 
contributor s understand that in certain lines of business they are or may be direct competitors and that it is imperative that they and their representatives act in a manner which does not violate any state,federal or international antitrust laws and regulations.without limiting the generality of the foregoing,contributor s acknowledge that this agreement prohibits any communications regarding exclusion of competitors or any other topic that may be construed as a violation of antitrust laws.
similarly,paragraph provides anything in this agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,the obligations of the parties hereto shall be subject to all laws,present and future,of any government having jurisdiction over the parties hereto.the agreement also contains a new york clause,as well as an exclusive clause providing that all disputes arising in any way out of this agreement shall be heard exclusively in,and all parties irrevocably consent to jurisdiction and venue in,the state and federal courts of new york,new york.
the crux of lotes complaint is its claim that the defendants have brazenly flouted their obligations under the contributors agreement to provide rand zero licenses to adopters of the usb standard.to begin with,lotes alleges that hon hai and foxconn have contacted the customers and distributors of lotes to allege that they have the sole patent rights on usb connectors and would sue them if they did not buy from foxconn.hon hai and foxconn have also refused to provide rand zero licenses to other manufacturers similarly situated to lotes and have sent out warning letters threatening those manufacturers with patent litigation.
foxconn has also allegedly disseminated its plans to monopolize the usb connector industry through the press.in a february,article,a taiwanese trade press publication reported that foxconn was the first to obtain patents related to usb products,which would enable it initially to enjoy a monopolistic position.the article also indicated ominously,according to lotes that foxconn would definitely take note of whether its competitors usb products infringe its patents.id.
despite these worrisome signs,lotes attempted to secure a rand zero license from hon hai.on march,at hon hai request,lotes executed and returned a agreement to enable licensing negotiations to proceed.on april,hon hai outside counsel informed lotes that it was in the process of developing licensing agreements,and would be in contact in due course.but despite repeated inquiries from lotes over the months that followed,lotes never received a draft licensing agreement or any other further communication from hon hai or its licensing counsel.
on february,in an effort to quell concern about hon hai and foxconn commitment to their licensing obligations,counsel for foxconn electronics sent a letter,on hon hai letterhead,to the usb if president and chief operating officer.the letter stated that hon hai and foxconn were pleased to be active contributors of the usb project and early signers of the usb contributors agreement.the letter then unequivocally affirm ed foxconn commitment to license patent claims necessary to practice the usb standard on rand zero terms as required by the contributors agreement.id.in addition,the letter also unequivocally affirm ed that foxconn would provide rand licenses for other intellectual property that is not strictly necessary to practice the usb standard but that would be required to practice certain optional features.id.
these assurances notwithstanding,on july,foxconn kunshan filed patent infringement suits in china against two chinese subsidiaries of lotes.in their prayers for relief,these suits request orders enjoining two key lotes factories from making and selling certain usb connectors,as well as orders for the destruction of all existing infringing inventory and specialized manufacturing equipment.the patents asserted in these suits are jointly owned by foxconn kunshan and hon hai,and are derived from earlier patents filed in the united states.according to lotes,the asserted claims of these two patents fall within the defendants licensing obligations under the contributors agreement,and therefore must be licensed to lotes on rand zero terms.
lotes alleges that the defendants actions have resulted in confusion and uncertainty that has complicated and endangered all of lotes s existing and prospective business relationships.if allowed to continue,the defendants scheme will allegedly force lotes to close its factories,eliminate it as a major competitor,and enable the defendants to become the dominant supplier in the market for usb connectors.moreover,other firms will take note of lotes fate,and thus the defendants willingness to bring suit against lotes in contravention of the usb if rand zero terms has an in terrorem effect capable of curbing competitive manufacture across the full range of products incorporating usb connectors.
given the central role chinese manufacturing plays in the global electronics supply chain,moreover,lotes alleges that curbing competition in china will have downstream effects worldwide,including in the united states.in lotes view,because any price increases in usb connectors will inevitably be passed on through each stage in the production process to consumers in the united states,a nything that affects the price,quantity,or competitive nature of the production market for usb connectors will have a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on commerce.in this way,lotes contends that its lost sales and potential elimination as a competitor in china will damage competition,increase prices,and harm consumers in the united states.
ii.procedural history 
lotes filed suit against the defendants on october.on december,lotes filed the operative first amended complaint,which asserts federal claims for violations of sections and of the sherman act,and claims for breach of contract,promissory estoppel,tortious interference with contracts and prospective business relations,a declaration of waiver,and a declaration of a license for all necessary patent claims.on january,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,which lotes duly opposed.
on may,the district court issued an opinion and order dismissing the first amended complaint in its entirety with prejudice under rule b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.following this court decision in filetech,at,the district court held that the restrictions of the ftaia are jurisdictional.the district court further held that lotes had failed to plausibly allege the requisite direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic or import commerce under the ftaia,and therefore dismissed the sherman act claims.the district court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims,and denied lotes request for leave to amend.
the clerk entered final judgment on may.this appeal followed.

subject matter jurisdiction 
as a threshold matter,we must address whether the limitations on antitrust claims set forth in the ftaia are jurisdictional or substantive as codified in section of the sherman act,the ftaia provides 
sections to of this title shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce other than import trade or import commerce with foreign nations unless 
such conduct has a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect 
a on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations,or on import trade or import commerce with foreign nations or 
b on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations,of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the united states and 
such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of sections to of this title,other than this section.
if sections to of this title apply to such conduct only because of the operation of paragraph b,then sections to of this title shall apply to such conduct only for injury to export business in the united states.
the supreme court has explained this intricate provision as follows 
this technical language initially lays down a general rule placing all nonimport activity involving foreign commerce outside the sherman act reach.it then brings such conduct back within the sherman act reach provided that the conduct both sufficiently affects american commerce,it has a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on american domestic,import,or certain export commerce,and has an effect of a kind that antitrust law considers harmful,the effect must giv e rise to a sherman act claim.
hoffmann la roche empagran,quoting.
congress enacted this statute with two principal purposes in mind.first,the statute seeks to boost american exports by mak ing clear to american exporters and to firms doing business abroad that the sherman act does not prevent them from entering into business arrangements say,arrangements,however anticompetitive,as long as those arrangements adversely affect only foreign markets.empagran,at citing,at.second,congress sought to clarify the legal standard determining when american antitrust law governs foreign conduct,which different courts had articulated in somewhat different ways.see,at.congress thus designed the ftaia to clarify,perhaps to limit,but not to expand in any significant way,the sherman act scope as applied to foreign commerce.empagran,at emphasis omitted.
in filetech,this court held that the ftaia limitations on antitrust claims involving foreign commerce are jurisdictional.see filetech,at.following that binding decision,the district court below too treated the ftaia requirements as jurisdictional,though it acknowledged that current thinking may point against that position.lotes argues that the district court ruling was erroneous and that filetech is no longer good law in light of the supreme court intervening decisions in arbaugh and its progeny.we agree.
in arbaugh,the supreme court confronted the question of whether a particular requirement in title vii of the civil rights act of affects federal courts subject matter jurisdiction or is instead a substantive element of a claim on the merits.see at.in particular,title vii prohibits any employer from discriminating on protected grounds,a,and defines employer to include only those having fifteen or more employees,id.b.reversing the lower courts,the supreme court held that this requirement goes to the merits of a claim rather than the jurisdiction of the court.see arbaugh,at.in so holding,the court announced a readily administrable bright line for when statutory requirements are jurisdictional 
if the legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional,then courts and litigants will be duly instructed and will not be left to wrestle with the issue.but when congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.
id.at footnote and internal citation omitted.in just eight years since arbaugh,the supreme court has repeatedly applied this rule to find statutory requirements substantive rather than jurisdictional.see,auburn reg l.at time limit for filing an appeal to the provider reimbursement review board under the medicare statute morrison austrl.bank,extraterritorial reach of b of the securities and exchange act of reed elsevier,muchnick,registration requirement under the copyright act.
in general,a panel of this court is bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an en banc panel of our court or by the supreme court.in re zarnel,cir quoting united states.wilkerson,cir.however,where there has been an intervening supreme court decision that casts doubt on our controlling precedent,one panel of this court may overrule a prior decision of another panel.id.quoting gelman ashcroft,cir.in this instance,lacking the supreme court guidance and following the arguments of the parties before us,our decision in filetech treated the ftaia requirements as jurisdictional with little analysis.see filetech,at.that holding now has been thoroughly undermined by arbaugh and its progeny.
applying the teaching of the arbaugh line of cases,we have little difficulty concluding that the requirements of the ftaia go to the merits of an antitrust claim rather than to subject matter jurisdiction.nothing in the statute speak s in jurisdictional terms or refer s in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts.arbaugh,at quoting zipes trans world airlines.to the contrary,the statutory text refers to the conduct to which the sherman act appl ies.as the seventh circuit has noted,t his is the language of elements,not jurisdiction.minnchem,at.moreover,both courts of appeals to have addressed this issue after arbaugh have reached the same conclusion and have overruled their respective contrary precedents.see id.at animal sci,china minmetals,cir.to the extent it holds that the ftaia requirements are jurisdictional,filetech is no longer good law.
in urging a contrary conclusion,the defendants point to the structure of the sherman act,certain statements in the ftaia legislative history,principles of international comity,and dicta from the supreme court decision interpreting the ftaia in empagran.none of these considerations is sufficient to overcome the teaching of arbaugh and the clear text of the statute.
with respect to statutory structure,the defendants note that the ftaia imposes a unique,separately codified threshold requirement on antitrust claims involving foreign conduct.unlike claims involving purely domestic conduct,the ftaia bars claims based on foreign conduct from proceeding unless the foreign conduct has a cognizable effect on the united states.only if that prerequisite is satisfied may the plaintiff pursue a claim under the provisions of section to of the sherman act,other than the ftaia.
but it is hardly uncommon for congress to impose threshold requirements or to codify those requirements in separate provisions.in the copyright act,for example,the threshold requirement for a plaintiff to register his or her copyright before filing an infringement action is codified at a,separately from the general provisions governing infringement claims at.but that statutory structure did not prevent the supreme court in reed from finding the registration requirement nonjurisdictional.see reed,at.here,the ftaia unmistakably imposes unique threshold requirements on antitrust claims involving foreign conduct,but nothing in the statute even suggests much less clearly states,arbaugh,at that those requirements are jurisdictional.
the defendants reliance on the ftaia legislative history fares no better.the statutory text plainly uses the language of elements,not jurisdiction,minnchem,at,and courts do not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear.ratzlaf united states.moreover,when the supreme court has instructed that jurisdictional requirements must be clearly state d,arbaugh,at,looking beyond an unambiguously substantive statutory text is doubly unwarranted.
furthermore,while the defendants point out that portions of the legislative history employ jurisdictional language,other portions speak in merits terms and even to the extent the legislative history mentions jurisdiction,j urisdiction is a word of many,too many meanings.arbaugh,at quoting steel citizens for a better env t.indeed,the legal lexicon knows no word more than jurisdiction,united states yousef,wl,at cir,quoting united states sabella,cir,and the supreme court,no less than other courts,has sometimes been profligate in its use of the term,arbaugh,at.none of the jurisdictional references the defendants rely upon uses the term unambiguously to describe the adjudicative authority of courts rather than,somewhat less precisely,the prescriptive scope of law.see,at explaining that the statute addresses the subject matter jurisdiction of united states antitrust law emphasis added.given that the judiciary often conflated these concepts until the supreme court began in recent years to bring some discipline to the use of this term,henderson ex rel.henderson shinseki,congress loose language is hardly surprising.
similarly unpersuasive is the defendants invocation of the canon of statutory interpretation whereby courts ordinarily construe ambiguous statutes to avoid unreasonable interference with the sovereign authority of other nations.empagran,at.even assuming that construing the ftaia to be jurisdictional would serve the interests of international comity,the statute is not ambiguous.and even if it were ambiguous,the supreme court has specifically instructed us to treat statutory limitations as nonjurisdictional unless congress clearly states otherwise.arbaugh,at.
finally,the defendants point to two arguably jurisdictional statements from the supreme court decision in empagran.first,the court quoted a statement from the ftaia legislative history to the effect that there should be no american antitrust jurisdiction absent a direct,substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic commerce or a domestic competitor.at quoting,at.and second,the court approvingly quoted a statement from a fifth circuit decision,which reported finding no case in which jurisdiction was found in a case like empagran.id.at quoting den norske stats oljeselskap as heeremac vof,cir.we note that the court also quoted a treatise arguing that congress would not have intended the ftaia to provide worldwide subject matter jurisdiction to any foreign suitor wishing to sue its own local supplier for conduct that has independent effects on commerce.id.at quoting phillip areeda herbert hovenkamp,antitrust law,at supp.
but again,j urisdiction is a word of many,too many meanings.arbaugh,at quoting steel,at.and empagran was decided in,before arbaugh was handed down in,and the supreme court has confessed to being imprecise in its use of jurisdictional language prior to arbaugh.see arbaugh,at.furthermore,the jurisdictional references in empagran appear in quotations from other sources,and the opinion also contains language that describes the ftaia in decidedly nonjurisdictional terms.as the seventh circuit has noted,the court in empagran spoke,for example,of the ftaia removing from the sherman act reach certain types of conduct,and whether it was reasonable under the facts presented there to apply this law to conduct that is significantly foreign.minnchem,at quoting empagran,at.the defendants reliance on empagran is thus misplaced.
accordingly,notwithstanding our contrary prior decision in filetech,we are compelled under arbaugh and its progeny to conclude that the requirements of the ftaia are substantive and nonjurisdictional.
ii.waiver of the ftaia 
because we hold the requirements of the ftaia to be nonjurisdictional,we must address lotes argument that the defendants have waived those requirements by contract in this case.
in this regard,lotes points to five provisions of the contributors agreement.first,paragraph recites the contributors understanding that it is imperative that they and their representatives act in a manner which does not violate any state,federal or international antitrust laws and regulations.j.second,this paragraph also prohibits any communications regarding exclusion of competitors or any other topic that may be construed as a violation of antitrust laws.id.third,paragraph provides that the agreement is to be construed and controlled by new york law.fourth,paragraph provides that all disputes arising in any way out of this agreement shall be heard in,and all parties irrevocably consent to jurisdiction and venue in,the state and federal courts of new york,new york.id.and finally,paragraph provides that the obligations of the parties hereto shall be subject to all laws,present and future,of any government having jurisdiction over the parties hereto.id.according to lotes,these provisions establish that the defendants have agreed to subject their conduct to antitrust scrutiny.appellant br.at.
there are two fundamental problems with this argument.first and foremost,lotes did not raise this issue before the district court,and i t is a general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.bogleassegai connecticut,cir quoting greene united states,cir.
second,even if we were to exercise our discretion to consider this forfeited issue,see,lotes argument is meritless.even assuming arguendo that the substantive requirements of the ftaia are waivable,but see new york hill,a right conferred on a private party,but affecting the public interest,may not be waived or released if such waiver or release contravenes the statutory policy.emphasis omitted quoting brooklyn sav.bank,nothing in the cited contractual provisions suggests that the defendants have waived those requirements here.the first portion of paragraph merely recites the parties understanding that they are subject to various antitrust laws and regulations and affirms the parties commitment to abide by their existing legal obligations.the second portion of paragraph prohibits the parties from engaging in anticompetitive communications.paragraphs and are nothing more than standard and clauses.and paragraph again merely reiterates the parties existing obligation to comply with all applicable laws.
at most,paragraph and the first portion of paragraph can be read to recognize and incorporate into the contributors agreement the signatories preexisting obligations under antitrust law.but these contractual provisions do not waive any statutory requirements or otherwise alter the scope of the signatories legal obligations.put differently,the contributors agreement affirms that the defendants must abide by the sherman act to the extent it properly applies.but the defendants remain free to argue that,under the ftaia,the sherman act does not apply to or regulate the conduct at issue in this case.the defendants have not waived their defenses under the ftaia.
iii.direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect under the ftaia 
we now turn to the issue of whether lotes has plausibly alleged that the defendants anticompetitive conduct has a direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect on domestic or import commerce under the ftaia.the district court answered this question in the negative.lotes and amici contend that the district court erred by misinterpreting the ftaia and applying the wrong legal standard.we agree.
in dismissing lotes antitrust claims for failure to satisfy the ftaia domestic effects exception,the district court relied heavily on the ninth circuit decision in lsl,which construed the statutory requirement of a direct effect.see lsl,at.borrowing from a supreme court case interpreting a similar term in the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,the ninth circuit held that an effect is direct if it follows as an immediate consequence of the defendant activity.lsl,at citing republic of arg.weltover.applying that standard to this case,the district court below found a disconnect between the relevant foreign market as defined by plaintiff usb connectors the market which defendants are allegedly attempting to monopolize and the market supposedly affected by defendants attempted monopolization notebooks,desktop computers,servers.footnote omitted.the district court concluded that t o the extent that defendants foreign conduct may result in higher computer prices and less competition here in the,those effects are simply too attenuated to establish the proximate causation required by the ftaia.id.
the district court also expressed doubts about the substantiality of any domestic effects.distinguishing a decision of the northern district of california in in re tftlcd flat panel antitrust litigation,d,the district court noted that this case contains no allegations of direct,that usb connectors are only one small component of the finished computer products that are ultimately sold in the united states,and that lotes market share allegations lack particularity in some respects.the district court also observed that a whole host of factors other than the price of usb connectors influence the price of domestic computer products.the district court thus found that t he indirect effect of defendants conduct on prices of computer goods,if any,can not be quantified.id.this conclusion bolstered the district court ultimate finding that,a t most,defendants conduct may cause ripple effects in the united states,but such effects are simply too attenuated to bring plaintiff foreign injury within the ambit of the sherman act.id.
in applying the interpretation of direct effect set forth in lsl,whereby an effect is direct if it follows as an immediate consequence,the district court appears not to have considered the alternative approach advocated by the united states and the ftc and adopted by the seventh circuit in its en banc decision in minn chem.under that approach,the term direct means only a reasonably proximate causal nexus.minnchem,at quoting makan delrahim,drawing the boundaries of the sherman act recent developments in the application of the antitrust laws to foreign conduct,ann.surv.am.we agree with lotes and amici that this less stringent approach reflects the better reading of the statute.
the court in lsl relied on two interpretive sources for its contrary holding.first,it quoted webster third new international dictionary,which defines direct as proceeding from one point to another in time or space without deviation or interruption.lsl,at quoting webster third new int l dictionary.but the same dictionary also defines direct as characterized by or giving evidence of a close especially logical,causal,or consequential relationship.webster third new int l dictionary.although this is an alternative definition,the relative order of the common dictionary definitions of a single term does little to clarify that term meaning within a particular context.when a word has multiple definitions,usage determines its meaning.trs.of chic.truck drivers,helpers warehouse workers union indep.pension fund leaseway transp,cir 
the court in lsl also relied upon the supreme court interpretation of a nearly identical term in the fsia in weltover.lsl,at.but the supreme court has cautioned that courts must be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination.gross fbl fin,quoting fed.express holowecki.indeed,m ost words have different shades of meaning and consequently may be variously construed,not only when they occur in different statutes,but when used more than once in the same statute or even the same section.env.def.duke energy,quoting atl.cleaners dyers,united states.
here,both the purpose and the language of the fsia and ftaia differ in critical respects.with respect to purpose,the fsia codifies foreign nations sovereign immunity from suit,and provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this country.argentine republic amerada hess shipping.the boundaries of the statutory exceptions to sovereign immunity,including the direct effect exception construed in weltover,must be carefully patrolled to preserve the fsia general rule of immunity.in re terrorist attacks on,cir.the ftaia,by contrast,is a substantive antitrust statute designed to clarify the sherman act scope as applied to foreign commerce.empagran,at.
textually,moreover,weltover construed the fsia phrase direct effect,while the ftaia contains the fuller phrase direct,substantial,and reasonably foreseeable effect.even more to the point,the supreme court in weltover arrived at its understanding of direct effect in the fsia only after refusing to import from the statute legislative history any notion that an effect is direct only if it is also both substantial and foreseeable.see weltover,at.in the supreme court words w e reject the suggestion that a contains any unexpressed requirement of substantiality or foreseeability.id.at.only then did the supreme court endorse the lower court interpretation,whereby an effect is direct if it follows as an immediate consequence of the defendant activity.id.quoting weltover,republic of,cir.
this textual difference between the fsia and ftaia is critically important.as minnchem succinctly explains,
no one needs to read the words substantial and foreseeable into the ftaia.congress put them there,and in so doing,it signaled that the word direct used along with them had to be interpreted as part of an integrated phrase.superimposing the idea of immediate consequence on top of the full phrase results in a stricter test than the complete text of the statute can bear.
at.indeed,lsl reading of the ftaia would violate the cardinal principle of statutory construction that statutes must be construed,if reasonably possible,so that no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.trw andrews,quoting duncan walker.reading direct as immediate would rob the separate reasonabl e foreseeab ility requirement of any meaningful function,since we are hard pressed to imagine any domestic effect that would be both immediate and substantial but not reasonably foreseeable.furthermore,we must remember that i mport trade and commerce are excluded at the outset from the coverage of the ftaia in the same way that domestic interstate commerce is excluded.minnchem,at see also providing that,unless an exception applies,the sherman act shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce other than import trade or import commerce with foreign nations emphasis added.to demand that any domestic effect must follow as an immediate consequence of a defendant foreign anticompetitive conduct would all but collapse the ftaia dom
