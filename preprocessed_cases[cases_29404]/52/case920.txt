rené and raúl schneider,surviving sons of deceased chilean general rené schneider,together with josé pertierra,personal representative of the estate of general schneider,brought this action in united states district court for the district of columbia against the united states and henry kissinger,who at the time of the relevant events was the national security advisor to the president of the united states.the complaint alleged in nine counts,all of them directed against both defendants,that kissinger and the united states had caused,in conjunction with chilean persons not named as defendants,the kidnapping,torture,and death of decedent.the district court granted the motion of to dismiss appellants complaint pursuant to rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.plaintiffs filed this appeal.because we agree with the district court that the courts lack jurisdiction over nonjusticiable questions raised by the complaint,we affirm the grant of dismissal pursuant to rule b.
background 
appellants filed their original complaint on september,identifying their relationship to the deceased general and claiming against kissinger,the united states,and richard helms former director of the cia.that complaint alleged that in the leader of the chilean leftist coalition,salvador allende,won a slight plurality of the vote in chile presidential election,and that this victory on his part created the expectation that he would,in the following months,be ratified by the chilean congress as the first socialist president of the country.according to the complaint,k ey united states policymakers opposed the choice of allende as president of chile and on september,policymakers began the process of assessing the pros and cons and problems and prospects involved should a chilean military coup be organized with assistance.compl,appellees appendix app.at.after receiving further information,on september,defendants kissinger,helms,and attorney general john mitchell met with president nixon.the president ordered that steps be taken to prevent allende from becoming president,and specifically,that the cia was to play a direct role in organizing a military coup in chile and do quickly whatever was possible to prevent the seating of a possible socialist president.compl,app.at.the president expressed that he was not concerned about any risks involved,authorized million in funds to effect such a coup,and required a plan of action be drafted within hours.id.
the complaint further alleged that efforts to prevent allende from achieving the presidency proceeded on two tracks.track i was a covert political,economic,and propaganda campaign approved by a subcabinet level body of the executive established to exercise political control over covert operations abroad.compl,app.at.track ii activities were undertaken in direct response to the president september order and were directed towards actively promoting and encouraging the chilean military to move against allende.id.in the following months,the tracks moved together.the united states ambassador to chile was authorized to encourage a military coup and to intensify contacts with chilean military officers in order to ascertain their willingness to support such a coup.the ambassador was also authorized to make contacts in the chilean military aware that the military would receive no military assistance from the united states if allende became president of chile.the ambassador reported back that general schneider would be an impediment to achieving the goals outlined in the president directive,and that he would have to be neutralized.the complaint went on to allege particular acts undertaken in furtherance of the goal of establishing a military coup and claims for relief based on those actions,including the kidnapping,torture,and killing of general schneider.in all,the complaint alleged seven claims summary execution torture cruel,inhumane,or degrading treatment arbitrary detention wrongful death assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on november,plaintiffs responded on december,and defendants replied on january.also,in november,the attorney general submitted a certification that kissinger and helms were acting within the scope of federal employment at the time of the incident out of which plaintiffs claims arose.based on that certification,the attorney general asked the court to remove the individual defendants from the case under the westfall act,and substitute the united states.in response to the westfall certification and to helms october death,plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint on november.the amended complaint omitted the direct references to president nixon,deleted the deceased helms as a defendant,and added two new claims under the federal tort claims act,b,one for negligent failure to prevent summary execution,arbitrary detention,cruel,inhumane,or degrading treatment,torture,wrongful death,and assault and battery,and one for intentional infliction of emotional distress.am.compl,app.at.defendants renewed their motion to dismiss on december.plaintiffs responded to the motion on january.on march,the court granted the motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b on the basis that the political question doctrine rendered plaintiffs claims nonjusticiable.schneider kissinger,applying baker carr,d.in the alternative,the court held that the complaint failed under rule b because kissinger was immune under the westfall act,schneider,at,and the united states was immune as sovereign,id.at.the court noted early in its decision that it would rely on both the original and amended complaints in making its decision,because t he parties ask the court to consider all briefs,as they did not repeat their initial arguments in response to the amended complaint.id.at nn.
because we determine that the court correctly ruled that it lacked jurisdiction as a result of the application of the political question doctrine,we need not reach the alternate ground.we note in passing that some of the discussion of sovereign immunity and westfall questions bears on our application of the political question doctrine,but we need make no determination of the questions raised by those theories in light of the jurisdictional question that is determinative.
ii.the political question doctrine 
the principle that the courts lack jurisdiction over political decisions that are by their nature committed to the political branches to the exclusion of the judiciary is as old as the fundamental principle of judicial review.antolok united states,separate opinion of sentelle.in the venerable case of marbury madison,cranch,chief justice marshall first expressed the recognition by the judiciary of the existence of a class of cases constituting political act s,belonging to the executive department alone,for the performance of which entire confidence is placed by our constitution in the supreme executive and for any misconduct respecting which,the injured individual has no remedy.id.at.in a continuing line beginning with chief justice marshall analysis in marbury madison,this doctrine has evolved as a limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts particularly applicable to foreign relations.see oetjen cent.leather.chief justice marshall,writing again in united states palmer,wheat,described questions of foreign policy as belong ing more properly to those who can place the nation in such a position with respect to foreign powers as to their own judgment shall appear wise to whom are entrusted all its foreign relations then to that tribunal whose power as well as duty is confined to the application of the rule which the legislature may prescribe for it.id.at emphasis added.
contemporary application of the political question doctrine,as recognized by the district court,draws on the analysis set forth in baker carr,d.the baker court first recognized that the political question doctrine is primarily a function of the separation of powers.schneider kissinger,d at quoting baker,at.in baker,the supreme court enumerated six factors that may render a case nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine 
prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion or the impossibility of a court undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of respect due coordinate branches of government or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made or the potentiality of embarrassment of multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.
baker,at.the baker analysis lists the six factors in the disjunctive,not the conjunctive.to find a political question,we need only conclude that one factor is present,not all.nonetheless,we note that most of the factors counsel against the exercise of jurisdiction over the controversy that bring to the court.
textually demonstrable constitutional commitment to other branches 
first,the lawsuit raises policy questions that are textually committed to a coordinate branch of government.as the supreme court suggested in marbury and made clear in later cases,the conduct of the foreign relations of our government is committed by the constitution to the executive and legislative the political departments of the government,and the propriety of what may be done in the exercise of this political power is not subject to judicial inquiry or decision.oetjen,at.otherwise put,foreign policy decisions are the subject of just such a textual commitment,as contemplated in baker carr.comm.of united states citizens reagan.
absent precedent,there could still be no doubt that in the fields of foreign policy and national security is textually committed to the political branches of government.article i,section of the constitution provides an enumeration of powers of the legislature.that article is richly laden with delegation of foreign policy and national security powers.direct allocation of such power is found in section,clause,the congress shall have the power to provide for the common defence clause,to regulate commerce with foreign nations clause,to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offenses against the law of nations clause,to declare war,grant letters of marque and reprisal,and make rules concerning captures on land and water clause,to raise and support armies clause,to provide and maintain a navy clause,to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces clause,to provide for calling forth the militia to repel invasions clause,to provide for organizing,arming,and disciplining,the militia,and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the united states.
in addition to these direct allocations to the congress of these foreign relations and national security powers,other sections and clauses of article i bear on the subject to provide further weight to the conclusion of contextual allocation.for example,section of article i provides for the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus when in cases of invasion the public safety may require it.section allocates to the congress the authority to provide consent to individual states,without which they may not enter into any agreement or compact with a foreign power,or engage in war this is not to mention the perhaps less direct but undeniably real connection between national security and other powers of congress,such as that under article i,section,clause,to lay and collect taxes,and clause,to borrow money on the credit of the united states.
just as article i of the constitution evinces a clear textual allocation to the legislative branch,article ii likewise provides allocation of foreign relations and national security powers to the president,the unitary chief executive.article ii,section provides,inter alia,that the president shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states,and of the militia of the several states,when called into the actual service of the united states that same section further provides that the president shall have power,by and with the advice and consent of the senate,to make treaties,and to appoint ambassadors,other public ministers and consuls.section of article ii provides that he shall receive ambassadors and other public ministers and shall commission all the officers of the united states,including obviously the officers of the military.
while the language of textual commitment of the president is not as extensive as that relating to the legislative branch,nonetheless it is plain that that commitment is real.indeed,the supreme court has described the president as possessing plenary and exclusive power in the international arena and as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations united states export.
by contrast,in article iii defining the judicial power of the united states the closest there is to a reference to foreign relations is the extension of jurisdiction to cases affecting ambassadors,other public ministers and consuls,art.iii.obviously all this provides is jurisdiction for adjudication of cases against those officers.it provides no authority for policymaking in the realm of foreign relations or provision of national security.it can not then be denied that in the areas of foreign policy and national security is textually committed to the political branches.
neither can it be gainsaid that the subject matter of the instant case involves the foreign policy decisions of the united states.in,at the height of the cold war,officials of the executive branch,performing their delegated functions concerning national security and foreign relations,determined that it was in the best interest of the united states to take such steps as they deemed necessary to prevent the establishment of a government in a western hemisphere nation that in the view of those officials could lead to the establishment or spread of communism as a governing force in the americas.this decision may have been unwise,or it may have been wise.the political branches may have since rejected the approach,or not.in any event,that decision was classically within the province of the political branches,not the courts.as the supreme court has repeatedly reminded us,t he political question doctrine excludes from judicial review those controversies which revolve around policy choices and value determinations constitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of congress or the confines of the executive branch.japan whaling ass am.cetacean soc y,d.this is so because t he judiciary is particularly ill suited to make such decisions,as courts are fundamentally underequipped to formulate national policies or develop standards for matters not legal in nature.id.quoting united states ex rel.joseph cannon.
no judicially discoverable and manageable standards 
the second criterion of the baker six brings under the nonjusticiable umbrella of political question any case as to which there is a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.at.this factor,even taken apart from the first factor,supports the district court conclusion that this case must be dismissed under rule b.as the district court well understood,for a court to adjudicate this case would be for that court to undertake the determination of whether,years ago,at the height of the cold war between the united states and the western powers on the one hand and the expanding communist empire on the other,it was proper for an executive branch official to support covert actions against a committed marxist who was set to take power in a latin american country.schneider,d at.unlike the executive,the judiciary has no covert agents,no intelligence sources,and no policy advisors.the courts are therefore to displace the political branches in such.
as we have said before of other security considerations in another context,it is within the role of the executive to acquire and exercise the expertise of protecting national security.it is not within the role of the courts to executive judgments made in furtherance of that branch proper role.center for sec.studies dep t of justice.
appellants claim that the district court erred in holding that no standards exist for determining whether it was proper for an executive branch official to support covert actions against an undesirable figure who was set to take power in a foreign nation.schneider,d at.they assert that the district court misconstrued plaintiffs claims by framing the issue as an attack on policy.appellants br.at.however,it is not at all clear to us why appellants believe their suit to be anything other than such an attack.they claim that the circuit has held that courts should not invoke the political question doctrine to avoid adjudication of a violation of basic rights.id.however,the only case from this court which they offer for that proposition is ramirez de arellano weinberger.in fact,that case stands for nothing at all,as it was vacated by the supreme court in weinberger ramirez de arellano,d.after the remand,this court reversed and sent the case back to the district court for dismissal,with no reinstatement of the original opinion ever occurring.see ramirez de arellano weinberger.
in the district court,though not expressly before us,appellants had urged that the standards for evaluating wrongful death are well established and that the court need not depart from these in managing the instant action.schneider,d at.we agree with the district court that this formulation of the issues is no help.as the district court stated,r esolving the present lawsuit would compel the court,at a minimum,to determine whether actions or omissions by an executive branch officer in the area of foreign relations and national security were wrongful under tort law.id.at.we agree with the district court and the eleventh circuit in aktepe united states,cir,that recasting foreign policy and national security questions in tort terms does not provide standards for making or reviewing foreign policy judgments.in aktepe,the eleventh circuit considered a case brought by turkish sailors alleging injuries and wrongful death suffered as a result of missiles fired by a united states navy vessel during north atlantic treaty organization training exercises.in holding that the action was barred,inter alia,by the second baker political question factor,that circuit noted that in order to determine whether the navy conducted the drill in a negligent manner,a court would have to determine how a reasonable military force would have conducted the drill.id.the aktepe court went on to observe a s the supreme court noted in a related context,it is difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which the courts have less competence.id.quoting gilligan morgan,d.similarly here,in order to determine whether the covert operations which allegedly led to the tragic death of general schneider were wrongful,the court would have to define the standard for the government use of covert operations in conjunction with political turmoil in another country.there are no justiciably discoverable and manageable standards for the resolution of such a claim.
judicial resolution would require an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion 
without rehashing the constitutional separation of powers concerns raised by the two baker factors already discussed,we note that the same sort of problems raise the third factor as well.the district court well stated the matter 
p laintiffs contend that the court is not here asked to pass judgment on any perceived value or danger of the allende government to united states interests and need not make any policy determination.pls.opp.i at.while the plaintiffs are correct that the court might be able to avoid evaluating the merits of a potential allende government in,it would nonetheless be forced to pass judgment on the means used by the united states to keep that government from taking power.
schneider,d at.while we are not at all convinced that we would be able to avoid evaluating the merits of the potential allende government in,we are completely in agreement with the district court that we would be forced to pass judgment on the decision of the executive to use covert action to prevent that government from taking power.allying united states intelligence operatives with dissidents in another country to kidnap a national of that country may be a drastic measure.to determine whether drastic measures should be taken in matters of foreign policy and national security is not the stuff of adjudication,but of policymaking.as the supreme court has emphasized,the nuances of the foreign policy of the united states are much more the province of the executive branch and congress than of this court.crosby foreign trade council,d quoting container of am.franchise tax,d.
thus,we agree with the district court that the third baker factor also counsels against jurisdiction over this case.
the court could not proceed without expressing a lack of respect to coordinate branches of government 
from what we have concluded as to the first three baker factors,it seems apparent to us that we could not determine appellants claims without passing judgment on the decision of the executive branch to participate in the alleged covert in which,we note from the record,has already been the subject of congressional investigation.we therefore affirm the conclusion of the district court that a court should refrain from entertaining a suit if it would be unable to do so without expressing a lack of respect due to its coequal branches of government.d at citing baker carr,at.other citations omitted.
for the reasons set forth above,we conclude that at least the first four of the six baker factors compel a determination that this case raises political questions committed to the political branches and therefore is beyond the jurisdiction of the courts.appellants counter the government political question arguments by asserting that this case does not fall within the political question doctrine because there is a difference between policy and the implementation of policy,and the latter is within the realm of the judiciary to oversee.appellants br.at.for this proposition,they cite dkt memorial fund agency for int l,which stated,whereas attacks on foreign policymaking are nonjusticiable,claims alleging with the law are justiciable,even though the limited review that the court undertakes may have an effect on foreign affairs.at.
appellants are indeed correct that the dkt memorial opinion so stated.however,it did so on a record immediately distinguishable from the controversy raised by the present litigation.dkt memorial concerned not the executive making of a policy decision and implementing that decision,but rather a challenge to the constitutionality of the manner in which an agency sought to implement an earlier policy pronouncement by the president.indeed,after the jurisdictional decision in dkt memorial had ordered the matter remanded to the district court,the district court decision on remand came before this court in a second appeal.we then made plain the narrowness of our original jurisdictional holding 
in the present case,where the president acted under a congressional grant of discretion as broadly worded as any we are likely to see,and where the exercise of that discretion occurs in the area of foreign affairs,we can not disturb his decision simply because some might find it unwise or because it differs from the policies pursued by previous administrations.
dkt memorial fund agency for int l development.thus,our ultimate disposition of the dkt memorial question supports rather than undermines the district court holding that the present case falls within the realm of nonjusticiable political questions first recognized in marbury madison and delineated in baker carr.
iii.other issues 
appellants halfheartedly make an argument that the actions of defendant kissinger in the matter were ultra vires.apparently it is their contention that,as
