on this appeal,we consider challenges to an award of summary judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york forrest,which forfeited to the united states various claimants interests in multiple properties,including a office building located at fifth avenue in manhattan the building,real properties in maryland,texas,california,virginia,and new york,and the contents of several bank accounts,collectively,defendant properties.we also consider challenges to the september,order denying a motion to suppress evidence seized from the alavi foundation and the fifth avenue company office.three concerns prompt us to vacate the judgment as to claimants alavi foundation alavi or the foundation and the fifth avenue company fifth or the partnership,of which alavi is a owner 
first,we identify material issues of fact as to whether the alavi foundation knew that assa corporation,its partner in the fifth.partnership,continued after,to be owned or controlled by bank melli iran,which is itself owned or controlled by the government of iran,a designated threat to this nation national security.see exec.order,fed.reg.accordingly,we vacate summary judgment and remand the case for trial as to the alavi foundation and fifth 
second,we conclude that the district court erred in sua sponte considering and rejecting the claimants possible statute of limitations defense without affording notice and a reasonable time to respond.thus,we vacate that part of the judgment without prejudice for reconsideration on proper notice and hearing.
third,in rejecting the claimants motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a challenged warrant,the district court erred in ruling that the claimants civil discovery obligations obviate the need for any fourth amendment analysis.in re fifth avenue and related properties,supp,in re fifth suppression decision.the fourth amendment exclusionary rule applies in civil forfeiture cases,and a party civil discovery obligations do not automatically render fourth amendment rights and remedies inapplicable.we likewise identify error in the district court alternative ruling that every item of unlawfully seized evidence would have been inevitably discovered.while discovery obligations might shield unlawfully seized items from suppression under the inevitable discovery doctrine,see united states eng,cir,such a conclusion requires a district court,for each particular piece of evidence,specifically to analyze and explain how,if at all,discovery of that piece of evidence would have been more likely than not inevitable absent the challenged search,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.because the record fails to demonstrate that particularized review,we remand to allow the district court to conduct the requisite analysis.on remand,the government may also pursue its argument raised before the district court and on appeal that the exception to suppression applies in this case.see united states leon.
accordingly,we vacate the district court challenged judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
we of course view the record in the light most favorable to the claimants,who are appealing from an adverse grant of summary judgment.lombard hamilton,cir.accord cortes mta new york city transit,cir.
i.the alavi foundation 
the alavi foundation traces its origins to,when the shah of iran,mohammad reza pahlavi,incorporated the eponymous pahlavi foundation as a new york corporation,and endowed it with several million dollars.the pahlavi foundation stated mission was,inter alia,t o render support and assistance for the study and promotion of the arts and sciences and to support established charitable,philanthropic,educational and civic endeavors.app x.in,the pahlavi foundation acquired property at fifth avenue in new york city the property.in,at the direction of the shah,bank melli a bank wholly owned by the iranian government loaned the pahlavi foundation million,thus providing the foundation with funds to construct a office tower on the property,the building,and bank melli with two mortgages on that property 
following the iranian revolution,which deposed the shah,iran new supreme leader,ayatollah ruhollah khomeini,ordered the formation of the bonyad mostazafan,an entity charged with managing property expropriated by the revolutionary government,including that at fifth avenue.in,the pahlavi foundation was renamed the mostazafan foundation of new york.the foundation took on its present name in 
since its inception,alavi has purchased and maintained several properties in the united states.in addition to the building,alavi acquired seven real properties in the and,including two parcels of land in rockville,maryland,one property in houston,texas,one property in carmichael,california,two parcels of land in prince william county,virginia,and one block of lots in queens,new york collectively,alavi real properties.
alavi bylaws state that its board controls the organization affairs and property and appoints corporate officers and directors,while its president supervises operations and reports to the board.the bylaws make alavi board and president responsible for,inter alia,operational decisions such as charitable efforts,personnel decisions,and program management.consistent with new york law,see.law,mckinney,alavi has never had formal owners,members,or shareholders.the record reflects that alavi remains a corporation in good standing,and new york regulatory authorities have never sought to dissolve or remove the organization corporate status,or taken any action against alavi,its directors,officers,or employees.
ii.the fifth avenue company 
fifth is a partnership created under new york law in as part of a plan to relieve alavi of certain tax obligations.although alavi has always been a organization,as a result of bank melli mortgages on the property,rental income from the building was taxable as unrelated business income.as explained by the iranian deputy prime minister and of the bonyad mostazafan in a july,letter to the prime minister,one of the major problems of the new york mostazafan foundation stem med from the debt it owe d to the new york branch of melli bank because the resulting tax obligations left insufficient funds for the foundation to provide million in services as required by its articles of association.supp.app x.thus,alavi,together with the government of iran,the bonyad mostazafan,and,ultimately,bank melli,sought to eliminate the tax obligation.
in his july,letter,the deputy prime minister proposed a series of transactions that would allow alavi to pay off the bank melli debt using money from the government of iran.first,he proposed creating company a in new york and transferring to it both ownership of the building and the bank melli loan.second,he proposed establishing company b in europe with anonymous shares.supp.app.third,he proposed allocating million to the bonyad mostazafan,which would then loan the sum to company b to purchase of company a stock from alavi.these transactions would thereby permit permitting alavi to pay off the bank melli loans.this plan was to be executed in but when that failed to occur,apparently due to bank melli failure timely to resolv e the issue of a partnership in the foundation building,app x,alavi and the bonyad mostazafan began considering alternatives.
in may,seyed mohammad badr taleh badr,then alavi managing director,met with representatives of the bonyad mostazafan and bank melli.meeting minutes reveal that the participants agreed substantially to carry out the plan by forming a company o n behalf of bank melli that would make partnership with alavi in order to alleviate alavi tax obligations.app x see also app x minutes from meeting between alavi and bank melli explaining that melli entered into partnership with alavi to save the foundation and prevent it from paying million in annual taxes.to accomplish this partnership,bank melli would establish a company in jersey island,and the established company via other company will participate with the ny foundation.app x.
in light of these tax concerns and the agreed solution,the company in jersey island was formed as assa company limited assa limited in,which then and to this day wholly owns the other company incorporated in new york,assa corporation together,assa.the understanding,as evident from a letter in which an assistant director of the bonyad mostazafan explained the partnership,was that assa belong ed to bank melli.app x.indeed,assa was the vehicle by which bank melli carried out the series of circular transactions that effectively relieved alavi of its tax obligations without surrendering melli interests in alavi income.as explained in bank melli correspondence,bank melli financed assa limited,assa corporation purchased a share in the fifth.partnership from alavi,and alavi used the funds to pay off the bank melli mortgages.see app x.pursuant to the partnership agreement,alavi contributed the building,then valued at approximately million,to the newly formed fifth,while assa contributed million in cash,which assa had received from bank melli and which alavi returned to bank melli as payment for its mortgage debt 
in october,alavi and assa formed a partnership under new york law known as the fifth.in securing the requisite leave of the new york supreme court for a transaction divesting all,or substantially all,assets of a organization,see.law a,mckinney,alavi badr stated in a verified petition that assa corporation was owned by assa limited,which was in turn beneficially owned by two individuals,mohammad behdadfar and mohsen kakavand,and that the formation of the partnership represent ed an transaction.app x.the filing explained that the fifth partnership was formed to resolve alavi tax liability arising from the building rental income,which had been taxable as unrelated business income.app x.no mention was made of bank melli relationship to assa.
based on their initial contributions,alavi received a interest and assa received a interest in fifth.alavi later sold a further to assa alavi now holds of the interest in the partnership,while assa holds.based on their ownership interests,alavi and assa received pro rata distributions of fifth income from the building.between and,the building generated approximately million in annual revenues.between and,the building generated between million and million in annual revenues.thus,through the circular transactions just discussed,instead of alavi owing a mortgage debt of approximately million to bank melli,bank melli owned and,later,of the building,initially valued at million,and received a commensurate share of that building substantial and now rental income.since the partnership founding and until commencement of these forfeiture proceedings,alavi served as fifth managing partner,administering the affairs of the partnership,including management of the building.
iii.iran involvement with alavi,assa,and fifth.before 
as the preceding section shows,there is ample evidence of bank melli involvement with alavi,assa,and fifth before.see,app x bonyad mostazafan correspondence explaining that the partnership between alavi and assa is based on prior agreements between the ministry of finance,bank melli iran,and bonyad mostazafan app x bank melli correspondence explaining that structure of assa entities was based on ample study at the new york foundation,the central office of the foundation,and bank melli in tehran.record evidence further shows that after assa formation and prior to,bank melli and assa maintained a close and at times inseparable relationship.indeed,bank melli had a substantial ownership interest in assa from its founding through.from until,two bank melli officials indirectly held approximately of assa total shares through another straw entity,harter holdings harter holdings,split equally.in,the officials shares were transferred to bank melli iran,which then held the indirect interest in assa until 
record evidence indicates that bank melli sought to conceal its ownership of assa through these arrangements.see app x bank melli correspondence dated december,explaining that bank melli took over ownership of assa limited and harter holdings because,with channel islands incorporation,accessing the ownership backgrounds of the companies behind the captioned corporation is not an easy task for investigators,and questioning whether naghshineh the assa corp new york director whose affiliation with the bank could be easily proven could be replaced with another individual whose affiliation with the bank could not be easily proven app x bank melli correspondence dated june,discussing risk of seizure of elements connected to the islamic republic of iran assets in the united states,and asking its new york office to estimate percentage of risk of the seizure of properties in case of the revelation of the ownership by assa corporation.
several letters between alavi and bank melli officials also indicate that they viewed assa as interchangeable with bank melli before.moreover,in,representatives for alavi and bank melli met in tehran to discuss fifth need for a million loan.meeting minutes reflect that bank melli representative confirmed bank melli commitment to stand by alavi and to approve the loan if alavi adopted a specific plan to pay the debt it owed to assa.
record evidence also indicates that,in addition to bank melli,other iranian government officials exercised some control over alavi and fifth affairs before.from approximately to,a bonyad mostazafan employee,seyed mojtaba,sat on alavi board and,every three months,provided reports about alavi to the prime minister of iran or the head of the bonyad mostazafan moreover,minutes from a meeting in zurich,switzerland indicate that alavi board of directors made changes in the board composition as directed by the supreme leader of iran,ostensibly referring to the ayatollah.app x.in a subsequent letter to the ayatollah,alavi managing director,badr,expressed concern that iran ambassador to the united nations would exercise a position of responsibility connected to alavi affairs going forward.app x.in a subsequent letter to an individual named sobhani,badr stated that,as a result of inadvisable actions taken by former executive directors of alavi and iran ambassador,both the foundation and the assets of bank melli will face obliteration.app x.that letter further explained that if the connection between alavi and the government of iran were discovered,board members,including,could be culpable of a heavy offence.app x.
iv.sanctions against iran 
in march six years after fifth formation president clinton issued a series of executive orders pursuant to the international emergency economic powers act ieepa,formally declaring the government of iran a threat to national security and imposing broad financial sanctions.see exec.order,fed.reg,exec.order,fed.reg.may.those executive orders authorized the secretary of the treasury,in consultation with the secretary of state,to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the financial sanctions.
pursuant to that authority,the treasury department office of foreign assets control ofac determined that bank melli was owned or controlled by the government of iran,thus subjecting it to,among other things,limitations on the receipt of services from financial institutions beginning june,except as authorized by an ofac license.see implementation of executive order with respect to iran,fed.reg.ofac also subsequently promulgated a series of iranian transactions regulations itrs relevant to this action,which took effect on august,and which generally prohibit united states entities from conducting business with or providing services to the government of iran.the government of iran is defined in the itrs as t he state and the government of iran,as well as any political subdivision,agency,or instrumentality thereof,a ny person owned or controlled,directly or indirectly,by the foregoing,and a ny person acting or purporting to act,directly or indirectly,for or on behalf of the foregoing.see id.alavi and fifth are united states entities subject to these orders and regulations and prohibited thereby from conducting business with or providing services to bank melli or any other instrumentality owned or controlled by,or acting on behalf of,the government of iran 
bank melli relationship with fifth.after 
in,after the first of the relevant executive orders imposing sanctions on iran was issued,bank melli formally divested its ownership of assa.bank melli harter holdings shares were acquired by two individuals,davood shakeri and fatemeh aghamiri.together,shakeri and aghamiri indirectly held of assa shares until,when they directly acquired of assa shares proffered records indicate that shakeri and aghamiri acquired their shares in harter holdings and in assa for app x.shakeri and aghamiri directly held of assa shares until 
in support of its claim that bank melli nevertheless continued to exercise control over assa after,the government primarily relied on two categories of evidence emails from hassan dehghani tafti tafti,assa sole representative in the united states tafti emails and notes purportedly from a meeting between alavi new president,farshid jahedi jahedi,and iran ambassador to the united nations,mohammad khazaee khazaee khazaee jahedi meeting.
tafti emails 
in,tafti sent three emails to mohsen ghadimipour,then head of bank melli overseas network supervisory department onsd.first,in february,tafti requested,inter alia,that onsd provide him with the signature of the assa share holders,aghamiri and shakeri.app x.second,in july,tafti advised ghadimipour that the share holders are forbidden from having residences in iran,and as per the view of the legal experts,the united states may freeze the capital of the share holders.app x.tafti requested that onsd make some arrangement that the residence location of the share holders of assa,davood shakeri and aghamiri be changed to another country.app x.finally,also in july,tafti wrote ghadimipour that c hanging the share holder of assa is possible,but the share holder should reside in a tax free country.otherwise,the country of residence will collect a tax from the income of the share holder.app x.the government argues that these communications show that assa record owners were only fronts for bank melli,which continued to control assa holdings in fifth.the august response tafti received is further evidence of bank melli control with reference to the email of,regarding the location of residence of the shareholders,this is to inform you that,as per the orders of the bank manager,until the appointment of the qualified individuals,act as before.app x emphasis added.although this email and three others in the record indicate that they were sent by or,in some,from tafti to the shareholders of assa,each bore the same email on several of the ghadimipour emails,see,app x.
khazaee jahedi meeting 
in,certain alavi board members and president jahedi met with ambassador khazaee at the ambassador residence.the record does not indicate the purpose of the meeting,how it was arranged,or what,if any,action was taken as a result of the meeting.the government nevertheless maintains that two sets of meeting notes support its contention that khazaee instructed jahedi with respect to the management of alavi.
the first set of notes,dated october,bears the heading board meeting,references khazaee and jahedi,and includes,inter alia,the following statements s hould only allocate to shiites,app x assa daily expenses payments investment policy,app x,the composition of the board of trustees whatever i decide should be approved and it should not be otherwise,app x and i have to definitely see the proposed allocations before a final decision is reached.i have to be kept informed and i have to be able to state my opinion in order for you to make a decision,app x emphasis in original.although the authorship of these notes is unknown,the government submits that their content supports an inference that they were taken by alavi president jahedi and that the speaker referenced therein is khazaee.
the second set of notes is from the journal of alavi secretary,alireza ebrahimi ebrahimi and references dates that do not match the purported october meeting shortly after the heading alireza ebrahimi journal,summer are three other dates,friday,july,sunday,july,and sunday,august.app x.these notes contain stray statements that may indicate a desire to sell bank melli share in assa.one statement reads,kharrazi assa share sell it,app x,and another reads,zarif assa bank melli share i can not sleep at night the issue of board of trustees will be solved,when transfer,app x.
vi.procedural history 
a.the initial civil forfeiture complaint 
on december,the united states filed this civil action in the southern district of new york seeking forfeiture of property owned by assa and bank melli based on violations of the ieepa,et,and.simultaneously,the treasury department added assa to the specially designated nationals sdn list based on its determination that assa is a front company for bank melli although the initial complaint recounted the history of alavi and fifth,it did not seek forfeiture of either entity property.that same day,however,district judge holwell entered a protective order prohibiting,inter alia,a ll persons and entities having actual knowledge of the order,which included alavi and fifth,from destroy ing any documents relating in any manner or part to the allegations in the complaint,including but not limited to the books and records of the fifth avenue company,the pahlavi foundation,the mostazafan foundation,the alavi foundation,assa corporation,assa company,bank melli.app x.in addition to the preservation requirements,the order required fifth but not alavi to make its books and records available for inspection to the united states.app x.
b.the separate criminal investigation 
also on december,the government served a grand jury subpoena on alavi,seeking evidence of ieepa violations and money laundering.the government sought any and all documents relating or referring to the fifth,assa,and bank melli iran,from january,to the present.app x.the subpoena was served on alavi president jahedi.the following day,agents of the federal bureau of investigation fbi observed jahedi throwing papers responsive to the subpoena into a public trash bin.jahedi subsequently pled guilty to obstruction of justice for these actions and was sentenced to three months imprisonment.judgment,united states jahedi,ecf see also united states jahedi,supp.the fbi ultimately retrieved the documents discarded by jahedi.although the government submitted photographs of the torn documents in connection with its opposition to claimants motion to suppress,the documents themselves were not submitted by the government in support of its motion for summary judgment as to the forfeitability of the defendant properties.
c.the criminal search warrant 
on december,the day after jahedi attempted destruction of documents,the fbi sought,obtained,and executed a criminal search warrant for the offices of alavi and fifth.magistrate judge theodore katz issued the warrant,which referenced supporting a ffidavit s made before me by special agent george ennis that he has reason to believe that listed property is now being concealed at the addresses specified to be searched.app x.in boilerplate language,the warrant stated that the magistrate judge was satisfied that there is probable cause to believe that the property so described is being concealed on the premises and that the grounds for application for issuance of the search warrant exist as stated in the supporting affidavit s.app x.it then authorized the fbi to search and seize 
any and all documents or records concerning or relating to the ownership of,rental of,mortgaging of,or investing in assa,fifth,or bank melli iran.
any and all documents concerning or relating to financial books and records,bank accounts,disbursements,money transfers or employment records of assa,fifth,alavi,or bank melli iran or any of the officers and employees of these entities.
any and all computers central processing units external and internal drives external and internal storage equipment or media computerized data storage devices hard disks or floppy disks and related or connected computer or data storage equipment.
app x.the warrant does not identify the crimes for which agents were authorized to search or seize the listed property.nor does the warrant place any temporal limit on the property to be seized.
the ennis affidavit supporting the warrant described the history of alavi,including the tax issue that led to the formation of fifth.moreover,unlike the search warrant,the ennis affidavit stated that the property sought constituted evidence of,among other crimes,violations of the ieepa,the itrs,and.it explained as follows 
in,ofac identified bank melli and its offices worldwide as entities owned or controlled by the government of iran.part,app.accordingly,bank melli is subject to the iranian transactions regulations itr,title united states code of federal regulations,part,and assa interest in the building and its rents is subject to civil forfeiture,as fully set forth in the attached december,civil complaint 
a lthough the property and funds which are subject to forfeiture belong to bank melli and its related entities,the transactions underlying bank melli acquisition of its interest in the building were not an transaction with alavi,but rather were structure d both to evade alavi tax liability and to conceal bank melli interest in the building.accordingly,i submit that there is probable cause to believe that alavi committed the same crimes alleged as a basis for the forfeiture sought in the original complaint,and that alavi and its directors,employees,and other agents,committed,conspired to commit,and aided and abetted the same violations by alavi and bank melli,among others.
the warrant was executed on claimants offices the day it was obtained.the fbi seized nearly all computers,servers,and electronic storage devices found therein,along with over two hundred boxes of papers,records,and other tangible materials,some documents dating back thirty years.
d.the amended civil forfeiture complaint 
almost a year after the search of claimants offices,on november,the government filed an amended civil forfeiture complaint,adding alavi and fifth properties as.in total,the government sought forfeiture of a ll right,title,and interest of alavi,fifth,assa,and bank melli iran,and all property traceable thereto,the building,including all improvements and attachments,and all property traceable thereto,the alavi real properties,with all improvements and attachments thereon,and the contents of nine bank accounts,and all funds traceable thereto.the government asserted that the defendant properties are forfeitable as proceeds of violations of the ieepa and certain itrs issued by the department of the treasury and as proceeds traceable to property involved in money laundering.the parties engaged in discovery for nearly four years thereafter.
judgment creditor actions 
soon after the government filed its initial forfeiture complaint,various plaintiff groups began to file actions against assa,alavi,and fifth,seeking attachment and turnover of defendants properties to satisfy judgments obtained against iran under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia for acts of terrorism.those judgment creditor actions generally allege that assa,alavi,and fifth are sufficiently related to iran to render their property subject to turnover pursuant to the fsia,see a,g,and the terrorism risk insurance act of tria,pub,stat,codified at note.although not at issue in the instant appeal,these judgment creditor actions are here relevant to the extent that,before the district court,they were consolidated with the civil forfeiture action for purposes of motions and,if necessary,trial 
f.the district court judgments 
since its commencement in,this forfeiture action has generated numerous decisions by the district court.as relevant here,on september,the district court denied alavi and fifth motion to suppress evidence seized during the december search,which they alleged violated their fourth amendment rights.see in re fifth suppression decision,supp.on september,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the united states,forfeiting all of assa,alavi,and fifth interests in the defendant properties,with the exception of the alavi real properties and three bank accounts.in re fifth avenue and related properties,civ.kbf,wl,at,in re fifth summary judgment decision.in granting summary judgment,the district court sua sponte raised and rejected the claimants possible statute of limitations defense.id.at.on april,the district court granted summary judgment to the government as to the alavi real properties and three bank accounts.in re fifth avenue and related properties,civ.kbf,wl,at.finally,on may,at alavi and fifth request,the district court entered final judgment as to the government claims of forfeiture against these claimants properties.see fed.civ.b permitting entry of final judgment as to fewer than all claims or parties upon finding of no just reason for delay see order,in re fifth avenue and related properties,civ.kbf may,ecf rule b judgment,in re fifth avenue and related properties may,ecf.alavi and fifth timely appealed,challenging the final summary forfeiture judgment of their interests in the defendant properties,and the denial of their motion to suppress.
discussion 
i.the government forfeiture claims 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and will affirm only when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.a see vincent money store,cir.in determining whether there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact,we resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.mhany,cty.of nassau,cir.
in civil forfeiture proceedings,the government bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the property at issue is subject to forfeiture.c accord united states sum of united states currency,cir.to carry this burden it must show that the property is more likely than not forfeitable.see united states funds in the amount of one hundred thousand one hundred and twenty dollars,cir.explaining in civil forfeiture action that preponderance standard requires showing that property is more likely than not subject to forfeiture united states coppola,cir.stating that preponderance finding satisfied if fact existence was more likely than not quoting united states hertular,cir.upon such a showing,the burden then shifts to the claimant to show a triable issue as to whether it was an innocent owner,that the claimant had no knowledge of the predicate illegal activity.see united states funds held in the name or for the benefit of wetterer,cir.
a.the ieepa theory of forfeiture 
the government first civil forfeiture claim arises under the ieepa,a federal statute that empowers the president of the united states to employ economic sanctions and other measures to deal with threats to this nation security,foreign policy,or economy,which have their source in whole or substantial part outside the united states,and for which he has declared a national emergency.the relevant civil forfeiture statute states 
a the following property is subject to forfeiture to the united states 
c any property,real or personal,which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to any offense constituting specified unlawful activity as defined in section c of this title,or a conspiracy to commit such offense.
a c.section c defines specified unlawful activity to include offenses under section relating to penalties of the international emergency economic powers act.id.c d.section of the ieepa makes it unlawful for a person to violate,attempt to violate,conspire to violate,or cause a violation of any license,order,regulation,or prohibition issued under this chapter,a,and provides for both civil and criminal penalties,see id.b providing civil fine of or amount twice transaction on which violation is based id.c providing for up to years imprisonment and criminal fine up to.the orders,regulations,and prohibitions referenced in section are set forth in several executive orders and related itrs promulgated by ofac.this chain of interlocking statutes can thus be summarized as follows property that constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to violations of executive orders and itrs promulgated pursuant to the ieepa is subject to forfeiture.see a c id.c d.
in,president clinton,acting pursuant to his authority under the ieepa,issued two executive orders relevant to the present action.executive order found that the actions and policies of the government of iran constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,foreign policy,and economy of the united states,and declared a national emergency to deal with that threat.exec.order,fed.reg.executive order imposed broad financial sanctions on iran,including a prohibition on the exportation from the united states to iran,the government of iran,or to any entity owned or controlled by the government of iran,or the financing of such exportation,of any goods,technology or services.exec.order,fed.reg,may,
pursuant to the ieepa and executive orders and,in september,ofac promulgated the five itrs that the government alleges alavi and fifth co violated in this case,thereby rendering the defendant properties forfeitable under a c as proceeds traceable to ieepa violations.in relevant part,the five itrs state 
a any transaction on or after october,that evades or avoids,has the purpose of evading or avoiding,causes a violation of,or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this part is prohibited.b any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this part is prohibited.
t he exportation,reexportation,sale,or supply,directly or indirectly,from the united states,or by a united states person,wherever located,of any goods,technology,or services to iran or the government of iran is prohibited,including the exportation,reexportation,sale,or supply of any goods,technology,or services to a person in a third country undertaken with knowledge or reason to know that 
a such goods,technology,or services are intended specifically for supply,transshipment,or reexportation,directly or indirectly,to iran or the government of iran id.
n o united states person,wherever located,may engage in any transaction or dealing in or related to 
a goods or services of iranian origin or owned or controlled by the government of iran 
b goods,technology,or services for exportation,reexportation,sale or supply,directly or indirectly,to iran or the government of iran.id.
a ny new investment by a united states person in iran or in property including entities owned or controlled by the government of iran is prohibited.id.
n o united states person,wherever located,may approve,finance,facilitate,or guarantee any transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by this part if performed by a united states person or within the united states.id.
with respect to these itrs,ofac has defined the government of iran to include a ny person owned or controlled,directly or indirectly by t he state and the government of iran,as well as any political subdivision,agency,or instrumentality thereof.id.ofac has further stated that the term entity owned or controlled by the government of iran includes any corporation,partnership,association,or other entity in which the government of iran owns a percent or greater interest or a controlling interest,and any entity which is otherwise controlled by that government.id.it is undisputed that bank melli,a bank owned by the iranian government,is the government of iran under the itrs.see see also implementation of executive order with respect to iran,fed.reg,determining bank melli to be owned or controlled by the government of iran.
for the government to succeed on summary judgment on its forfeiture claim against the defendant properties as proceeds of ieepa violations under the civil forfeiture statute,a c,it must show there is no triable issue that the defendant properties either constitute proceeds or are derived from proceeds that are traceable to a violation or a conspiracy to violate the relevant executive orders and implementing itrs.id.a c.
the government ieepa theory of forfeiture can be summarized as follows the defendant properties are forfeitable as proceeds traceable to alavi provision of services to its fifth partner assa,which violates the itrs because assa is a front for bank melli,which is an instrumentality of the government of iran to demonstrate a violation of any one of the implementing itrs on this theory,and hence to satisfy step three of the civil forfeiture statute,the government had to show that no triable issue exists as to whether assa was owned or controlled by the government of iran after,see see also id,and alavi provided services to assa after knowing it was so owned or controlled for the reasons set forth herein,we conclude that the government carried its burden as to the first requirement,but that triable issues of fact as to the second preclude an award of summary judgment in its favor therefore,because we identify material questions of disputed fact at the third step of analysis as to claimants mens rea,we vacate the summary judgment award forfeiting their interests in the defendant properties and remand for further proceedings.
ownership and control 
claimants argue that the district court erred in concluding,as a matter of law,that bank melli owned assa after.in so arguing,they rely on corporate records showing that bank melli sold its interest in assa to shakeri and aghamiri in,testimony from a former bank melli employee who stated that he understood that melli was required by law to divest its ownership in assa after five years,and testimony from another former bank melli employee that he was unaware of any relationship between melli and assa after.the argument fails because the records do not show a bona fide transfer in that they report only trivial consideration for an entity worth tens of millions of dollars.further belying a bona fide transfer is bank melli strong motive to conceal its continued ownership of assa after changes in law,previous use of straw entities to conceal its ownership interests,and documented continued involvement with assa after,while evading inquiries about the straw owners.on this record,even draw ing all reasonable inferences in claimants favor,mhany,at,the evidence on which they rely is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to bank melli ownership and control of assa.
first,assuming the admissibility of the proffered corporate records showing that bank melli divested its ownership interest in assa in,those records do not raise a question of fact precluding summary judgment because they fail to indicate a bona fide transaction rather,they show that shakeri and aghamiri each acquired shares first in harter holdings and then in assa for a total of.given that assa had assets worth approximately million,that consideration is so trivial as to belie a bona fide transfer.see united states premises and real property with buildings,appurtenance and improvements at delaware street,tonawanda,new york,cir.delaware street upholding finding that a father was straw owner of home transferred to him by arrested son for to avoid forfeiture united states reckmeyer,cir.explaining that third party can avoid forfeiture of property under by establishing that he is bona fide purchaser for value,he gave value to the defendant in an arms length transaction with the expectation that he would receive equivalent value in return emphasis added even if it is possible that the corporate records do not reflect the true price shakeri and aghamiri paid for assa,such a possibility is necessarily speculative in the absence of any other record evidence of the transfer price.see,distiso cook,cir.explaining that court reviewing motion for summary judgment can not credit a nonmovant merely speculative or conclusory assertions.
second,the record shows that bank melli had a strong motive in for concealing its continuing ownership and control of assa behind straw purchasers.president clinton executive orders and related itrs prohibited united states entities,such as alavi,from providing services to instrumentalities of the government of iran,such as melli,or entities fronting for it,as assa had from its creation.see exec.order,fed.reg,exec.order,fed.reg.may,iranian transactions regulations implementation of executive orders and,fed.reg.indeed,soon after the orders,ofac formally identified bank melli as owned or controlled by the government of iran,see implementation of executive order,fed.reg,thereby making it illegal for melli to own an interest in fifth.
third,even if the sanctions could admit an inference of true divestiture in order to comply with law,such an inference is not reasonable here.not only did the recorded consideration for bank melli assa holdings not reflect a bona fide sale,but record evidence demonstrates that,well before,bank melli had concealed its ownership and control of assa while still profiting from income.in,bank melli on behalf of iran,created a chain of straw entities stretching from the jersey islands to the united states,assa corporation,assa limited,harter holdings,fifth that it used to effect circular money transfers that allowed alavi to discharge its mortgage debt to melli and thereby avoid tax obligations on building income,while effectively transferring a subsequently interest in that property and its income to bank melli and thereby to iran.thus,even though bank melli ownership and control of assa prior to appears undisputed,corporate records show that from to,assa shares were held not directly by bank melli but,through harter holdings,by straw owners,mohammad behdadfar,a member of melli board,and mohsen kakavand,a regional manager of melli london office.see app x bonyad mostazafan correspondence from explaining that assa belong ed to bank melli app x bank melli correspondence explaining that transfer of the assa channel island shares of the mother company to the bank was not a problem because understanding has always been that the ownership of the mother company was with bank melli app x corporate records documenting ownership of assa shares from to.moreover,alavi,in its verified petition seeking leave of the new york supreme court to transfer ownership of the building to fifth,concealed bank melli true ownership of assa by identifying behdadfar and kakavand as owners,misrepresenting that the partnership was an transaction.app x.
record evidence from before also shows that even after bank melli became the record owner of harter holdings and,through it,of assa,bank melli intended to conceal its involvement with these straw entities.see app x letter from bank melli department stating that ownership of harter and assa limited was transferred to melli in part because,with their channel islands registration,accessing the ownership backgrounds of the companies behind the captioned corporation is not an easy task for investigators,and asking whether naghshineh the assa corp new york director whose affiliation with the bank could be easily proven could be replaced with another individual whose affiliation with the bank could not be easily proven app x letter from bank melli department to director of bank melli new york asking him to estimate the percentage of risk of the seizure of properties in case of the revelation of the ownership by assa corporation.such evidence of bank melli intent to conceal its ownership of assa behind straw entities and purchasers is probative,though not determinative,of bank melli similar intent in seeming to transfer assa ownership for trivial consideration to even more remote straw purchasers in.see,fed.evid,b.
fourth,after,assa sole united states representative,tafti,continued to communicate on management matters with onsd,which had been involved in assa affairs since its creation,see,app x.notably,tafti communicated with onsd head ghadimipour about structuring assa record ownership to avoid running afoul of sanctions on iran.tafti requested that ghadimipour supply him with copies of aghamiri and shakeri signatures,and that he instruct aghamiri and shakeri to drop iran as their residence to avoid the risk of capital in their names being frozen by the united states.see app x.tafti further advised ghadimipour that if a new assa shareholder were selected,it should be someone who resided in a tax free country.see app x.implicit in these communications is bank melli control of assa shareholder selection to conceal its own prohibited interest in property.communications purportedly from the assa shareholders to tafti warrant no different conclusion because each is sent to,or from,an onsd email address,thus further demonstrating bank melli control.
in urging otherwise,claimants suggest that bank melli was merely an intermediary between assa and the record shareholders.but that hypothesis is a speculative one given the lack of evidence that shakeri and aghamiri ever exercised any control over assa,participated in any of its decisions,or received any income therefrom.see distiso cook,at explaining that court reviewing motion for summary judgment can not credit a nonmovant merely speculative or conclusory assertions.such speculation is further undermined by tafti failure to identify assa shareholders or to arrange a meeting with them despite repeated requests from alavi attorneys and representatives in the united states.see,app x.indeed,record evidence indicates that tafti planned to address the absence of shakeri at a meeting with citibank either by explaining that shakeri was on a vacation or that he had resigned as director and that tafti and assa lawyer had become assa directors.app x.the record only bolsters the conclusion that shakeri and aghamiri were not bona fide owners of,and never exercised control over,assa.
despite the totality of evidence demonstrating bank melli continued control over assa after,claimants contend a genuine issue of material fact on that point is raised by the testimony of two former bank employees.mohammad karjooravy,the director of bank melli new york office from to who was closely involved in the formation of assa and fifth,testified that bank melli intended to be involved in the partnership for a short time,and that he understood regulation to require melli to divest its ownership interest within five years.app x.at best,this evidence demonstrates only bank melli intent to divest its record ownership in assa.it does not undermine,much less refute,record evidence showing that melli did not intend to divest itself of actual ownership or control of assa,or showing that the sale of assa was not a bona fide transfer of control.
gholamreza rahi,an assistant director for bank melli onsd at the time of the formation of assa and fifth,and the director of bank melli new york office from to,testified that he did not know who owned assa after bank melli divested its indirect interest in.claimants contend that rahi lack of knowledge strongly suggests that there was no ownership relationship between bank melli and assa after.claimants br.rahi ignorance,however,is not probative of bank melli relationship with assa because the record evidence does not indicate that the new york office was involved in assa affairs after.indeed,as discussed supra,after,bank melli onsd was involved with assa affairs,and the record is devoid of testimony from a of that department regarding ownership or control of assa.
in sum,the record evidence convincingly demonstrates that bank melli,and therefore the government of iran,continued to control assa after,and admits no genuine issue of triable fact on that question.
alavi knowledge of bank melli ownership and control of assa 
while the record admits no factual dispute as to bank melli ownership and control of assa after,there is a genuine dispute of fact as to whether claimant alavi knew of that ownership the claimants offered several letters from alavi employees and attorneys to assa representatives inquiring about the identity of assa owners or stockholders.for example,in,alavi counsel asked assa counsel to identify assa new owners.also in,mohammad geramian geramian,the president of alavi from to,inquired as to assa new owners.in and in,new counsel at alavi sent letters to assa counsel inquiring about assa owners and directors and requesting a meeting with them.moreover,abbas mirakhor mirakhor,a member of alavi board of directors from approximately,provided deposition testimony that he did not know who the actual owners of assa were,despite alavi good faith efforts to identify them.app x.mirakhor testified that he had no reason to believe that the other members of the board knew either.this evidence,viewed most favorably to alavi,could allow a reasonable jury to find that the government failed to carry its burden on the issue of alavi knowledge of bank melli and,therefore,iran continuing ownership and control of assa after.
in concluding otherwise,the district court relied almost exclusively on evidence,observing that alavi own documents from this time period are replete with references to board members awareness of the authority of the ayatollah over the composition of the foundation board,of the role that the iranian ambassador was to play in the foundation business with respect both to the building and its charitable activities.in re fifth summary judgment decision,wl,at.a court can not conclude,as a matter of law,that knowledge demonstrates knowledge.
nor can such a conclusion be reached based on notes in ebrahimi journal,specifically the note inscribing assa bank melli share.app x.even if this note,together with the totality of evidence,might permit a factfinder to conclude that alavi knew of bank melli control of assa,they do not compel that conclusion as a matter of law.a reasonable juror could conclude that the note reflects only the assignment of a share of fifth to bank melli through assa in return for melli financing of transactions.notes from the khazaee jahedi meeting are no more conclusive as to alavi knowledge of bank melli or the government of iran control over assa.
in sum,because testimonial and documentary evidence raises a genuine dispute as to whether alavi was aware of bank melli continuing ownership and control of assa after,this issue can not be resolved by summary judgment.further,because a triable issue exists as to alavi knowledge of bank melli ongoing ownership or control,it necessarily follows that a triable issue exists as to whether the claimants intended specifically to provide services to the government of iran,by way of bank melli,in providing services to assa after.the government may ultimately prove these disputed issues of knowledge and intent at trial,but the question can not be answered as a matter of law so as to support summary judgment on the government claim that these claimants committed a forfeitable offense under ieepa and the itrs.we therefore vacate the summary judgment award on these claims as to these claimants and remand for further proceedings,including trial.
b.the money laundering theory of forfeiture 
the government second civil forfeiture claim arises under the money laundering statutes.in relevant part,the civil forfeiture statute states 
a the following property is subject to forfeiture to the united states 
a any property,real or personal,involved in a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of section,or of this title,or any property traceable to such property.
a a.to show that the property was involved in such a transaction,the government has the burden of proving that there was a substantial connection between the property and the offense.id.c.the government claims that alavi and fifth committed a forfeitable offense by committing three types of money laundering violations prohibited by promotion money laundering,concealment money laundering,and international money laundering.in relevant part,states

b knowing that the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation,transmission,or transfer represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and knowing that such transportation,transmission,or transfer is designed in whole or in part i to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity or ii to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under state or federal law,
shall be guilty of an offense.
id.a a b,a.
knowledge of unlawful activity or intent to carry out an unlawful activity is an element of every one of the three money laundering offenses.to secure summary judgment based on promotion or concealment money laundering,the government must show,inter alia,that there is no genuine dispute that the claimants knew that property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity.id.a.to secure summary judgment based on international money laundering,the government must show,inter alia,no genuine dispute that the claimants either intended to promote the carrying on of a specified unlawful activity,or knew that the funds being transferred were proceeds of specified unlawful activity.id.a accord united states ness,cir.
here,the government alleges that the claimants engaged in proscribed money laundering by committing ieepa violations.as discussed above,however,whether claimants violated the ieepa depends on the disputed question of claimant alavi knowledge of bank melli control of assa,which gives rise to a triable issue as to its culpable intent in providing services to assa pursuant to their partnership in fifth.these material issues preclude determining claimants involvement in money laundering violations as a matter of law and,thus,require us to vacate the award of summary judgment on this claim for forfeiture and to remand the case for further proceedings 
ii.the statute of limitations defense 
to avoid running afoul of the statute of limitations,the government must file its civil forfeiture action within five years after the time when the alleged forfeitable offense was discovered.in their answer to the complaint,the claimants asserted that t he government claims are barred,in whole or in part,by the statute of limitations.app x.however,the claimants did not move for summary judgment on this defense,and the government did not argue that it was entitled to summary judgment on the defense in its motion.nonetheless,the district court raised and decided the statute of limitations defense sua sponte,entering summary judgment in favor of the government.in re fifth summary judgment decision,wl,at.the district court reasoned that it scoured the record to determine if there is a triable issue as to this defense and determined that there was no triable issue.id.
this decision was in error.the federal rules state that a court may grant summary judgment sua sponte only a fter giving notice and a reasonable time to respond and after identifying for the parties material facts that may not be genuinely in dispute.fed.civ.f see also celotex catrett,d istrict courts are widely acknowledged to possess the power to enter summary judgments sua sponte,so long as the losing party was on notice that it had to come forward with all of its evidence.while we have held that it is not necessarily reversible error in our circuit for a district court to grant summary judgment against the moving party without notice or opportunity to defend,we have firmly discouraged even that practice and made clear that grants of summary judgment without notice will be tolerated only when the facts before the district court were fully developed so that the moving party suffered no procedural prejudice.bridgeway citibank,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.we have emphasized that care should be taken by the district court to determine that the party against whom summary judgment is rendered has had a full and fair opportunity to meet the proposition that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried.cosmetics gmbh pacificlink int l,cir.alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the district court granted summary judgment against the nonmovant claimants statute of limitations defense without affording the claimants any let alone a full and fair opportunity to present evidence as to the applicability of the defense.in re fifth summary judgment decision,wl,at.the claimants had no notice that the district court would consider their statute of limitations defense because the government did not seek summary judgment on it or any other defense.indeed,in its motion for summary judgment,the government requested that the district court afford it a subsequent opportunity to address the claimants innocent owner defense if it initially granted summary judgment in its favor on the issue of forfeitability of the defendants in rem.dist.dkt.at.this effectively put the claimants and the district court on notice that the government did not intend for the claimants affirmative defenses to be addressed on its summary judgment motion.
in light of the government express cabining of its summary judgment motion to its affirmative liability claims,it was particularly important for the district court to put the claimants on notice of its intention sua sponte to consider the statute of limitations defense,and to afford claimants a reasonable opportunity to respond before deciding the issue against them.this is not a case where the record was so fully developed that claimants plainly suffered no prejudice from the procedural error.bridgeway,at.in fact,it was hardly developed at all on the statute of limitations question accordingly,the district court procedurally erred in sua sponte considering the claimants statute of limitations defense and deciding in favor of the government.
iii.the motion to suppress 
this court reviews a district court denial of a suppression motion for clear error as to the district court factual findings and de novo as to its legal conclusions.united states getto,cir.
a.the fourth amendment applies to the seizures at issue 
the fourth amendment protects t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.it further provides that no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.id.while the fourth amendment contains no provision expressly precluding the use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands,the supreme court has established an exclusionary rule that,when applicable,forbids the use of improperly obtained evidence at trial.herring united states,internal quotation marks omitted.the exclusionary rule is designed to safeguard fourth amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect.id.at quoting united states calandra.
it is that the fourth amendment exclusionary rule applies in forfeiture cases.see delaware street,at see also one plymouth sedan pennsylvania,holding that the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures applies in forfeiture proceedings austin united states,observing that the supreme court has held that the fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures applies in forfeiture proceedings krimstock kelly,cir.explaining that t he supreme court has held that the fourth amendment protects claimants against unreasonable seizures of their property in the civil forfeiture context.
the district court,however,concluded that there was no need to consider the claimants fourth amendment challenges to the seized evidence in this case because the claimants civil discovery and production requirements obviate d the need for any fourth amendment analysis.in re fifth suppression decision,supp.at.in fact,discovery or production obligations do not displace fourth amendment protections.rather,such obligations may trigger the inevitable discovery doctrine to shield from suppression even evidence seized in violation of the fourth amendment.see united states eng,cir.because we here identify a fourth amendment defect in the seizure warrant,we proceed to consider whether the government demonstrated inevitable discovery.we conclude that the district court failed to make the requisite findings with sufficient particularity and,therefore,we vacate its suppression ruling and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
b.the warrant was constitutionally defective 
the fourth amendment requires a search warrant particularly to describ e the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.const.amend.iv.such particularity is necessarily tied to the amendment probable cause requirement.by limiting the authorization to search to the specific areas and things for which there is probable cause to search,the requirement ensures that the search will be carefully tailored to its justifications,and will not take on the character of the exploratory searches the framers intended to prohibit.maryland garrison.thus,for a warrant to meet the particularity requirement,it must identify the alleged crime for which evidence is sought.see united states george,cir.observing that warrant lacked particularity where n othing on the face of the warrant tells the searching officers for what crime the search is being undertaken united states galpin,cir.holding that search warrant generally authorizing police officers to search defendant physical property and electronic equipment for evidence of nys penal law and or federal statutes violated the particularity requirement internal quotation marks omitted.
in groh,the supreme court stated that the fourth amendment particularity requirements must be satisfied in the warrant,not in the supporting documents.groh ramirez.however,a court may construe a warrant with reference to a supporting application or affidavit if the warrant uses appropriate words of incorporation,and if the supporting document accompanies the warrant.id.at.thus,for a warrant to be sufficiently particular,the alleged crimes must appear in either the warrant itself,or in a supporting document if the warrant uses appropriate words of incorporation and if the supporting document accompanies the warrant.see id.but for an attached affidavit properly to be incorporated into a warrant,the warrant must contain deliberate and unequivocal language of incorporation.united states waker,cir.per curiam finding supporting affidavit incorporated by reference in warrant where it was attached to warrant,warrant stated that supporting affidavit is incorporated herein by reference,and magistrate had initialed the relevant portion of the attached affidavit internal quotation marks omitted see also groh,at.language in a warrant that simply references an underlying affidavit does not incorporate the affidavit so as to allow the documents together to satisfy the particularity requirement.see groh,at concluding that,although warrant referenced affidavit insofar as it recite d that the magistrate was satisfied the affidavit established probable cause,warrant did not incorporate by reference list of items to be seized that was contained in application george,at holding recitation in warrant that it was issued upon the basis of an application and affidavit insufficient to incorporate affidavit by reference internal quotation marks omitted.
on its face,the warrant in this case plainly lacked particularity as to the crimes at issue.indeed,the government concedes this point.see government br.acknowledging that warrant should have listed the alleged offenses,but did not.nor did the warrant particularize categories of computerized information for which there was probable cause to seize,or the temporal scope of the materials that could be seized.instead,the warrant authorized the search and seizure of a ny and all documents or records concerning or relating to the ownership of,rental of,mortgaging of,or investing in assa,fifth,alavi,or bank melli iran,a ny and all documents concerning or relating to financial books and records,bank accounts,disbursements,money transfers or employment records of assa,fifth,alavi,or bank melli iran or any of the officers and employees of these entities,and,most broadly,a ny and all computers central processing units external and internal drives external and internal storage equipment or media computerized data storage devices hard disks or floppy disks and related or connected computer or data storage equipment located on the premises to be searched app x.
while the ennis affidavit supporting the warrant does reference the potential charges for which evidence was sought,noting that bank melli is subject to the iranian transactions regulations and assa interest in the building and its rents is subject to civil forfeiture,as fully set forth in the initial complaint against assa and bank melli,that affidavit was neither attached to the warrant nor incorporated by deliberate and unequivocal language.the warrant only referenced the affidavit.see app x affidavit s having been made before me by special agent george ennis id.i am satisfied that the grounds for application for issuance of the search warrant exist as stated in the supporting affidavit s.thus,even assuming that the affidavit can be construed to signal that only evidence relating to the alleged forfeitable offenses was to be seized,the failure of deliberate incorporation precludes a reviewing court reliance on the affidavit to cure the warrant lack of particularity.see groh,at 
c.the inevitable discovery exception to suppression 
under the inevitable discovery doctrine,evidence obtained during the course of an unreasonable search and seizure should not be excluded if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably without the constitutional violation.united states heath,cir.other internal quotation marks omitted citing nix williams.the inevitable discovery doctrine requires the district court to determine,viewing affairs as they existed at the instant before the unlawful search,what would have happened had the unlawful search never occurred.united states eng,cir.eng i emphasis in original accord united states eng,cir.eng ii same.p roof of inevitable discovery involves no speculative elements but focuses on demonstrated historical facts capable of ready verification or impeachment and does not require a departure from the usual burden of proof at suppression hearings.eng i,at emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted accord eng ii,at.
to show that the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule applies,the burden is on the government to prove that each event leading to the discovery of the evidence would have occurred with a sufficiently high degree of confidence for the district judge to conclude,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the evidence would inevitably have been discovered.united states vilar,cir.we have previously characterized the government obligation as one of certitude that the evidence would have been discovered.heath,at.
in eng i and eng ii,we identified the need to guard against government actions taken as an after the fact insurance policy to validate an unlawful search under the inevitable discovery doctrine and,toward that end,set forth courts procedural obligations in making inevitable discovery determinations.see eng i,at internal quotation marks omitted accord eng ii,at.the facts at issue in eng i and eng ii bear repetition here.in february,federal officials investigated the defendant for narcotics and money laundering violations.eng i,at.in the course of this investigation,the officials unlawfully searched and seized contents of the defendant safe without a warrant,violating the fourth amendment.id.at.unlawfully obtained evidence from that safe prompted an investigation of defendant on separate charges for tax evasion,with the government eventually issuing subpoenas to banks and other entities for evidence supporting such tax charges.id.at.after defendant was charged with three counts of tax evasion,he moved to suppress certain evidence as derived from the unlawful search of his safe.id.at.the district court concluded that the inevitable discovery doctrine applied and admitted all of the challenged evidence.id.at.
on appeal,eng i laid out and eng ii reiterated a process for making inevitable discovery determinations.id.at eng ii,at.first,the court must evaluate the progress of the investigation at the time of the government misconduct to determine whether an active and ongoing investigation was in progress at the time of unlawful search.eng i,at see eng ii,at.at this step,the government must establish that the investigation was not triggered or catalyzed by the information unlawfully gained by the illegal search but,rather,that the alternate means of obtaining the challenged evidence was,at least to some degree,imminent,if yet unrealized at the time of the unlawful search.eng i,at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted see eng ii,at.second,the court must,for each particular piece of evidence,specifically analyze and explain how,if at all,discovery of that piece of evidence would have been more likely than not inevitable absent the unlawful search.eng i,at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted see eng ii,at.applying these standards in eng,we ruled that a subpoena issued contemporaneously with an unlawful search was not enough to validate an unlawful search under the inevitable discovery doctrine.eng i,at internal quotation marks omitted.as we subsequently explained,in language particularly relevant in this case,the detailed showings of each of the contingencies involved in the eng formulations are necessary to avoid encouraging officers to obviate or nullify the fourth amendment warrant requirement by baldly asserting that they inevitably would have had the probable cause needed to obtain a warrant.heath,at emphasis added alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
this precedent makes clear that claimants civil discovery and protective order obligations were not enough,by themselves,to support a conclusion that the fourth amendment was not implicated in the suppression challenge presented.in re fifth suppression decision,supp.at.moreover,this precedent precludes a general conclusion that all of the evidence seized pursuant to the challenged warrant was nonetheless admissible in the government forfeiture action because it would have been inevitably discovered in civil discovery or as a result of the protective order.in reaching that conclusion here,the district court reasoned in two paragraphs of factual findings that a s to alavi,such historical facts exist and demonstrate inevitable discovery for all of the evidence seized in the december search because t he of civil litigations which each carried common law preservation obligations,the production obligations under the federal rules of civil procedure,and the fact that alavi failed to object to the scope of those obligations and actually produced the disputed documents moot the constitutional question central to this motion.id.at.
this analysis was insufficient to support a finding that the government would inevitably have discovered the entire contents of alavi computers,electronic storage devices,servers,and over boxes of documents pursuant to the protective order and civil discovery obligations.specifically,the district court failed to make clear that it was viewing affairs as they existed at the instant before the unlawful search,and making particularized findings as to what would have happened had the unlawful search never occurred.eng i,at emphasis in original see in re fifth suppression decision,supp.at.the former consideration should properly have been informed by the initial civil forfeiture action,filed on december,which sought forfeiture only of assa assets,although it discussed in detail the history of alavi and fifth the district court december,protective order in that action,which,among other things,a required fifth to make available for inspection to the united states all of its books and records and b prohibited any person or entity with actual knowledge of the protective order from destroying documents relating to the forfeiture complaint allegations the december,grand jury subpoena to alavi seeking all documents relating,or referring,to assa,fifth,and bank melli,for the period january to december and jahedi observed destruction of documents responsive to that subpoena the following day.with respect to these events,we make several observations.
first,in explaining that alavi was under a duty prior to the search to provide its books and records to the government for inspection all of them,the district court overstated alavi obligations under the protective order.in re fifth suppression decision,supp.at emphasis added.that order imposed no production obligation on alavi rather,it prohibited a ll persons and entities having actual knowledge of the protective order from destroy ing any documents relating in any manner or part to the allegations in the forfeiture complaint.app x.insofar as the protective order required fifth,a separate entity of which alavi is a owner,to make its books and records available for inspection to the united states,id.at,the district court failed to explain how that inspection obligation would have resulted in the government inevitably obtaining possession of such records.see,nix,at establishing that,under the inevitable discovery doctrine,evidence obtained during the course of an unreasonable search and seizure should not be excluded if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably without the constitutional violation emphasis added accord heath,at.logically,an obligation to make a massive quantity of materials available for inspection does not mean that the authorized inspector will inevitably obtain each individual material made available.here,it is not manifest that the government would have obtained every item seized from alavi computers,electronic storage devices,servers,and over boxes of documents pursuant to fifth obligation to make certain documents available or alavi obligation not to destroy certain documents.
second,the district court failed to explain how the government would have obtained every item of seized evidence in the civil suit,whether pursuant to the claimants production obligations or through civil discovery.the only action pending at the time of the search was the initial civil forfeiture action,which related to assa property and which imposed upon claimants,at most,a common law obligation of preservation see kronsich united states,cir.explaining that obligation to preserve evidence arises when the party has notice that the evidence is relevant to litigation most commonly when suit has already been filed,providing the party responsible for the destruction with express notice,but also on occasion in other circumstances,as for example when a party should have known that the evidence may be relevant to future litigation.thus,for the same reasons just discussed with respect to the protective order,further findings are necessary to conclude that any common law preservation obligation would inevitably have resulted in the government obtaining each item of seized evidence.
third,insofar as the government here relies on the december,subpoena,we note that the district court did not rely on that subpoena in reaching its inevitable discovery conclusion.thus,we leave it to that court on remand to determine whether the government has carried its burden to show that a response to the subpoena producing the evidence in question was inevitable.eng i,at.
finally,we are mindful that,in,in response to a joint document request from the government and judgment creditors,claimants did produce the same documents that were seized during the december search.the government,however,sought those documents from alavi and fifth only after amending its complaint to seek forfeiture of their interests.many of the amended complaint allegations against alavi and fifth derived from documents seized during the december,search.on this record,we can not confidently conclude that a request for production in the amended forfeiture action was not tainted by the challenged search so as to admit a finding of inevitable discovery.vilar,at concluding that evidence was properly admitted under inevitable discovery doctrine despite unlawful search because documents were subsequently produced pursuant to grand jury subpoena and,among other things,the subpoena was not issued on the basis of any information unlawfully seized from defendant office.
this is not to say that the government lacked sufficient evidence to commence a forfeiture action against alavi and fifth before the challenged search.indeed,based on facts alleged in the initial forfeiture complaint and issuance of the december,subpoena,the government investigation may well have been sufficiently advanced prior to the december,search to make both claimants addition to the forfeiture complaint even without the unlawfully seized evidence and,therefore,their disclosure obligations,inevitable.because the district court declined to consider this argument below,however,the record does not now permit us to reach such a conclusion.rather,the district court may consider this issue on remand.see eng i,at explaining that inevitable discovery analysis logically must begin with the progress of the investigation at the time of the government misconduct,and that court conducting such analysis must determine what would have happened in light of what the government knew and was pursuing at the moment before the unlawful search.
in remanding this case to the district court,we note that the supreme court has long rejected the notion that the government can circumvent the exclusionary rule by using lawful processes to obtain evidence that it previously seized illegally.see silverthorne lumber united states.in the enduring words of justice holmes,t he essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the court but that it shall not be used at all.id.at.allowing the government to immunize an illegal search simply by obtaining the evidence in a subsequent legal request would reduce the fourth amendment to a form of words.see also calandra,at.thus,we can not rubber stamp the government assertion that it would have inevitably discovered unlawfully obtained evidence in a subsequent lawful mechanism simply because the latter mechanism is pursued.to secure an exception from the exclusionary rule on the ground of inevitable discovery,the government must make a detailed showing of each of the contingencies involved and the district court must find each contingency satisfied with respect to each item of seized evidence.heath,at internal quotation marks omitted see also eng i,at eng ii,at united states stokes,cir.
d.the good faith exception 
on appeal,the government argues,with some force,that,whether or not the inevitable discovery exception applies,no suppression of evidence is warranted in this case because the executing agents relied in good faith on the december,search warrant.see united states leon,see also united states rosa,cir.explaining that although unincorporated,unattached supporting documents can not cure constitutionally defective warrant,those documents are still relevant to our determination of whether the officers acted in good faith.because the district court did not address the government argument,we decline to consider it for the first time on appeal.rather,we leave the government to pursue it on remand in the district court.
conclusion 
to summarize,we conclude as follows 
as to summary judgment ordering forfeiture of claimants property,
a the record admits no factual dispute as to bank melli and therefore iran continuing ownership and control of assa after,but 
b the record,viewed most favorably to claimants,reveals disputes of fact as to claimants knowledge of that ownership,which preclude an award of summary judgment against them as to both the ieepa and money laundering theories of forfeiture.
the district court procedurally erred in sua sponte considering and rejecting claimants statute of limitations defense without first affording the parties notice or a reasonable opportunity to be heard.
as to the district court challenged denial of suppression,
a it is well settled that the fourth amendment applies in civil forfeiture actions 
b where,as here,the government concedes that evidence was seized pursuant to a warrant lacking the requisite particularity,civil orders of protection and production do not obviate fourth amendment concerns,though they can trigger an inevitable discovery exception to suppression 
c the inevitable discovery exception requires a court to view affairs as they existed at the instant before the unlawful search,and make particularized findings with respect to each item of seized evidence as to what would have happened had the unlawful search never occurred,united states eng,cir.and 
d remand is required to allow the district court to conduct the requisite inevitable discovery analysis.
on remand,the government may pursue its argument that the exception to suppression also applies in this case.see united states leon.
accordingly,the district court summary judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the alavi foundation and fifth were the only claimants to request and secure entry of final judgment in this case and,thus,are the only appellants on this appeal.accordingly,we henceforth use claimants to refer only to the alavi foundation and the fifth avenue company.
although assa corporation is also a claimant whose property interests including its interest in fifth were forfeited pursuant to the challenged summary judgment,it is not a party to this appeal and the material issue we here identify relates only to alavi.thus,our decision today does not disturb the judgment and forfeiture order as they relate to assa.
on appeal,claimants broadly assert that,in ruling on the summary judgment motions,the district court relied on evidence whose admissibility and authenticity had been challenged and not properly ruled on.claimants br.see porter quarantillo,cir.only admissible evidence need be considered by the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment,and a district court deciding a summary judgment motion has broad discretion in choosing whether to admit evidence.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.in fact,the district court here rejected all three of claimants evidentiary objections,ruling as to proffered statements in farsi unaccompanied by a certified translation that t here can be no serious dispute that a certified translation could be obtained,claimants hearsay challenge failed on the merits,and that at trial,the parties could either stipulate to documents authenticity or they could be authenticated by fbi agent jennifer mcreynolds,the investigation evidence custodian.in re fifth,civ.kbf,wl,at,in re fifth summary judgment decision.we identify no abuse of discretion in these evidentiary rulings.
bank melli first loaned the pahlavi foundation million pursuant to an agreement executed on july,and subsequently provided an additional million loan pursuant to an october,agreement.
for ease of reference only,we refer to all three iterations of the foundation as alavi throughout the remainder of this opinion.
although the agreement indicates that million represented the fair market value of the building at that time,app x,other record evidence indicates that the building value was calculated so that assa and,therefore,bank melli partnership interest would be equivalent to the outstanding debt alavi owed to bank melli,see app x bonyad mostazafan correspondence explaining that although building was valued at million,that value made bank melli share in partnership worth million while debt alavi owed to bank melli was million,and,because bank melli could not come up with the difference,value of the building was set at million.
specifically,from,harter holdings held of assa limited shares.from,between the two bank melli officials,each held of harter holdings shares and,thereby,of assa limited.from,bank melli iran held this interest in harter holdings,and indirect interest in assa limited.as discussed infra,sometime in,shakeri and aghamiri took over that interest and held it until.
according to,he was employed by the bonyad mostazafan from approximately to approximately or,at which time he began working for a german company owned by the bonyad mostazafan.
on january,president obama issued executive order in connection with the implementation day of the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa related to iran nuclear program.see exec.order,fed.reg.the order revoked or amended certain executive orders concerning iranian sanctions,but kept in place president clinton declaration of a national emergency vis iran two decades ago.id.consistent with certain implementation day commitments,ofac has also submitted final rules partially amending the itrs.see fed.reg,to be codified at pt.for further discussion of the jcpoa,see kirschenbaum,et fifth avenue company and related properties kirschenbaum,at.
unauthenticated corporate records from the united kingdom jersey island purport to show that from,shakeri and aghamiri held interests in harter holdings,which owned of assa limited total shares,and each of assa limited shares.in,harter holdings divested its interests and shakeri and aghamiri became direct owners of assa limited.although the admissibility of these records is subject to question for reasons discussed infra at,on this appeal we assume authentication and admissibility will be satisfied on remand.
the records show that,as of january,shakeri and aghamiri each owned one share of assa limited,and that the a mount paid on each share par value was,app x and shares of harter holdings,and that the amount paid on each share par value for those shares was similarly,app x.when shakeri and aghamiri acquired all assa limited shares in,the amount paid on each share was again listed as.see app x.
the record contains no information regarding the ownership of assa limited after,when the government initiated this forfeiture action.
see dep t of treasury,press release,treasury designates bank melli front company in new york city,last visited june,explaining scheme to use a front company set up by bank melli a known proliferator of weapons of mass destruction to funnel money from the united states to iran internal quotation marks omitted.in january,the united states lifted sanctions previously imposed on iran and removed various entities subject to those sanctions from the sdn list,including bank melli and assa.for a more comprehensive discussion of this action,see kirschenbaum,at.
as discussed infra at,the ieepa imposes both civil and criminal penalties for the violation of any license,order,regulation or prohibition issued under the ieepa,and property derived from proceeds traceable to an offense under is subject to forfeiture,see a c.
the summary judgment entered in favor of these creditors is also before this panel and,although not consolidated with appeal of the forfeiture judgment,we heard oral argument on the two actions in tandem given their factual overlap.we dispose of the appeal in the judgment creditor action in a separate opinion also filed this day,see kirschenbaum.
though they were parties below,assa corporation and assa limited did not join alavi and fifth motion to suppress,and we express no view as to whether they would have had standing to do so.
although the district court also awarded the government summary judgment with respect to assa interest in the defendant properties,assa did not seek a rule b final judgment and,thus,that portion of the district court summary judgment order is not before us on this appeal.
