background 
the city of marshall is located in harrison county,texas,which is located partially within the cypress creek basin and partially within the sabine river basin.marshall received a permit in from the texas board of water engineers,a predecessor of the texas commission on environmental quality,authorizing marshall to divert of water per year from cypress creek.almost a decade later,the permit was amended to authorize an additional diversion.in,marshall received a certification of adjudication from the commission under the water rights adjudication act recognizing its right to divert a total of of water for municipal use per year.the commission rules define municipal use as the use of potable water within a community or municipality and its environs for domestic,recreational,commercial,or industrial purposes.admin.code.it is undisputed that marshall has never used more than half of its authorized amount of water.
in,marshall applied to the commission for a permit amendment authorizing it to change the purpose of use so that it could supply untreated water for industrial purposes.the record suggests that marshall was negotiating to sell the water to a power company and possibly to other industrial users.marshall also sought recognition of its historical practice of providing water to customers in the portion of harrison county located within the sabine river basin in addition to its existing authorization to provide water to customers within the cypress creek basin.hundreds of individuals and organizations filed requests for notice and hearing on the application,including the city of uncertain,the greater caddo lake association,the caddo lake institute,the caddo lake area chamber of commerce,john echols,and barry bennick collectively,uncertain,respondents in this court.uncertain asserted that the application posed a serious threat to big cypress bayou and caddo lake,which has been designated by the state and federal governments as a wetland of international importance.tourism centered around caddo lake is a significant component of the city of uncertain local economy,and the other opponents and their constituents either operate businesses,own land,hold water rights,or reside downstream from marshall point of diversion.uncertain asserted that the amendment would impair existing water rights and adversely affect the public welfare.it also contended that the application was inconsistent with the regional water plan and that marshall objectives in seeking the amendment could be met through conservation measures.in addition,uncertain argued that there were indications of a hydrological relationship between caddo lake and groundwater resources that the commission was required to consider under the commission rules.see.admin.code a.
the commission executive director determined that neither of marshall requested amendments required notice and hearing the director concluded that section v of the water code exempted the requested change in basin of use from notice and hearing requirements he also concluded that notice and hearing were not required for the requested change in use,reasoning that section b full use assumption mandated authorization of the change.water code b.the assumption,also known as the doctrine,requires the commission to assess a requested amendment impact on other water rights and the environment based upon the full amount of water authorized by the existing permit irrespective of the amount that the permit holder has actually used.see id.the executive director granted marshall application in march,and the commission denied uncertain appeal of that decision.see.admin.code.
uncertain appealed to the district court,naming the commission and marshall as defendants.uncertain sought a temporary restraining order and temporary injunction to prevent marshall from selling untreated water for industrial use pending disposition of the lawsuit,and also sought reversal of the executive director decision to grant the permit without allowing a hearing.uncertain further alleged that the approval violated several water code provisions and its right to due process under article i,sections and of the texas constitution.the parties filed for summary judgment the trial court granted uncertain motion and denied marshall and the commission,holding that the commission erred in its determination that the water code mandated approval of the amendment without a hearing.
the court of appeals affirmed in part,and reversed in part the trial court judgment.the court held that section v of the water code did not require a hearing on marshall request to change its permitted basin of use,id.at,but that section b allowed a hearing on marshall request to change the purpose of use,id.at.the court further held that notice and hearing were required under sections and of the water code.id.we granted the commission and marshall petitions for review to determine section b effect on section and notice and hearing requirements when a proposed permit amendment changes the permit purpose of use but does not affect the amount of water appropriated or the authorized diversion rate.uncertain does not contest the court of appeals decision that no hearing was required on marshall request,so that issue is not before us.
ii.discussion 
before addressing the parties arguments regarding section b import,it is helpful to consider the statute origin in the context of the development of water law in texas.that development illustrates the legislature continuing efforts to properly conserve and manage this increasingly vital resource.
water law background 
surface water in texas is generally owned by the state of texas and held in trust for the public,and the preservation and conservation of water resources are public rights and duties.const.art.xvi.water code a frank skillern,texas water law series.current laws governing texas rights have grown out of a of historical and contradictory water rights systems.robin melvin,transferring water rights in texas,in,the changing face of texas water rights in texas state bar of texas.
spanish,mexican,and common law 
spanish or mexican law governed water rights granted before texas gained independence in.under that body of law,a landowner had no right to use surface water unless the land grant specifically provided for it.state valmont plantations,antonio,aff.after independence,the republic of texas adopted the common law of england except to the extent it was specifically abrogated by statute.skillern,supra,at.england system of riparian rights,as adapted by this court,allowed owners of lands adjacent to streams to use such water for irrigation of riparian lands as was reasonable under the circumstances.see watkins land clements,melvin,supra,at skillern,supra,at.the riparian system,though,proved to more arid parts of the state,leading the legislature to enact the irrigation acts of and.act of,ch.laws act of,ch.laws.
the irrigation acts 
the irrigation acts of and preserved previously recognized riparian rights to some extent,but also allowed the acquisition of appropriative water rights in certain parts of the state.act of,ch.laws,act of,ch.laws.the irrigation acts provided that a water right was acquired by diverting water and applying it to a beneficial purpose.act of,ch.laws,act of,ch.laws.under the appropriative system,the right to divert water in times of shortage is determined by the seniority of the between appropriators,first in time is first in right.water code act of,ch.laws,act of,ch.laws.the irrigation acts contemplated that any rights acquired would be recorded by filing a sworn statement with the county clerk.act of,ch.laws,act of,ch.laws.appropriative rights under the irrigation acts were acquired without any assessment of environmental impacts or water availability.under the act,new riparian rights were no longer recognized in the arid parts of the state except for domestic purposes.act of,ch.laws.
in,texas continued to refine its ability to manage its water resources by creating a permit system administered by the board of water engineers,a commission predecessor.act of,ch.laws.under that system,the board was empowered to grant or deny permits for new rights,subject to notice and hearing.id.laws.rights acquired under the irrigation acts were to be recorded and filed with the board,but failure to file did not extinguish previously perfected appropriative rights.id.the existence of unrecorded but valid riparian and appropriative rights led to uncertainty and clashes between conflicting claims in times of water shortages,leading the legislature to further action.
the water rights adjudication act 
in,the legislature enacted the water rights adjudication act to unify the dual systems of riparian and appropriative rights.water code.the act required claimants to file claims with the board successor,the texas water rights commission,based upon the amount of water applied to beneficial use between and.the commission conducted adjudicative hearings throughout the state,and the courts ultimately approved its decisions.see,in re the adjudication of the water rights of upper guadalupe segment of guadalupe river basin.the adjudication process did not weigh the environmental impacts of the claimants historic use.see.water code.the certificate of adjudication that marshall sought to amend was obtained in this process.
while the adjudication process resulted in a unitary system of defined rights,many river basins in the state were overappropriated because the rights recognized were based upon historic use rather than water availability.research organization,texas at a watershed planning now for future needs april.a severe drought in the drew the legislature attention once again to issues.id.at.
senate bill 
in response to the legislature directive that those policies and action required to meet texas near and water needs be identified,the commission,the texas water development board,and the texas parks and wildlife department prepared a state water plan that projected huge increases in water demands in the next years.see texas water development board,water for texas today tomorrow legislative summary of the update of the state water plan.the plan noted that the opportunities to develop new reservoirs were limited by high costs and serious environmental issues,and recommended a number of measures to meet texas growing needs,including legislation to encourage conservation,planning,reuse,and the transfer and marketing of water rights.id.at.the legislature enacted many of those measures in senate bill,a landmark in legislation and the source of section b of the water code,which forms the basis of the parties dispute in this case.
b.the water code and hearings 
the parties assert differing interpretations of the water code notice and hearing requirements when a holder of permitted water rights seeks to amend the permit.we begin by considering the water code notice and hearing requirements and other pertinent criteria that the parties agree are mandatory for approval when an applicant seeks a new appropriation of state water.
appropriative permit requirements 
the right to use and divert state water is acquired by appropriation in the manner and for the purposes provided in the water code.water code.the code contains a number of procedural and substantive requirements that an application to appropriate unappropriated state water must meet.the procedural criteria relate generally to the form of the application,the necessary fee,and notice and hearing.id,b.more substantively,the applicant must show that 
the proposed appropriation 
a is intended for a beneficial use 
b does not impair existing water rights or vested riparian rights 
c is not detrimental to the public welfare 
d considers the assessments performed under sections d and e effects on bays and estuaries and instream uses and sections effects on water quality,effects on groundwater,and effects on fish and wildlife habitats and 
e addresses a water supply need in a manner that is consistent with the state water plan and the relevant approved regional water plan for any area in which the proposed appropriation is located,unless the commission determines that conditions warrant waiver of this requirement and 
the applicant has provided evidence that reasonable diligence will be used to avoid waste and achieve water conservation as defined by subdivision b,section.
id.b.the applicant is also required to provide evidence that reasonable diligence will be used to avoid waste and achieve water conservation as defined by subdivision b,section.id.b.in sum,the substantive components that currently must be assessed when an applicant seeks a new appropriation of water are comprehensive,and sections and of the water code provide that notice and hearing must be afforded to those who may be affected by the proposed appropriation.id.
we note that marshall certificate of adjudication was based upon water rights initially granted in permits issued by the commission in and.at the time the permits were issued,the commission could reject an application to appropriate water only if there was no unappropriated water in the source of supply,or if the proposed use conflicted with existing water rights or would be detrimental to the public welfare.see act of may,ch.laws.and certificates of adjudication under the water rights adjudication act took into account only the amount of water beneficially used without waste in any given year during a specified time period.water code b.in contrast,the current water code and its implementing regulations require the commission,in assessing new permit applications,to consider a proposed appropriation impact on bays and estuaries and uses,effects on water quality and groundwater,effects on fish and wildlife habitat,as well as its consistency with the state and any regional water plans.id.b d,e.consequently,in a december,letter to the commission,the texas parks wildlife department complained that no environmental assessment was required or performed at the time marshall original permit was granted and,as far as it could discern,no comprehensive review of marshall application has been performed to determine whether the city application complies with section.
the parties do not dispute the requirements that are necessary to initially acquire an appropriative permit.but they part ways over the process that governs an application to amend a permit when no additional water is sought to be appropriated and the diversion rate is unaffected.section governs amendments to permitted water rights,and we now turn to its provisions.
amendments 
section b of the water code provides 
subject to meeting all other applicable requirements of this chapter for the approval of an application,an amendment,except an amendment to a water right that increases the amount of water authorized to be diverted or the authorized rate of diversion,shall be authorized if the requested change will not cause adverse impact on other water right holders or the environment on the stream of greater magnitude than under circumstances in which the permit,certified filing,or certificate of adjudication that is sought to be amended was fully exercised according to its terms and conditions as they existed before the requested amendment.

section b plain language mandates authorization of a proposed amendment that does not increase the amount of water authorized to be diverted or the authorized diversion rate,but it also contains a number of conditional clauses through which the mandate must be viewed 
subject to meeting all other applicable requirements of this chapter for the approval of an application,an amendment shall be authorized if the requested change will not cause adverse impact on other water right holders or the environment on the stream of greater magnitude than if the certificate were being fully used 
water code b emphasis added.not surprisingly,the parties rely on different clauses and interpretations to support their respective positions.
marshall and the commission direct their focus on the assumption.they claim the legislature enacted section in to give the commission authority to adopt rules that would govern amendments to water rights,thus taking amendments out of section s purview and allowing the commission to determine which amendment applications required notice and hearing and which did not.by enacting subsection b in,they contend,the legislature sought to streamline the amendment process even further by removing commission discretion to deny an amendment that did not seek to appropriate additional water or increase the authorized diversion rate beyond the full use already permitted.according to marshall and the commission,section b predicate language subjecting an amendment approval to all other applicable requirements of this chapter for the approval of an application refers merely to matters they assert are not tied to a new appropriation of water,such as payment of a filing fee,administrative completeness,and provision of a conservation plan.id.b emphasis added.applying all of the section criteria to permit amendments,they claim,would thwart the legislature intent to streamline the amendment process.
uncertain primary focus is section b predicate language s ubject to meeting all other applicable requirements of this chapter for the approval of an application.water code b emphasis added.uncertain argues that the term application includes amendment applications,and that all requirements for approval of a new appropriation apply equally to amendments like marshall that request a change in the purpose of use,including the substantive and procedural requirements contained in sections.according to uncertain,section b assumption only restricts the parameters of the commission review of those elements specified in that section,namely that the proposed amendment will not cause adverse impact on other water right holders or the environment on the stream,and does not exempt the applicant from meeting all other section requirements.id.but even if the assumption does preclude the commission consideration of all other factors,uncertain argues,assessing the proposed amendment impact on other holders and the environment involves a factual determination upon which a hearing must be afforded.
each of the parties arguments finds some support in the statutory language.as marshall points out,section,which requires the commission to give notice and hearing to persons potentially affected by an application,refers to the proposed use and proposed appropriation in describing the required contents of the notice.id.b,c.by referring to the proposed appropriation,the notice and hearing provisions suggest they apply to water to which a right has not been previously recognized under a permit or certificate of adjudication.see lower.river auth.dep t of water,holding that section of the water code,which provides that water that has not been beneficially used is considered not appropriated,does not apply to the determination of whether unappropriated water is available under section b of the code.on the other hand,as uncertain argues and the court of appeals noted,the legislature has expressly stated in other sections of the water code when notice and hearing are not required yet chose not to include comparable language in section b,suggesting that notice and hearing are required for proposed amendments because they are not expressly excluded.at.
while the parties arguments have some textual support,neither gives full effect to section b statutory language.uncertain glosses over the term s ubject to meeting all other applicable requirements of this chapter for the approval of an application applicable must mean something less than all requirements necessary for an original permit else section b purpose to streamline the amendment process would have no effect.water code b emphasis added.on the other hand,marshall position that the clause refers only to administrative form and content requirements has no support in the text or the legislative history,not to mention the ease with which the legislature could have said subject to meeting all administrative requirements for the approval of an application had it so intended.contrary to the parties diametrically opposed interpretations,we believe all of section b language can be given effect without undermining the statute overall purpose to streamline the amendment application process.
in denying notice and hearing on marshall permit amendment application,the commission concluded that section b mandated authorization of the amendment and left no factual issues to be resolved in an evidentiary hearing that interpretation presumes,we believe incorrectly,that the only relevant criteria governing an amendment disposition are contained in section b itself,that the requested change does not adversely impact other holders or the environment any more than would full use of the permitted right.it is clear,as the commission believed,that the legislature did intend to make the amendment process less cumbersome by imposing the restriction on the assessment of adverse impacts on other water rights and the environment.but the legislature intent in enacting section b and other portions of senate bill was also to protect the public welfare by otherwise ensuring protection of this valuable resource.
as we have noted,the legislature sought in senate bill to comprehensively address the state present and future needs.toward this end,senate bill implemented a number of steps to make better use of existing supplies,including measures to facilitate transfers and marketing,to encourage conservation,to protect groundwater resources,and to encourage systematic planning while section b simplified the permit amendment process to facilitate marketing by curtailing certain assessments under the assumption,other provisions of senate bill specifically require applicants for both new and amended water rights to submit water conservation plans and direct the commission to assess an amendment application consistency with the state water plan and any approved regional plan.act of june,ch.laws,amended,current version at.water code b d,e.water code a.section b d,as implemented through section of the commission implementing regulations,also requires the commission to assess an amendment application effect on groundwater use,quality,or recharge.act of june,ch.laws,current version at.water code b d.admin.code.marshall and the commission contention that any application that does not increase the amount or rate of diversion must be approved irrespective of these effects would undermine the code purpose as reflected in section b clause.
section b predicate clause requires that an amendment application meet all other applicable requirements of this chapter for the approval of an application.water code b.all other requirements of the chapter can only mean those that do not concern section b specific criteria,assessment of adverse impact on other water right holders or the environment on the stream.those requirements are described as follows in section b for ease of illustration,those criteria that section b excludes or that clearly do not apply to amendments are indicated and explained in bold text 
b the commission shall grant the application only if 
the application conforms to the requirements prescribed by this chapter and accompanied by the prescribed fee 
unappropriated water is available in the source of supply the amendment here seeks no new appropriation,but would instead allow marshall to use previously appropriated water for a different purpose 
the proposed appropriation 
a is intended for a beneficial use 
b does not impair existing water rights or vested riparian rights assumption applies to impacts on other holders under section b 
c is not detrimental to the public welfare 
d considers the assessments performed under sections d and e effects on bays and estuaries and uses and sections effects on water quality,effects on groundwater and effects on fish and wildlife habitats assumption applies to these effects under section b and 
e addresses a water supply need in a manner that is consistent with the state water plan and the relevant approved regional water plan for any area in which the proposed appropriation is located,unless the commission determines that conditions warrant waiver of this requirement and 
the applicant has provided evidence that reasonable diligence will be used to avoid waste and achieve water conservation as defined by subdivision b,section.
water code b.in sum,the other applicable requirements that do not implicate effects on other holders or the environment concern conformance with administrative requirements,beneficial use of the water right,protection of the public welfare,groundwater effects,consistency with the state and any applicable regional water plan,avoidance of waste,and achievement of water conservation.id.
the legislative history that we have described,as well as the history of the commission authority over amendments and section b place in the general regulatory scheme,comports with this interpretation.
commission authority 
the legislature enacted the legislation that became section of the water code in.act of may,ch.laws.that legislation resolved longstanding jurisprudential questions about the commission authority over changes to water rights.in,the austin court of appeals had held that a permit holder was required to obtain permission from the board of water engineers to change the permitted purpose and place of use of the water right.clark briscoe irrigation,no writ.years later,the same court held that an irrigation district was not required to obtain the agency approval to change the use of water rights reflected in the district certified filing.nueces county water control improvement dist.water rights comm n,writ ref.the court distinguished clark on the ground that the case had involved a permit rather than a certified filing 
the rationale of clark is that the necessity for obtaining approval of the commission to change the authorized place or purpose of use of water under a permit is implied from the statutory policy and requirements relating to the grant of a permit in its original form,including the commission approval of the original place and purpose of use.those reasons are absent in the instance of a certified filing since the state approval of the place and purpose of use was not required in initiating a certified filing.
id.the court decision in nueces county prompted the legislature to adopt the legislation embodied in sections a and c,which made clear that a ll holders of permits,certified filings,and certificates of adjudication are required to obtain agency permission to alter a water right in any way.see act of may,ch.laws current version at.water code a.the legislature directed the commission to adopt rules to effectuate the statute.id.current version at.water code c.in accordance with that mandate,the commission adopted procedural rules governing amendment applications,as well as rules incorporating substantive water code criteria for the approval of amendments.
commission rules 
in response to the legislature directive,the commission adopted the predecessor to its current rules governing notice and hearing for applications to amend water rights.see texas water rights commission,rule available at the texas commission on environmental quality.that rule,like the commission current rule,did not require notice and hearing on every amendment application id.the current rule provides 
only an application to amend an existing permit which does not contemplate an additional consumptive use of state water or an increased rate or period of diversion and which,in the judgment of the commission,has no potential for harming any other existing water right,is subject to amendment by the commission without notice other than that provided to the record holder.upon filing such an application,the commission shall consider whether additional notice is required based on the particular facts of the application.
admin.code c.thus,a proposed amendment that contemplates no additional consumptive water use or increase in the rate or period of diversion,and that lacks potential to harm other existing water rights,is presumptively not subject to notice and hearing,although the rule contemplates that the commission may determine additional notice and hearing is required based on the particular facts of the application.see generally.admin.code 
the substantive rules that the commission adopted under section c and other water code provisions require assessment of a number of factors when considering an application to amend an existing permit.those rules were amended in,largely in response to senate bill.in amending the rules,the commission differentiated between criteria pertaining to an amendment impact on other water rights and the environment,and other particular section criteria.criteria concerning the former include the no injury rule.admin.code,effects,id,estuarine considerations,id,and uses,id.while these substantive criteria must be assessed when an applicant seeks a new appropriation of water,and notice and hearing must be afforded to those who may be affected,their assessment is constrained by the assumption for an amendment of that appropriation.this constraint significantly reduces the criteria that must be assessed for a permit amendment,thereby streamlining the amendment process as section b intended.
other commission rules specifically require the commission to consider other section criteria unconstrained by section b assumption.these include the public welfare,groundwater effects,the adequacy of a water conservation plan,and consistency with the state water plan and any approved regional plan.id.a c,e.
in sum,we interpret section b to require the commission to assess specified criteria other than impacts on other holders and the environment when considering a proposed amendment.marshall has a
