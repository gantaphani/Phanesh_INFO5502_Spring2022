background 
in,the united states and the republic of panama entered into a treaty which granted the united states occupation and control of the panama canal zone,a strip of land ten miles wide across the isthmus of panama,for the purpose of constructing the panama canal.see varilla treaty,stat.in,congress created the panama canal company to operate the canal and continued to exercise sovereignty over the canal and the canal zone until october,the effective date of the panama canal treaty of.see panama canal treaty,stat.
under the panama canal treaty,the united states and panama agreed to reestablish panamanian sovereignty over the zone but granted the united states the right to continue operating the canal until december,under the panama canal commission pcc,a governmental agency.id.at art.iii.to implement the treaty,congress then passed the panama canal act of,which,inter alia,established the pcc as a united states government corporation and set terms for pcc employment,including treating pcc personnel as federal employees and subjecting them to certain provisions of the civil service reform act of,stat.csra,including a,the provision at issue here.see a.
asedac,an association of former pcc employees and of specific panamanian civilian employees of the armed forces at the panama canal zone,appeals the dismissal of its complaint against the pcc,its successor entity the office of transition ota,the secretary of the army of the united states,and the secretary of the treasury of the united states the defendants.asedac claims that the pcc and ota violated the panama canal treaty and various united states laws,including the panama canal act,et,the administrative procedure act,et,and the back pay act,b,by failing to pay them an extra month salary for every twelve months they worked for the pcc in accordance with panamanian law,to provide them severance pay in accordance with panamanian and united states law,and to make contributions on their behalf to the panamanian social security system.
asedac sought an order requiring the secretary of the army,in his capacity as a member of the pcc supervisory board,to direct the pcc the ota to provide these benefits and requiring the secretary of the treasury to preserve and invest funds necessary to pay these benefits.the defendants moved to dismiss asedac complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure on the grounds that it was preempted by the csra.specifically,the defendants argued that the district court was barred from considering asedac claims because of a,which,they contend,makes the grievance procedures of collective bargaining agreements the exclusive remedy for grievances falling within the csra coverage.
the district court dismissed asedac claims pursuant to rule b,holding that a barred it from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over those claims.the district court first held that asedac claims for back pay and other benefits were grievances within the meaning of the csra and were subject to csra preemption,which it construed as a jurisdictional bar mandating dismissal under rule b rather than,as asedac argued,an affirmative defense subject to avoidances such as frustration or futility.the court further rejected asedac argument that a amendment to a changed its meaning and established asedac right to seek judicial review of its claims.
on appeal,asedac argues that the district court erred by failing to give meaning to the amendment to a,which asedac contends limits that provision exhaustion requirement only to administrative,but not judicial,remedies,and that even if a is held to preclude judicial review,asedac asserted failure to exhaust available grievance procedures as mandated by a should not be interpreted as a jurisdictional bar,but rather as an affirmative defense subject to traditional avoidances such as frustration and futility,which asedac contends are applicable here.
standard of review 
we review the district court determination of its subject matter jurisdiction de novo.see mexiport,frontier communications,cir milan express,averitt express,cir.the underlying issue on appeal,a question of statutory interpretation,is also subject to de novo review.see united states vittor,cir estate of shelfer,cir.
discussion 
the central issue on appeal is the meaning of a,which,together with section a,reads as follows 
except as provided in paragraph of this subsection,any collective bargaining agreement shall provide procedures for the settlement of grievances,including questions of arbitrability.except as provided in subsections d,e,and g of this section,the procedures shall be the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage.
any collective bargaining agreement may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures which are provided for in the agreement.
a emphasis supplied.
the dispute between the parties centers on the word administrative in a.prior to,the statute did not contain this word.instead,a formerly stated that the grievance procedures set forth in a collective bargaining agreement would be the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances which fell within its coverage.a emphasis supplied.
in carter gibbs,en banc,cert.denied,d,the federal circuit interpreted the language to preclude federal employees from resolving grievances covered by their collective bargaining agreement in court.relying on the unambiguous text of unamended a,carter held that the statute limited the resolution of such grievances to the negotiated procedures set forth in an employee collective bargaining agreement.carter,at.
however,asedac contends that by adding the word administrative to a in the amendment,congress intended to overrule carter and to establish a federal employee right to bring an action in court despite the availability of an administrative grievance procedure.the pcc counters that the structure of the statute,the remedial scheme established by,and the central purposes of the csra all counsel against reading the amendment to allow federal employees to press their grievances in court when they could seek an administrative remedy under their collective bargaining agreement.
the district court relied on carter to conclude that a bars a federal employee from bypassing the negotiated procedures contained in his or her collective bargaining agreement.however,while this appeal was pending,the federal circuit in mudge united states,overruled carter,as well as three decisions of the court of federal claims on which the district court also relied holding that carter was no longer applicable to interpreting a.mudge,at.instead,the federal circuit determined that by adding the word administrative to a,congress established a federal employee right to bring his or her claims directly in federal court.see also united states.
in mudge,the federal circuit interpreted a by applying the fundamental canon of statutory construction that statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute.mudge,at.because the csra does not define the word administrative,the court first determined that congress must have given that term its ordinary meaning,according to which administrative is distinguished from such functions and acts as are judicial.id.accordingly,the court held that t he plain language of a as amended is therefore clear while a limits the administrative resolution of a federal employee grievances to the negotiated procedures set forth in his or her collective bargaining agreement
