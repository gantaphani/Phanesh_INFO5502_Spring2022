the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia shields foreign states from suits in united states courts,with specified exceptions.the expropriation exception applies to any case in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property is owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state engaged in a commercial activity in the united states.a.
a wholly owned venezuelan subsidiary subsidiary of an american company parent has long supplied oil rigs to oil development entities that were part of the venezuelan government.the american parent and its venezuelan subsidiary plaintiffs filed suit in federal court against those entities venezuela,claiming that venezuela had unlawfully expropriated the subsidiary rigs by nationalizing them.venezuela moved to dismiss the case on the ground that its sovereign immunity deprived the district court of jurisdiction.plaintiffs argued that the case falls within the expropriation exception,but venezuela claimed that international law did not cover the expropriation of property belonging to a country nationals like the subsidiary and that the american parent did not have property rights in the subsidiary assets.the district court agreed as to the subsidiary,dismissing its claim on jurisdictional grounds.but it rejected the claim that the parent had no rights in the subsidiary property.the district of columbia circuit reversed in part and affirmed in part,finding that both claims fell within the exception.with respect to the subsidiary claim,it concluded that a sovereign taking of its own nationals property would violate international law if the expropriation unreasonably discriminated based on a company shareholders nationality.with respect to the parent claim,it held that the exception applied because the parent had raised its rights in a nonfrivolous way.the court decided only whether the plaintiffs might have a nonfrivolous expropriation claim,making clear that,under its standard,a nonfrivolous argument would be sufficient to bring a case within the scope of the exception.given the factual stipulations,the court concluded,the subsidiary had satisfied that standard for purposes of surviving a motion to dismiss.
held the standard is not consistent with the fsia.a case falls within the scope of the expropriation exception only if the property in which the party claims to hold rights was indeed property taken in violation of international law.a court should decide the foreign sovereign immunity defense a t the threshold of the action,verlinden central bank of nigeria,resolving any factual disputes as near to the outset of the case as is reasonably possible.
a the expropriation exception grants jurisdiction only where there is a legally valid claim that a certain kind of right is at issue property rights and that the relevant property was taken in a certain way in violation of international law.simply making a nonfrivolous argument to that effect is not sufficient.this reading is supported by the provision language,which applies in a case in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue.such language would normally foresee a judicial decision about the jurisdictional matter.this interpretation is supported by precedent.see,permanent mission of india to united nations city of new york.it is also supported by a basic objective of the fsia,which is to follow international law principles,namely,that granting foreign sovereigns immunity from suit both recognizes the absolute independence of every sovereign authority and helps to induc e each nation state,as a matter of international comity,to respect the independence and dignity of every other,berizzi brothers pesaro.nothing in the fsia history suggests that congress intended a radical departure from these principles in codifying the doctrine of restrictive sovereign immunity,which denies immunity in cases arising out of a foreign state strictly commercial acts,but applies immunity in suits involving the foreign sovereign public acts,verlinden,supra,at.it is thus not surprising that the expropriation exception on its face emphasizes conformity with international law,requiring both a commercial connection with the united states and a taking of property in violation of international law.
a reading of the exception would undermine the objectives embedded in the statute language,history,and structure.it could also embroil a foreign sovereign in an american lawsuit for some time by adopting a standard limited only by the bounds of a lawyer nonfrivolous imagination.and it could cause friction with other nations,leading to reciprocal actions against this country.
b plaintiffs arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.they suggest that the expropriation exception should be treated similarly to arising under jurisdiction,which applies if a plaintiff can make a nonfrivolous argument that a federal law provides the relief sought even if,in fact,it does not,bell hood.but differs from the exception in language and concerns.section often simply determines which court doors federal or state are open,and neither it nor related jurisdictional sections seek to provide a sovereign foreign nation with immunity the fsia basic objective.nor does the text of suggest that consistency with international law is of particular importance.
plaintiffs also claim that the approach will work little harm since the matter could be resolved by motion practice before the sovereign bears the expense of a full trial.but resolving a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b or summary judgment under rule may impose increased burdens of time and expense upon the foreign nation.and a district court decision that there is a violation of international law as a matter of jurisdiction may be immediately appealable as a collateral order,while the same decision made pursuant to a rule b or rule motion would be a decision on the merits not subject to immediate appeal.moreover,the circuit would part with its standard where a violation of international law is not an element of the claim to be decided on the merits.this bifurcated approach is difficult to reconcile with the statute language,history,or purpose and it creates needless complexity for judges and lawyers,domestic and foreign.

justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the foreign sovereign immunities act of fsia or act,provides,with specified exceptions,that a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states one of the jurisdictional exceptions the expropriation exception says that 
a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states or of the states in any case in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property is owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state engaged in a commercial activity in the united states.a.
the question here concerns the phrase case in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue.
does this phrase mean that,to defeat sovereign immunity,a party need only make a nonfrivolous argument that the case falls within the scope of the exception once made,does the existence of that nonfrivolous argument mean that the court retains jurisdiction over the case until the court decides,say,the merits of the case or does a more rigorous jurisdictional standard apply to put the question more generally what happens in a case where the party seeking to rely on the expropriation exception makes a nonfrivolous,but ultimately incorrect,claim that his property was taken in violation of international law 
in our view,a party nonfrivolous,but ultimately incorrect,argument that property was taken in violation of international law is insufficient to confer jurisdiction.rather,state and federal courts can maintain jurisdiction to hear the merits of a case only if they find that the property in which the party claims to hold rights was indeed property taken in violation of international law.put differently,the relevant factual allegations must make out a legally valid claim that a certain kind of right is at issue property rights and that the relevant property was taken in a certain way in violation of international law.a good argument to that effect is not sufficient.but a court normally need not resolve,as a jurisdictional matter,disputes about whether a party actually held rights in that property those questions remain for the merits phase of the litigation.
moreover,where jurisdictional questions turn upon further factual development,the trial judge may take evidence and resolve relevant factual disputes.but,consistent with foreign sovereign immunity basic objective,namely,to free a foreign sovereign from suit,the court should normally resolve those factual disputes and reach a decision about immunity as near to the outset of the case as is reasonably possible.see verlinden central bank of nigeria.
since the a wholly owned subsidiary subsidiary of an american company parent supplied oil rigs to oil development entities that were part of the venezuelan government.in the american parent company and its venezuelan subsidiary the respondents here brought this lawsuit in federal court against those foreign government entities.the entities go by their initials,pdvsa,but we shall normally refer to them as venezuela or the venezuelan government.the american parent and the venezuelan subsidiary claimed that the venezuelan government had unlawfully expropriated the subsidiary oil rigs.and they sought compensation.
according to stipulated facts,by early the venezuelan government had failed to pay more than million that it owed the subsidiary.at that point the government sent troops to the equipment yard where the rigs were stored,prevented the subsidiary from removing the rigs,and issued a decree of expropriation nationalizing the rigs.app.subsequently,the president of the oil development entities led a rally at the subsidiary offices,where he referred to the venezuelan subsidiary as an american company with foreign gentlemen investors.at.
venezuela asked the court to dismiss the case on the ground that venezuela possessed sovereign immunity and that the court consequently lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.see fed.rules civ.proc.b and b verlinden,supra,at,explaining that a court lacks and personal jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign unless an fsia exception applies.the companies replied that the case falls within the expropriation exception.venezuela in turn argued that the subsidiary expropriation claim did not satisfy the exception because international law does not cover expropriations of property belonging to a country own nationals the taking was not in violation of international law,and the exception thus does not apply.record in d dc,doc.venezuela further argued that the american parent nationality makes no difference because,as a corporate parent,it does not own the subsidiary assets.doc,at.
the parties agreed that the district court should then decide whether the exception applies,and it should do so on the basis of governing law,taking all of the plaintiffs allegations as true and construing the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.app.the court decided,in relevant part,that the exception did not apply to the venezuelan subsidiary claim because the subsidiary was a national of venezuela.see supp.the court concluded that venezuela consequently possessed sovereign immunity,and it dismissed the subsidiary claim on jurisdictional grounds.it rejected,however,venezuela argument that the parent had no rights in property in the subsidiary.it concluded that venezuela actions have deprived the parent,individually,of its essential and unique rights as sole shareholder by dismantling its voting power,destroying its ownership,and frustrating its control over the company.at.
the venezuelan subsidiary appealed the dismissal of its expropriation claim,and venezuela appealed the court refusal to dismiss the parent claim.the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit reversed in part and affirmed in part the district court conclusions.it decided that both the subsidiary and the parent claims fell within the exception.
with respect to the subsidiary claim,the court agreed that a sovereign taking of its own nationals property normally does not violate international law.but,the court said,there is an exception to this rule.and that exception applies when a sovereign expropriation unreasonably discriminates on the basis of a company shareholders nationality,cadc citing banco nacional de cuba sabbatino.that exception,it added,might apply here,in which case the expropriation would violate international law,the fsia expropriation exception would apply,and the federal courts would possess jurisdiction over the case,at.with respect to the parent expropriation claim,the court agreed with the district court that the expropriation exception applied because the parent had put its rights in property in issue in a way.at.
for present purposes,it is important to keep in mind that the court of appeals did not decide on the basis of the stipulated facts that the plaintiffs allegations are sufficient to show their property was taken in violation of international law.it decided instead that the plaintiffs might have such a claim.and it made clear the legal standard that it would apply.it said that,in deciding whether the expropriation exception applies,it would set an exceptionally low bar.at.any possible,claim of expropriation is sufficient,in the court of appeals view,to bring a case within the scope of the fsia exception.in particular if a plaintiff alleges facts and claims that permit the plaintiff to make an expropriation claim that is not wholly insubstantial or frivolous,then the exception permits the suit and the sovereign loses its immunity.ibid.emphasis added.given the factual stipulations,the court of appeals did not suggest further factfinding on this jurisdictional issue but,rather,decided that the subsidiary had satisfied this circuit forgiving standard for surviving a motion to dismiss in an fsia case.at.
venezuela filed a petition for certiorari asking us to decide whether the court of appeals had applied the correct standard in deciding that the companies had met the expropriation exception requirements.we agreed to do so.
foreign sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in this case because explicit statutory language makes it so.see a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states except as provided by the fsia exceptions a a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of federal and state courts if the exception at issue here is satisfied.given the parties stipulations as to all relevant facts,our inquiry poses a pure question of statutory construction,republic of austria altmann.in our view,the expropriation exception grants jurisdiction only where there is a valid claim that property has been taken in violation of international law.a.a nonfrivolous argument to that effect is insufficient.
for one thing,the provision language,while ambiguous,supports such a reading.it says that there is jurisdiction in a case in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue.ibid.such language would normally foresee a judicial decision about the jurisdictional matter.and that matter is whether a certain kind of right is at issue,namely,a property right taken in violation of international law.to take a purely hypothetical example,a party might assert a claim to a house in a foreign country.if the foreign country nationalized the house and,when sued,asserted sovereign immunity,then the claiming party would as a jurisdictional matter prove that he claimed property which a house obviously is and also that the property was taken in violation of international law.he need not show as a jurisdictional matter that he,rather than someone else,owned the house.that question is part of the merits of the case and remains at issue.
we recognize that merits and jurisdiction will sometimes come intertwined.suppose that the party asserted a claim to architectural plans for the house.it might be necessary to decide whether the law recognizes the kind of right that he asserts,or whether it is a right in property that was taken in violation of international law.perhaps that is the only serious issue in the case.if so,the court must still answer the jurisdictional question.if to do so,it must inevitably decide some,or all,of the merits issues,so be it.
our reading of the statute is consistent with its language.the case is one which the existence of rights remains at issue until the court decides the merits of the case.but whether the rights asserted are rights of a certain kind,namely,rights in property taken in violation of international law,is a jurisdictional matter that the court must typically decide at the outset of the case,or as close to the outset as is reasonably possible.
precedent offers a degree of support for our interpretation.in permanent mission of india to united nations city of new york,we interpreted a different fsia exception for cases in which rights in immovable property situated in the united states are in issue.a.we held that there was jurisdiction over the case because the plaintiff lawsuit to enforce a tax lien directly implicate d the property rights described by the fsia exception.see,at.we did not simply rely upon a finding that the plaintiff had made a nonfrivolous argument that the exception applied.
for another thing,one of the fsia basic objectives,as shown by its history,supports this reading.the act for the most part embodies basic principles of international law long followed both in the united states and elsewhere.see schooner exchange mcfaddon,cranch,see also verlinden,at explaining that the act comprehensively regulat es the amenability of foreign nations to suit in the united states our courts have understood,as international law itself understands,foreign nation states to be independent sovereign entities.to grant those sovereign entities an immunity from suit in our courts both recognizes the absolute independence of every sovereign authority and helps to induc e each nation state,as a matter of international comity,to respect the independence and dignity of every other,including our own.berizzi brothers pesaro,quoting the parlement belge,appeal taken from admiralty div.
in the century,we,like many other nations,began to treat nations acting in a commercial capacity like other commercial entities.see permanent mission,supra,at.and we consequently began to limit our recognition of sovereign immunity,denying that immunity in cases arising out of a foreign state strictly commercial acts,but continuing to apply that doctrine in suits involving the foreign sovereign public acts,verlinden,at emphasis added.
at first,our courts,aware of the expertise of the executive branch in matters of foreign affairs,relied heavily upon the advice of that branch when deciding just when and how this restrictive sovereign immunity doctrine applied.ibid.see also,similar.but in,congress,at the urging of the department of state and department of justice,began to codify the doctrine.the resulting statute,the fsia,starts from a premise of immunity and then creates exceptions to the general principle.at verlinden,supra,at.almost all the exceptions involve commerce or immovable property located in the united states,a and see also expressing the finding that u nder international law,states are not immune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts insofar as their commercial activities are concerned the statute thereby creates a doctrine that by and large continues to reflect basic principles of international law,in particular those principles embodied in what jurists refer to as the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.see,restatement third of foreign relations law of the united states,and comment a describing the restrictive theory of immunity united nations general assembly,convention on jurisdictional immunities of states and their property,res,adopting a restrictive theory of immunity and withdrawing immunity for loss of property where,among other requirements,the act or omission occurred in whole or in part in the territory of th e other state united nations general assembly,report of the ad hoc committee on jurisdictional immunities of states and their property,supp,same.
we have found nothing in the history of the statute that suggests congress intended a radical departure from these basic principles.to the contrary,the state department,which helped to draft the fsia language and to whose views on sovereign immunity this court,like congress,has paid special attention,altmann,at,told congress that the act was drafted keeping in mind what we believe to be the general state of the law internationally,so that we conform fairly closely to our accepted international standards,hearing on before the subcommittee on claims and governmental relations of the house of representatives committee on the judiciary.the department added that,by doing so,we would diminish the likelihood that other nations would each go their own way,thereby subject ing the united states abroad to more claims than we permit in this country ibid.it is consequently not surprising to find that the expropriation exception on its face emphasizes conformity with international law by requiring not only a commercial connection with the united states but also a taking of property in violation of international law.
we emphasize this point,embedded in the statute language,history,and structure,because doing so reveals a basic objective of our sovereign immunity doctrine,which a reading of the expropriation exception would undermine.a sovereign taking or regulating of its own nationals property within its own territory is often just the kind of foreign sovereign public act a jure imperii that the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity ordinarily leaves immune from suit.see permanent mission,at describing the fsia distinction between public acts,or jure imperii,and purely commercial ones restatement third of foreign relations law of the united states,at noting that,under international law,a state is responsible for a taking of the property of a national of another state emphasis added.see also restatement fourth of foreign relations law of the united states,reporter note,tent.draft,noting that n o provision comparable to the exception has yet been adopted in the domestic immunity statutes of other countries and that expropriations are considered acts jure imperii united states belmont,cheng schwarzberger,general principles of law as applied by international courts and tribunals collecting cases describing the power of the sovereign state to expropriate internal quotation marks omitted jurisdictional immunities of the state germany italy,judgt.of noting consistent state practice in respect to the distinction between public and commercial acts and describing an international law of immunity recognizing such a difference altmann,supra,at breyer,concurring describing the french court of appeals decision about whether a king who has abdicated the throne is entitled to claim immunity as hea d of state when his sovereign status at the time of suit was in doubt quoting farouk of egypt christian dior,clunet,ca paris.
to be sure,there are fair arguments to be made that a sovereign taking of its own nationals property sometimes amounts to an expropriation that violates international law,and the expropriation exception provides that the general principle of immunity
