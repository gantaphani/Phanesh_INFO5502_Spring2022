drawbridge special opportunities fund lp drawbridge appeals from a september,order of the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york shelley chapman,bankruptcy judge granting recognition of a foreign main proceeding recognition order.because we find that a applies to the debtor in a foreign main proceeding under chapter of the bankruptcy code,we vacate and remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
foreign representatives are the liquidators of octaviar administration pty oa,a company incorporated in queensland,australia.oa was placed into external administration in australia on october.on july,the supreme court of queensland ordered that oa be liquidated.as part of the investigation into oa affairs,various australian affiliates of drawbridge have been investigated and,on april,a lawsuit was commenced in australia against certain of those affiliates seeking aud.
on august,foreign representatives petitioned the bankruptcy court for an order recognizing the australian oa liquidation proceeding as a foreign main proceeding pursuant to u.drawbridge appeared and filed an objection on august.on september,the bankruptcy court entered the recognition order,and drawbridge filed a notice of appeal to the district court on september.on october,foreign representatives filed a motion seeking discovery from drawbridge and other parties.on october,drawbridge sought a stay pending appeal.
on november,the bankruptcy court granted a joint application for certification of the recognition order for direct appeal to this court pursuant to d a i,a iii and b i.the same day,the court entered an opinion explaining its decision.the court determined that there was no controlling precedent governing its holding that a debtor within the meaning of chapter is not required to have a domicile,residence,place of business or property in the united states the same issue was a matter of public importance that would dramatically impact the jurisdiction of the united states bankruptcy courts and the use of chapter to assist in the administration of insolvency cases and the legitimate investigation of claims and assets in the united states and a direct appeal would materially advance the progress of this chapter case.mem.op.in supp.of certification of direct appeal to the court of appeals for the second circuit at,in re barnet,dkt.
the bankruptcy court denied drawbridge motion to stay discovery on december,and granted foreign representatives discovery motion on december.the parties filed a joint application for direct appeal on december.on february,we granted the joint application and issued a stay of discovery.
discussion 
appellate standing 
this case presents an unusual jurisdictional thicket.foreign representatives argue that drawbridge lacks appellate standing because drawbridge is not aggrieved by the recognition order the order named in the parties joint request for direct appeal.we agree that,under the facts of this case,drawbridge may not appeal from the recognition order.however,that conclusion does not end our analysis.the bankruptcy court subsequent discovery order cured the jurisdictional infirmity notwithstanding the parties failure to discuss the discovery order in the joint request for direct appeal.in effect,we construe the appeal as being from the discovery order,which appeal brings up for review the recognition order that was a necessary prerequisite to discovery.
a.the recognition order 
we first consider whether drawbridge is permitted to appeal from the recognition order.as this appeal is direct,the issue of appellate standing was not expressly addressed by any lower court opinion.regardless,we review jurisdictional questions of law de novo.see adams zarnel in re zarnel,cir w e must first determine whether we have jurisdiction.we review these legal issues standing and mootness de novo.
the current bankruptcy code prescribes no limits on standing beyond those implicit in article iii of the united states constitution.congress has given us jurisdiction over all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees of the district courts in bankruptcy cases dish network dbsd,in re dbsd,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.nonetheless,our precedents establish that in order to have standing to appeal from a bankruptcy court ruling,an appellant must be a person aggrieved a person directly and adversely affected pecuniarily by the challenged order of the bankruptcy court.id.at internal quotation marks omitted quoting int l trade admin.rensselaer polytechnic,cir this test is stricter than article iii injury in fact test,and its stringency is rooted in a concern that freely granting appeals to those persons affected by bankruptcy court orders will sound the death knell of the orderly disposition of bankruptcy matters.licensing by paolo,sinatra in re gucci,cir see in re dbsd,at quoting in re gucci,at.
the recognition order neither names drawbridge nor directs any relief against drawbridge.nor does drawbridge argue that it is affected by the automatic relief provided for in see morning mist holdings krys in re fairfield sentry,cir considering an appeal from a recognition order by the party aggrieved by the automatic stay imposed by a.instead,drawbridge relies on the fact that at oral argument on the recognition order,foreign representatives stated their intention to take discovery of the american directors of the drawbridge affiliates that were sued in australia.tr.of record at,in re octaviar administration pty.
were we to accept this argument,however,it would undermine the pecuniary interest test and ignore our concern that if appellate standing is not limited,bankruptcy litigation will become mired in endless appeals brought by the myriad of parties who are indirectly affected by every bankruptcy court order.kabro assocs.of islip,llc colony hills assocs.in re colony hill assocs,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it is not the intentions of a litigant that cause pecuniary harm but the relief directed by a bankruptcy court,and here the recognition order contained no relief that affected drawbridge.
indeed,we have explicitly stated that potential harm from a bankruptcy court order is insufficient to justify appellate standing.see kane johns manville in re johns manville,cir noting that potential harm incident to the bankruptcy court orders is insufficient to render a party directly and pecuniarily affected by them.accord fire ins.of hartford thorpe insulation in re thorpe insulation,app x,cir summary order courts of appeal routinely deny standing to marginal parties involved in bankruptcy proceedings who,even though they may be exposed to some potential harm incident to the bankruptcy court order,are not directly affected by that order.quoting travelers ins.porter,cir duckor spradling metzger baum trust in re,cir endorsing our distinction in in re johns manville between a creditor opposing a plan of reorganization,who has standing,and marginal parties who face potential harm,who do not.
here,the recognition order subjected drawbridge only to potential future harm.to hold otherwise would ignore the bankruptcy court discretion to deny discovery under.it follows that the recognition order was not appealable by drawbridge when issued.
b.the discovery order 
although we conclude that a recognition order is not itself appealable by a party that is not directly affected by the relief that order provides,this conclusion does not end our standing analysis.here,drawbridge is aggrieved by an order of the bankruptcy court the discovery order issued on december.we next consider whether that order is appealable and conclude that it is.
because they are not final orders,the general rule is that discovery orders are not appealable unless the object of the discovery order refuses to comply and is held in contempt.see,e,golan am.airlines,in re air crash at belle harbor,on,cir glotzer stewart in re ex rel.glotzer,cir g enerally,a litigant who wants to challenge a discovery order must disobey the order,be held in contempt of court,then bring an appeal.
this rule has an exception for discovery orders issued pursuant to a,which provides for discovery for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal.a see chevron berlinger,cir.in chevron,we reasoned that the discovery order constitutes the final resolution of a petition to take discovery in aid of a foreign proceeding and is,therefore,immediately appealable.at.the same reasoning applies in this context.chapter proceedings,like section proceedings,are ancillary to a suit in another tribunal,such that there will never be a final resolution on the merits beyond the discovery relief itself.it follows that the discovery order entered by the bankruptcy court was appealable.
moreover,we have previously entertained an appeal from a party aggrieved by the automatic relief imposed by section.see in re fairfield sentry,at.appellate standing was warranted in fairfield precisely because once recognition is granted,the imposition of automatic relief requires no further action by the bankruptcy court.the discretionary relief permitted by section requires an extra step,but once that step is taken and the bankruptcy court has chosen to exercise its discretion,a party aggrieved by section stands in the same position as one aggrieved by section.if appellate review is available to one,therefore,it should be available to the other.
having concluded that we would have jurisdiction over an appeal from the discovery order,two questions remain whether the discovery order grants us jurisdiction over a premature notice of appeal from the recognition order and if so,whether an appeal from the discovery order brings up for review the recognition order.we answer both questions in the affirmative.
the notice of appeal filed on september,was directed to the district court,not to this court.before the district court assumed jurisdiction,however,the bankruptcy court,sua sponte,suggested that the parties seek certification for direct appeal to this court,giving as its reason that drawbridge and its affiliates really do want to produce documents and foreign representatives really want the documents.tr.of record at,in re octaviar administration pty.earlier in the same proceeding,foreign representatives had already made their argument that drawbridge lacked appellate standing.see id.at.the bankruptcy court statement that appellate review should be sought to expedite discovery,therefore,did not occur in a vacuum.rather,the bankruptcy court believed that our resolution of the validity of the recognition order would be dispositive of whether discovery was available.the parties then jointly petitioned the bankruptcy court for certification of direct appeal,which was granted on november.the bankruptcy court issued its discovery order on december,and the parties did not file their joint request for direct appeal to this court until december.at no time,therefore,was any notice of appeal or request for direct appeal pending in this court before the discovery order had been issued.
we have held that a premature notice of appeal from a nonfinal order may ripen into a valid notice of appeal if a final judgment has been entered by the time the appeal is heard and the appellee suffers no prejudice.this rule applies even if the final judgment was not itself appealed.community bank,riffle,f d,cir per curiam internal citations and quotation marks omitted see berlin renaissance rental partners,llc,cir same as first sentence of riffle quote.
in riffle,we exercised jurisdiction over an appeal from a and,hence,denial of a motion to dismiss because by the time the appeal reached us,the underlying bankruptcy proceeding was rendered final and appealable by a subsequent confirmation order.at.as in this case,the notice of appeal in riffle was filed after the order that rendered the lower court proceeding final.id.at.the discovery order,therefore,caused the premature notice of appeal from the recognition order to ripen into a valid notice of appeal.id.at.
we would reach the same result applying the federal rules of appellate procedure.in smith barry,the supreme court ruled that i f a document filed within the time specified by rule gives the notice required by rule,it is effective as a notice of appeal.smith barry,see id.w hen papers are technically at variance with the letter of rule,a court may nonetheless find that the litigant has complied with the rule if the litigant action is the functional equivalent of what the rule requires although courts should construe rule liberally when determining whether it has been complied with,noncompliance is fatal to an appeal.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.the year after barry,the federal rules of appellate procedure were amended to add what is now rule c,providing that a n appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal,or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice.rule c,therefore,codifies barry instruction to construe rule liberally and to overlook technical variances.
our precedents are in accord.invoking rule c,we interpreted a notice of appeal from a final judgment entered on the day of april,and from each part thereof as also appealing from orders entered on five other days ranging from june,to april.head start child dev,econ.opportunity comm of nassau,cir.we have similarly construed an appeal from the denial of a habeas petition as also appealing from a subsequent motion for reconsideration.see marrero pichardo ashcroft,cir.in marrero pichardo,we noted that i n determining whether to permit a defective notice of appeal,this court considers the notice of appeal so as to remain faithful to the intent of the appellant,fair to the appellee,and consistent with the jurisdictional authority of this court.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,there can be no argument that foreign representatives were in any way deprived of the notice required by rule or otherwise suffered prejudice.the only legal issues raised on appeal concern the validity of the recognition order,which is mentioned in the joint request for direct appeal.moreover,the bankruptcy court itself suggested that the purpose of direct appeal was to resolve the question of discovery by determining the validity of the recognition order.see tr.of record at,in re octaviar administration pty.on the bankruptcy court suggestion,the parties jointly pursued a direct appeal,which request was only filed with this court after the appealable order had been issued by the bankruptcy court.the failure to specifically identify the december discovery order,therefore,was a mistake of form for which the appeal must not be dismissed.fed.c.
finally,a correctly noticed appeal from the discovery order would bring up for review the recognition order.such an appeal,as with an appeal from any other final order,opens the record and permits review of all rulings that led up to the judgment.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.see fielding tollaksen,cir w hen a district court enters a final judgment in a case,interlocutory orders rendered in the case typically merge with the judgment for purposes of appellate review.internal quotation marks omitted anobile pelligrino,cir generally,absent prejudice to the appellees,this court interprets an appeal from a specific order disposing of the case as an appeal from the final judgment,which incorporates all previous interlocutory judgments in that case and permits their review on appeal.indeed,in this case,the recognition order was a necessary prerequisite to ordering discovery.see a providing for discovery u pon recognition.the recognition order is properly before us,therefore,as it has merged with the subsequent discovery order.
indeed,in our prior cases considering premature notices of appeal that ripen into valid notices of appeal we have considered the issues raised by the orders appealed from.see berlin,at considering issues arising from the attorneys fees order riffle,at considering issues arising from the denial of a motion to dismiss.we see no reason not to do the same here.
ii.the recognition order 
having determined that we have jurisdiction over this appeal,we now turn to the merits,whether section a applies to a debtor in a chapter proceeding.we review a bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo accepting the bankruptcy court factual findings unless clearly erroneous.in re fairfield sentry,at accord super nova llc gazes,cir applying the same standard.a lower court decision interpreting the meaning of a statute is also reviewed de novo.united states dicristina,cir see kreisberg healthbridge mgmt,llc,cir we review de novo the district court interpretation of the constitution and federal statutes and regulations.

statutory enactments should,moreover,be read so as to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.dicristina,at quoting duncan walker,see nwozuzu holder,cir a statute must be construed to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word internal quotation marks omitted mary jo state local ret,cir one of the most basic interpretive canons is that a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all of its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
the recognition of foreign proceedings is governed by sections through.in re fairfield sentry,at.the basic requirements for recognition are outlined in a the proceeding is a foreign main proceeding or foreign nonmain proceeding as defined by the foreign representative applying for recognition is a person or body and the petition for recognition meets the requirements of.
a foreign main proceeding the category relevant to this appeal is a foreign proceeding pending in the country where the debtor has the center of its main interests.a foreign proceeding is a collective judicial or administrative proceeding in a foreign country under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court,for the purposes of reorganization or liquidation.debtor is defined,f or the purposes of this chapter,as an entity that is the subject of a foreign proceeding.
the question presented by this appeal is whether a applies to a debtor under chapter.section a provides notwithstanding any other provision of this section,only a person that resides or has a domicile,a place of business,or property in the united states,or a municipality,may be a debtor under this title.section a of title provides that,other than for an exception not relevant here,chapter of this title appl ies in a case under chapter.section,of course,is within chapter of title and so,by the plain terms of the statute,it applies in a case under chapter.because foreign representatives made no attempt to establish that oa had a domicile,place of business or property in the united states,recognition should not have been granted.
the straightforward nature of our statutory interpretation bears emphasis.section a makes all of chapter applicable to chapter.section a within chapter creates a requirement that must be met by any debtor.chapter governs the recognition of foreign proceedings,which are defined as proceedings in which the assets and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court.the debtor that is the subject of the foreign proceeding,therefore,must meet the requirements of section a before a bankruptcy court may grant recognition of the foreign proceeding.
commentators have reached the same conclusion.see collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry somme,ed.although chapter is the principal chapter of the bankruptcy code that governs the conduct of ancillary cases,several other sections of the bankruptcy code directly affect cases under chapter.these include section,which limits the types of debtors eligible for chapter susan power johnston,conflict between bankruptcy code a and do bankruptcy courts have jurisdiction over chapter cases if the foreign debtor has no assets or presence in the.prac,at s ection a can not be reconciled with chapter and contrary to congress intent,foreign representatives of foreign debtors without assets in the are not,on the face of the statute,entitled to the assistance of bankruptcy courts.
foreign representatives advance several arguments to resist this conclusion.first,they argue that section a creates a requirement for debtors under this title,whereas oa is a debtor under the australian corporations act,not under title.put another way,foreign representatives argue that they are not seeking recognition of a debtor and that no debtor appeared before the bankruptcy court rather,foreign representatives appeared seeking recognition of a foreign proceeding.
this argument fails,however,because the presence of a debtor is inextricably intertwined with the very nature of a chapter proceeding,both in terms of how such a proceeding is defined and in terms of the relief that can be granted.it stretches credulity to argue that the ubiquitous references to a debtor in both chapter and the relevant definitions of chapter do not refer to a debtor under the title that contains both chapters.
although foreign representatives are correct that recognition is sought by a foreign representative,not by a debtor,a,t he term foreign representative means a person or body authorized in a foreign proceeding to administer the reorganization or the liquidation of the debtor assets or affairs.similarly,as noted above,a foreign main proceeding is a foreign proceeding pending in the country where the debtor has the center of its main interests.moreover,section defines a debtor as the subject of a foreign proceeding,and the definition of foreign proceeding identifies the assets and affairs of the debtor as its subject.
in addition,both the automatic and discretionary relief provisions that accompany recognition of a foreign main proceeding are directed towards debtors.a applies,and to the debtor,the property of the debtor,or an interest of the debtor in property,as appropriate.section,in turn,provides for,inter alia,the stay of any proceeding against the debtor.a see also a governing property acquired by the estate or by the debtor.the discretionary relief provisions follow the same pattern.see providing for,entrusting the administration or realization of all or part of the debtor assets within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states to the foreign representative,staying execution against the debtor assets,and granting any additional relief that may be available to a trustee.even the relief that foreign representatives seek requires a debtor under title,as section a provides for the examination of witnesses concerning the debtor assets,affairs,rights,obligations or liabilities.
second,foreign representatives argue that even if oa must qualify as a debtor under title,it is only required to meet the chapter specific definition of debtor contained in section,and not also the requirements of section.as noted above,section defines a debtor f or the purposes of this chapter as an entity that is the subject of a foreign proceeding.this argument also fails,as we can not see how such a preclusive reading of section is reconcilable with the explicit instruction in section a to apply chapter to chapter.but even if the definition of debtor in section blocked application of section within chapter,that would not support the conclusion that oa need not satisfy section in order for foreign representatives to obtain recognition of the foreign proceeding.given its broadest reading,section
