pollution discharges from ships are regulated by both and international law.the act to prevent pollution from ships apps,et,implements two related treaties to which the united states is a signatory.the first is the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships,referred to as the marpol protocol.the second is the protocol of relating to the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships.together,the two treaties are generally referred to as marpol marpol,and more than of the world shipping tonnage is transported under the flags of signatories to these treaties.
annex i to marpol sets forth regulations for the prevention of pollution by oil from ships.apps authorizes the coast guard to issue regulations implementing the requirements of these two treaties.and.the coast guard has issued such regulations incorporating marpol requirements.see et.
annex i sets out,inter alia,the international standards for the maximum amount of oil permitted to be discharged from ships.marpol also requires ships to have and maintain several pieces of equipment intended to work together to measure the oil content of various waste and bilge discharges from ships and to divert discharges containing too much oil to storage tanks rather than allowing them to be discharged from the ship into the ocean.
in addition to prohibitions on oily waste discharges,the treaties require each oil tanker over a given weight to maintain a record known as an oil record book.marpol annex i,reg.the oil record book must include records for all transfers of oil management and disposal of oily wastes generated on board the vessel,including any discharges of dirty ballast or cleaning water from fuel oil tanks and the disposal of oily residues such as sludge,as well as discharges of bilge waste that has accumulated in machinery spaces.id.at reg.accidental or emergency discharges of oil or oily waste greater than or parts per million ppm must also be recorded.these entries in the oil record book must be signed by the person in charge of the operation in this case,abrogar.id.at reg.the oil record book must be maintained on board for not less than three years and must be kept on board the vessel and readily available at all reasonable times.id.
the coast guard has the authority to board and examine the oil record book of any vessel while that vessel is in waters or at a port.c a and c.the is a party to the international regime embodied in marpol and other treaties that require the country in which a ship is registered,known as the flag state,to certify a ship compliance with international standards.port states,such as the in this instance,conduct inspections to ensure compliance in their ports and waters.in conducting inspections,the coast guard typically relies on a ship oil record book and statements of the crew to determine whether the crew is properly handling water and its disposal.failure of a ship to comply with marpol requirements can form the basis for action to refuse to allow that ship to enter port,to prohibit the ship from leaving port without remedial action,to refer the matter to the flag state of the vessel,or where appropriate,to prosecute the violation in the united states.see.
