thai airways,international thai airways appeals from the district court order denying thai airways motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.b.thai airways claims the district court erred in refusing to recognize the preclusive effect res judicata of an earlier order dismissing,under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia or act,et,an identical action brought by gupta.that california order of dismissal was not appealed,and is now final.we raised the issue of jurisdiction during oral argument sua sponte and asked the parties to submit briefing on the discrete issue whether this court has jurisdiction to consider the district court holding that res judicata does not apply in this case.we conclude that we have jurisdiction,and we reverse.
subir gupta,was scheduled to fly from bangkok to los angeles.when gupta attempted to board the plane bound for los angeles,thai airways employees refused to allow gupta to board because they determined his united states visa was invalid.gupta claims the employees subjected him to unwarranted accusations of fraud after he presented a valid and current visa.gupta was unable to fly to los angeles on this date and claims he missed a lucrative business meeting.
gupta timely filed a complaint in california superior court,los angeles county,alleging thai airways employees subjected him to unwarranted accusations of fraud regarding his visa that led to professional business losses.gupta complaint alleged claims of negligence respondeat superior liability negligent hiring,training,retention of unfit employee intentional infliction of emotional distress employer authorization of employee wrongful conduct slander per se and intentional interference with contractual relations.
thai airways successfully moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction asserting it was a foreign state under fsia,and no exception to the fsia was applicable the superior court rejected gupta assertion that thai airways had implicitly waived its immunity under a by communicating with gupta regarding gupta suit and by not responding to the service of the complaint.consequently,the court held thai airways immune from suit in united states courts in accordance with a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states.gupta did not appeal the state court order dismissing the action rather,gupta filed a complaint in federal district court in january,alleging identical causes of action as those raised in the dismissed state court complaint.
thai airways moved to dismiss gupta federal case pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b forum non conveniens.regarding rule b,thai airways asserted that the issue of subject matter jurisdiction and immunity under the fsia was res judicata by virtue of the state court prior determination of these issues.thai airways also argued,without reliance on res judicata,that it was a foreign state and that no exception to the fsia was applicable.
gupta responded by asserting that thai airways is subject to the jurisdiction of united states courts pursuant to the warsaw convention,which governs the international transportation of passengers and cargo.see convention for the unification of certain rules relating to international transportation by air,stat,reprinted in note following gupta also argued that the forum was proper because the warsaw convention allowed for suit at the place of destination.
in ruling on thai airways motion to dismiss,the district court held that the prior state judgment did not bar of the claim in federal court.nominally applying the preclusion rules of california,the court explained that a court dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is not res judicata as to the merits of the claim because it was not a judgment on the merits.because the state court order dismissed gupta action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on thai airways immunity under the fsia,the court held it was not a judgment on the merits and has no preclusive effect.
next the district court held that s uits against foreign states under the warsaw convention are excepted from fsia immunity.on this basis,the district court then held that the suit against thai airways,even though it is a foreign carrier,was properly brought in united states federal court.the convention applied to this case,the district court reasoned,because the act of embarking on an international airline flight was sufficient to bring the incident within the ambits of the convention.
finally the court explained that the forum was proper because article of the warsaw convention allows for actions brought before a court located in the place of the passenger destination.since gupta was bound for los angeles,the district court held that forum is proper in federal district court in california.
thai airways now appeals the district court order denying its motion to dismiss on grounds of rule b.thai airways argues that gupta action in federal court is barred under principles of res judicata because the state court determined that thai airways is immune from suit in the united states on the identical claims asserted in gupta federal complaint.
because this appeal is from an order denying a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter order which ordinarily is not must first determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider thai airways appeal.see savage glendale union high,cir stating that the denial of a motion to dismiss is ordinarily not a complete and final judgment subject to appeal.although the parties did not raise the issue of jurisdiction,we have the obligation to confirm our jurisdiction sua sponte before determining whether the california state court holding that thai airways is immune from suit under the fsia is res judicata in federal court.wmx,miller,cir en banc although the parties did not raise the question of our jurisdiction,we have raised it sua sponte,as we must.we conclude that jurisdiction exists.
the fsia is the exclusive source of subject matter jurisdiction over all suits involving foreign states or their instrumentalities.compania mexicana de aviacion,dist,cir per curiam.hence,only if one of the act specified exceptions to sovereign immunity applies may a court exercise subject matter jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign.verlinden cent.bank of nigeria,d 
because jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign may be exercised only by applicability of an exception to the fsia,we have long held that an order denying immunity under the fsia is appealable under the collateral order doctrine.compania mexicana,at an interlocutory appeal insures that a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states except as provided in the act.id.alteration in the original quoting accordingly,we have jurisdiction over the order denying thai airways rule b motion.
thai airways moved the district court to dismiss gupta action on two grounds lack of subject matter jurisdiction under.b and forum non conveniens under.b in support of its motion to dismiss under rule b,thai airways briefed two grounds for dismissal in the alternative the state court decision already determined thai airways immunity under fsia and,under principles of res judicata,therefore precludes further review of the issue and thai airways is a foreign state within the meaning of fsia,and no fsia exception is applicable to confer the court jurisdiction.the district court rejected both of thai airways arguments and issued an order denying thai airways motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
it is from this order that thai airways is appealing.under compania mexicana,we may review this order denying thai airways immunity under the fsia 
the existence of subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia is a question of law reviewed de novo.see coyle garuda indonesia,cir blaxland,at.
while the order from which thai airways is appealing is one denying its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,thai airways first theory supporting dismissal is that the california state court already determined thai airways was immune under fsia.thus,thai airways contends this determination has preclusive effect in federal court under the principle of res judicata.we agree.
whether a prior state court judgment precludes relitigation of an identical claim in federal court depends on the preclusion rules of the state.migra warren city sch.dist.bd.of,d allen mccurry,d.this principle results from the statutory command in that judicial proceedings shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the united states and its territories and possessions as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state from which they are taken.this statute has long been understood to encompass the doctrines of res judicata,or claim preclusion,and collateral estoppel,or issue preclusion.san remo hotel,city and county of san francisco,d internal quotation marks omitted.hence,we look to california law to determine whether principles of res judicata precluded the district court from deciding anew thai airways immunity under the fsia.
under california law,a n order denying a motion or dismissing a proceeding for procedural reasons such as lack of jurisdiction is not res judicata as to the merits of any underlying substantive question.kalai gray,th,d emphasis added quoting gorman gorman,d.however,and determinative here,such dismissal does bar of issues necessary for the determination of jurisdiction.mib,d.quoting nichols canoga,d.as the california supreme court explained,when the decision on the jurisdictional question is based upon a determination of the merits of an issue before the court,it constitutes a binding determination of that issue.shore shore,cal d.
here,the california state court concluded it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because thai airways is owned by the ministry of finance of the kingdom of thailand and is therefore immune from suit in courts in the united states under the fsia.see b including as a foreign state any entity a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof.the state court further concluded gupta had not alleged any of the exceptions to the fsia applied to thai airways.these findings were necessary to the determination of jurisdiction and therefore have a preclusive effect under shore,cal d at,and mib,d at.
under california law,it makes no difference that gupta now contends the warsaw convention provides the court jurisdiction.the california appellate court in mib faced a similar situation where in the fourth action attempting to establish jurisdiction over an defendant,the plaintiffs introduced new evidence and pleaded new causes of action.d at.the court held that evidence which was not introduced in the earlier proceedings does not overcome the preclusive effect of the prior decisions.id.at.even if wrong,an earlier decision involving the same issue and the same parties,is as conclusive as a correct one.id.gupta had a full and fair opportunity to establish the jurisdiction of united states courts over thai airways.he failed to do so.he does not now get a 
accordingly,we reverse and remand with instructions to the district court to vacate its order and dismiss gupta suit for lack of jurisdiction 
reversed and remanded.
the majority finds appellate jurisdiction in this case only by mistakenly assuming that if any issue decided by the district court is subject to interlocutory appeal,any other issue decided in the same order can also be reached on interlocutory appeal.because i disagree and would dismiss this interlocutory appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction over the limited issues raised and not reach the merits,i respectfully dissent.
under the collateral order doctrine,this court would have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal from that portion of the district court order denying thai airways claim to sovereign immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia.but this rule does not confer jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal from other parts of the same order.
thai airways was very specific of the issues it raised on this appeal.it raised only two issues.to quote fully the issues presented for review section of thai airways opening brief 
whether the district court erred in denying thai airways motion to dismiss after the state superior court determined,in an identical prior action,that thai airways was immune from suit on gupta claim in the united states under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia.saudi arabia nelson,d.
whether gupta subsequent identical action against thai airways in federal court was a de facto appeal of the prior state court determination and thus barred under the doctrine.
in support of its first issue,thai airways argued that the district court erred in denying its motion to dismiss because the prior ruling by the state superior court was res judicata.in support of its second issue,thai airways argued that under the doctrine gupta action in the district court was a de facto appeal of the state court dismissal of his earlier action.thai airways raised no argument in its briefs that it was immune from suit as a foreign state under the fsia.yet,because thai airways is taking an interlocutory appeal from an order denying thai airways immunity under the fsia,op.at emphasis added,the majority concludes,without analysis and erroneously in my view,that we have jurisdiction to review that portion of the district court order denying dismissal on the basis of res judicata.
the collateral order doctrine is intended to allow immediate appeal only of that small class of decisions which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.cohen beneficial indus.loan.the requirements for collateral order appeal have been distilled down to three conditions that an order conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.will hallock,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
while it is true that our case law permits an immediate interlocutory appeal from an order denying a motion to dismiss based on foreign sovereign immunity,compania mexicana de aviacion,dist.court,cir per curiam,it is equally that the denial of a motion to dismiss based on res judicata grounds is not immediately appealable.see will.at the rule of respecting a prior judgment by giving a defense against relitigation has not been thought to protect values so great that only immediate appeal can effectively vindicate them.to repeat,in this case,while it is true that the order thai airways appeals from rejected its claim of sovereign immunity,thai airways only arguments on appeal are directed to the other bases of the order,those resting on res judicata and the doctrine 
although the cases discussing the collateral order doctrine sometimes loosely refer to interlocutory orders as being appealable,in fact,the cases actually analyze the specific claim or issue presented in determining the scope of their jurisdiction on an interlocutory appeal.and each claim presented must independently meet the requirements of the collateral order doctrine in order for it to be considered on interlocutory appeal.appellate jurisdiction over one claim rejected in a district court order does not confer jurisdiction over all other claims rejected in the same order.abney united states,d see also united states yellow freight,cir inquiry into the immediate appealability of a particular pretrial order must focus upon each claim asserted.
in abney,after ruling that a denial of a criminal defendant motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is an immediately appealable collateral order,the supreme court noted that we,of course,do not hold that other claims contained in the motion to dismiss are immediately appealable as well.at.the court held that other claims presented to,and rejected by,the district court in passing on the accused motion to dismiss are appealable if,and only if,they too fall within cohen exception to the rule.id.at.the court thus held that the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to review the district court denial of the motion to dismiss based on insufficiency of the indictment.id 
the principle that appellate courts must examine each claim or issue presented separately to determine their jurisdiction on interlocutory appeal is also reflected in the requirements that an order must meet to be immediately appealable.those requirements are phrased in terms of a disputed question in the that it is not the breadth of the order that defines the scope of appellate jurisdiction on an interlocutory appeal.rather,each particular appealable issue that is resolved by the order must be examined separately.see will.at noting that an order must conclusively determine the disputed question and resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits to be immediately appealable emphasis added.
hence,the issue here is whether separate are raised by thai airways arguments to the district court of a substantive entitlement to foreign sovereign immunity,and issue preclusion as to its entitlement to foreign sovereign immunity.here,under simple logic,applying abney,if the two arguments constitute separate claims,then this court does not have jurisdiction over an appeal taken solely from the portion of the district court order rejecting thai airways issue preclusion argument.the fact that the ruling on one argument is interlocutorily appealable does not mean that the other is as well 
there may be instances where it is not entirely clear whether the two arguments can be considered separate defenses an immunity defense and an issue preclusion defense,however,are clearly unrelated,separate defenses.see,timpanogos tribe conway,cir refusing to exercise pendent jurisdiction over a res judicata claim in an interlocutory appeal of the denial of a motion to dismiss on eleventh amendment grounds,because there was no showing that the res judicata claim was inextricably intertwined with the eleventh amendment claim 
here,the rationale for applying the cohen collateral order doctrine to appeals from denials of foreign sovereign immunity does not encompass instances where the appeal is taken and supported solely on the grounds of issue preclusion.the supreme court has pointedly remarked that the third cohen question,whether a right is adequately vindicable or effectively reviewable on appeal from a final judgment,simply can not be answered without a judgment about the value of the interests that would be lost through rigorous application of a final judgment requirement.digital equip.desktop direct,d.
in explaining why pretrial rulings based on res judicata grounds do not merit immediate appeal,courts have emphasized that the res judicata doctrine is not meant to give a defendant an absolute right to avoid trial.see,in re corrugated container antitrust,cir t he only injury from denial of immediate review is that the defendant will have to present its defense at trial,but that sort of injury follows in every denial of a motion to dismiss a complaint and does not justify an exception to the rule.see also donnelley sons ftc,cir preclusion in a civil case creates a right not to be tried only in the sense that it creates a right to win but many legal doctrines do that without also creating a right to interlocutory appellate review.
here,in relying only on issue preclusion arguments,thai airways is not arguing that the substantive purposes of the fsia would be served by granting it sovereign immunity.those admittedly weighty interests are not the interests at stake in this appeal.rather,thai airways is only arguing that respect for another court judgment entitles it to dismissal.the interests at stake in the claim being asserted are simply those ordinarily protected by the doctrine of res judicata.any interest that thai airways may legitimately possess in avoiding suit under the fsia is not truly implicated in this appeal,because thai airways is not arguing the merits of its claim to fsia immunity.thus,in reaching the merits of this interlocutory appeal,the majority frustrates the substantial finality interests is meant to further,will.at,and expands the intended modest scope of the collateral order doctrine,id.at.
had thai airways chosen to appeal the district court ruling as to its entitlement to foreign sovereign immunity under the fsia,we might have exercised jurisdiction over that appeal.however,nowhere in its opening or reply brief did thai airways make this argument.in fact,thai airways affirmatively declared that the merits of its fsia defense are not within the scope of its appeal,arguing in its reply brief that the applicability of the warsaw convention is not an issue on this appeal.by electing not to argue its entitlement to fsia immunity on the merits,thai airways has waived the issue for purposes of this appeal.united states kama,cir.thai airways issue preclusion defense is an insufficient ground upon which to base our appellate jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.
because i would dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction,i respectfully dissent.
in california the typical method for raising lack of subject matter jurisdiction is by means of a demurrer.california code of civil procedure ccp a when any ground for objection to a complaint appears on the face thereof the objection on that ground may be taken by a demurrer to the pleading.motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,however,have been recognized in california case law.see,goodwine superior court,cal d,in re guardianship of donaldson,d.these motions have been described as a substitute for general demurrer.witkin,california procedure,pleading,ed.the fact that a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was used in this case rather than a general demurrer does not affect the analysis here because a general demurrer alleging the same facts would have been sustained given thai airways immunity under the fsia,and gupta failure to plead an exception to the fsia.see id.explaining that any procedural error in eliminating the complaint by motion rather than demurrer is not prejudicial or reversible if a general demurrer could have been properly sustained without leave to amend.
united states courts,both federal and state,possess subject matter and personal jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign only when an exception to the fsia applies.compania mexicana de aviacion,dist,cir per curiam.the california court of appeal has explained that the fsia is the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in california state court.bolkiah super,th,d.thus,although gupta complaint alleged tortious action by thai subject matter over which the superior court normally would have superior court jurisdiction over thai airways depended on the applicability of an exception to the airways is owned by the ministry of finance of the kingdom of thailand.under federal law,an entity whose controlling shares or majority interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision is itself a foreign state.b.the fsia provides that a foreign state is immune from suit in state and federal court unless an exception to the fsia applies.id.gupta has never contended thai airways is not a foreign state.
the superior court order is final because gupta neither amended the complaint nor appealed the dismissal within the time allowed for such actions.an action is deemed to be pending from the time of its commencement until its final determination upon appeal,or until the time for appeal has passed emphasis added.pursuant to the california rules of court,gupta had days to file a notice of appeal.cal.rules of court a.thus,when the days passed without a notice of appeal,the superior court order became final on december.
gupta argued articles and of the warsaw convention brought thai airways within the jurisdiction of united states courts despite the fsia.article provides for carrier liability when physical injury occurs on board the aircraft or in the course of embarking or disembarking the aircraft.article provides for carrier liability for damage ca
