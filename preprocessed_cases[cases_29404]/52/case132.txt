background 
bout has long been regarded by the united states government as a dangerous and powerful international arms trafficker,and his illicit arms pipeline has repeatedly been designated for sanctions by united states and united nations authorities.the drug enforcement administration dea initiated an international sting operation against bout in late with the assistance of three confidential sources css.two of the css posed as representatives of the fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de colombia the farc,a colombian entity and longtime revolutionary organization seeking the violent overthrow of the colombian government.the farc,which has been designated by the united states government as a foreign terrorist organization,is also one of the world largest cocaine suppliers and has directed violent acts toward american personnel and property.
on january and,the three css met with andrew smulian,a former colleague of bout,on the island of curaçao,in the caribbean,to discuss the possibility of a weapons transaction supposedly in order to aid the farc in its fight against the colombian government and the united states.following the meetings in curaçao,smulian visited bout in moscow,where they discussed the weapons order in greater detail.bout then directed smulian to meet the css to continue discussions,which later occurred over a period of two weeks in romania.smulian,on behalf of bout told the css that sam missiles were available immediately,and that bout could provide additional equipment and advice if needed.
on march,bout met with smulian and the three css about the weapons deal at a hotel in bangkok,thailand.during recorded conversations,bout repeatedly supported the farc intention to use his weapons to kill american pilots stationed in colombia on march,thai authorities arrested both bout and smulian in bangkok.less than a month later,while bout was still in thailand,a grand jury sitting in the southern district of new york returned an indictment against him.in august,a lower court in thailand denied bout extradition to the united states,but that decision was reversed by an appellate court in august.
bout was extradited to the united states on november,and his trial began on october.after a trial,the jury found bout guilty on all four counts of the indictment,and on april,judge scheindlin sentenced him to concurrent terms of months imprisonment on counts one,two,and four and months imprisonment on count three.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,bout raises a number of claims,including that the government conduct constituted an outrageous or vindictive prosecution in violation of his constitutional right to due process of law,and that therefore the district court should have granted his motion to dismiss the indictment his extradition was illegal because it was the impermissible consequence of intense,coercive political pressure exerted by the united states his prosecution violated the doctrine of specialty and the indictment returned against him insufficiently stated the offenses listed in counts one and two in analyzing the denial of bout motion to dismiss the indictment,we review the district court conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see united states daley,cir.we consider each of bout claims in turn.
bout argues that t he egregious government action here is sui generis,taking the concepts of entrapment,vindictive prosecution and selective prosecution to a cumulative higher order and can only be described as outrageous.appellant br.a n indictment will be dismissed if there is a finding of actual vindictiveness,or if there is a presumption of vindictiveness that has not been rebutted by objective evidence justifying the prosecutor action.united states johnson,cir.to demonstrate an actual vindictive motive the defendant must show that the prosecutor harbored genuine animus toward the defendant,or was prevailed upon to bring the charges by another with animus such that the prosecutor could be considered a stalking horse,and the defendant would not have been prosecuted except for the animus.united states sanders,cir internal quotation marks and alteration omitted emphasis supplied.
the supreme court has also recognized the possibility that outrageous government conduct could bar a criminal conviction.see hampton united states,d.to prevail on such a claim,however,a defendant must show that the government conduct is so outrageous that common notions of fairness and decency would be offended were judicial processes invoked to obtain a conviction.united states schmidt,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,the government conduct must shock the conscience in the sense contemplated by the supreme court in rochin california.forced stomach pumping.united states cromitie,l,wl,at cir.as we have explained 
generally,to be outrageous,the government involvement in a crime must involve either coercion or a violation of the defendant person.it does not suffice to show that the government created the opportunity for the offense,even if the government ploy is elaborate and the engagement with the defendant is extensive.likewise,feigned friendship,cash inducement,and coaching in how to commit the crime do not constitute outrageous conduct.
united states al kassar,cir citations omitted.indeed,as with all sting operations,government creation of the opportunity to commit an offense,even to the point of supplying defendants with materials essential to commit crimes,does not exceed due process limits.cromitie,wl,at see also schmidt,at holding that elaborate and extensive government sting operation in which a law enforcement agent posed as a hit man and federal agents actually conducted a controlled prison breakout did not constitute outrageous government conduct united states ming he,cir noting that a federal court supervisory power over dea conduct in a sting operation is extremely limited internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
having reviewed the record in light of these principles,we conclude that bout allegations do not meet the high threshold necessary to prevail on a vindictive prosecution claim.bout refers to media reports stating that former deputy national security advisor juan zarate and other officials at the drug enforcement agency dea had him in their.appellant br.even if true,these allegations do not constitute the type of animus that is relevant within the meaning of our cases on vindictive prosecution.the animus that is prohibited typically occurs in situations where a prosecutor charging decision is a direct and unjustifiable penalty that resulted solely from the defendant exercise of a protected legal right.united states stewart,cir alteration omitted.in this case,however
