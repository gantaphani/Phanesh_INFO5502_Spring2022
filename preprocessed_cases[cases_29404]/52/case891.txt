the islamic american relief agency,based in columbia,missouri,challenges the district court decision upholding the blocking of its assets.the government concluded that the organization was a branch office of a specially designated global terrorist and invoked its authority under laws to block assets.in this appeal,contends that the district court erroneously held that the record supports the government conclusion,and that it erroneously dismissed and entered summary judgment for defendants on claims under the administrative procedure act and the constitution.also argues that it should have been permitted to amend its complaint to request access to its blocked funds for payment of attorneys fees.because we conclude that the designation was supported by the record and was not contrary to law,we affirm the district court disposition of the case,but on the question of attorneys fees we remand for further proceedings.
in,a sudanese immigrant founded as the islamic african relief agency.since then,the entity has engaged in humanitarian activities around the world,often in partnership with similar organizations.in,changed its name from the islamic african relief agency to the islamic american relief agency emphasis added.meanwhile,the entity in sudan calling itself the islamic african relief agency iara continued to exist under that name.
on october,the office of foreign assets control in the department of the treasury ofac designated iara as a specially designated global terrorist sdgt.the designation was based on ofac conclusion that iara provides financial support or other services to persons who commit,threaten to commit or support terrorism in violation of laws.although was not independently designated,ofac considered it to be the united states branch of iara and included it in the blocking notice.this meant that none of financial assets or property could be transferred,withdrawn,exported,paid,or otherwise dealt in without prior authorization from ofac.could not receive any contribution of funds,goods,or services,nor could it continue to use its offices or remove any items of corporate property.any violation of the blocking notice could subject to criminal and civil penalties.
immediately contested the blocking,maintaining that it is a separate entity from iara.it requested that ofac review the designation and permit to access its blocked funds for the limited purpose of paying attorneys fees.in late december,having failed to persuade ofac to unblock its assets,filed a complaint in district court,naming as defendants the attorney general,the secretary of the treasury,and other unidentified fbi agents and treasury personnel relevant to this appeal,it claimed that the blocking is unsupported by the record and thus violates the apa and the international emergency economic powers act,the blocking violates constitutional rights of equal protection,free exercise of religion,and free association and should be permitted to pay attorneys fees from the blocked funds.in a memorandum opinion and order issued on september,the district court dismissed or entered summary judgment in favor of defendant on all claims.islamic am.relief agency unidentified fbi agents,d.the district court held that the record supported ofac conclusion that was a branch of iara,and that the blocking was proper under applicable laws and the constitution.it also denied the motion to access blocked funds for attorneys fees.
in this appeal,argues that the district court erred in rejecting the three arguments described above,and that it erred in failing to ensure that the government complied with an internal regulation requiring it to declassify record evidence and in denying discovery before entering summary judgment.does not challenge the district court ruling on its other claims.
we note at the outset that the designated entity,iara,is not a party to this case,and does not challenge the evidentiary basis for the designation of its alleged parent.rather,the question here is whether the record supports ofac conclusion that is a branch of iara.if so,as conceded at oral argument,ofac blocking of its assets was a proper consequence of the designation.

our review of an sdgt designation falls under the apa,and thus its highly deferential standard of review applies.see holy land found.for relief dev.ashcroft.under that standard,we will set aside ofac action only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.we may not substitute our judgment for ofac,but we will require it to examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the,state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation marks omitted see also cellular telecomms.internet ass fcc.thus,with respect to the apa claims,if ofac actions were not arbitrary and capricious and were based on substantial evidence,we must affirm the district court decision.a holy land,at.
this case is the first in this court challenging an sdgt designation based on a branch relationship with an entity that supports terrorists.our prior cases involved entities that directly supported terrorists.suggests that because of this factual difference,we should review the blocking as we would review an alias designation in a foreign terrorist organization fto case.in those cases,we require evidence that the designated entity so dominates and controls the alleged alias entity that they can be considered one and the same.council of resistance of iran dep t of state,ncri.on theory,then,blocking its assets based on the designation of iara was proper only if iara dominates and controls.the government disagrees,arguing that the alias test is not applicable here because this blocking was not based on an alias theory.it urges instead that the blocking may stand if there is sufficient evidence that and iara are the same organization,even in the absence of evidence that one controls the other.
we conclude that the government has the better argument.to determine whether the evidence is sufficient,we must employ a test that reflects the theory on which the assets were blocked.the dominates and controls test is appropriate for reviewing the existence of a relationship because,where there is sufficient evidence to find an agency relationship,substantial evidence of the principal unlawful activity is sufficient to justify the designation or blocking of the agent.see ncri,at concluding that the dominates and controls test is an appropriate basis for upholding an alias designation,because of the ordinary principle of agency law that where a corporate entity is so extensively controlled by its owner that a relationship of principal and agent is created one may be held liable for the actions of the other internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in this case,however,ofac theory was that and iara,along with other branch offices,comprised a single global organization.the government argues that their relationship,therefore,is more accurately described as one between different offices of the same entity.it follows that,if the record contains substantial evidence that is a branch of iara,then it was proper for ofac to subject to the blocking as a result of iara designation.
the district court applied the proper standard.it entered summary judgment on the apa claims,concluding that the record contained substantial evidence to support ofac conclusion that is related and connected to the iara,and accordingly that the designation was not arbitrary and capricious,d at.as did the district court,we shall limit our review of the designation to the administrative record.holy land,at.
with this framework in mind,we turn to the unclassified record.while the record contains a great number of documents,we discuss here only a sampling of the most pertinent.was founded by an immigrant from sudan,the site of iara offices,and was incorporated with a name identical to iara from its founding until,when made the minor change of replacing african in its name with american.articles of incorporation describe it as islamic african relief agency united states affiliate and include the purpose of effect ing the objectives and means of the islamic african relief agency as set forth in its constitution.in the event of dissolution,the articles of incorporation provided that iara,among other entities,should receive its assets.
since its founding,has continued to engage in conduct that evinces a branch relationship with iara.in,for example,applied to the treasury department for a license to transfer funds to islamic african relief agency,sudan,in which it described itself as the islamic african relief agency,united states affiliate.it described the islamic african relief agency,sudan as its partner in sudan.in a letter to the washington times on october,executive director identified himself as speaking on behalf of iara and its partners,implicitly accepted the newspaper characterization of iara as the islamic relief agency,and acknowledged iara branch offices in the united states and other countries.solicitation materials used by stated that its international headquarters are in khartoum,sudan.additionally,maintained financial connections with at least one other iara branch and its address was listed on iara websites as a united states branch office.
denies that this evidence reveals a branch relationship.the initial identity and current similarity in the entities names,it claims,is purely coincidental the founder of,though aware of iara existence,chose the name because it was descriptive of the organization mission.although offers no explanation for the references to iara in its articles of incorporation,it nonetheless categorically denies that the organization was founded as a branch.
arguments fail in the face of clear and substantial evidence in the record.the evidence supports the conclusion that,at its founding,considered itself a branch of iara.an entity genesis and history may properly be considered by ofac in making the designation or blocking,at least where the ties have not been severed.holy land,at.although it is true that subsequently amended its name,there is no indication that it severed the relationship,particularly in light of the more recent evidence discussed above.indeed,since itself does not concede that it was ever a branch of iara,it can not argue that the name change effected a severance of the relationship.rather,would have us believe that the amended name,as the initial name,was chosen simply because it was descriptive,without any intention of aligning with iara.we need not pass on the credibility of this explanation,however,because we hold that the other evidence in the record is sufficient to support ofac interpretation of the evidence.
we acknowledge that the unclassified record evidence is not overwhelming,but we reiterate that our an area at the intersection of national security,foreign policy,and administrative extremely deferential.holy land,at noting the unique nature of reviewing an sdgt designation as involving sensitive issues of national security and foreign policy humanitarian law project reno,cir noting that,where a regulation involves the conduct of foreign affairs,we owe the executive branch even more latitude than in the domestic context and stating that the high degree of judicial deference to the decision to designate an entity as an fto is a necessary concomitant of the foreign affairs power.under that standard,the various types of evidence from several different sources,and covering an extended period of substantial evidence for the conclusion that is part of iara.furthermore,although we deem it unnecessary to sustain ofac actions,the classified record contains extensive evidence that is a branch of iara.
ofac conduct was also lawful under the relevant statute and executive orders.in the wake of the attacks of september,the president invoked the authority of the international emergency economic powers act,ieepa by declaring a national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to national security posed by terrorists.blocking property and prohibiting transactions with persons who commit,threaten to commit,or support terrorism,exec.order,as amended by exec.orders.july,and.in that order,the president described the types of conduct that could subject an entity to blocking of its assets,such as providing financial support to terrorists.he named a number of entities whose assets would be blocked immediately,and authorized the treasury department to designate additional entities that it determines are within the purview of the order.exec.order.at.
argues that ofac can not block an entity assets unless it determines that the entity itself poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security.the district court rejected this argument,holding that the threat need not be found with regard to each individual entity,d at.we agree with the district court.the president may exercise his authority under the ieepa to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat,which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the united states,to the national security,foreign policy,or economy of the united states,if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.a.thus,once the president has declared a national emergency,the ieepa authorizes the blocking of property to protect against that threat.id.a b.it is that authority ofac invoked when it blocked assets.we hold that the district court correctly dismissed this claim because could prove no set of facts that would entitle it to relief.
we turn next to claims that the blocking violated its rights under the constitution.as an initial matter,we note that constitutional claims rest on a misinterpretation of ofac basis for the designation.argues that the blocking was unconstitutional because the government has not shown that is controlled or dominated by iara.but as explained above,ofac basis for the blocking was that functions as a branch of iara.thus,the dominates and controls test is not relevant to whether the blocking was constitutional.and since we have concluded that there was substantial evidence that was a branch of iara,these constitutional claims lose their footing.as we have noted previously,there is no first amendment right nor any other constitutional right to support terrorists.holy land,at see also humanitarian law project,at t here is no constitutional right to facilitate terrorism with materials or funding.
our analysis of constitutional arguments is informed by our recent decision in holy land,at.in that case,holy land foundation hlf challenged its designation as an sdgt under the first,fourth,and fifth amendments.id.the district court rejected hlf first and fifth amendment claims,and we affirmed,on the basis that the law is established that there is no constitutional right to fund terrorism.id.at.thus,where an organization is found to have supported terrorism,government actions to suspend that support are not unconstitutional.id.noting that hlf could not have produced evidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the designation and the blocking of assets violat
