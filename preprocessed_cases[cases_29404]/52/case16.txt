while visiting the west bank,azzam rahim,a naturalized united states citizen,allegedly was arrested by palestinian authority intelligence officers,imprisoned,tortured,and ultimately killed.rahim relatives,petitioners here,sued the palestinian authority and the palestinian liberation organization under the torture victim protection act of tvpa,which authorizes a cause of action against a n individual for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing committed under authority or color of law of any foreign nation.stat,note following.the district court dismissed the suit,concluding,as relevant here,that the tvpa authorization of suit against a n individual extended liability only to natural persons.the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit affirmed.
held as used in the tvpa,the term individual encompasses only natural persons.consequently,the act does not impose liability against organizations.
a the ordinary,everyday meaning of individual refers to a human being,not an organization,and congress in the normal course does not employ the word any differently.the dictionary act defines person to include certain artificial entities as well as individuals,thereby marking individual as distinct from artificial entities.federal statutes routinely distinguish between an individual and an organizational entity.see,k.and the very congress that passed the tvpa defined person in a separate act to include any individual or entity.
b before a word will be assumed to have a meaning broader than or different from its ordinary meaning,congress must give some indication that it intended such a result.there are no such indications in the tvpa.to the contrary,the statutory context confirms that congress in the act created a cause of action against natural persons alone.the act liability provision uses the word individual five times in the same sentence once to refer to the perpetrator and four times to refer to the victim.see tvpa a.since only a natural person can be a victim of torture or extrajudicial killing,it is difficult to conclude that congress used individual four times in the same sentence to refer to a natural person and once to refer to a natural person and any nonsovereign organization.in addition,the tvpa holds perpetrators liable for extrajudicial killing to any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.see tvpa a.persons often has a broader meaning in the law than individual,and frequently includes persons.construing individual in the act to encompass solely natural persons credits congress use of disparate terms.
c petitioners counterarguments are unpersuasive.
petitioners dispute that the plain text of the tvpa requires this court result.first,they rely on definitions that frame individual in nonhuman terms,emphasizing the idea of oneness,but these definitions make for an awkward fit in the context of the tvpa.next they claim that federal tort statutes uniformly provide for liability against organizations,a convention they maintain is common to the legal systems of other nations.but while congress is understood to legislate against a background of adjudicatory principles,astoria fed.sav.loan solimino,congress plainly evinced its intent in the tvpa not to subject organizations to liability.petitioners next argue that the tvpa scope of liability should be construed to conform with other federal statutes they claim provide civil remedies to victims of torture or extrajudicial killing.but none of the statutes petitioners cite employs the term individual,as the tvpa,to describe the covered defendant.finally,although petitioners rightly note that the tvpa contemplates liability against officers who do not personally execute the torture or extrajudicial killing,it does not follow that the act embraces liability against nonsovereign organizations.
petitioners also contend that legislative history supports their broad reading of individual,but reliance on legislative history is unnecessary in light of the statute unambiguous language.milavetz,gallop milavetz,united states.in any event,the history supports this court interpretation.
finally,petitioners argue that precluding organizational liability may foreclose effective remedies for victims and their relatives.this purposive argument simply can not overcome the force of the plain text.moreover,congress appeared well aware of the limited nature of the cause of action it established in the tvpa.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
the torture victim protection act of tvpa or act,stat,note following,authorizes a cause of action against a n individual for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing committed under authority or color of law of any foreign nation.we hold that the term individual as used in the act encompasses only natural persons.consequently,the act does not impose liability against organizations.
because this case arises from a motion to dismiss,we as true the allegations of the complaint.ashcroft,slip,at.petitioners are the relatives of azzam rahim,who immigrated to the united states in the and became a naturalized citizen.in,while on a visit to the west bank,rahim was arrested by palestinian authority intelligence officers.he was taken to a prison in jericho,where he was imprisoned,tortured,and ultimately killed.the following year,the department of state issued a report concluding that rahim died in the custody of palestinian authority intelligence officers in jericho.of state,occupied territories human rights practices.
in,petitioners filed this action against respondents,the palestinian authority and the palestinian liberation organization,asserting,inter alia,claims of torture and extrajudicial killing under the tvpa.the district court granted respondents motion to dismiss,concluding,as relevant,that the act authorization of suit against a n individual extended liability only to natural persons.mohamad rajoub,supp,dc.the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit affirmed on the same ground.see mohamad rajoub,congress used the word individual to denote only natural persons we granted certiorari,to resolve a split among the circuits with respect to whether the tvpa authorizes actions against defendants that are not natural persons and now affirm.
the tvpa imposes liability on individuals for certain acts of torture and extrajudicial killing.the act provides 
an individual who,under actual or apparent,or color of law,of any foreign nation 
subjects an individual to torture shall,in a civil action,be liable for damages to that individual or 
subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing shall,in a civil action,be liable for damages to the individual legal representative,or to any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.a.
the act defines torture and extrajudicial killing,and imposes a statute of limitations and an exhaustion requirement,b,c.it does not define individual.
petitioners concede that foreign states may not be sued under the act namely,that the act does not create an exception to the foreign sovereign immunities act of,et,which renders foreign sovereigns largely immune from suits in courts.they argue,however,that the tvpa does not similarly restrict liability against other juridical entities.in petitioners view,by permitting suit against a n individual,the tvpa contemplates liability against natural
