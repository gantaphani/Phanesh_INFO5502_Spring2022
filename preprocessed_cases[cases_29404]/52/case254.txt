this case presents an unusual question whether plaintiffs,german social insurers gsis may bring based negligence and wrongful death claims arising out of the terrorist attacks of september,under authority of german law despite the personal representatives receipt of funds from the victim compensation fund vcf or the fund.the district court answered that question in the negative,and we affirm.
on,six individuals insured by the adams,klaus bothe,sebastian gorki,kimmig,wolfgang peter menzel,and klaus johannes their lives as a result of the terrorist attacks.some were passengers on the hijacked airplanes.others were present at the world trade center wtc.all but one of the decedents were killed at or near the wtc in new york.adams died in pennsylvania the personal representatives of each decedent submitted a claim to the vcf and received compensation from the fund.the gsis paid insurance benefits to the decedents beneficiaries.
subsequently,the gsis brought suit against defendants for wrongful death and negligence for the amounts paid by the gsis to decedents beneficiaries.the gsis premise their right to sue upon a provision of german law that they assert automatically transfers the claims of the the the relevant gsi upon the insured injury a claim for compensation for a loss is transferred to the social insurance carrier to the extent that the social insurance carrier has to pay social benefits as a result of the occurrence of loss.sozialgesetzbuch german social insurance code,part x,anspr√ºche gegen schadenersatzpflichtige,hereinafter sgb x.the gsis expressly disclaim that the putative right to bring this action is based upon subrogation.
given the automatic transfer,the gsis claim that the waiver of the right to bring any civil action arising out of the attacks by the decedents personal necessary precursor to the receipt of funds from the not have affected their rights to bring this action,as the personal representatives essentially had nothing to waive.alternatively,the gsis claim that,insofar as vcf claimants may recover collateral obligations,collateral source providers should be able to maintain actions against tortfeasors for amounts paid.in relevant part,defendants assert that,even if any claims were transferred to the gsis,the claims fail because the gsis can not maintain the negligence or wrongful death actions under new york or pennsylvania law.
the air transportation safety and system stabilization act,pub,stat,as amended by the aviation and transportation security act,pub,stat,together,the stabilization act,provides the starting point for our analysis.see generally virgilio city of new york,cir discussing statutory framework.title iv of the stabilization act establishes the vcf and the rules governing claims related to the attacks.relevant here,section b creates an exclusive federal cause of action for damages arising out of the hijacking s and dictates that t he substantive law for decision in any such action shall be derived from the law,including choice of law principles,of the state in which the crash occurred unless such law is inconsistent with or preempted by federal law.stat.at.thus,new york and pennsylvania law provide the rules to be applied.
because there were two places of injury,we apply the rules of each of those states.new york and pennsylvania tests require application of the wrongful death and survival statutes of those states.new york analysis for depends upon whether the competing legal rules relate to conduct regulation or loss allocation.given that wrongful death and survival actions relate to loss allocation,see schultz boy scouts of america,and that the parties are domiciled in a number of different states,the presumption is that new york rules apply,see neumeier kuehner,the gsis have not persuaded us otherwise.
pennsylvania analysis for torts incorporates analysis and the significant relationship theory.see cipolla shaposka,leonard reed,see also restatement second of conflict of laws.in applying that qualitative test,we look to the following 
the place where the injury occurred the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred the domicile,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties and the place where the relationship between the parties is centered.
leonard.at.the third and fourth factors are not particularly useful in this case.defendants have several different principal places of business,and plaintiffs conduct their business predominantly in germany and the european union.we doubt there is a place where the relationship between the parties is centered.the second factor implicates new jersey because the alleged omissions and errors giving rise to the insurer indirect injury would likely have taken place at newark airport,the place of departure for decedent adams plane.but none of the parties has suggested that new jersey law applies finally,the first factor favors application of pennsylvania law because adams injury obviously occurred in pennsylvania.
despite the interest that the gsis have in compensating beneficiaries and,to a lesser extent,in reimbursement for that compensation,the additional consideration of consistency leads to the application of pennsylvania law.everyone aboard united airlines flight perished.although the victims beneficiaries have received compensation from the vcf,the gsis press their claims.given the possible combinations of potential litigation flowing from that crash,it makes sense to apply one set of law to the claims involved.accordingly,deference to uniformity weighs in favor of pennsylvania law as opposed to german law.see restatement second of conflict of laws.
turning to the wrongful death claims,we find that the gsis have no recourse against defendants.even if new york or pennsylvania courts would recognize a transfer of claim from the decedents to the gsis pursuant to german law,the decedents had no wrongful death claim to transfer.at common law,a beneficiary had no right of action against tortfeasors for the pecuniary loss caused by the death of the decedent.see,hernandez new york city health hosps,hodge loveland.nonetheless,new york and pennsylvania both provide certain individuals with the right to recover for pecuniary loss caused by the wrongful acts of third parties.see.powers trusts law.civ.a b.cons.stat.b.these statutes,and case law interpreting them,provide that the cause of action is prosecuted by the estate personal representative for the benefit of legislatively designated individuals in new york,only who would share in the estate if the decedent had died a right to the proceeds from a wrongful death action,see,hernandez,at,in pennsylvania,only the spouse,children,and parents of the deceased have an interest in the action,see,kiser schulte.decedents had no interest in a wrongful death claim.wrongful death actions are for the benefit of those who would have enjoyed the care and support of the decedent but for the decedent untimely and unfortunate death.the gsis had no right to recover wrongful death damages.
similarly,we find that the gsis may not maintain their claim for negligence,which is nothing more than a survival action,given that they are not personal representatives and do not have the putative powers possessed by those carrying letters testamentary to prosecute such actions see.powers trusts law.cons.stat.gee cbs,interpreting pennsylvania law.a personal representative who has received letters of administration of the estate of a decedent is the only party who is authorized to bring a survival action for personal injuries sustained by the decedent on account of his or her death.mingone state,dismissing action without prejudice where no administrator had been duly appointed accord kiser,at a survival action is brought by the administrator of the decedent estate in order to recover the loss to the estate resulting from the tort.notwithstanding plaintiffs assertion of a direct cause of action,their negligence claims are premised upon survival claims they can not assert.accordingly,dismissal of the negligence action was appropriate.
plaintiffs alternative collateral source argument is also without merit.wh
