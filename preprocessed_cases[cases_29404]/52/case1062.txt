air machine com srl,an italian limited company com,and panatta sport srl,an italian limited company panatta,together,petitioners seek to overturn in this writ of mandate proceeding the trial court ruling that they generally appeared and thus forfeited their objection to personal jurisdiction when they jointly served a statutory offer of settlement under code of civil procedure section offer on real parties in interest ponani sukumar and southern california stroke rehabilitation associates together,sukumar while their motions to quash service of summons for lack of jurisdiction were pending.
petitioners contend the trial court erred in treating their offer as a general appearance because their act of serving the offer fell within the purview of section,subdivision e,which they contend clear ly applies to prevent a defendant involuntarily submission to jurisdiction when a defendant moves to quash service of summons and engages in any other action during the pendency of the motion to quash.
as we explain,we conclude section,subdivision e,applies to petitioners service of the offer on sukumar because petitioners filed their motion to quash under subdivision a of section they served their offer on sukumar,and because,as we discuss post,we interpret subdivision e of section broadly to include any act,we conclude petitioners were not deemed to have generally appeared in the action.
we thus grant the petition,vacate the trial court order denying petitioners motions to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction and remand the matter to the trial court with directions to consider anew their motions to quash without regard to whether petitioners waived their jurisdictional challenge by serving sukumar with the offer.
background 
the facts are not in dispute.in april sukumar filed a complaint in the superior court of san diego county against defendants air machine,an italian corporation air machine,on the one hand,and health tech resources,dba impact fitness systems and thomas eggers together,eggers,on the other hand,for breach of contract and various other causes of action.sukumar alleged in his complaint that eggers owned impact fitness systems and acted as the united states sales agent of air machine,which sukumar alleged manufactured exercise equipment for sale in the united states,including in california.
sukumar further alleged that he entered into a contract with defendants to purchase multiple pieces of air machine equipment that he intended to use in a rehabilitation center he planned to open and operate.however,when the exercise equipment arrived,sukumar alleged it had multiple defects that eggers did not remedy,despite his promises otherwise.
in july sukumar served petitioner com who claimed it had been erroneously sued as air machine under the hague convention.com and sukumar subsequently stipulated to allow sukumar to conduct expedited jurisdictional discovery in the event com moved to quash service of summons based on lack of jurisdiction.com filed its motion to quash in.however,before that motion could be heard,sukumar filed a first amended complaint,added panatta as a defendant and separately named com and air machine as defendants.sukumar served panetta in april under the hague convention.
in petitioners each moved to quash service of summons of the first amended complaint on grounds california lacked personal jurisdiction over them.com and panetta each argued they did not have minimum contacts in california sufficient for the exercise of personal jurisdiction 
shortly after they filed their motions to quash,petitioners served sukumar with their offer.it provides pursuant to code of civil procedure section,defendants com and panatta collectively defendants offer to compromise and pay plaintiff sukumar the total sum of twenty five thousand dollars in full satisfaction of sukumar claims against defendants in this action.this offer is expressly contingent on plaintiffs dismissing,with prejudice,the action against defendants.plaintiffs shall indicate their acceptance by signing and dating below within thirty days after this offer is made,or it will be deemed withdrawn.this offer is subject to all provisions of code of civil procedure section,and shall be deemed to have been made on may.
the offer was signed by counsel of com and panatta,and below counsel signature there were signature lines for sukumar and his company to accept the offer.sukumar obviously did not sign the offer.
sukumar opposed the quash motions,arguing that com and panatta were subject to personal jurisdiction in california based on their contacts those of air machine,a related company,and that,in any event,they waived jurisdiction when they served their offer on him.
during argument on their quash motions,the trial court noted that one of the significant purposes of a is to take advantage of the laws of the state of california which will get you significant sums of money by way of costs,expert costs,other costs in the event that your offer is not accepted and plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award.in the court view,the offer amounted to petitioners availing themselves of the laws of the state of california to get a significant benefit at the end of this trial.
counsel for com and panatta argued the offer should not be considered an appearance because they were not asking the court to do anything,they were not asking for any relief,and the offer itself was written so as to not mention anything about entering judgment.counsel for com and panatta also argued the offer was a backup plan if petitioners were unable to get out of the case on their motions to quash.
the trial court denied the motions to quash of com and panatta,but granted the motion of air machine.as to com and panatta,the court ruled they submitted to the jurisdiction of the court when they served the offer on sukumar in late may.the court therefore did not address whether petitioners had sufficient minimum contacts in california to subject them to the court jurisdiction.
as to air machine,the trial court found sukumar did not proffer sufficient evidence to show the contacts between air machine and the forum state were substantial,continuous and systematic,to establish air machine purposefully availed itself of forum benefits with respect to the matter in controversy the controversy is related to or arises out of defendant contacts with the forum and the exercise of jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice.
com and panatta petitioned this court for a writ of mandate seeking relief from the trial court order.we issued an order to show cause and deemed the briefs on file as the return and reply to the order to show cause.we subsequently asked the parties for additional briefing analyzing the legislative history of subdivision e of section.in particular,we asked whether subdivision e applied only to a defendant who makes a motion under section and simultaneously demurs to,answer or moves to strike a complaint,or whether the legislature intended this subdivision to apply more broadly,applied only to demurrers,answers and motions to strike,or whether the legislature intended it to apply more broadly,and conformed california practice with respect to challenging jurisdiction to the practice under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
discussion 
it has long been the rule in california that a party waives any objection to the court exercise of personal jurisdiction when the party makes a general appearance in the action.roy superior court th,roy see also dial fesbinder th,a general appearance operates as a consent to jurisdiction of the person citation.section reads in part a defendant appears in an action when the defendant answers,demurs,files a notice of motion to strike,files a notice of motion to transfer pursuant to section,moves for reclassification pursuant to section,gives the plaintiff written notice of appearance,or when an attorney gives notice of appearance for the defendant 
the statutory list of acts constituting an appearance under section is not exclusive rather the term may apply to various acts which,under all of the circumstances,are deemed to confer jurisdiction of the person citation.hamilton asbestos cal th,slaybaugh superior court d,a defendant may appear in ways other than those specifically designed in section.thus,whether a party engaged in an act that amounts to an appearance is fact specific.hamilton asbestos,supra,cal th at.
here,we need not decide whether petitioners offer amounted to a general appearance because we conclude subdivision e of section governs in this situation.we turn now to that issue.
section,subdivision e 
subdivision e was added to section in.roy,supra,th at.subdivision e provides a defendant or may make a motion under this section and simultaneously answer,demur,or move to strike the complaint or.italics added.
subdivision e of section provides notwithstanding section,no act by a party who makes a motion under this section,including filing an answer,demurrer,or motion to strike constitutes an appearance,unless the court denies the motion made under this section.if the court denies the motion made under this section,the defendant or is not deemed to have generally appeared until entry of the order denying the motion.italics added.
subdivision e of section states if the motion made under this section is denied and the defendant or petitions for a writ of mandate pursuant to subdivision c,the defendant or is not deemed to have generally appeared until the proceedings on the writ petition have finally concluded.
finally,subdivision e of section provides failure to make a motion under this section at the time of filing a demurrer or motion to strike constitutes a waiver of the issues of lack of personal jurisdiction,inadequacy of process,inadequacy of service of process,inconvenient forum,and delay in prosecution.
no case has interpreted the word act in subdivision e of section or determined the subdivision scope.petitioners,who raised this issue for the first time in their petition for writ of mandate contend the statutory language of subdivision e of section is clear and unambiguous.based on the plain meaning rule,petitioners contend the words no act in this subdivision means literally any action,and thus a defendant may move to quash coupled with any other action without being deemed to have submitted to the court jurisdiction.because petitioners filed their motions to quash before they served sukumar with the offer,they contend their act of serving the offer is not deemed a general appearance within the meaning of subdivision e of section.
we disagree with petitioners contention that subdivision e of section and its subparts are clear and unambiguous on their face.read in isolation,subdivision e of section appears to apply only to the situation when a defendant makes a motion under subdivision a of that statute and simultaneously answer s,demur s,or move s to strike the complaint.italics added.however,petitioners own brief undermines their contention subdivision e is unambiguous,inasmuch as petitioners also contend the legislative history of subdivision e shows that a party will not be deemed to have a made a general appearance if the party files a motion under subdivision a of section before filing an answer,demur or motion to strike,as opposed to filing such a motion simultaneously.judiciary com.analysis of bill.reg.sess,as introduced january,senate bill would provide that a defendant may move to quash service concurrently with a substantive response to the complaint without being penalized for failing to move to quash first,but does not require a concurrent filing.under this bill,a defendant still could opt to challenge jurisdiction with a motion to quash prior to answering,demurring to,or moving to strike the complaint assem.judiciary com.analysis of bill reg.sess,as amended april,same.
we further reject petitioners contention that subdivision e is clear and unambiguous in light of the words no act and including in subdivision e see fernandez california of pesticide regulation th,w e do not view the words of a statute in isolation,but construe them in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,interpreting legislation reasonably and attempting to give effect to the apparent purpose of the statute.indeed,the legislature inclusion of these words suggests there are acts other than filing an answer,demurrer,or motion to strike that when undertaken by a party do not constitute an appearance until an order denying the motion is entered or if a writ is taken,when those proceedings have concluded.
because we conclude the statutory language of subdivision e of section is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we must examine the context in which the language appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes.rothschild tyco internat.us,th.to determine the most reasonable interpretation of a statute,we look to its legislative history and background.goodman lozano cal th,see also granberry islay investments cal th,when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citations.
legislative history 
the legislative history is silent regarding the meaning of the word act in subdivision e of section.subdivision e was introduced in senate bill in january.bill reg.sess.the legislative counsel digest of senate bill states the bill would permit a defendant or to move to quash service of summons and simultaneously answer,demur or move to strike the complaint or.the bill would specify certain circumstances under which a party is not deemed to have made a general appearance for purposes of a court exercising its jurisdiction.the bill would declare the intent of the legislature in enacting its provisions to conform california practice with respect to challenging personal jurisdiction to the practice under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.legis.counsel,bill.reg.sess.
