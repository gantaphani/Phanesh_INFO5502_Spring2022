discussion 
two issues are presented a whether service of process on the sudanese minister of foreign affairs via the sudanese embassy in washington complied with the requirement of a that service be sent to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs,and b whether the district court erred in issuing turnover orders without first obtaining either an ofac license or a doj statement of interest explaining why no ofac license was required.
service of process on the minister of foreign affairs 
the fsia provides the sole means for effecting service of process on a foreign state.see a,at,as reprinted in,section sets forth the exclusive procedures with respect to service on a foreign state.four methods of service are prescribed,in descending order of preference.a.plaintiffs must attempt service by the first method,or determine that it is unavailable,before attempting subsequent methods in the order in which they are laid out.
the first method is service in accordance with any special arrangement for service between the plaintiff and the foreign state or political subdivision.id.a.in the absence of such a special arrangement,the statute next permits service in accordance with an applicable international convention on service of judicial documents.id.a.if neither of these first two methods is available,plaintiffs may proceed according to the third method,which permits service by sending a copy of the summons and complaint and a notice of suit,together with a translation of each into the official language of the foreign state,by any form of mail requiring a signed receipt,to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state concerned.id.a emphasis added.finally,the statute provides that if service can not be made under the first three paragraphs,service is permitted as a last resort by any form of mail requiring a signed receipt,to be addressed and dispatched by the clerk of the court to the secretary of state in washington,district of columbia,to the attention of the director of special consular services and the secretary shall transmit one copy of the papers through diplomatic channels to the foreign state.id.a.
here,it is undisputed that service in conformity with the first two methods was unavailable,because plaintiffs have no special arrangement for service with sudan,and because sudan is not a party to an international convention on service of judicial documents.id.a.thus,a was the preferred method of service,and plaintiffs effectuated service in accordance with this paragraph.in the underlying litigation in the district court,the clerk of court sent process by mail,return receipt requested,to the minister of foreign affairs,deng alor koul,via the embassy of sudan in washington,
as an initial matter,plaintiffs complied with the first three clauses of a.first,service could not be made under paragraphs or of a.second,plaintiffs directed the clerk of court to include in the service package a copy of the summons and complaint,and notice of suit,and the clerk confirmed that a translation of each was included.and third,plaintiffs directed the clerk of court to serve sudan by a form of mail requiring a signed receipt,id.a,and,after the clerk mailed the service package on november,a return receipt was in fact received on november,
on appeal,sudan argues that service on sudan minister of foreign affairs via the sudanese embassy in washington does not comply with the requirement of the final clause of a,that service be sent to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs.sudan contends that service should have been sent to sudan minister of foreign affairs at the ministry of foreign affairs in khartoum,and because service was ineffective under a,the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over sudan.
in answering this issue,one of first impression in our circuit,we look to the statutory language,cases that have interpreted this statute,and the legislative history.see united states allen,cir.
on its face,the statute requires that process be mailed to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of the foreign state.a.it is silent as to a specific location where the mailing is to be addressed.if congress had wanted to require that the mailing be sent to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs in the foreign county,it could have said so.in a,for example,congress specified that the papers be mailed to the secretary of state in washington,district of columbia,to the attention of the director of special consular services,for transmittal to the foreign state through diplomatic channels.id.a emphasis added.nothing in a requires that the papers be mailed to a location in the foreign state,and the method chosen by plaintiffs a mailing addressed to the minister of foreign affairs at the embassy was consistent with the language of the statute and could reasonably be expected to result in delivery to the intended person.
what little case law there is on this question accords with our reading of a,that service on a minister of foreign affairs via an embassy address constitutes literal compliance with the statute.this is not the first time that sudan has made the argument for a more restrictive reading of a.in rux.republic of sudan,the eastern district of virginia rejected sudan contention that service had to be mailed directly to the minister of foreign affairs at the ministry of foreign affairs in khartoum,rather than to the minister of foreign affairs via the sudanese embassy.cv,wl,at,aff on other grounds,cir.the district court found that t he text of a does not prohibit service on the minister of foreign affairs at an embassy address.indeed,the statute does not prescribe the place of service,only the person to whom process must be served.id.
in another case,wye oak technology,republic of iraq,the eastern district of virginia similarly held that service via an embassy is sufficient to satisfy the fsia as long as the service is directed to the minister of foreign affairs.cv,wl,at.june,aff on other grounds,cir.in wye oak,a summons was issued by the clerk of the court to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs of iraq,care of the embassy of the republic of iraq in washington,dc.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court found that 
section a does not impose a requirement that an otherwise proper service package must be delivered to a particular destination.no doubt,the address to which the service package is directed must bear some objectively reasonable relationship to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs and the chosen method of delivery must have some reasonable expectation of success.however,there is nothing on the face of section a that prohibits plaintiff chosen method of delivery to the head of the ministry of foreign affairs 
id.at.we agree.
cases where a service was held to be ineffective involved suits where service was sent to a person other than the minister of foreign affairs,not to a place other than the ministry of foreign affairs.rux,wl,at emphasis in original see magness russian fed n,cir finding service improper where complaint sent to texas secretary of state for forwarding to boris yeltsin,and also sent directly to russian deputy minister of culture transaero,la fuerza aerea boliviana,finding service improper when made on the bolivian ambassador and consul general in washington,and the bolivian first minister and the bolivian air force in la paz,but never on the ministry of foreign affairs or the secretary of state alberti empresa nicaraguense de la carne,cir holding that the ambassador of nicaragua can not be construed as the head of the ministry of foreign affairs.
the legislative record on a is sparse,and sheds little light on the question.the house judiciary committee report seemed to contemplate and reject service on an embassy in its discussion of proposed methods of service under the fsia 
a second means of service,of questionable validity,involves the mailing of a copy of the summons and complaint to a diplomatic mission of the foreign state.section precludes this method so as to avoid questions of inconsistency with section of article of the vienna convention on diplomatic relations,ust,tias,which entered into force in the united states on december.service on an embassy by mail would be precluded under this bill.see of state bull.
at,as reprinted in.this report,though,fails to make the distinction at issue in the instant case,between s ervice on an embassy by mail,id.emphasis added,and service on a minister of foreign affairs via or care of an embassy.the house report suggests that precludes service on an embassy to prevent any inconsistency with the vienna convention on diplomatic relations,entered into force in united states,hereinafter vienna convention.the relevant sections of the vienna convention say only that t he premises of the mission shall be inviolable,and that a diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the host state civil and administrative jurisdiction.id.in a case where the suit is not against the embassy or diplomatic agent,but against the foreign state with service on the foreign minister via the embassy address,we do not see how principles of mission inviolability and diplomatic immunity are implicated.moreover,sudan has not sought to rely on this legislative history.
in this case,service was directed to the right individual,using the sudanese embassy address for transmittal.process was not served on the foreign mission rather,process was served on the minister of foreign affairs via the foreign mission.the requirement advanced by sudan,that service be mailed directly to a ministry of foreign affairs in the foreign country,makes little sense from a reliability perspective and as a matter of policy.while direct mailing relies on the capacity of the foreign postal service or a commercial carrier,mail addressed to an embassy as an extension of the foreign state can be forwarded to the minister by diplomatic pouch.see rux,wl,at addressing the inherent reliability and security associated with diplomatic pouches,which,unlike the united states postal service,dhl,or any other commercial carrier,is accorded heightened protection under international law to ensure safe and uncompromised delivery of documents between countries.citing vienna convention.
we conclude that plaintiffs complied with the plain language of the fsia service of process requirements at a.
finally,though not well developed in its brief,we construe sudan as also raising a question as to whether service was proper in the turnover proceedings.because we have found that service of the default judgment in the underlying district court case was proper,sudan argument fails.see e a copy of the default judgment shall be sent to the foreign state in the manner prescribed for service in this section.peterson islamic republic of iran,cir the fsia is quite clear what a plaintiff must serve on a foreign state before a court may enforce a default judgment against that state the default judgment.service of motions is not required.autotech techs.lp integral research dev,cir holding that the federal rules for service applied because the fsia service provisions do not cover motions.
here,plaintiffs served all three turnover petitions at issue,as well as their motion for entry of order finding sufficient time has passed to seek attachment and execution of defendant judgment debtor assets,by mail addressed to sudan new minister of foreign affairs,
