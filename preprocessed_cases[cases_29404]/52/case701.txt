order and opinion 
the panel has unanimously voted to grant the petition for panel rehearing.the petition for rehearing en banc is denied as moot.the unpublished memorandum disposition of july,is hereby withdrawn.an opinion shall be filed concurrently with this order.
ernest rowland appeals the denial of his motion to suppress evidence and his motion for pretrial discovery related to his conviction for possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute in violation of a,b a viii.we have jurisdiction over this appeal under and we affirm.we hold that guam customs officers are statutorily authorized to stop any passenger arriving in guam if the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the passenger is violating guam drug laws.we also conclude,that the totality of the circumstances in this case gave rise to reasonable suspicion of such a violation,and that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied rowland motion for pretrial discovery.
factual and procedural background 
in october,drug enforcement administration dea agents in guam received a telephone tip that rowland was planning to smuggle methamphetamine hydrochloride to guam from hawaii.the informant identified himself to the officers,provided rowland name and his approximate height and weight,and remarked that rowland was from hawaii and was on probation.the informant told dea agent jonathan anderson that he had contacted the dea to bare his soul it is undisputed that the informant contacted the dea voluntarily and was not motivated by a plea offer or other favorable treatment from authorities.after receiving the tip,agent anderson and agent david taitano contacted the hawaii probation department.the probation department confirmed that rowland was on probation in hawaii,provided rowland date of birth and his physical location,and informed the agents of rowland criminal history that included prior drug convictions.
about one week after receiving the tip,agents anderson and taitano met with the informant for about ten minutes to discuss rowland.in addition to that meeting,the agents spoke with the informant on the telephone about two or three other times.the informant could not tell the agents the specific date that rowland would travel from hawaii to guam.the informant had no known track record of reliability on this or any other case.agents anderson and taitano informed guam customs and quarantine guam customs that they were interested in rowland guam customs placed rowland name on a computer watch list at won pat international airport in guam.
on december,rowland arrived at the guam airport on a domestic flight from honolulu,hawaii.although rowland and the other passengers were not required to pass through federal immigration or customs checkpoints,they were required to execute a guam customs agriculture declaration form.rowland presented his form to a guam customs officer,and stated that he would spend roughly one week in guam and that he did not possess prohibited items or controlled substances.
because rowland name was in the computer watch system,the guam customs officer referred rowland to secondary inspection.at secondary inspection,guam customs officer quinata asked rowland if he was carrying any prohibited items.rowland responded that he was not.officer quinata searched rowland bag and found nothing.officer quinata observed,however,that rowland was nervous and sweating mildly during the inspection.quinata then asked rowland if he had any weapons or narcotics on his person.rowland replied,yes,i have dope on me.quinata conducted a and found grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride in packets strapped around rowland waist.
on december,rowland was indicted for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine hydrochloride in violation of a,b a viii.rowland filed a motion to suppress evidence on march,alleging,inter alia,that the guam customs officers lacked both probable cause and reasonable suspicion to believe that rowland was engaged in criminal activity.he simultaneously filed a motion for pretrial discovery of information related to the confidential informant.in its opposition to the motions,the government argued,inter alia,that the search was a border search that did not require reasonable suspicion or probable cause.in his reply,rowland contested the assertion that the customs search qualified as a border search.after a brief initial hearing on april,the district court ordered supplemental briefing on the border search issue.on october,the district court conducted a second hearing on the motions and heard testimony from dea agent anderson about his contact with the confidential informant.
on november,the district court denied the motion to suppress.the district court did not reach the question whether the search was a border search that did not require reasonable suspicion or probable cause.instead,the district court held that the information supplied by the informant demonstrated sufficient indicia of reliability so as to provide the dea with reasonable articulable suspicion justifying the issuance of the intelligence report and the custom s officer subsequent stop of defendant.the court further concluded that rowland statement that he had dope on his body created probable cause that justified the search of his person.
on december,the magistrate judge in guam denied rowland motion for discovery related to the confidential informant.the magistrate judge concluded that rowland had not made a sufficient showing to demonstrate that he is entitled to the information concerning the informant.the magistrate judge found relevant the fact that the government did not intend to use the informant or the information that he provided at trial.
following the denial of his motions,rowland entered into a conditional guilty plea with no written plea agreement.on may,he was sentenced to months incarceration and years of supervised release.rowland filed this timely appeal of the denial of his motion to suppress and his motion for pretrial discovery.
ii.standard of review 
we review the denial of a motion to suppress de novo.see united states crawford,cir en banc.whether an official acted within his statutory authority is a question of law that we review de novo.see,united states miller,cir.we also review de novo whether reasonable suspicion justified a stop.see united states miguel,cir.the trial court factual findings are reviewed for clear error.see united states bynum,cir.
the decision whether to disclose the identity of a confidential informant is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see united states henderson,cir.nondisclosure is an abuse of discretion only if disclosure is relevant and helpful to the defense of the accused,or essential to a fair determination of the defendant cause.see roviaro united states,d.
iii.statutory authority to make stop 
at the outset,we must determine whether guam customs officers have the statutory authority to stop an individual that they believe is violating guam drug laws.if the officers lack the statutory authority to make such a stop,our cases suggest that the evidence obtained as a result of the stop might be suppressed.see,united states juda,cir noting that dismissal of indictment or suppression of evidence might be appropriate remedy for statutorily unauthorized search,but declining to reach the issue united states peterson,cir noting that suppression might be proper remedy for statutorily unauthorized search,but declining to reach the issue.
any guam customs officer may arrest persons who violate a prohibition contained in article of title guam code annotated chapter and make seizures of any controlled substance imported into guam in violation of article of title guam code annotated chapter guam code ann.article,chapter is codified at section of title of the guam code,and pertains to importation and exportation of controlled substances.specifically,section of title makes it unlawful to import into guam any controlled substance in schedule i or ii of this act,subject to exceptions for approved medical and scientific imports.guam code ann.a.methamphetamine is a schedule ii substance.see guam code ann.defining schedule ii drugs as those listed in appendix b guam code.b c methamphetamine.it thus appears that guam customs officers are statutorily authorized to arrest persons and seize methamphetamine imported into guam.the question then becomes whether methamphetamine arriving in guam on a flight originating in hawaii is imported into guam within the meaning of the statutory scheme.this is a question of first impression 
rowland argues that drugs imported into guam must arrive in guam from a foreign country.because his flight was a nonstop,domestic flight from hawaii,rowland argues that the guam customs officers lacked statutory authority to stop and question him about suspected violations of guam drug laws.in support of this interpretation,rowland offers four arguments that the plain meaning of imported does not include the authority to stop domestic trafficking of controlled substances that our decision in united states cabaccang,cir en banc,compels the conclusion that rowland did not import drugs into guam that our decision in united states,cir,requires that the evidence be suppressed in the instant case and that other sections of the guam code support his interpretation of the statute.we find these arguments unpersuasive.
it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.united states smith,cir quoting perrin united states,d.rowland thus argues that domestic,as set forth in section of title of the guam code,should be defined as of or relating to a country internal affairs,and that importation must therefore implicate activities.the problem with rowland argument is that he resorts to a common dictionary meaning before determining whether the term is otherwise defined in the statute.when a word is defined in a statute,courts are not at liberty to look beyond the statutory definition.smith,at citation omitted.
in this case,the customs title of the guam code states that,f or the purpose of this article,the term import means,with respect to any article,any bringing in or introduction of any such article into any area on guam.guam code ann.thus,when the next subsection prohibits import ing into guam any controlled substance,see guam code ann,it prohibits bringing any controlled substances into guam,regardless of whether the substance comes from a foreign country or from the united states.any article brought into guam from outside of guam is therefore imported within the meaning of guam drug laws.because guam customs officers are statutorily empowered to arrest individuals who import drugs into guam,see guam code ann.a,and because it is an act of importation to bring drugs to guam from the united states,we hold that guam customs officers are statutorily authorized to stop and seize individuals they suspect of bringing drugs to guam,even if the person arrived on a flight originating in the united states.
even if we were not convinced by the plain language of the statute,we would reach the same conclusion based on the structure of guam customs law.guam is not part of the united states customs territory,and has its own customs zone.see h defining united states in the tariff act of as all territories and possessions of the united states except guam a noting that guam is outside the customs territory of the united states.imports into guam are not governed by the tariff act of,and guam has its own customs administration.see b the customs administration of guam is under the government of guam.thus,although guam is geopolitically part of the united states,an item passing from the united states into guam leaves one customs territory,and its administration,and enters another.see id.it therefore makes sense that,for purposes of guam customs law,any item arriving in guam from outside of if coming from the united subject to customs inspection 
rowland additional arguments in support of his interpretation can not compete with the clarity of the statutory scheme.his reliance on our en banc decision in united states cabaccang,is misplaced.in cabaccang,we reversed a conviction for importation of controlled substances in violation of a.the cabaccang brothers caused large amounts of methamphetamine to be shipped on nonstop commercial airline flights from california to guam.see cabaccang,at.federal law makes it unlawful to import into the united states from any place outside thereof,any controlled substance,see a,and the cabaccangs were convicted of violating that section,see cabaccang,at.our prior decisions had held that transporting drugs from one point in the united states to another through international airspace constituted importation.see guam sugiyama,cir,overruled by cabaccang,at united states perez,cir,overruled by cabaccang,at.in cabaccang,we sat en banc and overruled those cases,holding that drugs that pass through international airspace on a nonstop flight from one location to another are not from outside the united states for purposes of a.see cabaccang,at.
the statute in cabaccang prohibited transportation of drugs into the united states,and the critical question was whether passage through international airspace rendered drugs imported.here,there has been no suggestion that the drugs were imported due to passage through international airspace instead,we know that the drugs were imported because they were introduced into any area on guam from outside of guam.see guam code ann.because guam has its own customs zone and a different definition of imported,importation into the united states under and importation into guam under guam customs laws are not analogous.guam is part of the united states for purposes of federal drug law,see,but not for customs purposes.cabaccang is inapposite to the case at bar.
rowland also argues that we must suppress the evidence in this case because of our prior decision in united states.in that case,united states customs officers inspected a truck entering the united states at nogales,arizona,and learned that it contained marijuana.see,at.instead of seizing the drugs,the officers followed the truck to its point of delivery in compton,california to arrest potential.see id.the officers surveilled the suspected contraband for four days,and watched as it was moved into a building.see id.the customs officers then entered the building without a warrant and arrested.see id.we held that the motion to suppress should have been granted because the officers were required by statute to obtain a warrant.see id.at.specifically,if a customs officer believes that goods that violate customs laws are in a dwelling house,store,or other building or place,he is required to seek a warrant to enter such building.id.citing a.it was due to the statutory violation that the evidence was suppressed in that case.
the instant case is distinct from because the guam customs officer did not violate a statutory command.indeed,it appears that the officer was statutorily authorized to make the stop,as set forth above.we do not agree with rowland that compels us to order suppression in this case.
finally,rowland argues that section of title of the guam code and section of title of the guam code support his position.first,he argues that section indicates that an item must come from a foreign country to be imported.that argument is squarely rejected by the broad definition of import in the preceding subsection,a subsection that rowland does not address.see guam code ann.defining import as any bringing in or introduction of any such article into any area on guam.turning to his second argument,section empowers guam customs officers to conduct suspicionless searches of baggage arriving on flights originating outside of the united states.rowland asserts that the corollary is that guam customs officers lack the statutory authority to conduct searches and seizures of passengers arriving on flights from the united states.we are not persuaded.that guam legislature has empowered its customs authorities to inspect baggage arriving on international flights is irrelevant to the question whether customs authorities may stop persons they reasonably suspect of violating guam dru
