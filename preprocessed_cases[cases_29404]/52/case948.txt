this case involves a lawsuit brought under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,by two american citizens who sued the socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya libya for torture and hostage taking.plaintiffs lawsuit seeks cover under a recent amendment to the fsia which strips certain foreign states including libya of their sovereign immunity in american courts when they engage in such conduct.see a.
in response to plaintiffs suit,libya moved to dismiss,claiming sovereign immunity and a lack of personal jurisdiction.the district court denied the motion to dismiss and libya now seeks review in this interlocutory appeal.two central questions have been raised on appeal first,whether plaintiffs have alleged facts that are legally sufficient to revoke libya immunity under the fsia and,second,whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction over libya in the manner specifically authorized by the fsia violates the due process clause.
we hold,first,that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for hostage taking adequate to abrogate sovereign immunity and establish subject matter jurisdiction.the allegations set forth in the complaint do not come close to satisfying the definition of hostage taking prescribed by the fsia.we hold further that the allegations supporting plaintiffs torture claim are not adequate to bring the case within the statutory exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity.the complaint in its present form is simply too conclusory to satisfy a.in contrast to the claim,however,plaintiffs have at least intimated that they can allege facts that might state a proper claim for torture under the fsia.accordingly,we will remand the case to allow plaintiffs to attempt to amend their complaint in an effort to satisfy the statute rigorous definition of torture.as a word of caution,we note that there is a question as to whether the complaint states a claim for relief upon which plaintiffs can recover although this matter is not properly before us on interlocutory review,we are not foreclosing review of the issue in the district court.
finally,we hold that libya,as a foreign state,is not a person within the meaning of the due process clause.we therefore conclude that the constitution imposes no limitation on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the federal courts over libya.
background 
the facts and procedural history of this case are relatively straightforward.plaintiffs michael price and roger frey,americans who had been living in libya in the employ of a libyan company,were arrested in march of after taking pictures of various places in and around tripoli.libyan government officials apparently believed that these photographs constituted propaganda,because they would portray unfavorable images of life in libya.
price and frey allege that,following their arrest,they were denied bail and kept in a political prison for days pending the outcome of their trial.in their complaint,plaintiffs assert that they endured deplorable conditions while incarcerated,including mattresses,a cramped cell with substandard plumbing that they were forced to share with seven other inmates,a lack of medical care,and inadequate food.the complaint also asserts that the plaintiffs were kicked,clubbed and beaten by prison guards,and interrogated and subjected to physical,mental and verbal abuse.compl.at.the complaint contends that this incarceration was for the purpose of demonstrating defendant support of the government of iran which held hostages in the embassy in tehran,iran.id.at.
ultimately,plaintiffs were tried and acquitted of the crimes with which they had been charged.after the verdict was announced,however,the libyan government retained their passports for another days while the prosecution pursued an appeal,which is permitted under the libyan code of criminal procedure.when this appeal was eventually rejected,plaintiffs were permitted to leave libya.
on may,price and frey commenced a civil action against libya in federal court.their complaint asserted claims for hostage taking and torture and sought million in damages for each man.following receipt of process,libya filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that the grant of subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs action was unconstitutional,the court exercise of personal jurisdiction was unconstitutional,and plaintiffs had failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.the district court rejected each of these arguments,thus vitiating libya sovereign immunity defense and allowing the court to assert both subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims and personal jurisdiction over the defendant.libya now pursues an interlocutory appeal.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,libya has not renewed its constitutional attack on the court subject matter jurisdiction.instead,it claims that the district court erred in not resolving certain disputed issues of fact,proceeding instead as if plaintiffs factual allegations had already been established.libya also argues that,even assuming that these facts were true,the plaintiffs have failed to make out a valid claim either for torture or hostage taking under the fsia.finally,libya asserts that the due process clause does not permit an american court to take jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign based on conduct that has no connection to the united states save for the nationality of the plaintiff.
plaintiffs cause of action 
before we address the issues arising under the fsia and the due process clause,we first want to make it clear that our decision today does not address or decide whether the plaintiffs have stated a cause of action against libya.the parties appear to assume that a substantive claim against libya arises under the fsia,but this is far from clear.the fsia is undoubtedly a jurisdictional statute which,in specified cases,eliminates foreign sovereign immunity and opens the door to subject matter jurisdiction in the federal courts.see first city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,d.there is a question,however,whether the fsia creates a federal cause of action for torture and hostage taking against foreign states.see roeder islamic republic of iran,d.
the flatow amendment to the fsia confers a right of action for torture and hostage taking against an official,employee,or agent of a foreign state,pub,div.a,title i,c,codified at note see flatow islamic republic of iran,but the amendment does not list foreign states among the parties against whom such an action may be brought.while it is possible that such an action could be brought under the international terrorism statute,a,boim quranic literacy,cir,no such claim has been raised in this case.
the question relating to plaintiffs cause of action has yet to be raised or addressed in the district court,and it was neither briefed nor argued by the parties during this appeal.therefore,although we flag the issue,we will leave its disposition to the district court in the first instance following remand of this case.we will turn our attention now to the matters before us,the issues arising under the fsia and the due process clause.
b.the amendments to the foreign sovereign immunities act 
the fsia provides a basis for asserting jurisdiction over foreign nations in the united states.argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d.the statute,which was originally enacted in,confers immunity on foreign states in all cases that do not fall into one of its specifically enumerated exceptions.see,mckesson hboc,islamic republic of iran.these exceptions were crafted in order to codify the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity,under which immunity is generally limited to a foreign state public or governmental acts jure imperii but withheld from its private or commercial acts jure gestionis.see,at jackson people republic of china,cir.
the fsia thus begins with a presumption of foreign sovereign immunity,qualified by a list of specific circumstances in which that immunity is unavailable.these include cases in which the state has waived its immunity,id.at a,cases based upon various forms of commercial activity,id.at a,takings of property in violation of international law,id.at a,and torts committed in the united states,id.at a.the original fsia was not intended as human rights legislation.see jennifer gergen,human rights and the foreign sovereign immunities act.int l.thus,no matter how allegedly egregious a foreign state conduct,suits that did not fit into one of the statute discrete and limited exceptions invariably were rejected.see,saudi arabia nelson,d holding that a claim arising from the detention and torture of an american citizen in saudi arabia was not based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states smith socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,cir holding that libya retained its sovereign immunity for the bombing of pam am over lockerbie,scotland princz fed.republic of germany,holding that plaintiff could not recover for slave labor performed at nazi concentration camps,because germany conduct was not commercial activity causing a direct effect in the united states and did not constitute an implied waiver of sovereign immunity siderman de blake republic of argentina,cir holding that argentina was immune from liability for acts of torture committed by the ruling junta libyan arab republic,edwards,concurring fsia precludes jurisdiction over libya for armed attack on civilian bus in israel amerada hess,at.at i mmunity is granted in those cases involving violations of international law that do not come within one of the fsia exceptions.
under the original fsia,therefore,terrorism,torture,and hostage taking committed abroad were immunized forms of state activity.see,at t he fsia does not currently allow citizens to sue for gross human rights violations committed by a foreign sovereign on its own soil.indeed,in nelson,the supreme court recognized that conduct of the sort alleged in the present case wrongful arrest,imprisonment,and torture amounted to abuses of police power,and however monstrous such abuse undoubtedly may be,a foreign state exercise of the power of its police has long been understood for purpose of the restrictive theory as peculiarly sovereign in nature.at.at see also mathias reimann,a human rights exception to sovereign immunity some thoughts on princz federal republic of germany.int l,observing that under the unamended fsia efforts to persuade the courts to recognize a human rights exception to sovereign immunity had failed.
the mounting concern over decisions such as these eventually spurred the political branches into action.see john murphy,civil liability for the commission of international crimes as an alternative to criminal prosecution,harv.hum.rts.in,as part of the comprehensive antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,pub,a,stat,congress amended the fsia to add a new class of claims for which certain foreign states would be precluded from asserting sovereign immunity.specifically,the amendment vitiates immunity in cases 
in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture,extrajudicial killing,aircraft sabotage,hostage taking,or the provision of material support or resources for such an act if such act or provision of material support is engaged in by an official,employee,or agent of such foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office,employment,or agency.
a.in enacting this provision,congress sought to create a judicial forum for compensating the victims of terrorism,and in so doing to punish foreign states who have committed or sponsored such acts and deter them from doing so in the future.see daliberti republic of iraq,d,molora vadnais,the terrorism exception to the foreign sovereign immunities act,ucla int l foreign aff.
while such legislation had long been sought by victims groups,it had been consistently resisted by the executive branch.see alan gerson jerry adler,the price of terror,at.executive branch officials feared that the proposed amendment to fsia might cause other nations to respond in kind,thus potentially subjecting the american government to suits in foreign countries for actions taken in the united states.see murphy,supra,at,at.although these reservations did not prevent the amendment from passing,they nevertheless left their mark in the final version of the bill.
section a has some notable features which reveal the delicate legislative compromise out of which it was born.first,not all foreign states may be sued.instead,only a defendant that has been specifically designated by the state department as a state sponsor of terrorism is subject to the loss of its sovereign immunity.a a.second,even a foreign state listed as a sponsor of terrorism retains its immunity unless a it is afforded a reasonable opportunity to arbitrate any claim based on acts that occurred in that state,and b either the victim or the claimant was a national at the time that those acts took place.a b.in the present case,libya has been designated as a sponsor of terrorism.see rein socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,cir.moreover,both plaintiffs are american citizens,and libya does not contend that it has been denied a chance to arbitrate their claims.
if service of process has been made under,personal jurisdiction over a foreign state exists for every claim over which the court has subject matter jurisdiction.see b.in turn,the statute automatically confers subject matter jurisdiction whenever the state loses its immunity pursuant to a.see id.at a.personal jurisdiction determinations always have been made in this way under the fsia.see joseph dellapenna,suing foreign governments and their corporations commenting on this significant compression,whereby both competence subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction depend upon whether the foreign state is immune under the substantive rules in the act see also harris vao intourist,moscow,weinstein,noting the way in which the fsia collapses subject matter jurisdiction,in personam jurisdiction,and sovereign immunity into a single inquiry.
under the original fsia,however,it was generally understood that in order for immunity to be lost,there had to be some tangible connection between the conduct of the foreign defendant and the territory of the united states.see verlinden cent.bank of nigeria,d lee caplan,the constitution and jurisdiction over foreign states the amendments to the foreign sovereign immunities act in perspective.int l,mckeel islamic republic of iran,cir n othing in the legislative history of the act suggests that congress intended to assert jurisdiction over foreign states for events occurring wholly within their own territory.such an intent would not be consistent with the prevailing practice in international law.in this way,the original statute immunity exceptions prescribe d the necessary contacts which must exist before our courts can exercise personal jurisdiction,at describing the act personal jurisdiction provisions as a kind of federal statute,one patterned after the district of columbia own law see also jurisdiction of courts in suits against foreign states hearings before the subcommittee on administrative law and governmental relations of the house committee on the judiciary on,sess.statement of bruno ristau noting that this feature of the bill will insure that only those disputes which have a relation to the united states are litigated in the courts of the united states.
when congress passed the original fsia,it was assumed that the exercise of personal jurisdiction over foreign states under the statute always would satisfy the demands of the constitution.see joseph glannon jeffery atik,politics and personal jurisdiction suing state sponsors of terrorism under the amendments to the foreign sovereign immunities act,geo.this assumption proved accurate.see,shapiro republic of bolivia,cir callejo bancomer,cir s davis int l,republic of yemen,cir noting that the direct effects language of a closely resembles the minimum contacts language of constitutional due process and these two analyses have overlapped.indeed,as some courts have noted,the nexus requirements imposed by the original fsia sometimes exceeded the constitutional standard.see in re papandreou,substantial contact required by e requires more than the minimum contacts necessary to ensure due process.
the antiterrorism amendments changed this statutory framework.under a,the only required link between the defendant nation and the territory of the united states is the nationality of the claimant.thus,a now allows personal jurisdiction to be maintained over defendants in circumstances that do not appear to satisfy the minimum contacts requirement of the due process clause.see caplan,supra,at under its plain terms,the new law extends extraterritoriality much further than the traditional reach of the international shoe washington.standard.
challenges to the factual underpinnings of an fsia complaint 
before we turn to the due process issue,as well as to the antecedent question of whether plaintiffs have stated valid claims under a for hostage taking and torture,we must first address a separate argument that libya has advanced on appeal.libya contends that the district court erred in assuming the truth of the factual allegations in plaintiffs complaint for purposes of determining whether it had subject matter jurisdiction.appellant correctly points out that in phoenix consulting,republic of angola,we held that when a foreign state defendant raises a dispute over the factual basis of the court subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia,the trial court is required to go beyond the pleadings and resolve any disputed issues of fact the resolution of which is necessary to a ruling upon the motion to dismiss.
libya now claims that it did not engage in the actions described in plaintiffs complaint.thus,it contends that we must reverse the district court finding of subject matter jurisdiction and remand for further on that issue.see,islamic republic of iran,holding that where the conclusory allegations in a plaintiff complaint are challenged by a sovereign defendant,the district court must do more than just look to the pleadings to ascertain whether to grant the motion to dismiss.we reject this argument.
in its original motion to dismiss,libya specifically stated that,for purposes of that pleading,it was not challenging the facts in the complaint.def.mot.to dismiss,at.when it renewed this motion,libya still did not challenge the factual basis of plaintiffs allegations.instead,it wrote that,e ven viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,the facts alleged in the complaint do not establish acts of torture by libya.def.mot.to dismiss,at.the district court then properly took the plaintiff factual allegations as true and determine d whether they brought the case within any of the exceptions to immunity invoked by the plaintiff.phoenix consulting,at.it now falls to this court to review this determination,which we do de novo.see mckesson hboc,at.
appellate jurisdiction 
price and frey claim that we lack jurisdiction over libya appeal,because the denial of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is neither a final decision,see,nor the proper subject of an immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine,see cohen beneficial indus.loan.coopers lybrand livesay,d.these propositions are generally correct however,insofar as the instant appeal addresses the denial of libya motion to dismiss on grounds of foreign sovereign immunity,that question is immediately appealable.see princz federal republic of germany,at observing that sovereign immunity confers not merely a defense against liability but a right not to be tried.thus,an fsia defendant can take an immediate appeal if the district court rejects its argument that the facts alleged in the plaintiff complaint do not bring the case within one of the statute immunity exceptions.
this is in substance what libya argued below,and what it now asserts on appeal.see br.for appellant the fact that price frey received a trial and were acquitted and subsequently released,must deprive the district court of subject matter jurisdiction as their confinement can not be considered an act of hostage taking under a.emphasis added.in other words,the basis for libya motion to dismiss and for this appeal was that plaintiffs had not set forth an adequate factual basis for applying the fsia torture and hostage taking exceptions.it follows therefore that we have jurisdiction to review this challenge at this time.
the fsia definition of torture derives from the meaning given that term in section of the torture victim protection act of tvpa,pub,stat,codified at note.see e.section b of the tvpa defines torture to include 
any act,directed against an individual in the offender custody or physical control,by which severe pain or suffering other than pain or suffering arising only from or inherent in,or incidental to,lawful sanctions,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on that individual for such purposes as obtaining from that individual or a third person information or a confession,punishing that individual for an act that individual or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,intimidating or coercing that individual or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.
emphases added.this definition,in turn,borrows extensively from the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,res,gaor,supp,at,doc.torture convention,which the united states signed in and ratified two years later.see,part,at.indeed,the tvpa was passed in part to fulfill the convention mandate that ratifying nations take action to ensure that torturers are held legally accountable for their actions.see,at.
while the legislative history of aedpa gives no indication as to how broadly the definition of torture was intended to sweep,congress considered this question both in ratifying the torture convention and in enacting the tvpa.see beth stephens michael ratner,international human rights litigation in courts.specifically,the drafting histories of both the convention and the statute address two ambiguities lurking in that definition that must be confronted as we consider whether price and frey have alleged facts sufficient to bring this case within the fsia definition of torture.the first concerns the meaning of severe how much actual pain or suffering must defendants inflict before their conduct rises to the level of torture the second involves the for such purposes language what must plaintiffs prove about the motivation for the alleged torture if they hope to deprive foreign states of their immunity 
the severity requirement is crucial to ensuring that the conduct proscribed by the convention and the tvpa is sufficiently extreme and outrageous to warrant the universal condemnation that the term torture both connotes and invokes.see david stewart,the torture convention and the reception of international criminal law within the united states,nova,noting that what the convention forbade was likely already illegal under most domestic legal systems filartiga,cir among the rights universally proclaimed by all nations is the right to be free of physical torture,at official torture violate s standards accepted by virtually every nation.the drafters of the convention,as well as the reagan administration that signed it,the bush administration that submitted it to congress,and the senate that ultimately ratified it,therefore all sought to ensure that only acts of a certain gravity shall be considered to constitute torture.herman burgers hans danelius,the united nations convention against torture see also exec,at the term torture,in the united states and international usage,is usually reserved for extreme,deliberate and unusually cruel practices,for example,sustained systematic beating,application of electric currents to sensitive parts of the body,and tying up or hanging in positions that cause extreme pain.
the critical issue is the degree of pain and suffering that the alleged torturer intended to,and actually did,inflict upon the victim.the more intense,lasting,or heinous the agony,the more likely it is to be torture.see exec,at the united states understands that,in order to constitute torture,an act must be a deliberate and calculated act of an extremely cruel and inhuman nature,specifically intended to inflict excruciating and agonizing physical or mental pain or suffering.internal quotation marks omitted.this understanding thus makes clear that torture does not automatically result whenever individuals in official custody are subjected even to direct physical assault.not all police brutality,not every instance of excessive force used against prisoners,is torture under the fsia.
as to the purposes for which abuse must be inflicted,it is clear from the text of the tvpa that the list of purposes provided was not meant to be exhaustive.see murphy,supra,at.instead,this list was included in order to reinforce that torture requires acts both intentional and malicious,and to illustrate the common motivations that cause individuals to engage in torture.see exec,at.the for such purposes language thus suggests that any purpose would have to be similar in nature to those mentioned in order to elevate an act of violence into an act of torture.see burgers danelius suggesting that there must be some,even if remote,connection with the interests or policies of the state.moreover,this requirement ensures that,whatever its specific goal,torture can occur under the fsia only when the production of pain is purposive,and not merely haphazard.in order to lose its sovereign immunity,a foreign state must impose suffering cruelly and deliberately,rather than as the unforeseen or unavoidable incident of some legitimate end.
when reviewing a plaintiff unchallenged factual allegations to determine whether they are sufficient to deprive a foreign state defendant of sovereign immunity,we assume those allegations to be true,at.thus,where the defendant contests only the legal sufficiency of plaintiff jurisdictional claims,the standard is similar to that of rule b,under which dismissal is warranted if no plausible inferences can be drawn from the facts alleged that,if proven,would provide grounds for relief.see browning clinton.a claimant need not set out all of the precise facts on which the claim is based in order to survive a motion to dismiss.sinclair kleindienst.however,in light of the serious and implications of the fsia amendments,it is especially important for the courts to ensure that foreign states are not stripped of their sovereign immunity unless they have been charged with actual torture,and not mere police brutality.
in this case,plaintiffs complaint offers no useful details about the nature of the kicking,clubbing,and beatings that plaintiffs allegedly suffered.as a result,there is no way to determine from the present complaint the severity of plaintiffs alleged beatings including their frequency,duration,the parts of the body at which they were aimed,and the weapons used to carry them out in order to ensure that they satisfy the tvpa rigorous definition of torture.in short,there is no way to discern whether plaintiffs complaint merely alleges police brutality that falls short of torture.thus,the facts pleaded do not reasonably support a finding that the physical abuse allegedly inflicted by libya evinced the degree of cruelty necessary to reach a level of torture.
furthermore,the present complaint says virtually nothing about the purpose of the alleged torture.plaintiffs seemingly have left it for the courts to conjure some illicit purpose to fill in this pleading gap.obviously this will not do.
in sum,plaintiffs allegations of torture as presently stated are insufficient to survive defendant motion to dismiss.plaintiffs must allege more than that they were abused.they must demonstrate in their pleadings that libya conduct rose to such a level of depravity and caused them such intense pain and suffering as to be properly classified as torture.although it is far from certain,their complaint hints that they might be able to state a proper claim for torture under the fsia.accordingly,we will remand the case to the district court to allow plaintiffs to attempt to amend their complaint in an effort to satisfy tvpa stringent definition of torture.
hostage taking 
as with torture,the fsia draws its definition of hostage taking from an exogenous legal source,here article of the international convention against the taking of hostages.see e.this provision reads as follows 
any person who seizes or detains and threatens to kill,to injure or to continue to detain another person in order to compel a third party,namely,a state,an international governmental organization,a natural or judicial person or a group of persons,to do or abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the hostage commits the offense of taking hostages within the meaning of the convention.
emphases added.under no reasonable reading of the plaintiffs complaint does their admittedly unpleasant imprisonment qualify as hostage taking so defined.
the convention does not proscribe all detentions,but instead focuses on the intended purpose of the detention.in this case,the complaint asserts only that libya incarcerated price and frey for the purpose of demonstrating defendant support of the government of iran which held hostages in the embassy in tehran,iran,at.such motivation does not satisfy the convention intentionality requirement.the definition speaks in terms of conditions of release the defendant must have detained the victim in order to compel some particular result,specifically to force a third party either to perform an act otherwise unplanned or to abstain from one otherwise contemplated so as to ensure the freedom of the detainee.accordingly,detention for the goal of expressing support for illegal behavior even for behavior that would itself qualify as hostage taking does not constitute the taking of hostages within the meaning of the fsia.
in this case,the plaintiffs have suggested no demand for quid pro quo terms between the government of libya and a third party whereby price and frey would have been released upon the performance or of any action by that third party.indeed,even when read most favorably to them,their complaint points to no nexus between what happened to them in libya and any concrete concession that libya may have hoped to extract from the outside world.the one purpose that plaintiffs have alleged is plainly inadequate,and they have advanced no others.their allegation thus falls short of the standard for hostage taking under a.
for these reasons,libya can not be stripped of its sovereign immunity based on plaintiffs allegation of hostage taking.the district court thus erred in refusing to dismiss this count.accordingly,we reverse on this point.
personal jurisdiction 
the last question that we face is whether the due process clause is offended by the district court assertion of personal jurisdiction over libya.if,on remand,plaintiffs can state a claim of torture under a sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss,and if they have properly served process on the defendant,personal jurisdiction will be established under the fsia.see b practical concepts,republic of bolivia,noting that under the fsia,subject matter jurisdiction plus service of process equals personal jurisdiction.however,it is that a statute can not grant personal jurisdiction where the constitution forbids it.gilson republic of ireland.
the due process clause requires that if the defendant be not present within the territory of the forum,he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.int l shoe,at.at quoting milliken meyer.in the absence of such contacts,the liberty interest protected by the due process clause shields the defendant from the burden of litigating in that forum.see burger king rudzewicz,d.libya argues that foreign states,no less than private individuals and corporations,are protected by these constitutional strictures.
in the present case,it is undisputed that libya has no connection with the district of columbia or with the united states,except for the alleged fact that it tortured two american citizens in libya.this would be insufficient to satisfy the usual minimum contacts requirement.see,imo,kiekert ag,cir holding that minimum contacts do not exist in an intentional tor
