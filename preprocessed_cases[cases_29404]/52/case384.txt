harlon costner,united states marshal for the middle district of north carolina the government,appeals a district court order denying a motion to dismiss petru mironescu habeas corpus petition,see west,and enjoining the government from extraditing mironescu to romania.finding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of mironescu petition,we vacate and remand for dismissal of the petition.
before discussing the facts specifically pertaining to this case,we begin with some background regarding the extradition process and the law governing it.
extradition procedure 
extradition is a process by which a fugitive may be returned to another country to face criminal charges.the process begins with the submission by a foreign government of an extradition request to the united states department of state.see restatement third of foreign relations law cmt.a.the state department then determines whether the request is covered by a treaty.see id.if it is,the matter is referred to the justice department for screening.see id.assuming that the justice department deems the request to be valid,it is referred to the united states attorney for the district in which the fugitive is believed to be located.see id.
at that point,the united states attorney files a complaint in the district court,seeking certification of the fugitive extraditability and a warrant for his arrest.see west supp.once the fugitive is in custody,a district court judge or magistrate judge conducts a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the fugitive has violated one or more of the criminal laws of the country requesting extradition the alleged conduct would have been a violation of american criminal law,if committed here and the requested individual is the one sought by the foreign nation for trial on the charge at issue.see peroff hylton,cir.provided that these requirements are satisfied and that the applicable treaty provides no other basis for denying extradition,the judge certifies to the secretary of state the secretary that the fugitive is extraditable.see.although a judge certification of extraditability is not appealable,a fugitive may obtain limited collateral review of the certification in the form of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see peroff hylton,cir per curiam.in considering such a habeas petition,the district court generally determines only whether the judge had jurisdiction,whether the charged offense is within the scope of the applicable treaty,and whether there was any evidence supporting the probable cause finding.see prushinowski samples,cir.
following certification by the district court,the secretary must decide whether to extradite the fugitive.see west the secretary of state may order the person to be delivered to any authorized agent of such foreign government,to be tried for the offense of which charged.in deciding whether to extradite,the secretary may consider factors affecting both the individual defendant as well as foreign that may be beyond the scope of the judge review.sidali ins,cir.the broad range of options available to the secretary includes but is not limited to reviewing de novo the judge findings of fact and conclusions of law,refusing extradition on a number of discretionary grounds,including humanitarian and foreign policy considerations,granting extradition with conditions,and using diplomacy to obtain fair treatment for the fugitive.see united states,cir.
the cat and the farr act 
a central issue in this appeal is whether the secretary discretion in extradition matters has been constrained by article of the united nations convention against torture cat,see united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,adopted,and of the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act the farr act of,see,div.g,stat.codified at note.as is relevant here,article of the cat provides 
no state party shall expel,return refouler or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.
for the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds,the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including,where applicable,the existence in the state concerned of a consistent pattern of gross,flagrant or mass violations of human rights.
at president reagan signed the cat on april.the senate adopted a resolution of advice and consent to the convention in but conditioned that consent on its declaration that the provisions of articles through of the convention are not.cong.rec.and,the president ratified the cat for the united states subject to this same declaration.see ogbudimkpa ashcroft,cir recounting ratification history of the cat.
in light of the senate determination that the cat was not,congress enacted the farr act to implement the treaty.the farr act provides that i t shall be the policy of the united states not to expel,extradite,or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture,regardless of whether the person is physically present in the united states.section a.it also directs heads of the appropriate agencies to prescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the united states under article.section b.
the applicable state department regulations identify the secretary as the official responsible for determining whether to surrender a fugitive to a foreign country by means of extradition.b.they provide that to implement the obligation assumed by the united states pursuant to article of the convention,the department considers the question of whether a person facing extradition from the is more likely than not to be tortured in the state requesting extradition when appropriate in making this determination.id.they further state that in each case in which there is an allegation relating to torture,appropriate policy and legal offices shall review and analyze information relevant to the case in preparing a recommendation to the secretary as to whether or not to sign the surrender warrant.a.and,they provide that d ecisions of the secretary concerning surrender of fugitives for extradition are matters of executive discretion not subject to judicial review.
having briefly described the legal landscape in which this appeal arises,we now turn to the facts.
mironescu was prosecuted and convicted in absentia in romania for various crimes relating to automobile theft.he was sentenced to an aggregate term of four years imprisonment.
romania submitted a request to the united states for mironescu extradition under the applicable treaty between the two countries.after mironescu was arrested in the united states in,a magistrate judge conducted an extradition hearing,at which mironescu argued that he had not committed the charged crimes and that the cat barred his extradition.the judge determined that he lacked authority during an initial extradition hearing to address the cat allegations and that there was probable cause to believe that mironescu had committed the charged offenses.see in re extradition of mironescu,d.the judge therefore certified mironescu extraditability to the secretary.see id.at.
mironescu subsequently petitioned the district court for habeas corpus,contending,inter alia,that extradition would violate his rights under the cat and the farr act.the district court ruled that the certification for extradition was valid,but that mironescu claims under the cat and the farr act were not ripe for adjudication.see mironescu costner,d.the court ruled that mironescu could bring his humanitarian concerns to the secretary attention and that the secretary was required to notify mironescu of the issuance of any surrender warrant in order to allow him adequate time to consider whether to pursue habeas review see id.at.the court therefore denied mironescu habeas petition without prejudice.see id.
upon receiving notification that a warrant to extradite him had been signed by the secretary,mironescu filed the present habeas petition mironescu asserts that the secretary has a mandatory duty under the cat and farr act not to extradite a fugitive who is likely to be tortured after his surrender.he further alleges that he presented substantial evidence to the secretary that he would be tortured if extradited to romania and that the secretary decision to extradite him in the face of such evidence was arbitrary and capricious.mironescu submits that the district court possesses jurisdiction over his habeas petition because he alleges that he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.c.he also asserts that the district court has jurisdiction to consider his petition under the administrative procedure act apa,west supp.
the government moved to dismiss the petition.while conceding that the cat,the farr act,and the implementing state department regulations require the secretary to deny extradition if mironescu would likely face torture in romania,the government nevertheless asserted that,based on the common law rule of,as well as the language of the farr act and the apa,the district court lacked authority to review the secretary extradition decision.
the district court denied the motion to dismiss,concluding that it possessed jurisdiction to review whether the secretary torture determination as to mironescu was arbitrary,capricious,or not in accordance with law.internal quotation marks omitted.the court emphasized that this review will not consist of a de novo review of the court will not substitute its opinion for the secretary as to whether mironescu would face torture upon return to will merely determine whether the secretary did,in fact,consider mironescu evidence,if only to subsequently and validly reject it.id.at.having determined that it was obliged to examine the secretary reasoning in deciding to extradite mironescu,the court ordered the government to produce,for in camera review,the administrative record considered by the secretary with respect to the question of whether mironescu would be subject to torture the court also enjoined the government from surrendering mironescu to romanian officials pending its decision.
the government maintains that the district court erred in denying its motion to dismiss mironescu petition because claims that an extradition would violate the cat or the farr act may not be raised on habeas.specifically,the government argues that the scope of habeas review in extradition cases is limited and the rule of bars such claims.
u nder what is called the rule of in extradition law,courts in this country refrain from examining the penal systems of requesting nations,leaving to the secretary of state determinations of whether the defendant is likely to be treated humanely.hood,cir.understanding the underpinnings of this rule is critical in deciding whether it applies here.the origin of the rule can be traced back to two supreme court cases from the late century.see jacques semmelman,federal courts,the constitution,and the rule of in international extradition proceedings,cornell.first,in benson mcmahon,the court listed the following as the sole issue properly before it on habeas review of an extradition decision whether,under the construction of the act of congress and the treaty entered into between this country and mexico,there was legal evidence before the commissioner to justify him in exercising his power to commit the person accused to custody to await the requisition of the mexican government.benson,at.the court issued the second decision two years later,expanding on this proposition 
a writ of habeas corpus in a case of extradition can not perform the office of a writ of error.if the commissioner has jurisdiction of the and of the person of the accused,and the offense charged is within the terms of a treaty of extradition,and the commissioner,in arriving at a decision to hold the accused has before him competent legal evidence on which to exercise his judgment as to whether the facts are sufficient to establish the criminality of the accused for the purposes of extradition,such decision of the commissioner can not be reviewed by a circuit court or by this court,on habeas corpus,either originally or by appeal.
oteiza jacobus.the rule of thus originally was born by implication,by virtue of the fact that the treatment a fugitive would likely receive once he was extradited was not listed by the court as a factor that is properly considered on habeas review of a decision to grant extradition.semmelman,cornell.at.the rule also has some roots in neely henkel.see yapp reno,cir carnes,circuit judge,dissenting.there,the petitioner had filed a writ of habeas corpus challenging extradition to cuba on the ground that the statute providing the basis for his extradition was unconstitutional,in that it did not secure for him all of the rights he would have under the constitution if tried in this country.see neely,at.in rejecting that claim,the court stated 
when an american citizen commits a crime in a foreign country,he can not complain if required to submit to such modes of trial and to such punishment as the laws of that country may prescribe for its own people,unless a different mode be provided for by treaty stipulations between that country and the united states.
id.at.lastly,glucksman henkel,provided the final piece of the puzzle.see united states howard in re extradition of howard,cir.there,in the context of analyzing the petitioner claim that there was insufficient evidence to warrant his extradition,the court stated,
i f there is presented,even in somewhat untechnical form according to our ideas,such reasonable ground to suppose the relator guilty as to make it proper that he should be tried,good faith to the demanding government requires his surrender.we are bound by the existence of an extradition treaty to assume that the trial will be fair.
glucksman,at.citations omitted.
we conclude that the rule of does not warrant a holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to review the secretary extradition decision on habeas.most relevant to our conclusion is our decision in plaster united states,cir.there,a united states attorney filed a complaint in district court seeking certification of plaster extraditability.see plaster,at.attached to the complaint were an affidavit from the state department certifying west germany extradition request,pursuant to an extradition treaty between the two countries,as well as various documents establishing plaster involvement in a murder.see id.at.after the court certified plaster extraditability,the district court granted a writ of habeas corpus,ruling that extradition would infringe plaster due process rights because it would violate the terms of an immunity agreement between him and the united states government.see id.at 
we affirmed,holding that the district court correctly ruled that it had jurisdiction to enjoin plaster extradition when the court determined that his detention was unlawful.see id.at.we recognized that the scope of habeas review of international extradition proceedings has been traditionally described in narrow terms whether the magistrate had jurisdiction,whether the offence charged is within the treaty and whether there was any evidence warranting the finding that there was reasonable ground to believe the accused guilty.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we nevertheless observed that none of the cases describing the review in those terms involved a claim that extradition would be unconstitutional.see id.at.we explained that the united states must act within the confines of the constitution when carrying out its treaty obligations,and we noted that a claim of unconstitutional governmental conduct is within the scope of habeas corpus review mandated by both the constitution itself and the applicable federal statute.id.citation omitted see in re burt,cir holding that district court was correct to consider procedural due process claim as part of its habeas corpus review in an extradition challenge.
in holding that the district court possessed jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of the extradition,we specifically rejected an argument by the government that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the extradition power of the united states is sui generis and commits the consideration of alleged constitutional violations solely to the secretary of state and the president.plaster,at.we noted that although the executive has unlimited discretion to refuse to extradite a fugitive,it lacks the discretion to extradite a fugitive when extradition would violate his constitutional rights.see id.additionally,we explained that unquestionably,it is the province of the judiciary to adjudicate claims that governmental conduct is in violation of the constitution.id.
our reasoning in plaster is controlling here.the supreme court cases describing habeas review of extradition orders,particularly benson,oteiza,and glucksman,did not involve claims that extradition would violate a federal statute,nor did the several fourth circuit cases that similarly describe such habeas review see ordinola hackman,cir prushinowski samples,cir antunes vance,cir collier vaccaro,cir.moreover,the government concedes that the farr act precluded the secretary from extraditing mironescu to a signatory to the cat,see status of ratification of the convention against torture,http www.ohchr.org english law cat ratify.htm last visited,if he was likely to be tortured there.see br.for the appellants at noting that before the district court t he government recognized that the secretary of state is bound by the policy of the cat as implemented by domestic legislation and state department regulations,and that mironescu thus could not be extradited to romania if it was likely he would indeed be tortured there id.at w e are not arguing that the secretary of state has the authority to extradite a fugitive who is likely to be tortured.but see siefert ii,cir.concluding that the farr act does not eliminate the secretary discretion to extradite an individual likely to face torture in the requesting country,vacated as moot,cir en banc and,the habeas writ indisputably extends to prisoners being held in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states,c.
neither plaster,nor the application of the plaster rule here,contradicts neely.certainly,prior to the cat and the farr act,the conclusion of the supreme court that individuals being extradited are not constitutionally entitled to any particular treatment abroad rendered evidence of the treatment they were likely to receive irrelevant in the context of a claim on habeas that their detention contravened federal law.see peroff,at.it stood to reason that,absent any federal right to particular treatment in the requesting country,any refusal of extradition based on the treatment a fugitive was likely to receive would have to be made by the executive.see,at the secretary may decline to surrender the relator based on humanitarian considerations.however,the farr act now has given petitioners the foothold that was lacking when the court decided neely.
in arguing that the rule of bars habeas review here,the government relies on decisions of other circuits that have expanded the justifications for the rule of since its origin.several of these cases have reasoned that not only has the extradition power historically been vested exclusively in the executive,but the executive is uniquely suited for that role.see,at.these courts have determined that courts are as institutions to the executive extradition decisions.united states smyth in re requested extradition of smyth,cir see ii,at t he decision to surrender a fugitive,unlike the probable cause determination that a judicial officer makes,involves sensitive judgments about how the fugitive is likely to be treated if returned to the requesting country whether to seek assurances about the protections that will be afforded to him,at what level to obtain them,and how to evaluate such assurances as are given and the nature of diplomatic relations between the united states and the requesting foreign state at the time.
some courts have also noted that the rule of is warranted because courts are as a matter of separation of powers and foreign relations policy to make inquiries into and pronouncements about the workings of foreign countries justice systems.smyth,at.they have concluded that interests of international comity are by requiring a foreign nation to satisfy a united states district judge concerning the fairness of its laws and the manner in which they are enforced.ahmad wigen,cir see semmelman,cornell.at stating that a judicial decision to enjoin extradition for humanitarian reasons could lead to a retaliatory refusal to extradite and potentially affect the relations between the countries 
relying on these cases,the government maintains that regardless of the fact that the secretary extradition of mironescu would violate federal law if extradition will likely result in mironescu torture,the rule of should preclude habeas review here because courts are to the expert opinion of the state department regarding whether torture is likely to occur in romania.br.for the appellants at.we do not agree.it is important to emphasize that a habeas court reviewing cat or farr act claims would not be called upon to consider whether extradition would further our foreign policy interests or,if so,how much to weigh those interests.rather,it would be required to answer only the straightforward question of whether a fugitive would likely face torture in the requesting country.american courts routinely answer similar questions,including in asylum proceedings and in applying the political offense exception,under which the political nature of and motivation for a crime may negate extraditability.see andrew parmenter,comment,death by the ninth circuit permits the extradition of a citizen facing the death penalty for a drug offense prasoprat benov,cir,washburn,see also ordinola,at observing that the vast majority of extradition treaties provide political offense exceptions.we have no reason to doubt that district courts could adequately perform this function in this context as well.
the government also maintains that concerns regarding international the possibility of delays that habeas review could application of the rule of.that habeas review may delay extradition,or preclude it altogether,can not negate mironescu right to obtain habeas relief if he is being detained in violation of federal law,just as such considerations did not negate plaster right to assert his constitutional claim.see plaster,at.indeed,plaster specifically recognized that habeas proceedings regarding claims that extradition would be unconstitutional will often involve delicate questions of international diplomacy.id.moreover,one could well argue that the damage done to our foreign relations with another country is likely to be less when a court,as opposed to the secretary,makes the decision that extradition must be denied.see quinn robinson,cir john quigley,the rule of and human rights treaties,cath.
finally,the government suggests that habeas review concerning the treatment a fugitive would likely receive in the requesting country might compromise the confidentiality of certain sensitive communications between the executive and a foreign government.however,we have no reason to doubt that district courts can adequately protect the confidentiality of such communications by considering them in camera,as the district court intends to do here.see quinn,at.for all of these reasons,we hold that,in light of the secretary conceded obligation under the farr act not to extradite mironescu if he is likely to face torture,the rule of does not bar habeas review of the secretary extradition decision.but see ii,at.
despite our holding regarding the rule of,we nevertheless conclude that the district court erred in denying the government motion to dismiss on the basis that d of the farr act bars consideration of mironescu petition.
in interpreting a statute,we must first determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning.robinson shell oil,d.our determination of whether a statute is ambiguous is guided by reference to the language itself,t
