congress has enacted two statutes to help victims of terrorism collect on money judgments against the foreign states responsible for sponsoring the attacks.we consider whether victims can collect from an instrumentality of a state that has sponsored terrorism when the instrumentality is a separate juridical entity that was a party to the underlying lawsuit.
background 
the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia is the sole basis for jurisdiction over foreign states in courts.under the fsia,foreign sovereigns are generally immune from jurisdiction,except for a few carefully delineated exceptions.one such exception is for claims arising out of acts of terrorism.see id.
four groups of individuals the bennett,greenbaum,acosta and heiser creditors hold separate judgments obtained in courts against the republic of iran,based on various terrorist attacks that occurred between and.the bennett creditors are owed almost million in damages for iran role in the bombing of a cafeteria at hebrew university in jerusalem.the greenbaum creditors are owed almost million for a bombing of a jerusalem restaurant.the acosta creditors are owed over million for iran part in a mass shooting.and,finally,the heiser creditors are owed over million for the bombing of the khobar towers in saudi arabia.all judgments were by default,but no one disputes that they are valid and that all four sets of creditors are owed money by iran.
however,winning a money judgment against a foreign state is the end of the story,because sovereign immunity separately protects the assets of a foreign sovereign from attachment.for years,the terrorism exception to the fsia created an anomaly it abrogated a foreign sovereign immunity from judgment,but not its immunity from collection.terrorism victims therefore had a right without a meaningful remedy.
congress subsequently enacted two statutes closing this loophole section a of the terrorism risk insurance act tria and.g.section was enacted to deal comprehensively with the problem of enforcement of judgments rendered on behalf of victims of terrorism by enabling them to satisfy such judgments through the attachment of blocked assets of terrorist parties,at.blocked assets are those that have been seized or frozen by the federal government.the tria provides that the blocked assets of a terrorist party including the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party shall be subject to execution.terrorism risk insurance act of,pub,a,stat,codified at note satisfaction of judgments from blocked assets of terrorists,terrorist organizations,and state sponsors of terrorism.
section g,enacted in as an amendment to the fsia,extended the tria abrogation of asset immunity to funds that were not blocked.it provides that the property of a foreign state against which a judgment is entered under this statute,and the property of an agency or instrumentality of such a state,including property that is a separate juridical entity or is an interest held directly or indirectly in a separate juridical entity,is subject to attachment in aid of execution upon that judgment as provided in this section.g.
these two statutes give creditors a theoretical avenue to collect on the judgments they obtained.but,of course,they have to find the money first and iranian assets within the united states are notoriously hard to come by.an opportunity arose in,when the department of treasury issued a blocking order prohibiting certain iranian assets in the united states from being transferred back to iran.that blocking order was based on iran illicit nuclear program,not its terrorism.nonetheless,it meant that various financial institutions had money owed to iran sitting in accounts within the united states.the creditors here saw a rare chance to collect on their judgments and filed a complaint seeking access to million in blocked assets held by visa and franklin but owed to bank melli iran national bank.fearing they might be liable to bank melli if they simply handed the money over to the creditors,visa and franklin responded by filing a complaint to interplead bank melli and obtain final resolution of who was entitled to the funds.visa and franklin deposited the funds into the district court registry.bank melli made an appearance and moved to dismiss.the district court denied that motion but certified its order for interlocutory appeal under b.we review de novo.see colony cove,llc city of carson,cir.
ii.discussion 
bank melli makes four distinct arguments as to why the creditors should be able to collect from the funds held by visa and franklin.first,it argues that the assets are protected by sovereign immunity notwithstanding the tria and section g,because those statutes waive sovereign immunity only for the terrorist party iran and bank melli is a separate juridical entity from iran.second,it asserts that federal rule of civil procedure requires dismissal of this entire action,because bank melli is an indispensable party that can not be joined.third,it argues that applying the tria and section g to the judgments at issue here would be impermissibly retroactive,because the creditors obtained their judgments against iran before the statutes enactment.and,finally,bank melli claims that the frozen assets are subject to the tria or section g because those statutes extend only to assets owned by the foreign entity.because the assets here are technically in the possession of visa and franklin,bank melli argues that they are yet owned by bank melli.
foreign sovereign immunity 
bank melli argues that the tria and section g do not abrogate the asset immunity of all of a terrorist state instrumentalities,only those that are alter egos of the state.for this proposition,bank melli relies principally on the supreme court holding in first national city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba bancec,that government instrumentalities established as juridical entities distinct and independent from their sovereign should normally be treated as such.under bancec,the only conditions under which an instrumentality may be equated with the sovereign are when it is so extensively controlled by its owner that a relationship of principal and agent is created or when failure to regard them as equivalent would work fraud or injustice.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.bank melli contends that the tria and section g incorporate bancec distinction between instrumentalities that are separate juridical entities and those that are alter egos,and abrogates immunity only as to those instrumentalities that,unlike bank melli,fall within bancec two exceptions.
we can not reconcile bank melli argument with the plain text of either statute.section a of the tria specifically states that the blocked assets of a terrorist party including the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party shall be subject to execution.a emphasis added.bank melli argues that the parenthetical phrase is merely illustrative and does not purport to expand the meaning of terrorist party beyond bancec.but we must assume congress meant what it said when it used the term any agency or instrumentality.see united states gonzales.read naturally,the word any has an expansive meaning,that is,one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.id.quoting webster third new international dictionary.because congress did not add any language limiting the breadth of that word,we must read the statute as referring to all instrumentalities.id.
furthermore,bank melli interpretation flouts the rule that a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,and no part will be inoperative or superfluous.clark rameker,internal quotation marks omitted.because an alter ego under bancec is the terrorist party,there would be no need for congress to separately provide for attachment against instrumentalities unless it sought to extend coverage to those instrumentalities that can not be equated with the terrorist party itself.
we therefore agree with the second circuit that it is clear beyond cavil that section a of the tria provides courts with subject matter jurisdiction over execution and attachment
