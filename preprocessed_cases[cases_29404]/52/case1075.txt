respondents lawsuit against sullivan first judgment 
on september,in an opinion authored by chief judge schofield,the court found that sullivan had been given notice of a hearing on respondents claims against him.the court ordered sullivan to pay the costs incurred by respondents in the underlying litigation.in a judgment dated october,after noting that this case was unusual,judge schofield explained the basis for awarding costs against a nonparty as follows 
respondents alleged that sullivan was complicit in the fraud.sullivan filed a bankruptcy to avoid the effects of the proceedings in this claim.following a hearing in which sullivan failed to appear,the court found sullivan had been guilty of complicity in laycock fraudulent claims and ordered that he pay the defendants costs on an indemnity basis.in ruling against sullivan,the court required proof that sullivan was acting in bad faith in being a party to putting false evidence before the court.the court found sullivan lied to the court.sullivan played a supervisory role in the preparation of fraudulent documents presented to the court.
as part of a lengthy opinion,judge shofield explained despite sullivan protestations of innocence,from all the evidence i was satisfied that he was involved in the preparation of the false evidence i was satisfied that sullivan involved himself in laycock claim and that his intervention was in bad faith in that he was a party to the concoction of false evidence in pursuit of the claim the claim had to be answered by the defendants who have expended considerable sums of money in proving the falsity of the evidence.i concluded that costs should be borne by sullivan.it is impossible to separate the actions of laycock and sullivan in their pursuit of the claim.
the gibraltar court cited to the english supreme court act,quoting it as follows 
subject to the provisions of this or any other enactment and to rules of court,the costs of and incidental to all proceedings in 
a the civil division of the court of appeal

attorney fee litigation for lawsuit against sullivan second judgment 
subsequently,in an opinion dated march,the registrar concluded the costs incurred by respondents in prosecuting the claim against sullivan as subsequently corrected to be.that amount was in addition to the award in the first judgment.a hearing of the proceedings before the registrar is included in the record and indicates that sullivan was represented by counsel who participated by phone.the registrar stated that,in order to establish that sullivan intervened in bad faith,requires copious collection of evidence because how do you establish that someone has intervened without investigating.this is further complicated by the geographical distances.and both investigations in the and mexico that had to be carried out in order to establish this intervention and the effect of this intervention.
federal litigation 
bankruptcy court 
as mentioned,just prior to the hearing in gibraltar on respondents claim against sullivan,sullivan filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.the bankruptcy court considered the consequence of the gibraltar court proceeding after the bankruptcy petition had been filed.in an opinion dated november,the bankruptcy court concluded that absent the annulment of the automatic stay,the acts would be void.it concluded the facts favored annulling the bankruptcy stay.the court concludes that the failure of the debtor sullivan to list the movants million dollar plus claim was for the sole purpose of making it appear he qualified for chapter relief.as such,the schedules were filed in bad faith and the court will look beyond them when determining his eligibility for chapter relief.sullivan also failed to be candid with the court,trustee,and creditors regarding his income.
district court 
the case was appealed to district court.on june,the federal district court issued an opinion finding the gibraltar action was dismissed because laycock complaint was fraudulent.five days before a hearing on whether sullivan should be liable for the costs of suit,sullivan filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.the bankruptcy court found that sullivan filed his petition in bad faith sullivan did not disclose his spouse income his or income and misstated the nature sources and regularity of his income.sullivan failed to list claims.the bankruptcy court properly annulled the stay because sullivan acted in bad faith,judicial economy militated in favor of resolving the gibraltar lawsuit.the bankruptcy court explained that creditors were faced with what to do once sullivan filed for bankruptcy in bad faith.
los angeles superior court action 
respondents filed a complaint against sullivan requesting the trial court enter judgment on a foreign money judgment pursuant to the ufmjra.a separate lawsuit against laycock was joined,but laycock is not a party to this appeal.
richard melville,a member of queen counsel,was the only witness who testified at trial.melville was certified to practice law in gibraltar.he defended respondents in the litigation brought by laycock.he testified regarding the documents received from the supreme court of gibraltar to authenticate those documents.no dispute with respect to the authentication of the documents is raised on appeal.melville testified no punitive damages were sought or awarded.on,sullivan attorney asked melville about specific cost items including the cost of surveillance of sullivan in order to serve him.
the trial court concluded that the judgments of the gibraltar court were not fines or penalties,they were final,conclusive,and enforceable where rendered,and were not subject to any exceptions.on december,the superior court awarded judgment of,plus costs of suit in favor of respondents.that amount included the award in the first judgment and that in the second judgment.sullivan timely appealed.
discussion 
in the trial court,respondents asked the court to recognize and enforce the gibraltar judgments pursuant to the ufmjra.the california legislature amended that act in,while this case was pending.the legislature made clear that the prior version applies to this case,which commenced in.code civ,subd.b the former uniform foreign recognition act applies to all actions commenced before the effective date of this chapter in which the issue of recognition of a judgment is raised.therefore,we apply the former statutes.unless otherwise indicated,statutory citations to the ufmjra are to the statutes before the amendment.
the ufmjra,a act,is in effect in over states and was an effort to codify the law on recognition of judgments from foreign countries.systems yardeni.the codification was based on rules that had already been applied in a majority of courts.west laws ann.foreign recognition act.subject to certain exceptions,a foreign judgment is enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state which is entitled to full faith and credit code civ.article iv,section,of the united states constitution provides that full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts,records,and judicial proceedings of every other state.and the congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts,records and proceedings shall be proved,and the effect thereof.
a foreign judgment excludes a judgment for a penalty.code civ.a foreign judgment is not conclusive if the foreign court did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant.code civ,subd.a bank of montreal kough,affd.cir.the foreign judgment is not conclusive if it was rendered in a court that does not provide due process of law.code civ,subd.a bank melli iran pahlavi cir,evidence that iranian regime does not believe in independence of judiciary and evidence of sentiment supported district court conclusion that iranian judgment was not enforceable.a judgment need not be recognized if the defendant was not given notice in time to defend the judgment is repugnant to public policy the judgment conflicts with another final and conclusive judgment or if the foreign court was a seriously inconvenient forum.code civ,subd.b.sullivan argues that based on each of these grounds the trial court should not have enforced the gibraltar judgments.
i.the judgment did not include a penalty 
by definition,a foreign judgment does not include a judgment for a penalty.therefore,whether the award requiring sullivan to pay attorney fees constituted a penalty,as sullivan now argues,is a threshold question.sullivan previously argued in this court that t he trial transcript makes it clear that the lasc judgment was for attorneys fees and costs and was not a penalty.
to define penalty in this context,we look to cases discussing the enforcement of sister state judgments made relevant by the ufmjra statement that foreign judgments should be enforced in the same manner as sister state judgments.code civ.we also consider cases discussing the enforcement of foreign judgments under principles of comity as the ufmjra was an effort to codify the majority practice.finally,the restatement of the foreign relation laws of the united states also is instructive.these sources present a uniform definition of penalty,one that sullivan ignores.
more than a century ago,the united states supreme court explained that the term penalty has multiple definitions,only one of which applies in the context of the enforcement of judgments.the high court held the question whether a statute of one state,which in some aspects may be called penal,is a penal law in the international sense,so that it can not be enforced in the courts of another state,depends upon the question whether its purpose is to punish an offense against the public justice of the state,or to afford a private remedy to a person injured by the wrongful act.huntington attrill.the test is not by what name the statute is called by the l egislature or the courts of the state in which it was passed,but whether it appears to the tribunal which is called upon to enforce it to be in its essential character and effect,a punishment of an offence against the public,or a grant of a civil right to a private person.id.at.crimes and offences against the laws of any state can only be defined,prosecuted and pardoned by the sovereign authority of that state and the authorities,legislative,executive or judicial,of other states take no action with regard to them,except by way of extradition to surrender offenders to the state whose laws they have violated,and whose peace they have broken.id.at.
this test has been followed in california.miller municipal court cal d,see also farmers merchants trust madeira d.t he question is not whether the statute is penal in some sense.the question is whether it is penal within the rules of private international law.a statute penal in that sense is one that awards a penalty to the state,or to a public officer in its behalf,or to a member of the public,suing in the interest of the whole community to redress a public wrong.citations.the purpose must be,not reparation to one aggrieved,but vindication of the public justice chavarria superior court d,quoting loucks standard oil,loucks.applying this rule,treble damages,double damages,and minimum fines were considered penalties.miller municipal court,at,see also in re marriage of gray d.
the test in the restatement of the law,the foreign relations law of the united states restatement is consistent.the restatement explains that courts in the united states are not required to recognize or to enforce judgments for the collection of taxes,fines,or penalties rendered by the courts of other states.rest d the foreign relations law of the united states,com.b.a penal judgment,for purposes of this section,is a judgment in favor of a foreign state or one of its subdivisions,and primarily punitive rather than compensatory in character.a judgment for a fine or penalty is within this section a judgment in favor of a foreign state arising out of a contract,a tort,a loan guaranty,or similar civil controversy is not penal for purposes of this section some states consider judgments penal for purposes of if multiple,punitive,or exemplary damages are awarded,even when no governmental agency is a party in the united states,such judgments are not considered penal for this purpose.ibid.
sullivan unpersuasively and without citation to relevant authority asserts that because attorney fees are a weapon in deterring groundless litigation and akin to punitive damages they are clearly penal.applying the definition of penalty in the context of the enforcement of judgments to this case,the attorney fees awards were not penalties.sullivan was not being punished for an offense against the public but instead was ordered to compensate respondents for the fees they incurred in defending a lawsuit.the award was not payable to the state or to the court but instead to respondents.the judgment arose from a civil action,not an enforcement of the penal laws of gibraltar.the damages were not designed to provide an example or punish sullivan.sullivan questioned certain of those costs at the trial but did not argue or show that there was a different basis for the judgment.no mandatory fine,sanction,or multiplier was imposed.thus,although sullivan views the attorney fee award as a penalty for groundless litigation,it was not a penalty within the meaning of the ufmjra.erbe elektromedizin gmbh canady d,awarding attorney fees is not penal in nature and qualifies as a foreign judgment loucks,supra,at rejecting as penal where offender is punished,but the purpose is the reparation to the aggrieved.
ii.the attorney fees are not repugnant to public policy
