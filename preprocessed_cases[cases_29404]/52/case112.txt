discussion 
applicable law 
the foreign sovereign immunities act is the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court.fsia provides that a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states except as provided in sections to of this chapter.thus,if a defendant is a foreign state within the meaning of fsia,that defendant is not subject to the jurisdiction of the united states courts unless one of the exceptions in the act applies.
in,congress amended fsia to include a terrorism exception,codified at a,in order to give american citizens an important economic and financial weapon against outlaw states that sponsor terrorism by providing safe havens,funding,training,supplying weaponry,medical assistance,false travel documentation,and the like,at.this section was subsequently repealed,and congress enacted in its place.see,div.a,stat.repealing a and creating a a i l the court shall hear a claim under this section if the foreign state was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the state department.to the extent relevant to this case,provides for the same exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity as the repealed section.
fsia also has several sections which address the type of foreign property that can be attached by judgment creditors.generally,property of a foreign sovereign is immune from attachment.see.exceptions are,however,provided by f a,tria a,and g.
f a provides that any property with respect to which financial transactions are prohibited or regulated under the trading with the enemy act twea,or the international emergency economic powers act ieepa can be subject to execution or attachment to satisfy a judgment which was obtained under the terrorism exception outlined in.see f a s hall be subject to execution or attachment in aid of execution of any judgment relating to a claim for which a foreign state including any agency or instrumentality or such state claiming such property is not immune under section a or section.also in f,however,congress authorized the president to waive section f in the interest of national security.f.president clinton waived f attachment remedy entirely,effectively preventing judgment creditors from collecting pursuant to f.see presidential determination.this waiver,which no president has rescinded,effectively rendered the attachment remedy under f unavailable to plaintiffs.
in an effort to aid victims of terrorism to satisfy their judgments congress in enacted tria which is not subject to presidential waivers issued under f.see,stat,reprinted in relevant part at note,at.ministry of def.support for the armed forces of the republic of iran elahi,d congress placed the notwithstanding clause in a to eliminate the effect of any presidential waiver issued under u.f prior to the date of the tria enactment.specifically,tria authorizes plaintiffs holding a judgment against a terrorist party to attach blocked assets of the terrorist party or any agency or instrumentality of the terrorist party.see tria a.the statute provides that 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,and except as provided in subsection b,in every case in which a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party on a claim based on an act of terrorism,or for which a terrorist party is not immune under a,the blocked assets of that terrorist party including the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party shall be subject
