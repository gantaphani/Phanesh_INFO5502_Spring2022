the department of commerce commerce selected two exporters,jacobi carbons ab jacobi and calgon carbon tianjin,cct,to individually examine in the third administrative review of an antidumping order.commerce assigned both exporters de minimis dumping margins.rather than using the expected method of averaging those de minimis margins to calculate a separate rate for exporters ningxia guanghua cherishmet activated carbon,cherishmet shanxi dmd shanxi,and ningxia huahui activated carbon company huahui commerce continued to apply the rates it had assigned those exporters in the second,immediately preceding administrative review.the court of international trade cit held that commerce use of prior dumping margins was impermissible with respect to cherishmet and shanxi but permissible with respect to huahui.we affirm with respect to cherishmet and shanxi and reverse and remand with respect to huahui.in each case,commerce has failed to justify using the rate from the prior administrative review.
background 
when merchandise is sold in the united states at less than fair value,commerce is authorized by statute to impose antidumping duties.see.these duties are equal to the dumping margin,the amount by which the price of the merchandise in the exporting country normal value exceeds the price of the merchandise in the united states export price or price.see id.a,a,a changzhou wujin fine chem.factory,united states.under the statute,commerce is generally charged with determining individual dumping margins for each known exporter.c.when it is not practicable to determine individual margins for each exporter,the statute provides that commerce may limit its examination to a reasonable number of exporters that either constitute a statistically representative sample of all known exporters or account for the largest volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting country.id.c.
in proceedings involving economy countries,including china,commerce presumes that exporters are,and assigns them a single statewide dumping rate.changzhou,at d.this presumption is rebuttable an exporter that demonstrates sufficient independence from state control may apply to commerce for a different rate.changzhou,at.a separate rate,sometimes referred to as the rate,is assigned to all examined exporters separate respondents when commerce limits its examination to fewer than all known exporters.c b i ii changzhou,at.

the underlying proceedings involve an initial investigation followed by three administrative reviews of imports of certain activated carbon from the people republic of china,which encompasses powdered,granular,or pelletized carbon product s obtained by activating with heat and steam various materials containing carbon.notice of antidumping order certain activated carbon from the people republic of china.in the initial investigation in,commerce individually investigated only the two largest volume exporters,jacobi and cct.commerce determined that appellant huahui and appellees cherishmet and shanxi were entitled to separate rates.
after receiving several requests for review of the initial antidumping order,commerce conducted a series of three administrative reviews.in the first review in,jacobi and cct were selected as individual respondents,and commerce granted cherishmet request to be individually examined as a voluntary respondent.certain activated carbon from the people republic of china notice of preliminary results of the antidumping duty administrative review and extension of time limits for the final results,may.in the second review in,jacobi and huahui were individually examined,while cct,cherishmet,and shanxi were given separate rates.certain activated carbon from the people republic of china final results and partial rescission of second antidumping duty administrative review.commerce assigned jacobi a rate of kg and huahui a rate of kg.it calculated the separate rate by averaging those individual margins,resulting in a separate rate of kg,which was applied to cherishmet and shanxi.
in the third and final review in,which is the subject of this appeal,commerce individually examined jacobi and cct.certain activated carbon from the people republic of china final results and partial rescission of the third administrative antidumping duty administrative review final results.cherishmet,shanxi,and huahui were held entitled to a separate rate.huahui submitted a request to be individually examined as a voluntary respondent,but commerce denied its request.in the final results,commerce determined that jacobi and cct,the individually examined respondents,were not dumping,and assigned them de minimis margins the question was whether these de minimis rates should be averaged and applied to the separate respondents.
as discussed in detail below,c governs commerce calculation of separate rates.under the statute,when all individually examined exporters are assigned de minimis margins,the expected method is for commerce to calculate the separate rate by taking the average of the de minimis margins assigned to the individually examined respondents.see saa,at.if commerce determines that following the expected method would not be feasible or would result in margins that would not be reasonably reflective of potential dumping margins for the separate respondents,commerce may use other reasonable methods.id.
rather than following the expected method of averaging the de minimis margins calculated for the individually examined respondents here,commerce calculated separate rates for huahui,cherishmet,and shanxi by continuing to apply the margins it had assigned them during the previous period of review huahui was given kg,the same rate it was assigned when individually examined during the second review,and cherishmet and shanxi were given kg,the same separate rate that was calculated during the second review by averaging the rates for the individually examined respondents.commerce does not contend that employing the expected method would be unfeasible.instead,commerce determined that the expected method would result in margins that would not be reasonably reflective of the separate respondents actual dumping,explaining primarily that its policy was to exclude de minimis margins from all separate rate calculations we agree with petitioners that commerce should not diverge from the practice of excluding zero and de minimis margins when calculating the separate rate margin.memorandum to the file,through ronald lorentzen from christian marsh re issues and.mem.for the final results of the third antidumping duty administrative review,dated,at memorandum,available at.
huahui,cherishmet,and shanxi challenged commerce separate rate calculations in the cit.albemarle united states albemarle i,d.int l trade.the exporters argued that commerce calculations were unreasonable because they were based exclusively on data,and asserted that commerce failed to adequately explain its departure from the premise that the final results of a proceeding should be based solely on the facts on the record in that proceeding.id.at.the cit remanded and ordered commerce to reconsider the margin it assigned to cherishmet and shanxi,explaining that the 
kg margin was not based on data pertaining to any pricing behavior that occurred in the third period of review.nor was it based on any data pertaining to these respondents instead,commerce reverted to a margin it determined in another review for other respondents.this margin does not reflect commercial reality with respect to shanxi or cherishmet,and is,in that sense,arbitrary.

discussion 
we review decisions of the cit concerning commerce antidumping determinations by applying the same standard of review used by the cit.bestpak,at changzhou,at.commerce determination will be set aside if it is arbitrary and capricious or not supported by substantial evidence.changzhou,at see also skf,united states,we review commerce decision under the administrative procedure act and any other applicable law.the question of whether commerce statutory interpretation accords with law is guided by the test articulated in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see bestpak,at nan ya plastics,united states.we have acknowledged commerce special expertise in antidumping cases and have accorded substantial deference to its construction of pertinent statutes.skf,at internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.
under the statute,commerce normally calculates the separate rate by averaging the dumping margins established for exporters and producers individually investigated,excluding any zero and de minimis margins.c a changzhou,at.the statute provides an exception,however,for situations like the present one where all individually examined respondents receive de minimis margins.in that case,commerce may use any reasonable method to establish the estimated rate for exporters and producers not individually investigated,including averaging the estimated weighted average dumping margins determined for the exporters and producers individually investigated.c b.the statement of administrative action,legislative history that is recognized by congress as an authoritative expression concerning the interpretation and application of the tariff act under d,bestpak,at,explains that when all individually examined respondents are assigned de minimis margins,
the expected method in such cases will be to the zero and de minimis margins provided that volume data is available.however,if this method is not feasible,or if it results in an average that would not be reasonably reflective of potential dumping margins for exporters or producers,commerce may use other reasonable methods.
saa,at underscoring added the saa thus makes clear that under the statute,when all individually examined respondents are assigned de minimis margins,commerce is expected to calculate the separate rate by taking the average of those margins.commerce may use other reasonable methods,but only if commerce reasonably concludes that the expected method is not feasible or would not be reasonably reflective of potential dumping margins.id.
it is true,as the government points out,that applies on its face only to investigations,not periodic administrative reviews see amanda foods vietnam united states,d.int l trade.but the statutory framework contemplates that commerce will employ the same methods for calculating a separate rate in periodic administrative reviews as it does in initial investigations.see a amended in conducting periodic administrative reviews,commerce is required to determine the dumping margin to calculate the amount of any antidumping duty,just as it must do in initial investigations indeed,for this reason commerce itself has found the statute methodology applicable in periodic administrative reviews as well as initial investigations,as it did in this case.see memorandum,at.
the expected method under the statute makes sense in light of the general assumption underlying the statutory framework.here,the individually examined respondents account for a majority of the market during the relevant period,and are representative at the very least in terms of aggregate volume.the government argues that the possibility exists that the pricing behavior of the largest exporters selected for individual examination may not reflect the pricing behavior of smaller exporters,br.of united states at,but there is no evidence here that the largest exporters are not representative.the very fact that the statute contemplates using data from the largest volume exporters suggests an assumption that those data can be viewed as representative of all exporters.the statute assumes that,absent such evidence,reviewing only a limited number of exporters will enable commerce to reasonably approximate the margins of all known exporters.as the cit has explained,t he representativeness of the investigated exporters is the essential characteristic that justifies an all others rate based on a weighted average for such respondents.knitwear sportswear ass united states.thus the government repeated argument that no record evidence demonstrated that the separate rate respondents engaged in pricing behavior similar to jacobi or cct,br.of united states at,is backwards.the burden is not on the separate respondents to show that their dumping is the same as that of the individually examined respondents.rather,commerce must find based on substantial evidence that there is a reasonable basis for concluding that the separate respondents dumping is different.
there is no contention here that the expected method is not feasible.the questions therefore are whether commerce properly determined that the expected method utilizing the average of the margins calculated for the examined respondents would not be reasonably reflective of potential dumping margins for cherishmet,shanxi,and huahui and if so,whether commerce chosen method of carrying forward their margins from the previous review was reasonable.
commerce primarily seeks to justify its approach on the ground that there is a policy against using de minimis margins to calculate separate rates.see memorandum,at we agree with petitioners that commerce should not diverge from the practice of excluding zero and de minimis margins when calculating the separate rate margin.emphasis in original.the government contends that this is reasonable because the statute disfavors using zero or de minimis rates as a general matter.we disagree.
it is true that when there are minimis margins assigned to individually examined respondents,the statute instructs commerce to calculate the separate rate by averaging the margins assigned to the individually examined respondents,excluding any zero and de minimis margins.c a.but it is equally clear that when all individually examined respondents are assigned de minimis margins,commerce has no similar mandate to routinely exclude zero or de minimis margins.congress has spoken directly to this precise situation in c b,and the saa unambiguously provides that the expected method to calculate the separate rate in such circumstances is to average the individually examined respondents de minimis margins.see saa,at.
the government can not contend that methodology employing de minimis margins is disfavored when congress has unmistakably explained that it is,in fact,preferred the government policy simply can not be distilled from the statute in this context,and commerce insistence on using its hostility to de minimis rates as the driving force behind its methodology is on its face arbitrary and capricious.indeed,counsel for the government admitted at oral argument that commerce would have used kg,which cct was assigned in the preliminary results of the third review,as the separate rate if one of the two individually examined respondents had been assigned that rate in the final review.see oral arg.at.this demonstrates the arbitrariness of commerce approach.
commerce also seeks to justify its approach on the ground that commerce has a legitimate interest in allocating its own limited resources while this interest is certainly relevant,it alone is not sufficient to render an otherwise unreasonable methodology reasonable.
finally,as our cases have explained,accuracy and fairness must be commerce primary objectives in calculating a separate rate for cooperating exporters.see bestpak,at an overriding purpose of commerce administration of antidumping laws is to calculate dumping margins as accurately as possible.gallant ocean thailand,united states,a rate must be a reasonably accurate estimate of the respondent actual rate internal quotation marks and citations omitted snr roulements united states,antidumping laws intend to calculate antidumping duties on a fair and equitable basis.rhone poulenc,united states,the basic purpose of the statute is to determin e current margins as accurately as possible see also nan ya,at accuracy represents a reliable guidepost for commerce determinations,and a determination is accurate if it is supported by substantial evidence.
we therefore turn to commerce other justifications for its approach.we first address commerce methodology with respect to cherishmet and shanxi.cherishmet and shanxi were not individually examined in either the second or third reviews.in the second review,they were assigned a separate rate based on the simple average of the dumping margins calculated for the individually examined respondents,jacobi and huahui,which resulted in a dumping margin of kg.in the third review,commerce individually examined jacobi and cct,ultimately assigning them both de minimis margins.but commerce continued to apply the kg margin to cherishmet and shanxi as their separate rate in the third review.
there is no evidence that supports commerce determination that averaging the de minimis margins assigned to the individually examined respondents in the third review would have resulted in margins for cherishmet and shanxi that would not have been reflective of their actual dumping margins.commerce had no data specific to cherishmet or shanxi from either the second or third review.and commerce in fact assumed that the examined respondents were reasonably representative of cherishmet and shanxi during the second review,as commerce calculated the separate rate by averaging the margins of the individually examined respondents from that review.
having assumed that the individually examined respondents were reasonably representative of cherishmet and shanxi in the second review,commerce lacked any basis to reverse course and conclude that cherishmet and shanxi were somehow different in the third review.commerce did not collect any additional information regarding cherishmet or shanxi,nor was there any evidence that would indicate different exporting behavior.in fact,one of the two individually examined exporters,jacobi,was examined in both the second and third reviews.and in both reviews commerce selected the individually examined respondents pursuant to the same method of examining the largest volume exporters.in the second review,jacobi rate was used to calculate the rates for cherishmet and shanxi,but was found in the third review.the government offers no explanation as to why cherishmet and shanxi were no longer reasonably represented by the individually examined respondents in the third review,while they had been in both reviews prior.commerce conclusion was arbitrary and unsupported by substantial evidence.accordingly,we affirm the cit with respect to cherishmet and shanxi.
we next consider huahui.unlike cherishmet and shanxi,commerce did have information specific to huahui because huahui was one of the individually examined respondents in the second review.huahui was assigned an individual dumping margin of kg in the second review,significantly higher than the kg margin assigned to jacobi,the other individually examined respondent during that review,and the kg rates assigned to the individually examined respondents in the third review.for this reason,commerce did have substantial evidence to support its conclusion that simply averaging the de minimis rates assigned to jacobi and cct in the third review might not reasonably reflect huahui potential dumping margin during the third period.commerce was therefore entitled to use other reasonable methods under the statute.saa,at c b.the question here is whether commerce chosen method of carrying forward huahui data from the second period of review to the third was reasonable.we conclude that it was not.
in assessing the reasonableness of commerce methodology,our analysis is guided by the statute manifest preference for contemporaneity in periodic administrative reviews.under the statute,commerce is obligated to review an antidumping duty order if requested a t least once during each month period beginning on the anniversary of the date of publication of the order.a amended.commerce must commence a review within six months of any request.a b ii amended.the purpose of periodic administrative reviews is to reassess dumping margins previously calculated in light of data made available during the intervening period since the antidumping order was issued.see union steel united states,allegheny ludlum united states.
unlike investigations,which consider overall pricing behavior to determine the appropriateness of imposing an antidumping duty order in the first place,administrative reviews begin with an antidumping duty order already in place,and typically employ methodology that permits
