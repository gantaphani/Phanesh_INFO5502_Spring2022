the supreme court has long recognized the importance of preserving the united states ability to speak with one voice in regulating foreign commerce.michelin tire wages,d see also japan line,cnty.of,d.appellee esab group,urges us to allow the various views of the states to replace the federal government singular voice regarding commercial arbitration of insurance disputes in foreign tribunals.specifically,esab group contends that south carolina law reverse preempts federal law namely,a treaty and its implementing legislation pursuant to the mccarran ferguson act,a federal statute directed at protecting state insurance regulations from implied preemption by federal domestic commerce legislation.see am.ins.ass garamendi,d.we find such a reading of the pertinent law untenable.for this reason,we affirm as to the district court exercise of jurisdiction,and we find no error in the district court order compelling arbitration 
we likewise reject the arguments of appellant zurich insurance plc zip that the district court erred in exercising personal jurisdiction over it and in remanding nonarbitrable claims to state court.finding both parties appeals to be without merit,we affirm.
this appeal presents a complex question regarding the intersection of a treaty and federal and state statutory law.for this reason,we first provide an overview of the applicable law before discussing the factual background.
in,to the shock of observers and commentators,the supreme court held that insurance was subject to federal regulation under the interstate commerce clause.see united states.underwriters ass n.prior to that decision,it had been assumed that the issuance of an insurance policy was not a transaction in interstate commerce and that the states enjoyed a virtually exclusive domain over the insurance industry.paul fire marine ins.barry,d.accordingly,the likelihood developed that,through implied preemption,federal statutes enacted to govern domestic commerce would oust states from insurance regulation.
in,in response to south eastern underwriters,congress enacted the mccarran ferguson act,to restore the states preeminent position in insurance regulation.see dep t of treasury fabe,d life partners,morrison,cir.typically,of course,the supremacy clause of the united states constitution requires that a state law yield to a conflicting federal law.see const.art.vi,cl.kurns friction prods,d.the mccarran ferguson act,however,transformed the legal landscape by overturning the normal rules of.fabe,at.
the act first declares that congressional silence shall not be construed to impose any barrier to state regulation or taxation of the business of insurance.it further provides that n o act of congress shall be construed to invalidate,impair,or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business,unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance.id.b.thus,mccarran ferguson authorizes reverse preemption of generally applicable federal statutes by state laws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.see safety cas.certain underwriters at lloyd,london,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.
while congress acted to preserve the states dominance in insurance regulation,it moved to federalize policy regarding arbitration.in,congress enacted the federal arbitration act faa,which established a liberal federal policy in favor of the enforcement of arbitration agreements in maritime and commercial contracts.see compucredit greenwood,d.although the original version of the faa protected the enforceability of domestic arbitration agreements,it did not ensure that courts would enforce agreements to arbitrate in foreign tribunals or awards granted by such tribunals.for this,the united states entered into a multilateral treaty guaranteeing the reciprocal enforcement of such arbitration agreements and awards.
the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards the convention,adopted june,entered into force with respect to the united states,was crafted during a united nations conference.see leonard quigley,accession by the united states to the united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,yale.
the convention obligates signatories to recognize and enforce written agreements to submit disputes to foreign arbitration and to enforce arbitral awards issued in foreign nations.see id.arts.i iii.article ii of the convention describes signatories responsibilities with respect to the enforcement of foreign arbitration agreements as follows 
each contracting state shall recognize an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship,whether contractual or not,concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration.
the court of a contracting state,when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the meaning of this article,shall,at the request of one of the parties,refer the parties to arbitration,unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void,inoperative or incapable of being performed.
id.art.ii.article iii addresses signatories obligations to enforce foreign arbitral awards.it states that e ach contracting state shall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon,under the conditions laid down in the following articles.id.art.iii.in contrast with article ii,article iii omits an express instruction to courts to enforce these awards.
the united states,although a participant in the drafting conference,did not immediately accede to the convention.see quigley,supra,at.rather,the senate gave its advice and consent to accession in,and president nixon approved the accession in september.presidential proclamation on the united states of america accession to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards presidential proclamation,wl,at.the convention entered into force in the united states on december,id.
according to contemporaneous legislative materials,this delay occurred because the american delegation to the drafting conference felt certain provisions of the c onvention were in conflict with some of our domestic laws.exec,at.thus,the president and congress believed that c hanges in the federal arbitration act title of the united states code were required before the united states bec ame party to the c onvention.id.at see also,reprinted in,even though the convention was approved in october,the instrument of accession will not be deposited until chapter of the faa is enacted into law.specifically,a representative of the state department office of the legal advisor requested changes to the united states code to insure the coverage of the faa extends to all cases arising under the treaty and some changes in federal civil procedure to take care of related venue and jurisdictional requirement problems.exec,at statement of richard kearney.
to address these concerns and to aid in the enforcement of the convention,congress enacted chapter of the faa the convention act.the first section of this chapter states,the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of june,shall be enforced in united states courts in accordance with this chapter.the convention act then clarifies that arbitration agreements and awards arising out of commercial relationships,unless they are entirely between united states citizens and have no reasonable relation with one or more foreign states,fall under the convention.id.
sections through provide rules regarding jurisdiction and venue.notably,grants federal district courts original jurisdiction over any action or proceeding falling under the convention,and allows a defendant to remove such action or proceeding from state court to federal district court.id.other provisions of the convention act permit federal district courts to direct that arbitration be held and appoint arbitrators in accordance with the parties agreement,id,and to confirm foreign arbitral awards falling under the convention,id.
like federal policy,south carolina policy favors arbitration.grant magnolia manor greenwood.south carolina law establishes that,in general,written arbitration agreements are valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.ann.a.but this rule does not apply to any insured or beneficiary under any insurance policy.id.b.
in analyzing the enforceability of domestic arbitration agreements in insurance policies,both the united states district court for the district of south carolina and the south carolina court of appeals have held that,pursuant to the mccarran ferguson act,south carolina law invalidating arbitration agreements in insurance policies reverse preempts chapter of the faa,which governs domestic arbitration,am.health life ins.heyward,d,cox woodmen of the world ins.esab group appeal presents the concomitant question with respect to the convention and convention act does the mccarran ferguson act apply such that state law can reverse preempt federal law and invalidate a foreign arbitration agreement 
esab group is a south manufacturer of welding materials and equipment.during the time period relevant to this appeal,it has had several foreign corporate parents.from to,esab group and its predecessors operated as subsidiaries of esab ab,a swedish company.in,esab group became an indirect subsidiary of charter plc,a british company.it remained as such until october,when it became an indirect subsidiary of charter international plc,an irish company.throughout this time,esab group has maintained its principal place of business in florence,south carolina,where it has a manufacturing plant,executive offices,and sales,engineering,and research development divisions.
between and,a swedish insurer,trygg hansa,issued seven global liability policies the zip policies or the policies to esab group swedish parent,esab ab.under these policies,trygg hansa agreed to provide coverage,either as direct primary coverage or in excess of primary policies,to esab ab and its subsidiaries.special endorsements in the policies specifically extended coverage to esab group and its predecessors.and according to the policy territory clauses contained in each policy,the policies applied to occurrences worldwide.
five of the policies,the zip policies,contain arbitration agreements,which mandate the resolution of disputes in swedish arbitral tribunals in accordance with swedish law.the other policies,the zip policies,include swedish provisions but omit arbitration clauses.
trygg hansa transferred its obligations under the zip policies to zurich insurance company through a loss portfolio transfer agreement.zurich insurance company then transferred these obligations to zip,an irish insurer,in.
esab group is currently facing numerous products liability suits arising from alleged personal injuries caused by exposure to welding consumables manufactured by esab group or its predecessors.these suits presently are proceeding in numerous state and federal courts in the united states.as of june,esab group had incurred more than million in defense costs and suffered adverse verdicts in excess of million.
esab group requested that its insurers defend and indemnify it in these products liability actions.several,including zip,refused coverage.as a result,esab group brought suit against these insurers in south carolina state court 
the defendant insurers removed the case to the united states district court for the district of south carolina pursuant to the convention and the convention act grant of removal jurisdiction.esab group disputed the district court jurisdiction.esab group maintained that the convention act implements the convention,so the convention is judicially enforceable only as incorporated into the act.and,it continued,the mccarran ferguson act permits south carolina law,which would invalidate the arbitration clauses in the zip policies,to reverse preempt the convention act.esab group therefore contended that the zip policies did not contain valid arbitration agreements,so they did not fall under the convention.thus,according to esab group,the claims were not removable.
zip,in turn,challenged the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction.zip emphasized its limited contacts with south carolina.a zip representative attested that zip maintains no offices or other facilities in south carolina,owns no property there,is not licensed as an insurer by south carolina,and does not regularly conduct business in the state.although the zip policies extended coverage to esab group,zip argued this was an insufficient basis for personal jurisdiction because the contracts were negotiated,drafted,and executed in sweden by two swedish companies,esab ab and trygg hansa.
the district court rejected both parties contentions.as to the issue of jurisdiction,the district court acknowledged a split amongst our sister circuits concerning the interaction between the convention,the convention act,and the mccarran ferguson act.after considering the relevant precedent,the district court adopted the position of the fifth circuit,articulated in safety national.under this reasoning,it found that the convention,not the convention act,directs courts to enforce international arbitration agreements,and because the mccarran ferguson act text limits its scope to federal statutes,mccarran ferguson could not disrupt the application of traditional preemption rules.
the district court then found that zip had the requisite minimum contacts with the forum to permit the exercise of personal jurisdiction and that the exercise of jurisdiction over zip was otherwise reasonable.after concluding it had jurisdiction over both the subject matter and parties to the action,the district court enforced the arbitration agreements.it referred claims pertaining to the zip policies to arbitration 
because it had referred to arbitration all claims providing a basis for jurisdiction,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.it remanded the claims relating to the zip policies to state court.
esab group timely appealed the district court exercise of jurisdiction.zip filed a,challenging the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction and its authority to remand the nonarbitrable claims to state court.
we first consider whether the federal courts have jurisdiction over the present action or whether,as esab group claims,south carolina law reverse preempts federal law and eliminates the basis for jurisdiction.our review of questions of jurisdiction is de novo.dixon coburg dairy,cir en banc.
esab group asserts that the convention is a treaty,one that requires implementing legislation to be given effect in domestic courts.according to esab group,it follows from this that the convention has legal effect only as incorporated into its implementing legislation here,the convention act.and because the convention act is a federal statute that does not speak directly to insurance,esab contends,it is subject to reverse preemption under the mccarran ferguson act.
two of our sister circuits,the second and the fifth,have examined whether a state law may preempt the convention or convention act pursuant to the mccarran ferguson act and have reached divergent conclusions.
the second circuit visited the issue in stephens american international insurance,cir.citing only the convention act,the stephens court stated,t he convention is not,and therefore,relies upon an act of congress for its implementation.id.at.the court then framed the question as whether the implementing legislation,the convention act,is subject to preemption by state law under the mccarran ferguson act.see id.the convention itself is simply inapplicable in this instance.based on the text of the mccarran ferguson act,the court concluded,without elaboration,that state laws precluding arbitration of disputes with a delinquent insurer reverse preempt the convention act.id.
the second circuit soon called its holding into question,however.in stephens national distillers chemical,cir,the court held that the mccarran ferguson act did not apply to the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,so the fsia could preempt new york insurance law.see id.at.it based this decision,in part,on clear congressional intent for the fsia to preempt all contrary state law.see id.at.although the court noted in a footnote that this reasoning might apply to the convention act,in conflict with its earlier decision,it declined to consider the potential conflict at that time.see id.at.
the fifth circuit,sitting en banc,took up the issue of the interaction between the mccarran ferguson act and the convention in safety national.the majority in that case held that,even assuming the convention was and therefore did not have legal effect in domestic courts absent implementing legislation,reverse preemption did not apply.see safety,at.the majority first reasoned that the mccarran ferguson act applied only to statutes,not treaties.see id.at congress did not intend to include a treaty within the scope of an act of congress when it used those words in the mccarran ferguson act.it then concluded that,despite the presence of implementing legislation,the convention,not the convention act,was being construe d to supersede state law.id.at.and because the mccarran ferguson act did not apply to treaties,that act could not cause state law to the convention.id.at.
judge elrod,joined by two other judges,provided a strident dissent.she too assumed that the treaty was,finding that the parties failed to preserve this issue.see id.at elrod,dissenting.but she observed that,as to treaties,commentators overwhelmingly conclude that under current and longstanding law,it is only the implementing statute,not the treaty,that can be enforced by the courts so as to be capable of preemption.id.at citing sources.and because only the implementing legislation had preemptive effect,it was a statute the convention act that was being construed to supersede state law.see id.at.
the dissent charged that the majority had misconstrued the appropriate inquiry by analyzing whether a treaty was an act of congress for purposes of mccarran ferguson judge elrod agreed it was not.see id.at.she further claimed that the majority had engaged in a play on words in finding that the convention itself was being construed under the mccarran ferguson act to supersede state law.id.at.the convention,as a treaty,was not judicially enforceable,so it lacked the power to preempt or supersede state law.id.at.instead,the dissent argued,the convention act,which incorporated the convention by reference,must be the source of the potentially preemptive federal law to which mccarran ferguson rule might apply.id.the proper question,according to the dissent,was whether the convention act was an act of congress within the meaning of mccarran ferguson,id.at,and the dissenters would have held that it was,id.at.
judge clement concurred in the judgment but rejected the majority analysis.see id.at clement,concurring in the judgment.the dissent,she asserted,had persuasively refute d the majority position that the provisions of a,implemented treaty have full preemptive effect.id.at.judge clement argued that the court should instead have found that article ii of the convention was based on its directive to domestic courts to enforce foreign arbitral agreements.see id.at.although she acknowledged that some factors indicated the convention act was intended as implementing legislation,she believed these were better explained by reading other portions of the convention,particularly article iii,as.see id.at.if article ii was,then the treaty itself preempted state law,and the mccarran ferguson act,applicable only to statutes,could not disrupt the traditional rules of preemption.see id.at.
zip presents numerous arguments in support of its position that the mccarran ferguson act does not authorize reverse preemption in this case.first,we quickly reject zip contention that the south carolina statute is not subject to mccarran ferguson because it is not a law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.the supreme court has instructed that this category of laws is a broad one,encompassing laws that possess the end,intention,or aim of adjusting,managing,or controlling the business of insurance.fabe,at quoting black law dictionary,ed internal quotation marks omitted.we agree with the district court and the south carolina court of appeals that south carolina law,which governs the manner in which disputes regarding coverage are resolved,falls within this category.see heyward,d at cox,at.
the parties also spill significant ink disputing whether article ii of the convention is a treaty provision.chief justice marshall first delineated the distinction between a and treaty in foster neilson,pet,overruled on other grounds by united states percheman,pet.he wrote that,because the constitution establishes that treaties are the supreme law of the land,a court should regard a treaty as equivalent to an act of the legislature,provided that it operates of itself,without the aid of any legislative provision,it is.see also medellin texas,d only i f the treaty contains stipulations which are,that is,require no legislation to make them operative,will they have the force and effect of a legislative enactment.alterations in original quoting whitney robertson.but if the treaty addresses itself to the political,not the judicial department,chief justice marshall directed,it is,and the legislature must execute the contract,before it can become a rule for the court.foster,at.it is that a treaty may contain both and provisions.lidas,united states,cir see also united states postal,cir.
zip asserts that article ii of the convention is and,therefore,should be enforced and given preemptive effect independent of the convention act.there is much to recommend this position.most notably,the starting point of treaty interpretation is the text,medellin,at,and the text of article ii instructs domestic courts to enforce foreign arbitral agreements.the supreme court has signaled that this sort of directive to domestic courts is indicative of a treaty provision.id.at.judge clement,in her safety national concurrence,see at,and the united states,in opposing the petition for certiorari in that case,see brief for united states as amicus curiae at.safety ass of timbermen self insurers fund certain underwriters at lloyd,london,d,wl,adopted the view that the instructive language in article ii rendered it.
but,as judge clement noted,there is an emerging presumption against finding treaties to be.see safety,at.and the legislative history of the convention act indicates that congress viewed the act as implementing legislation,at least as to some of the convention provisions.see exec,at statement of richard kearney referring to the proposed changes to the faa as implementing legislation,reprinted in,same.medellin,furthermore,cited the convention act as an example of implementing legislation.at.although judge clement urged that the convention act served to implement other provisions of the convention particularly article iii,see safety,at,this is hardly clear because nothing in the convention act or legislative history differentiates between article ii and the remainder of the treaty.
moreover,the question of what constitutes a treaty has long confused courts and commentators.see postal,at the question is perhaps one of the most confounding in treaty law.curtis bradley,intent,presumptions,and non self executing treaties,am.int l,b oth the theory behind the doctrine and its mechanics have long befuddled courts and commentators.indeed,scholars and jurists continue to debate the proper means for determining a treaty status.see,igartua united states,cir torruella,concurring in part and dissenting in part urging a predominantly textual approach david sloss,executing foster neilson the two step approach to analyzing self executing treaties,harv.int l carlos manuel vazquez,the four doctrines of self executing treaties,am.int l.
but we need not wade into these murky waters to resolve the question before us.to the contrary,we hold that,even assuming article ii of the convention is,the convention act,as implementing legislation of a treaty,does not fall within the scope of the mccarran ferguson act.instead,as detailed below,supreme court precedent dictates that mccarran ferguson is limited to legislation within the domestic realm,and prior precedent of this court and our sister circuits supports a narrow reading of the act.
our aim in analyzing the mccarran ferguson act,as in all matters of statutory interpretation,is to implement congress intent.united states abdelshafi,cir.we do so by examining the text of the statute,and absent clear congressional intent to the contrary,we will give the statute its plain meaning.see also stephens ex rel.astrue,cir in interpreting the plain language of a statute,we give the terms their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended them to bear some different import.quoting ex rel.cooper.valley,cir.
where a statute touches upon foreign relations and the united states treaty obligations,we must proceed with particular care in undertaking this interpretive task.as the supreme court observed in considering a prior potential conflict between the convention act and a federal statute,i f the united states is to be able to gain the benefits of international accords and have a role as a trusted partner in multilateral endeavors,its courts should be most cautious before interpreting its domestic legislation in such manner as to violate international agreements.vimar seguros y reaseguros,sky reefer,d.we seek,when possible,to construe statute s consistent with our obligations under international law.kofa ins,cir en banc citing murray schooner charming betsy,cranch.
esab group urges that we must construe act of congress,as that term is used in the mccarran ferguson act,to apply to every federal statute,irrespective of the international implications.but the supreme court has recently explained that,in enacting the mccarran ferguson act,congress plainly did not intend the law to apply so broadly.in garamendi,the supreme court specified that mccarran ferguson was directed to implied preemption by domestic commerce legislation.at see also id.as the text itself makes clear,the point of mccarran ferguson legislative choice of leaving insurance regulation generally to the states was to limit congressional preemption under the commerce power,whether dormant or exercised.
although in garamendi the court was examining the interaction between state law and an executive agreement,the court statements regarding congressional intent guide our understanding of congress intent to limit the act scope.specifically,that case demonstrated that congress did not intend for the mccarran ferguson act to permit state law to vitiate international agreements entered by the united states.ftc travelers health ass n,d stating that mccarran ferguson was not intended to permit a state to regulate activities carried on beyond its own borders,cited in garamendi,at.
on several occasions,moreover,courts of appeals have refused to give the mccarran ferguson act the broad scope urged by esab group.for example,we have previously expressed our skepticism that congress intended the mccarran ferguson act to apply to statutes governing federal jurisdiction.gross weingarten,cir.and several of our sister circuits have joined in this view or held that such statutes are not subject to reverse preemption.see safety,at expressing skepticism hawthorne sav.reliance ins.of,cir holding that the diversity jurisdiction statute is not,amended cir martin ins.agency,prudential reinsurance,cir holding that the mccarran ferguson act did not remove diversity jurisdiction from the federal courts in insurance matters grimes crown life ins,cir finding no preemption of diversity jurisdiction statute.
the second circuit has found several substantive statutes outside of mccarran ferguson rule.it first held that the mccarran ferguson act could not permit state law to exempt an insurer from compliance with title vii of the civil rights act of,et.spirt teachers ins.annuity ass n,cir,vacated,remanded to cir.but see murf prof l med.ins,cir questioning spirt holding naacp am.family mut.ins,cir same.it reasoned that title vii broad and explicit provision evinced congressional intent to displace all contrary state laws.spirt,at.
likewise,as noted previously,the second circuit subsequently held that mccarran ferguson rule was inapplicable to the fsia.distillers,at.the origins of the fsia,it declared,were so different from the kind of congressional statutory action that the mccarran ferguson act was enacted to deal with,that they virtually compel led the conclusion that the mccarran ferguson act did not authorize state law to displace the fsia.id.in addition,it concluded that the mccarran ferguson act did not alter the rules of preemption so drastically as to force a federal law that clearly intends to preempt all other state laws to give way simply because the insurance industry is involved.id.at.and it found that the fsia evidenced such an intent id.at.
the convention act,which provides,without exception,that the convention shall be enforced in united states courts,similarly intends to replace all contrary state laws.the supreme court has opined that the convention and convention act demand that courts subordinate domestic notions of arbitrability to the international policy favoring commercial arbitration.mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,d.thus,although the court acknowledges that the convention permits congress to specify categories of claims it wishes to reserve for decision by our own courts,it has decline d to subvert the spirit of the united states accession to the convention by recognizing exceptions where congress has not expressly directed the courts to do so.id.at.
the mccarran ferguson act contains no such express direction indeed,the supreme court has told us that the aim of mccarran ferguson is not arbitration or treaties,but domestic commerce legislation.garamendi,at.we therefore hold that the convention act,as legislation implementing a treaty,is not subject to reverse preemption,so insurance disputes are not exempt from the convention act pursuant to mccarran ferguson rule.
as we have observed,the federal government must be permitted to speak with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments.michelin tire,at.with the convention and convention act,the government has opted to use this voice to articulate a uniform policy in favor of enforcing agreements to arbitrate internationally,even when a contrary result would be forthcoming in a domestic context.mitsubishi motors,at.to allow parochial refusal s to enforce foreign arbitration agreements would frustrate the very purposes for which the convention was drafted achieving the predictable and orderly resolution of disputes essential to any international business transaction and ensuring parties are not haled into hostile or inappropriate forums.scherk alberto culver,d see also mitsubishi motors,at.
congress might opt to exclude insurance disputes from the convention.but it has not done so with the mccarran ferguson act.nothing in mccarran ferguson suggests that,by enacting that statute,congress intended to delegate to the states the authority to abrogate international agreements that this country has entered into and rendered judicially enforceable.we will not read it to do so.
because the supreme court has made clear that mccarran ferguson is limited to domestic affairs,we hold the convention act falls outside of its scope hence,we affirm the district court exercise of jurisdiction.
in addition,as the zip policies contain valid arbitration clauses subject to the convention and convention act,we find the district court properly compelled arbitration in sweden of esab group claims under these policies.
having established that the district court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action,we now consider the issues presented by zip.
zip avers that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over it.it notes that it maintains no office,employees,or a
