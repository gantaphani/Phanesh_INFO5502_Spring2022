miguel angel torres de la cruz torres,a native and citizen of mexico,was admitted into the united states as a lawful permanent resident on october.after an august,state court conviction in utah for possession of a controlled substance cocaine,the and naturalization service ins initiated removal proceedings against him in december.he was found to have committed a removable offense and ordered removed.
in this appeal,torres asserts four claims his state conviction is not a controlled substance offense under the recent holding in salinas united states,d,and thus does not constitute a removable offense his state misdemeanor conviction for possession can not constitute an aggravated felony within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act ina the immigration court interpretation of d,the rule,violates his right to due process and equal protection and his removal proceedings violate the vienna convention and an ins regulation on consular notification rights.
lacking jurisdiction over torres first two claims,we dismiss them.while retaining jurisdiction over his remaining two claims,we find they lack merit,deny the petition for review,and affirm the order of removal.
background and procedural history 
this case began in december of when the ins charged that torres was removable for committing an aggravated felony under a a iii,and a controlled substance violation under a b i,based on his utah state guilty plea to simple possession of cocaine in august of.during his removal hearings,the ins dropped the aggravated felony count as a basis for removal.on february,an immigration judge ij found that torres had a controlled substance conviction and was removable under a b i,determined that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal,and ordered him removed to mexico.on appeal,the board of immigration appeals bia considered torres challenges to the ij decision and found them to be without merit in an order dated august.
on september,a utah sentencing court modified torres conviction from a felony to a misdemeanor.based on the state court action,on september,torres filed a motion to reopen the proceedings with the bia to challenge his removability.the bia denied the motion as without merit on february.
because he was in custody,torres filed a habeas action in district court for the district of colorado on august.while the habeas petition was initiated prior to the bia denial of his motion to reopen,torres later amended his petition to include the arguments presented before the bia in his motion to reopen.the case was later held in abeyance pending the supreme court decision in ins cyr,d.
in january,the case was transferred to this court and converted to a petition for review pursuant to the real id act of,div.b,a,c,stat.
ii.jurisdiction 
before addressing torres claims,our threshold inquiry is whether we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.congress has provided an avenue for direct review of final orders of removal through petitions for review in courts of appeals.a comfort,cir.indeed,petitions for review filed with the court of appeals are the sole and exclusive means of review of most administrative orders of removal.ferry gonzales,cir internal quotation omitted.
although torres failed to file a petition for review within thirty days of either of the bia final orders of removal as required by b,the real id act cures this defect.torres appeal is premised on his habeas petition filed in the district court under.the real id act directs that habeas petitions challenging a final order of removal,and which were pending in the district courts before the effective date of the real id act,like torres,are to be transferred to the appropriate court of appeals as a petition for review under notwithstanding the failure to comply with b requirement,div.b at c,stat.at the court of appeals shall treat the transferred case as if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review under such section,except that subsection b the deadline of such section shall not apply.see schmitt maurer,cir.
here,the bia ordered torres removed on august.torres then timely filed his habeas petition challenging that final order of removal in the district court on august.the district court later granted his motion to amend the habeas petition to include arguments considered by the bia in its denial of the motion to reopen on november.these arguments therefore fall within the language of the transfer provision the habeas petition is therefore considered a petition for review over both bia decisions and our jurisdiction is found under.see schmitt.
notwithstanding the foregoing,we only retain jurisdiction over claims challenging a final order of removal if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available as of right.d.we have recognized that n eglecting to take an appeal to the bia constitutes a failure to exhaust administrative remedies as to any issue that could have been raised,negating the jurisdiction necessary for subsequent judicial review.soberanes comfort,cir.accordingly,we have jurisdiction only over those claims that were presented to the bia and were properly appealed to this court through torres habeas petition.
under this framework,we are deprived of jurisdiction over torres first two claims.
controlled substance offense 
torres first claim challenges whether his drug possession conviction is a removable offense after salinas,d.salinas holds that a conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance is not a controlled substance offense for purposes of the united states sentencing guidelines because the guidelines expressly define the offense to require a trafficking element.at.considering that salinas was decided more than five years after his agency proceedings were completed,torres obviously could not have invoked salinas in the first instance before the bia.
in his motion to reopen,however,torres generally charged that the reclassification of his state conviction as a misdemeanor renders the offense incapable of serving as a basis of removal under a b i.he argued that the offense fell under the functional equivalent of the federal first offender act and that the offense is not a deportable offense.at.nevertheless,where a specific issue was not addressed in administrative proceedings in the manner it is now addressed before us,general statements in the notice of appeal to the bia are insufficient to constitute exhaustion of administrative remedies.see ramani ashcroft,cir.accordingly,torres broad assertions in his motion to reopen are not sufficient to exhaust the issue.torres did not ask the bia to consider,nor did the bia analyze,whether the conviction for a controlled substance offense in the removal context is analogous to the sentencing guidelines definition requiring a trafficking element.
torres failure to exhaust this issue precludes our jurisdiction and we dismiss the claim without reaching the merits.
aggravated felony 
torres second argument is that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony,thereby preserving his eligibility for cancellation of removal under a.the record makes clear that this issue was never presented to the bia,which divests us of jurisdiction.
torres other claims 
since they were presented to the bia,torres final two claims survive the procedural bar of exhaustion.nevertheless,they must still withstand other limits to our subject matter jurisdiction.congress has eliminated judicial review of bia discretionary decisions,a b,as well as any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed certain offenses,among them controlled substance offenses,a c.
these broad provisions are subject to two exceptions.first,as an article iii court,we have inherent jurisdiction to determine whether the jurisdictional bar applies.we may therefore decide whether the petitioner is i an alien ii deportable iii by reason of a criminal offense listed in the statute.latu ashcroft,cir internal citations omitted.accordingly,we have jurisdiction to review torres arguments challenging the bia order of removal on the basis that his plea and conviction do not constitute an offense warranting removal.see ballesteros ashcroft,cir.
the second exception is statutory,coming from the real id act.congress added a new section making clear that n othing in a b or c,or in any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.a d.consequently,we are not barred by a b or c from reviewing torres claims that raise either constitutional or legal questions.see ballesteros,at.
we find torres final two claims sufficiently raise legal or constitutional questions to confer jurisdiction to consider their merits.torres due process and equal protection challenges to the rule patently present a constitutional question.his final argument based on consular notification rights also raises a question of law under a d because it involves legal issues in interpreting a treaty 
iii.analysis 
we review the legal and constitutional questions de novo.ferry gonzales,cir.we now address torres final two claims.
a.the rule and cancellation of removal 
torres launches a constitutional attack on the denial of his eligibility for cancellation of removal under a.under a,cancellation of removal is a discretionary form of relief that allows the attorney general to cancel the removal order of a removable alien.to qualify for cancellation of removal,an alien must satisfy three elements the alien must have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than five years,a the alien must have resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,id.a and the alien may not have been convicted of any aggravated felony,id.a.
torres gained lawful permanent residence on october,and so putatively satisfies the requirement of a.nevertheless,under the rule,the ij found torres ineligible for cancellation of removal under a.the rule,as provided for in d,is a methodology to calculate an alien continuous physical presence or residence in the united states and thus determines whether an alien has been here long enough to be eligible for cancellation of removal under a.
under the rule,time will stop accruing when the alien was served with a notice to appear,or when the alien committed certain removable offenses.id.d.torres arrived in the united states on october,and his removable offense occurred on august.the ij held that the clock stopped ticking about a month and a half,two months short of the milestone of a and so denied him eligibility for cancellation.at.
torres argues that the rule as applied to him lacks a rational basis and thus violates constitutional due process and equal protection principles.we find torres constitutional arguments unpersuasive because he has no protected liberty interest in the cancellation of his removal order and the challenged statutory provisions easily withstand rational basis review.
first,torres alleges that his due process rights were violated because no rational basis exists for the rule for a continuous presence requirement when no such rule exists for a requirement.the rule does not extend to a because that provision language refers only to lawful admission as a permanent resident,while the rule applies only to continuous residence or continuous physical presence.see a,d see also gonzales,cir.although unclear from the briefs,we construe this argument to encompass both substantive and procedural due process claims.second,torres contends that an equal protection violation occurs when a application to aliens of any status impermissibly creates disparate treatment of violation and aliens.we disagree with both contentions.
procedural due process 
before passage of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,suspension of deportation,as a purely discretionary form of relief,did not give rise to a liberty or property interest protected by the due process clause.united states,cir examining the case law in several circuits,vacated,united states,cir en banc.nevertheless,when facing deportation aliens are entitled to procedural due process,which provides an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.id.at.
torres claims are governed by the iirira nevertheless,the same point of law applies.while the cancellation of removal is not a liberty or property interest,aliens challenging eligibility for the cancellation of removal are entitled to an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.id.torres received the process that was due,as evidenced by the ij colloquy with torres counsel regarding the cancellation of removal and he was entitled to no more.
equal protection substantive due process 
in disposing of torres equal protection and substantive due process claims,we hold that the rule is rationally grounded.see appiah ins,cir applying rational basis review to substantive due process and equal protection challenges to rule.with the rule,congress intended to prevent aliens from continuing to accumulate time toward the continuous residency requirement after ins had issued an order to show cause to an alien.sibanda ins,cir.by mandating the rule,congress also removed an alien incentive for prolonging removal hearings in order to become eligible for cancellation of removal.appiah,at.these purposes are valid governmental objectives.
torres argues that the statutory scheme is irrational because the rule applies only to a seven years of continuous residence and not to a five years from lawful admission and so the incentive to prolong removal proceedings persists.we do not follow this logic.an alien must satisfy all three requirements of a to be eligible for cancellation.if a can not be satisfied,then the alien is ineligible for cancellation of removal notwithstanding the alien compliance with a other provisions.if an alien is short of the seven years required under a,he is ineligible for cancellation of removal and so it does not matter that the alien time counted toward permanent residency still accrues under a.accordingly,prolonging the removal proceedings will be unavailing.
torres also complains that the rule lacks a rational basis because it denies cancellation to lawfully admitted aliens who have not been continuously present in the country for seven years,while granting eligibility for aliens who may have been in the country unlawfully and subsequently gained legal permanent residence but have nonetheless been in the country for the requisite seven years.
we disagree that these classifications fail rational basis review.section a provides that aliens eligible for cancellation must have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence for at least five years.congress may have determined that after five years of lawful residence and seven years of physical presence in the country,aliens should be eligible for cancellation of removal regardless of their prior unlawful presence in the country.while the policy objective may not be perfectly advanced by these provisions,only a reasonable relationship to the objective and the chosen means need be shown.
the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized that over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of congress more complete than it is over the admission of aliens,and it has long recognized the power to expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the government political departments is largely immune from judicial control.thus,in determining whether a rational basis exists for making distinctions between classes of aliens,we are especially deferential.
latu,at internal quotations omitted.if congress chooses to treat aliens who were formerly present illegally but legalized their status more favorably than those who commit drug crimes,it is not our role to the governmental objective.
since we find no constitutional infirmity with a and the rule,we need not address torres arguments about alternate interpretations of the rule.
consular notification 
torres final argument concerns the ins failure to apprise him that he was entitled to communicate with mexican consular or diplomatic officers under the v
