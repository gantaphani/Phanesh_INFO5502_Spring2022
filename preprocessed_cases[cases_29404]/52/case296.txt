under the south pacific tuna treaty sptt,a limited number of licenses to fish the waters of the pacific island nations are available to vessels under the control and command of citizens.moore company,moore,a law firm,commenced this false claims act fca action against korean nationals and llcs formed by them,alleging that the llcs acquired two of these sptt licenses by fraudulently certifying to the government that they were controlled by citizens and that their fishing vessels were commanded by captains.moore first learned of this alleged fraud through discovery in a wrongful death action that it litigated in federal court against two of the defendants in this case.the issue before us is whether the district court,in dismissing moore action,properly interpreted the fca public disclosure bar and its original source exception,particularly the amendments to these provisions.
the fca empowers a person,or relator,to sue on behalf of the united states those who defraud the government,and to share in any ultimate recovery but the fca public disclosure bar forecloses a relator action when the alleged fraud has been publicly disclosed in at least one of several enumerated sources unless the relator is an original source of certain information underlying the action.
in,congress amended the public disclosure bar as part of the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca.in doing so,it removed the language that explicitly stated that a court was deprived of jurisdiction over the fca action if the bar applied to that action reduced the number of enumerated public disclosure sources and expanded the definition of original source by allowing a relator who materially adds to the publicly disclosed information to qualify.
each of these three changes is implicated in this case,as moore argues that the district court erred by construing the amended bar as a jurisdictional limitation,so that it improperly dismissed the action under rule b rather than rule b ruling that the allegations or transactions of the alleged fraud were publicly disclosed and concluding that moore was not an original source.we agree that the public disclosure bar is no longer jurisdictional and that the motion therefore should have been decided under rule b rather than rule b.we further conclude that the alleged fraud was publicly disclosed,but that moore was nevertheless an original source of information underlying the action.
at issue on appeal is not whether moore has alleged an actionable fraud rather,what is contested is whether the alleged fraud was disclosed through any of the qualifying public disclosure sources,and if so,whether moore has materially added to those public disclosures by contributing details of the alleged fraud that it independently uncovered through discovery in the wrongful death action in federal court.the answers to these questions turn on how we apply the public disclosure bar as amended by the ppaca.we will begin with a discussion of the significance of the bar new provisions.
i.the amendments to the fca public disclosure bar 
the fca is a relic of the civil war,but its public disclosure bar was engrafted on the act more recently.the original fca did not require a relator to possess firsthand knowledge of a previously unknown fraud.as a result,in the early,some enterprising individuals filed fca actions based not on their own independent knowledge of a fraud but on information revealed in the government criminal indictments,at.to counteract these parasitic lawsuits,congress added a provision in that denied jurisdiction over fca actions that were based upon evidence or information in the possession of the united states,or any agency,officer or employee thereof,at the time such suit was brought.c.but this government knowledge defense did not just eradicate the parasitic lawsuits it eliminated most fca lawsuits,for courts strictly interpreted c as barring fca actions even when the government knew of the fraud only because the relator had reported it.see united states ex rel.findley fpc boron employees club,b y restricting qui tam suits by individuals who brought fraudulent activity to the government attention,congress had killed the goose that laid the golden egg and eliminated the financial incentive to expose fraud against the government.
against this backdrop,congress amended the fca in,replacing the government knowledge defense with the less restrictive public disclosure bar.this bar precluded a relator from bringing an action that was based on allegations or transactions of fraud that had been publicly disclosed in certain enumerated sources,but added an exception if the relator was an original source of the information underlying the action 
a no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in i a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,ii in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or iii from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
e a.an original source was defined as an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.id.e b.
although the original public disclosure bar was less restrictive than the government knowledge defense,it was by no means a low bar for relators to clear.indeed,given its broad language,as well as different courts varying interpretations of that language,relators faced a formidable hurdle.
in,congress amended the bar as part of the ppaca so that it now reads as follows 
a the court shall dismiss an action or claim under this section,unless opposed by the government,if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed 
i in a federal criminal,civil,or administrative hearing in which the government or its agent is a party 
ii in a congressional,government accountability office,or other federal report,hearing,audit or investigation or 
iii from the news media,
unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
b for purposes of this paragraph,original source means an individual who either i prior to a public disclosure under subsection e a,has voluntarily disclosed to the government the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based,or who has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions,and who has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section.
e a,b emphases added.
the italicized language has radically changed the hurdle for relators.first,the bar preliminary language no longer explicitly states that a court is deprived of jurisdiction over the fca action if the bar applies.compare e a no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section,with id.e a the court shall dismiss an action or claim under this section,unless opposed by the government.second,information that was disclosed in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing now qualifies as a public disclosure only if the information was disclosed in a federal case to which the government was a party.compare e a listing a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing as a public disclosure source,with id.e a i listing a federal criminal,civil,or administrative hearing in which the government or its agent is a party as a public disclosure source.as a result,information that was disclosed in a federal case between private parties no longer constitutes publicly disclosed information.
lastly,congress expanded the definition of original source in e b.the salient question is no longer whether the relator has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations in the complaint are based.e b.rather,original source status now turns on whether the relator has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions.id.e b.significantly,a relator no longer must possess direct knowledge of the fraud to qualify as an original source.see united states ex rel.stinson,lyons,gerlin bustamante,prudential ins,cir holding under the bar that a relator lacked direct knowledge because it had learned of the fraud through two intermediaries,one of which was the discovery procedure by which the memoranda exposing the alleged fraud were produced.the focus now is on what independent knowledge the relator has added to what was publicly disclosed.
in short,with its amendments,congress overhauled the public disclosure bar.although no direct legislative history seems to exist,the textual changes alone evince congress intent to lower the bar for relators,at least as to some of its components.with these changes in mind,we turn to the issues presented in this case 
ii.nonjurisdictional character of the amended public disclosure bar 
we first address moore contention that,by virtue of congress change to the bar preliminary language,the district court should have decided the case under rule b for failure to state a claim rather than under rule b for lack of jurisdiction while the bar stated that n o court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in certain enumerated sources,e a,the bar states that t he court shall dismiss an action or claim under this section,unless opposed by the government,if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed in certain enumerated sources,id.e a.with little analysis,the district court declared that this amended provision,like its predecessor,presented a jurisdictional bar.we disagree and join the other circuits that have ruled that the amended version does not set forth a jurisdictional bar.see united states ex rel.osheroff humana,cir we conclude that the amended e creates grounds for dismissal for failure to state a claim rather than for lack of jurisdiction.united states ex rel.may purdue pharma,cir it is apparent that the bar is no longer jurisdictional.
as our sister circuits have reasoned,first,the amended bar makes no mention of jurisdiction,and unless congress has clearly state d that the statutory limitation is jurisdictional,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.sebelius auburn reg l med,d quoting arbaugh y h,d.second,in amending the bar,congress removed the jurisdictional language that prohibited a court from entertaining the suit if the public disclosure bar applied.see brewster gage.the deliberate selection of language so differing from that used in the earlier acts indicates that a change of law was intended.third,congress left undisturbed similar jurisdictional language in neighboring provisions.see,e no court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought by a former or present member of the armed services under subsection b of this section against a member of the armed forces arising out of such person service in the armed forces.finally,if a court holds that a relator claim is publically disclosed,the amended bar nonetheless permits the government to oppose the court dismissal of the action,an option that effectively dispels any notion that the bar is still jurisdictional.see gonzalez thaler,d jurisdiction can never be waived or forfeited.
for these reasons,we conclude that the amended bar is not jurisdictional.accordingly,the district court should have decided the defendants motion to dismiss on public disclosure grounds under rule b,not rule b.
iii.public disclosure 
we next address whether the fraud alleged by moore was publicly disclosed.moore brought this fca action against majestic blue fisheries,llc pacific breeze fisheries,llc and joyce jungmi kim,alleging they defrauded the government in that,in order to procure the sptt fishing licenses,the llcs fraudulently certified to the coast guard that they were controlled by citizens and that their eponymous fishing vessels majestic blue and pacific breeze were commanded by captains according to moore,the llcs,in fact,were controlled by dongwon industries,a south korean tuna company,and their vessels,majestic blue and pacific breeze,were commanded by korean fishing masters who worked for dongwon 
we must decide whether substantially the same allegations or transactions of fraud as alleged in moore action or claim were publicly disclosed in any of the enumerated public disclosure sources.e a.we first consider whether the sources on which the defendants rely in arguing that the alleged fraud was publicly disclosed qualify as public disclosure sources under e a.we next determine whether substantially the same allegations or transactions of fraud alleged by moore were publicly disclosed through these qualifying sources.id.
as stated earlier,to be publicly disclosed,the alleged fraud must have been revealed through at least one of three sources a federal criminal,civil,or administrative hearing in which the government or its agent is a party a congressional,government accountability office,or other federal report,hearing,audit,or investigation or news media.id.e a i iii.here,the defendants argue,as they did in the district court,that the alleged fraud was publicly disclosed in news media and federal report s.
as news media,the defendants proffered a mixture of two internet news articles,a podcast,and a blog,but the district court concluded that only the two news articles qualified.the first article,flogging and mutiny in the century,proudly waving the stars and stripes,which was posted,describes the experience of doug pine,an american who had served as a captain of the majestic blue maritime accident article.app.the second,coast guard probes island mariner account of fiasco at sea,which was posted,also describes pine experience aboard the majestic blue vashon beachcomber article.app.moore concedes that these two articles qualify as news media.
the district court also decided that certain information that moore had obtained through freedom of information act foia requests constituted federal report s.this information included the llcs allegedly fraudulent certifications to the coast guard that they were controlled by citizens and that their vessels,majestic blue and pacific breeze,were commanded by captains,as well as certain emails sent by a man named hwang of dongwon industries.app.
in deciding that these foia documents constituted federal reports,the district court relied on schindler elevator united states ex rel.kirk,d.there,the court analyzed whether foia documents constitute report s under the bar and decided that a written agency response to a foia request falls within the ordinary meaning of report,and that a ny records the agency produces along with its written foia response are part of that response.id.at.the district court concluded that schindler interpretation of report in the bar applied with equal force to the bar because a report is also a public disclosure source in the bar.compare e a listing a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report as a public disclosure source emphasis added,with id.e a ii listing a congressional,government accountability office,or other federal report as a public disclosure source emphasis added.
while moore recognizes that a government report is also a public disclosure source in the bar,it contends that the court interpretation of that word in schindler does not apply to the bar because the bar is a much different statute.moore br.it further urges us to follow the guiding philosophy behind the amendments to the public disclosure bar,which,it asserts,is that the bar applies only when federal officials are likely to see the public disclosures.id.
we reject moore argument.the ppaca did not alter the bar in any way that would render schindler interpretation of report inapplicable to the foia documents under consideration here.moreover,even before schindler was decided,many courts,including our own,had similarly interpreted report in the bar.see,united states ex rel.mistick pbt housing auth.of pittsburgh,cir concluding that foia documents fell within the ordinary meaning of the term report united states ex rel.grynberg praxair,cir it is generally accepted that a response to a request under the foia is a public disclosure.when congress overhauled the bar in,it could have reacted to these cases by excluding foia documents as report s.merck,reynolds,d we normally assume that,when congress enacts statutes,it is aware of relevant judicial precedent.but it did not it left report largely unaltered as a public disclosure source congress thus did not amend this source in any way that would cast doubt on the view held by many courts that a report includes foia documents,a view later confirmed by the court in schindler.
in addition,moore guiding philosophy argument rings hollow when we consider that e a includes many documents that the government will likely never see.for example,news media is a source that include s a large number of local newspapers and radio stations and therefore likely describes a multitude of sources that would seldom come to the attention of the attorney general.graham cty.soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,d.
we next consider whether substantially the same allegations or transactions of fraud alleged by moore were publicly disclosed via the two news articles and the foia documents.an allegation of fraud is an explicit accusation of wrongdoing.a transaction warranting an inference of fraud is one that is composed of a misrepresented state of facts plus the actual state of facts.united states ex rel.zizic,llc,cir.formulaically this appears as follows x misrepresented state of facts y true state of facts z fraud.united states ex rel.dunleavy cty.of,cir.a defendant must therefore show that substantially the same allegation of fraud z or transaction of fraud x y was publicly disclosed through the sources enumerated in e a.
here,moore allegation of fraud z is that the defendants fraudulently procured certificates of documentation from the coast guard so that they could obtain the sptt fishing licenses.as for the transaction of that fraud,it alleges that the defendants certified to the coast guard that citizens controlled the llcs and commanded their vessels the mispresented state of facts,or x when in fact dongwon both controlled the llcs and commanded their vessels the true state of facts,or y.the defendants have shown that substantially this same transaction was publicly disclosed.
in the applications for certificates of documentation that the llcs filed with the coast guard and that were obtained by moore through foia requests,majestic blue llc and pacific breeze llc certified that do not have authority within a management group,whether through veto power,combined voting,or otherwise,to exercise control over the llc s,and that their eponymous fishing vessels will at all times remain under the command of a citizen.app.
however,the two news articles indicate that majestic blue llc is not controlled by citizens,nor is its vessel commanded by a captain.the vashon beachcomber article describes how doug pine accepted a position on the majestic blue as captain of the ship,states that the majestic blue is operated by a korean company,and even names that company as korea dongwon corporation.app.the maritime accident article reveals how the korean fishing master,not captain pine,commanded the vessel 
when the majestic blue was registered in the us,the korean captain became the fishmaster and captain pine joined as captain.it was an uncomfortable relationship.
pine found it difficult to exercise his authority almost from the moment he first boarded the vessel the first day i was aboard i asked for the crew list.it was ordered by rank.i was number two,the fishmaster was number.the second officer refused a direct order to change it.the korean officers refused to obey any routine command activity.
in fact,pine was supposed to simply be a paper captain to meet the requirements of the flag and to accept the authority of the fishmaster,the former captain.pine was unable to manoeuver the vessel or use the navigation equipment on the bridge.
less apparent,though still publicly disclosed,is the true state of facts the y for pacific breeze llc and its vessel,revealed through emails sent by hwang of dongwon industries and obtained by moore via foia requests.notably,these emails also support the true state of facts for majestic blue llc and its vessel.in one email,hwang informs the recipient that he is from dongwon industries and is in charge of care for majestic blue pacific breeze.app.he writes that he has received a message from the llcs general manager and that he is worried about the looming expiration of the vessels sptt licenses.in a second email,addressed to the llcs general manager,he states that w e dongwon are studying the possibility of our flagged fishing vessel sic operation in atlantic ocean.app.relying on these emails,moore itself alleges in its complaint that c learly,dongwon,rather than any citizen,maintained operational control over the llcs and made all major decisions for majestic blue and pacific breeze.app.it further contends that b y dongwon own admission,the vessels are part of dongwon us flagged fishing vessel operation and were not really owned or controlled by citizens despite defendants contrary certifications to the government.app.
in sum,we have little difficulty concluding that the transaction setting forth the alleged fraud was publicly disclosed via the two news articles and the foia documents.
iv.original source 
moore can nonetheless clear the bar if it qualifies as an original source.the bar defines an original source as one who has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions.e b.in support of its case for original source status,moore relies on information that it obtained from discovery in a federal civil case.in june,the majestic blue sank in the south pacific,resulting in the death of its captain,david hill.moore represented hill wife in a wrongful death action in federal court against majestic blue llc and dongwon.in discovery in that litigation,moore obtained documents and deposed individuals including hwang,and joyce kim and jayne kim,the llcs sole shareholders.from this discovery,moore not only first learned of the alleged fraud but also uncovered details as to how it unfolded.moore argues,as it must,that this information that it obtained in the wrongful death action is independent of,and materially adds to,the publicly disclosed transaction of fraud.we agree.
independent of 
the district court held that moore was not an original source because the information that it had obtained through discovery in the wrongful death action did not constitute independent knowledge.in doing so,it analyzed moore knowledge according to our jurisprudence under the bar whereby we had required that a relator knowledge must be independent not just from information that qualified as a public disclosure under e a,but also from information readily available in the public domain.see united states ex rel.atkinson.shipbuilding,cir stating that while reliance solely on public disclosures under e a is always insufficient under e b to confer original source status,reliance on public information that does not qualify as a public disclosure under e a may also preclude original source status depending on the availability of the information and the amount of labor and deduction required to construct the claim citation and quotation marks omitted.informed by this interpretation,the district court concluded that moore knowledge was not independent because the information obtained in the civil litigation was in the public domain and not obscure.app.
although the district court was correct in interpreting our jurisprudence,it erred in concluding that this interpretation of independent knowledge should also apply to the bar.as noted earlier,the bar defined an original source as an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the complaint all
