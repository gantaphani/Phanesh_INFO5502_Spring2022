mohamed rashed moved the district court to dismiss six of the nine counts of an indictment charging him with terrorism.he claimed that under the double jeopardy clause his prior prosecution in greece for related offenses foreclosed a prosecution in the united states.rashed recognized that the dual sovereignty doctrine normally renders the double jeopardy bar inapplicable in cases of prosecutions by different sovereigns.but he invoked an exception overriding the dual sovereignty doctrine when one sovereign prosecution is a sham for prosecution by the other.see bartkus illinois,d.the district court denied the motion.united states rashed,d.
we affirm.in no reasonable sense of the word was greece prosecution of rashed a sham.far from being controlled by the united states,the greek trial occurred only because greece rejected demands for rashed extradition,yet was subject to the requirement of article of the montreal convention to prosecute rashed itself if it failed to extradite him.convention on suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of civil aviation,montreal convention.
rashed is charged with participating in various bombing enterprises around the world in violation of law.the charges include placing a bomb on an august,pan am flight from tokyo to honolulu,killing one and wounding passengers.rashed is also charged with conspiring in the same month to place a bomb on a pan am aircraft in rio de janeiro,a bomb that luckily was discovered and removed safely.the counts of the indictment at issue here,and,all relate to the bomb on the flight.
at the request of the united states,greek authorities detained an individual bearing a passport in the name of mohammed hamdan on may.the individual was in fact rashed,who here the expense of his notion that greece is a the united states did not tell greece of hamdan true identity for fear that otherwise greece would have apprehended him.after verifying rashed capture,the united states requested his extradition under its bilateral extradition treaty with greece.treaty of extradition between the united states and the hellenic republic,may,stat,as further interpreted by the protocol,stat.in may the greek supreme court ruled that rashed could be extradited on some but not all counts of the indictment.decision,greek supreme court,sixth penal section may.but the greek government delayed handing rashed over to the united states and officially rejected the united states extradition request in september.instead greece chose to pursue article alternative course,that of prosecuting rashed itself.montreal convention,at.
a greek court found rashed guilty of intentional homicide and placement of explosive devices in an aircraft,but acquitted him of charges of illegal seizure of an aircraft and instigation of damage to aircraft.although sentenced to years in prison,he was released on december,after serving eight and a half years.in the course of his travels away from greece he was taken into custody and arrested by the fbi.
in denying rashed motion to dismiss,the district court not only rejected rashed sham prosecution theory but also concluded that none of the charges satisfied the blockburger test for determining when crimes stated in two charges constitute the same offense.rashed,d at see blockburger united states.we affirm,but because we reject the sham prosecution theory we have no need to address the blockburger issue.
the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment provides that n o person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life and limb.the clause forecloses multiple prosecutions for the same offense by the same sovereign,but not ones by different sovereigns.heath alabama,d successive prosecutions united states wheeler,d successive navajo tribal prosecutions abbate united states,d successive prosecutions united states rezaq,successive prosecutions.the exception for dual sovereignty flows from the understanding that every sovereign has the authority to punish infractions of its own laws.wheeler,at.
in bartkus people of state of illinois,d,however,the supreme court implicitly suggested an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine.illinois had brought a robbery charge against a man who had been acquitted of the same charge in federal court.the court upheld the state prosecution,but emphasized that the evidence failed to show that illinois,in bringing its suit,had been merely a tool of the federal authorities or that its prosecution had been a sham and a cover for a federal prosecution.id.at.a number of circuits have accordingly inferred a sham prosecution exception to dual sovereignty.see,for example,united states raymer,cir united states bernhardt,cir.united states balsys,d,may indicate further support for such an exception.there the court held that while fear of prosecution in a foreign country normally does not provide a basis for asserting the fifth amendment right against in a judicial proceeding in the united states,a different result might be appropriate if the foreign nation brought its prosecution as much on behalf of the united states as of the prosecuting nation itself.id.at.
several courts have stressed that the bartkus exception is a narrow one and difficult to prove.united states guzman,cir narrow exception united states aboumoussallem,cir same united states,cir difficult to prove.others have questioned whether the exception even exists.united states brocksmith,cir united states patterson,cir.we have uncovered no case where a court found successive prosecutions by different nations to fall under the bartkus exception,though defendants have tried the theory in at least four cases.see guzman,at united states,cir united states mcrary,cir united states richardson,cir.the government suggests that we should hold the exception inapplicable to foreign prosecutions.it reasons foreign governments are never subject to the sort of federal domination that states may be,so that the sham relationship is much less probable in the international context.improbability may imply rarity,but we do not think the sham relationship so unlikely as to justify a blanket rule against the exception in the foreign prosecution context.
as a preliminary matter,we are not persuaded by rashed suggestion that the united states may have been in privity with greece in that government prosecution,and that this privity argues for finding the sham exception applicable.rashed makes no collateral estoppel claim per se,identifying no issue that was resolved in his favor in the greek litigation.in general,a party is in privity with another if it assume d control over litigation by the other.montana united states,d.see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at.wright,miller cooper suggest that control is enough if the nonparty has the actual measure of control or opportunity to control that might reasonably be expected between two formal coparties.id.at,citing jones craig,cir.courts have occasionally hinted that privity as ordinarily conceived might justify application of collateral estoppel in the dual sovereignty context,but,finding privity requirements unmet,have not reached the issue.see united states davis,cir.united states parcel land at bell rock road,cir breyer.because double jeopardy is a constitutionalized instance of preclusion principles,ashe swenson,d,a privity or control test represents an obvious candidate as the standard for an exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine.
yet in bartkus the court used the terms sham and tool,which have uniformly been understood by the lower federal courts to far more special relationship than is suggested by the concept of privity or control,namely a relationship with a strong element of manipulation.see united states liddy,reading bartkus as support for the proposition that federal authorities are proscribed from manipulating state processes to accomplish that which they can not constitutionally do themselves guzman,at emphasizing that the bartkus exception is limited to situations in which one sovereign thoroughly dominates or manipulates the prosecutorial machinery of another.an easy case,for example,migh
