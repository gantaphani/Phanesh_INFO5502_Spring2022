factual background 
the parties stipulated to the following facts air china is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the prc and is engaged exclusively in international air transportation serving various cities throughout the world including san francisco.air china operates aircraft out of the airport and leases space there that it uses exclusively for its air transportation operations.
the united states and the prc are parties to a tax treaty agreement between the government of the united states of america and the people republic of china with respect to mutual exemptions from taxation of transportation income of shipping and air transport enterprises tax treaty.the tax treaty exempts both the united states and the prc from taxation by the other party for income and profits generated from the operation of aircraft in international air transportation.
air china leases space from the airport and makes payments for the use of the premises.air china also pays landing fees for the right to land at the airport.since,the county has imposed property taxes including possessory interest taxes on air china leasehold improvements,and landing rights at the airport.air china has paid these taxes under protest.
on october,the california state board of equalization board issued a letter opinion in response to an inquiry by air china concerning the tax treaty tax exemption.the board concluded that the county imposition of any property tax on air china aircraft or other property including possessory interests was prohibited by the tax treaty.

b.the county has the right to tax air china possessory interests 
the county has the right to assess taxes on property within its jurisdiction.cal,art.xiii,see also all property within the state is subject to taxation if not exempt under federal law or other state law.pursuant to section,the county may tax possessory interests in land or improvements if certain conditions are met.a possessory interest is a p ossession of,claim to,or right to the possession of land or improvements,except when coupled with ownership of the land or improvements in the same person,subd.a.in order for a possessory tax to be valid,the right of possession in the property must be independent,durable,and exclusive of rights held by others in the property.united air lines,county of san diego th,fn,d freeman county of fresno d.t axation of possessory interests is rooted in the belief that the holder of a valuable use of public property that is tax exempt should contribute taxes to the public entity which makes its possession possible and provides a certain amount of exclusivity.citations.korean air lines,county of los angeles th,d korean air lines,quoting city of san jose carlson th,d.
here,the county assesses a property tax based on air china possessory interests in the occupancy and use of the airport international space and facilities.the tax is based upon the value of rent air china pays over the term of the lease.in determining the tax,the county gives no consideration to air china earnings or profits.likewise,there is no consideration given to air china income in assessing the tax for its possessory interests in the landing rights at the airport.this assessment is based on the value of air china right to use the airfield runways,taxiways,and appurtenant aircraft accessible facilities.the value of the landing rights is prescribed by statute in section and is calculated using air china prior year annual aircraft landed weights,of the applicable airport landing fee rate,and the anticipated term and expense rate specified in the statute.
in korean air lines,the court addressed the propriety of a county imposition of a similar tax on a foreign airline possessory interest in common airport terminal facilities.korean air lines,supra,th at,d.the court determined that korean air use of the federal inspection service area at the airport met the independent,exclusive and durable criteria to constitute a taxable possessory interest under section,subdivision a.just as the shared use of property with others does not defeat the exclusivity requirement for taxability,but merely affects valuation of the taxable interest citation,similarly the shared control of property with government does not defeat the independence requirement,but merely affects the valuation of the taxable interest.korean air lines,at,d.the court concluded that the durability requirement was also met because korean air had the right to use the facilities pursuant to a lease for the period from through the date of its assessment appeal,a period sufficient to establish that its right was durable within the meaning of section,subdivision a.korean air lines,at,d.
here,the question of whether the county tax on air china possessory interests in landing rights and leasehold improvements at the airport meets the statutory requirements of section was not disputed in the trial court and is not before us.air china,however,suggests in its reply brief that the county is prohibited from imposing any property taxes because it does not own any property at the airport and its use of the terminal space,taxiways,and runways is not exclusive.while it does not make this argument in the context of the exclusivity requirement of section,it is well settled that shared use of property with others affects only the valuation of the possessory interest and does not defeat the exclusivity requirement of section.korean air lines,supra,th at.
c.the tax treaty does not prohibit the county from taxing air china possessory interests at the airport 
air china contends that the tax treaty prohibits the county from imposing any taxes on income and profits it derives from its air transportation operations to or from the united states.it argues that the county taxation of its possessory interests in the use of landing and common terminal facilities violates the tax treaty.
the tax treaty provides that i ncome and profits of an enterprise of a contracting state from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that contracting state.the tax treaty prohibits both the united states and the prc from taxing the income or profits derived from airport transportation enterprises engaged in by one country companies in the other country.it makes no mention of property taxes and there is nothing in the language of the treaty that proscribes them.
the rules governing the interpretation of international tax treaties are established.the clear import of treaty language controls unless application of the words of the treaty according to their obvious meaning effects a result inconsistent with the intent or expectations of its signatories.sumitomo shoji ame
