the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act,stat,includes a provision,h,that prohibits employers from retaliating against whistleblower employees who make certain protected disclosures.the instant case requires us to determine whether h protects a foreign worker employed abroad by a foreign corporation where all events related to the disclosures occurred abroad.because legislation is presumed to apply only domestically unless there is evidence congress intended otherwise there is no indication congress intended the whistleblower protection provision to have extraterritorial application and the facts in the complaint unequivocally demonstrate that applying the statute in this case would constitute an extraterritorial application,we conclude that the district court properly dismissed the complaint.
background 
liu meng lin,a citizen and resident of taiwan,was employed as a compliance officer for the healthcare division of siemens china,a chinese corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary of siemens ag siemens,a german corporation whose shares,at all relevant times,were listed on the new york stock exchange.according to his complaint,liu discovered that siemens employees were indirectly making improper payments to officials in north korea and china in connection with the sale of medical equipment in those countries.liu believed that these payments violated both company policy and u.measures.he therefore reported this conduct to his superiors through internal company procedures,including in a meeting with a siemens executive in shanghai,china.liu claims that as he sought to address these alleged violations,siemens progressively restricted his authority as a compliance officer,demoted him,and ultimately fired him.liu does not plead that any of the events related to his firing the allegedly corrupt conduct,liu discovery of that conduct,liu efforts to address the corrupt conduct through siemens internal protocols,or his subsequent mistreatment by siemens occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states.
two months after siemens fired him,liu reported the allegedly corrupt conduct to the securities and exchange commission sec,charging that siemens had violated the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa liu then brought this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york william pauley iii,judge,alleging that by firing him siemens had violated the antiretaliation provision of the dodd frank act.h a.siemens moved to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim.b,asserting two separate defects in the complaint that the antiretaliation provision does not apply extraterritorially,and that none of liu disclosures were required or protected by a relevant statute as the antiretaliation provision requires.the district court granted siemens motion to dismiss with prejudice on both grounds,holding that on the facts pled,the complaint sought an extraterritorial application of the antiretaliation provision,which does not have extraterritorial reach,and that liu complaint failed to establish that he had made a disclosure to the sec that was required or protected by any of the specific statutes enumerated in h a iii.
liu timely appealed,and upon de novo review of the district court grant of the motion to dismiss,lundy catholic health of long island,cir,we affirm on the ground that liu seeks an extraterritorial application of the antiretaliation provision,and that that provision does not apply extraterritorially.
discussion 
we review a motion to dismiss de novo,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true,and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.lundy,at.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,u,internal quotation marks omitted.the factual content of the complaint must allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.id.
i t is a longstanding principle of american law that legislation of congress,unless a contrary intent appears,is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states.morrison austl.bank,quoting eeoc arabian am.oil aramco.this principle represents a canon of construction,or a presumption about a statute meaning,rather than a limit upon congress power to legislate.it rests on the perception that congress ordinarily legislates with respect to domestic,not foreign matters.id.internal citations omitted.the presumption that w hen a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application,it has none,kiobel royal dutch petroleum,quoting morrison,at alteration omitted,is rebutted only when the statute text,history,and purposes evince a clear indication of extraterritoriality.id.at,quoting morrison,at.moreover,it is well established that generic terms like any or every do not rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality,nor do fleeting reference s to possible international ramifications of an otherwise domestic statute,morrison,at.
we have read morrison to wholeheartedly embrace application of the presumption against extraterritoriality,finding that unless there is the affirmative intention of the congress clearly expressed to give a statute extraterritorial effect,we must presume it is primarily concerned with domestic conditions.norex petroleum access,cir,quoting morrison,at.we will thus look for a clear and affirmative indication that a statute applies to conduct occurring outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states before concluding that the presumption has been overcome.united states weingarten,cir,quoting morrison,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
this case involves the reach of the antiretaliation provision of the dodd frank act,which directs,in relevant part,that 
n o employer may discharge or in any other manner discriminate against,a whistleblower in the terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful act done by the whistleblower in making disclosures that are required or protected under the sarbanes oxley act of,this chapter,and any other law,rule,or regulation subject to the jurisdiction of the securities and exchange commission.
h a.to survive siemens motion to dismiss,liu must demonstrate either that the facts alleged in his complaint state a domestic application of the antiretaliation provision of the dodd frank act,or that the antiretaliation provision is intended to apply extraterritorially.
the first alternative need not detain us long.we have no occasion here to define the precise boundary between domestic and extraterritorial application of this relevant provision,or to delineate the types of contacts within the united states that would render an application of the statute domestic rather than extraterritorial because this case is extraterritorial by any reasonable definition.liu is a resident of taiwan employed by the chinese subsidiary of a german company he reported to superiors in china and germany regarding allegedly corrupt activities that took place in china,north korea,and hong kong and his employers decided,apparently in china germany,to terminate his employment.in short,the whistleblower,his employer,and the other entities involved in the alleged wrongdoing are all foreigners based abroad,and the whistleblowing,the alleged corrupt activity,and the retaliation all occurred abroad.the facts alleged in the complaint reveal essentially no contact with the united states regarding either the wrongdoing or the protected activity.
liu attempts to avoid this conclusion by pointing to one slim connection to the united states.he argues that siemens voluntarily elected to have a class of its securities publicly listed on the new york stock exchange and thereby voluntarily subjected itself to and undertook to comply with united states securities laws,including the antiretaliation provision.appellant br.at.liu argues that because siemens has securities listed on an american exchange,his case is fundamentally distinguishable from morrison,id.at.
this argument is unavailin
