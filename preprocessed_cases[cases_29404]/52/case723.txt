we must decide whether,under the treaty clause of the constitution,the united states may enter into a treaty with a entity,such as hong kong.we conclude that such a treaty is constitutional,and therefore uphold the validity of the agreement between the government of the united states of america and the government of hong kong for the surrender of fugitive offenders extradition agreement.we also hold that a magistrate judge has jurisdiction under the federal magistrates act to issue a report and recommendation r r regarding a habeas petition without the defendant explicit consent.
background 
in,hong kong magistrate bina chainrai issued a warrant authorizing michael wang arrest.the warrant listed eighteen counts of theft adding up to in hong kong currency and two counts of dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of an indictable offense.after the hong kong department of justice formally requested wang surrender pursuant to the extradition agreement,the united states filed a request to extradite him.united states magistrate judge rosalyn chapman held a hearing,found that all of the requirements for the extradition had been met,and issued an order certifying wang extraditability.
wang filed a habeas petition challenging the extradition order,contending that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to certify extradition because the extradition agreement between the united states and hong kong is not a proper treaty under the constitution,and that no probable cause supports certain charges against him.wang habeas petition was heard by magistrate judge chapman,who issued a r r to district judge christina snyder.although wang did not explicitly consent to magistrate judge chapman review of his habeas petition,wang made no objection to her appointment.judge snyder conducted a de novo review of the r r,approved and adopted the r r,and entered an order denying the petition for habeas corpus.
ii.discussion 
on july,the united kingdom returned sovereignty over hong kong to china.see.the hong kong special administrative region hksar of china was set up to enjoy a high degree of autonomy on all matters other than defense and foreign affairs.id.the transfer of sovereignty implemented a one country,two systems policy,under which hong kong will retain its current lifestyle and legal,social,and economic systems until at least the year.id.
from to june,extradition relations between the united states and hong kong were governed by an extradition treaty between the united states and the united kingdom.in light of the transfer of sovereignty over hong kong from the united kingdom to china,the united states and hong kong concluded the extradition agreement,for which president clinton requested the senate advice and consent to ratify as a treaty.china had already approved hong kong entering into the agreement.the senate subsequently ratified the extradition agreement.see cong.rec.s,
political question 
the government argues that the constitutionality of the extradition agreement is a nonjusticiable political question,framing the issue as whether hong kong is a sufficiently sovereign foreign power for the purpose of entering into a treaty.however,this court need not decide the status of hong kong sovereignty.rather,the constitutional issue that wang has raised is whether the term treaty in the treaty clause encompasses agreements with,such as hong that question is clearly justiciable under baker carr,d.
the second circuit separation of justiciable and nonjusticiable issues regarding the hong kong extradition agreement is instructive 
federal courts lack the authority and institutional competence to make the political judgments involved in ascertaining the legitimacy of foreign systems.thus,in this case,it is not for the courts to decide whether the hksar government is a legitimate government.instead,our role is limited to answering the prior definitional question what does the term foreign government in the extradition statute mean more precisely,the question we must answer is whether the government of a subsovereign constitutes a foreign government or the government of a foreign country for purposes of.put another way,for most purposes of united states foreign relations,the hksar government is the government of hong kong because it has been recognized as such by the executive,but it is a foreign government within the meaning of the extradition statute only if the judiciary interprets that term to encompass subsovereigns.
cheung united states,cir citing baker carr,at.though we answer a slightly different definitional the president may enter into a treaty with a under the treaty principle is the same,relying on baker distinction between discerning a nation sovereignty a political question and interpreting the impact of that status on the law a judicial one 
while recognition of foreign governments strongly defies judicial treatment and the judiciary ordinarily follows the executive as to which nation has sovereignty over disputed territory,once sovereignty over an area is politically determined and declared,courts may examine the resulting status and decide independently whether a statute applies to that area.
at.footnote omitted.china sovereignty over hong kong and by corollary hong kong subsovereign status has been resolved by the executive branch,and we do not question that judgment.however,this court may examine the resulting status of hong kong,and decide whether the treaty clause applies to hong kong as a constitutionally cognizable treaty party.
baker six factors to determine whether an issue is a nonjusticiable political question supports finding justiciability here 
prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion or the impossibility of a court undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.
id.at.unless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar,there should be no dismissal for nonjusticiability on the ground of a political question presence.id.emphasis added.
justice powell distilled the baker test into three inquiries i does the issue involve resolution of questions committed by the text of the constitution to a coordinate branch of government ii would resolution of the question demand that a court move beyond areas of judicial expertise iii do prudential considerations counsel against judicial intervention goldwater carter,d powell,concurring.in applying the factors,it is important to note that it is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance,baker,at,and that not every matter touching on politics is a political question.japan whaling ass american cetacean soc y,d citing baker,at.
no textually demonstrable commitment 
the issue here is whether the term treaty in the treaty clause encompasses agreements with.on this issue of constitutional interpretation,there is no textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department,baker,at,to the president.rather,the text is silent,and the dissent concedes as much.see dissent.
no lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards no requirement for an initial policy determination 
the second goldwater factor lumps together the second and third baker there is a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards and whether a decision is impossible without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.see goldwater,at.powell,concurring.nowhere do we make an explicit or implicit policy determination that an extradition agreement,or foreign relations generally,with hong kong is a good or bad thing.the neutral analysis of the indian treaty line of cases to fill in the silence of the treaty clause utilizes regular means of constitutional interpretation.resolution of the question may not be easy,but it only requires us to apply normal principles of interpretation to the constitutional provisions at issue.id.the dissent disagreement with the indian treaty analogy does not make the analysis judicially unmanageable or.
prudential considerations 
the remaining baker inquires may be seen as prudential considerations,the third of the goldwater inquiries.the dissent is concerned that addressing the requirements of the treaty clause would risk the nation ability to speak with one voice in the field of foreign affairs with hong kong.dissent.though a valid concern,it is overstated.even if the court were to find that the treaty clause did not encompass agreements with,the president could still enter into an executive agreement,or pass legislation with both houses of congress,that would establish identical extradition obligations and other treaty obligations between the united states and hong kong.
the court is cognizant of the interplay between the interpretation of the treaty clause and the conduct of this nation foreign affairs,but one of the judiciary characteristic roles is to interpret the constitution,and we can not shirk this responsibility merely because our decision may have significant political overtones.japan whaling,at.addressing whether two statutes required the secretary of commerce to act contrary to an executive agreement,despite contention of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments.thus,we conclude that the issue presented is justiciable.
b.the united states may enter into a treaty with a 
we review whether a constitutionally valid extradition treaty exists de novo.in the matter of then melendez,cir.
the text,framer intent,and the indian treaties 
the text of the treaty clause of the united states and the extradition statute are silent as to the definition of the term treaty.the power to make treaties is given by the constitution in general terms,without any description of the objects intended to be embraced by it holmes jennison,pet.treaties enacted pursuant to article ii receive a presumption of constitutionality.see in re aircrash in bali,indonesia on april,cir.
wang argues that the united states can not constitutionally enter into a treaty with a such as hong kong.however,there is no credible source that supports the proposition that the treaty clause permits only a treaty with a sovereign nation.indeed,it would be difficult for the founders to have this thought at the drafting of the constitution,since,as wang concedes,entities were not prevalent in.
the second circuit has upheld the constitutionality of the hong kong extradition agreement see cheung.the reasoning of the second circuit is persuasive 
although the term treaty is commonly understood in modern usage as a contract between independent nations,the term was not necessarily so limited in the century or now when the federal extradition statute was enacted.it is true that at the time congress passed the act,the united states had ratified only two extradition treaties,both with sovereign and england.however,the united states had also ratified hundreds of treaties with indian tribes or nations.from the first years of our constitutional republic,the indian treaties have enjoyed a status on a par with foreign treaties.this has been the case even though indian treaty partners have been described as domestic dependent nations insofar as they had ceded powers generally associated with sovereignty,including the right freely to carry out foreign relations and trade.
thus,it is clear that the term treaty had a meaning broader than an agreement between fully sovereign or independent entities.
cheung,at citations omitted.
the supreme court treatment of united states treaties with indian nations,despite an evolving debate about their sovereignty status as constitutionally valid,see,united states gallons of whiskey.minnesota mille lacs band of chippewa indians,d strongly suggests that the treaty clause does not preclude the united states from entering into treaties with.
the significance of 
wang also argues that the implementation of which prohibits future contracts by treaty with indian nations without invalidating or impairing prior treaties,demonstrates that the congress and president interpreted the term treaty only as an agreement.thus,wang argues that cheung incorrectly concluded that the united states may enter into a treaty with a by mistakenly assuming that indian tribes were entities.
first,it is a stretch to argue that based on united states relations with indian nations via an statute,without any interpretation of the treaty clause,the term treaty should be constitutionally defined solely as between two sovereigns whatever the congress and the president may have believed in about treaties and sovereignty,it is that it is the judicial branch that is endowed with the duty of constitutional interpretation.marbury madison,cranch.it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.and,to date,there is no supreme court precedent specifically holding that a treaty between a sovereign and is unconstitutional.
second,as cheung points out,decisions did refer to indian nations as,or at least as less than fully sovereign.see,cherokee nation georgia,pet.see also johnson,wheat.indian rights to complete sovereignty,as independent nations,were necessarily diminished but see worcester georgia,pet.describing indian nations as distinct,independent political communities,retaining their original natural rights,as the undisputed possessors of the soil.
thus,the united states history of treaties with nonsovereign indian nations fills in the silence of the treaty clause and the extradition statute with respect to the term treaty it is constitutional for the united states to enter into a treaty with a,such as hong kong.
appointment of same magistrate judge to handle extradition certification and habeas challenge was proper 
we review the scope of authority and powers of a magistrate judge de novo.united states,cir.the jurisdiction and powers of magistrate judges are enumerated in of the federal magistrates act.section b a allows a district judge to designate a magistrate to hear and determine any pretrial matter,except eight types of motions none of which pertain to wang case.section b b permits a district judge to designate a magistrate to conduct hearings and submit proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition of any motion excepted in b a,applications for posttrial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses,and prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement.finally,there is a provision,b,which permits a district court judge to assign the magistrate any additional duties not inconsistent with the constitution and the laws of the united states.
the united states district court for the central district of california issued general order,which fills in specific additional duties assigned to magistrate judges.federal habeas corpus petitions and extradition proceedings are among the types of cases assigned to magistrates.the order explains that once a case is randomly assigned to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation as magistrate judge chapman was assigned to wang extradition proceeding,all subsequent habeas corpus cases filed by the same party shall be assigned to the same magistrate judge.thus,under general order,magistrate judge chapman was well within her authority to issue a r r for wang habeas petition.the issue presented here is whether,in this scenario,the magistrate judge exceeded the authority granted under b the provision 
wang argues that magistrate judge chapman lacked jurisdiction under to submit a r r because he did not explicitly consent to his habeas petition being handled by a magistrate.under united states,cir,consent is the most important factor in determining what the provision encompasses,when the matter at issue is a critical stage of the proceedings as opposed to a subsidiary one.goes on to explain that where discretion is exercised,the scope of the magistrate judge authority is construed more narrowly.id.at.for example,duties that require a final and independent determination of fact or law would necessitate consent.id.
here,the magistrate judge r r was not a final and independent determination of fact or law,as the district judge reviewed the habeas petition de novo.thus,the issuance of the report was not a critical stage of the proceedings.
united states,cir,makes clear that magistrate judge chapman did not exceed her authority in issuing the r r.in,the district court had erred in delegating to the magistrate judge a final determination regarding involuntary medication we acknowledged that the issue of involuntary medication is of clear constitutional importance and a llowing a magistrate judge to make the ultimate decision in a matter of such clear constitutional import would raise serious article iii concerns.id.at.however,the court found no statutory or constitutional concerns raised by allowing the magistrate judge to submit proposed findings and recommendations on the involuntary medication determination to the district court for de novo review.id.the court went even further,making a broad statement about delegations to magistrates involving de novo review by the district judge 
raddatz makes clear that the delegation to magistrate judges of matters that implicate constitutional rights for proposed findings and recommendations is constitutional so long as the findings and recommendations are subject to de novo review by an article iii judge.
id.citing united states raddatz,d.
there is no reason to question the de novo review done by judge snyder here.the order adopting the r r states that the court reviewed the petition and other papers along with the attached report and recommendation as well as petitioner objections and respondent response to petitioner objections,and has made a de novo determination.considering this de novo review,there was no violation of the federal magistrates act or a deprivation of review by an article iii judge 
conclusion 
for all of the foregoing reasons,the extradition of wang is constitutional,and the issuance of the r r by magistrate judge chapman comported with the federal magistrates act.
not every constitutional question requires judicial scrutiny or resolution.while the judiciary has the power to address questions concerning the content of treaties,see eastern airlines,floyd,d,the question of whether the president may enter into treaties with is left to the politically accountable branches of government.the majority announces a flawed and unnecessary constitutional ruling on this issue.because we should dismiss wang appeal for lack of justiciability,i must dissent.
the majority rules that whether the president has the constitutional authority to enter into treaties with,like hong kong,is a clear justiciable question under baker carr,d.instead of discerning a nation sovereignty a political question,the majority states that we are only examin ing the resulting status of hong kong and decid ing whether the treaty clause applies to hong kong as a constitutionally cognizable treaty party.op.at.what constitutes a constitutionally cognizable treaty party,however,is a question of foreign policy that the judiciary can not address.in fact,all of the baker factors support dismissing wang appeal and leaving resolution of this question to the political process.
first,mindful of the fact that not every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance,baker,at,the question of whether hong kong is a constitutionally cognizable treaty partner is committed to the political branches because it is inextricably linked to the president broad authority in the field of foreign relations.
the majority narrowly reframes the issue for purposes of the first baker test,as whether the term treaty in the treaty clause encompasses agreements with.op.at.but the real issue here is not as simple as the majority would have us view it.while it is undisputed that the judiciary has the power to interpret the language of the constitution,including the treaty clause,see cooper aaron,d per curiam the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the constitution,and that principle has ever since marbury madison been respected by this court and the country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system,not every constitutional question requires judicial interpretation.see spector motor serv.mclaughlin.if there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of constitutional adjudication,it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality unless such adjudication is unavoidable.in its most basic form,the real question before us is whether it is the role of the judiciary or the political branches to decide what constitutes a treaty partner.the constitution commits the latter to answer this question.
as chief executive,const.art.ii,cl,and commander in chief,const.art.ii,cl,the president is the guiding organ in the conduct of our nation foreign affairs.ludecke watkins.see united states pink.t he president is the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.citation omitted.in addition to granting the president the power to make treaties with the advice and consent of the senate,const.art.ii,cl,the same clause of the constitution confers upon the president the sole power to appoint ambassadors,other public ministers,and consuls,while a subsequent section vests the president with the authority to receive ambassadors and other public ministers.const.art.ii.the president further authority to recognize foreign powers logically derives from his ample constitutional authority in the realm of foreign affairs.see banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d political recognition is exclusively a function of the executive.pink,at.objections to the underlying policy as well as objections to recognition are to be addressed to the political department and not to the courts.united states sandoval.recognition of indian tribes is also left to the political branches.
here,the president,acting within his grant of constitutional authority,engaged in diplomatic relations with hong kong while under british and now chinese rule.on the basis of this preexisting relationship,the president considered hong kong a foreign or which the united states could cooperate and reach various agreements,including an extradition agreement.to effectuate his interest in establishing an extradition policy with hong kong,the president entered into the hong kong extradition agreement hkea with the senate approval pursuant to the president constitutionally committed power to make treaties,provided two thirds of the senators present concur.const.art.ii,cl.the hkea is,therefore,a treaty that represents the president ongoing interest in maintaining foreign relations with hong kong.
it is not the role of the courts to question whether the president properly exercised his political power by entering into a treaty with hong kong in the process of conducting foreign affairs.see harisiades shaughnessy.explaining that the conduct of foreign relations is so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference footnote omitted united states belmont.stating that the conduct of foreign relations was committed by the constitution to the political departments of the government,and the propriety of what may be done in the exercise of this political power is not subject to judicial inquiry or decision referring to oetjen central leather.by virtue of wielding the power to make treaties,appoint ambassadors,and recognize foreign governments,all part of the president extensive power to conduct foreign relations,the president is necessarily entrusted by the structure of the constitution with the power to determine who makes a proper treaty partner.see alperin vatican bank,cir.june,citing
