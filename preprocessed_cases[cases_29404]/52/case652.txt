under the act of state doctrine,the acts of foreign sovereigns taken within their own jurisdiction shall be deemed valid.kirkpatrick environmental tectonics,d.founded on international law,the doctrine also serves as a basis for jurisdiction when the plaintiff complaint challenges the validity of a foreign state conduct.we consider here whether the district court had jurisdiction over this suit,based upon the act of state doctrine,such that removal from state to federal court was proper.because none of the referenced conduct by the foreign this case,the philippine essential to any of the plaintiff causes of action,we reverse the district court exercise of jurisdiction under the act of state doctrine.
background 
the provincial government of marinduque the province sued placer dome corporation in in nevada state court for alleged human health,ecological,and economic damages caused by the company mining operations on marinduque,an island province of the republic of the philippines according to the complaint,placer dome severely polluted the lands and waters of marinduque for some thirty years,caused two cataclysmic environmental disasters,poisoned the islanders by contaminating their food and water sources,and then left the province without cleaning up the in violation of philippine law.the province further alleges that placer dome received certain forms of assistance in its mining endeavors from the philippine government.more particularly,the province contends that former philippine president ferdinand marcos,in exchange for a personal stake in the mining operations,eased various environmental protections obstructing placer dome way.
immediately after the province filed suit,placer dome removed the case to federal district court for the district of nevada on the basis of jurisdiction.specifically,placer dome contended that the case tender ed questions of international law and foreign relations.the province moved for an order requiring placer dome to show cause why the action should not be remanded to the state court due to a lack of jurisdiction.the district court denied the province motion,holding that jurisdiction existed under the act of state doctrine of the federal common law.placer dome moved to dismiss the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens.the district court granted limited discovery on personal jurisdiction before discovery was concluded,in march,the united states supreme court issued sinochem international malaysia international shipping,announcing that district courts have latitude to rule on the threshold issue of forum non conveniens before definitively ascertaining and personal jurisdiction,d.the district court stayed jurisdictional discovery,and ordered briefing on the issue of forum non conveniens.invoking sinochem,the district court dismissed the matter on forum non conveniens grounds in favor of a canadian forum.in ruling on the province motion for reconsideration,the district court affirmed its earlier conclusion that subject matter jurisdiction does,in fact,exist in this case,based upon the act of state doctrine.
removal to federal court 
this case was removed from state to federal court under a on placer dome representation that the province claims implicated the federal common law of foreign relations.removal was proper only if the district court would have had original jurisdiction over the claims.placer dome asserted jurisdiction pursuant to,which states that federal courts have jurisdiction over cases presenting questions of federal constitutional,statutory,and common law.
federal courts may exercise jurisdiction over an action in two situations.first,and most commonly,a federal court may exercise jurisdiction if a federal right or immunity is an element,and an essential one,of the plaintiff cause of action.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust for,d quoting gully first national bank.thus,the federal question on which jurisdiction is premised can not be supplied via a defense rather,the federal question must be disclosed upon the face of the complaint,unaided by the answer.phillips petroleum texaco,d per curiam.second,a federal court may have such jurisdiction if a claim necessarily raise s a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.grable sons metal,darue eng g,d.such a federal issue must be a substantial one,indicating a serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum.id.at.
the removal statute is strictly construed against removal jurisdiction.syngenta crop,henson,d california ex rel.lockyer dynegy,cir.the defendant bears the burden of establishing that removal is proper.id.
ii.determination of removal jurisdiction in light of sinochem 
the question before us,then,is whether the district court had jurisdiction under.we review de novo a district court determination that jurisdiction exists for a case that has been removed.schnabel lui,cir.
before considering this issue,we first address placer dome assertion that the district court dismissed this case on forum non conveniens grounds without resolving the issue of jurisdiction.according to placer dome,the district court exercised its discretion under the supreme court decision in sinochem not to resolve whether it has authority to adjudicate the cause jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction over the defendant if it determines that,in any event,a foreign tribunal is plainly the more suitable arbiter of the merits of the case.at.if the district court did not determine jurisdiction,placer dome intimates,then we are presented with only the forum non conveniens dismissal to review.placer dome further argues that,even if the district court concluded that jurisdiction existed,that holding was alternative to the forum non conveniens determination.
we question whether sinochem restricts our ability to address an issue of jurisdiction,even if characterized as an alternative holding.w e have an independent obligation to examine our own and the district court jurisdiction.rivas rail delivery,cir.that obligation necessarily carries with it the authority to determine for ourselves,under sinochem,whether the jurisdictional issue should be addressed,regardless of the path the district court chose to take.
in any event,placer dome misapprehends the proceedings below.following removal of this suit,the province challenged the court jurisdiction.the district court agreed with placer dome that removal was proper,holding that the province allegations invoked the act of state doctrine and thus triggered jurisdiction.the district court arguably cast a shadow upon that conclusion when it dismissed the case on forum non conveniens grounds.however,in its final order denying the province motion for reconsideration,the district court clarified that it had inadvertently placed its jurisdiction in doubt and explicitly affirmed its previous conclusion that the complaint presented federal questions under the act of state doctrine.whether viewed as an alternative holding or not,it is abundantly clear that the district court concluded it had jurisdiction over this suit 
in sinochem,the supreme court considered whether a district court must first conclusively establish its own jurisdiction before dismissing a suit on the basis of forum non conveniens.answering in the negative,the court explained that,because jurisdiction is vital only if a court intends to render a determination on the merits of a case,a federal court has leeway to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits.at.quoting ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d.and because a forum non conveniens dismissal is not a merits determination,the court held that a district court may dispose of an action by a forum non conveniens dismissal,bypassing questions of and personal jurisdiction,when considerations of convenience,fairness,and judicial economy so warrant.id.at.the court further observed 
in the mine run of cases,jurisdiction will involve no arduous inquiry and both judicial economy and the consideration ordinarily accorded the plaintiff choice of forum should impel the federal court to dispose of those issue s first.ruhrgas,at.but where or personal jurisdiction is difficult to determine,and forum non conveniens considerations weigh heavily in favor of dismissal,the court properly takes the less burdensome course.
id.at.alterations in original.
in sinochem,the supreme court offered the lower courts a practical mechanism for resolving a case that would ultimately be dismissed.for a case originally filed in federal court,the result would be the same,whether dismissed on jurisdictional or forum non conveniens would be inevitable and conclusive.for a case originating in state court,however,the difference could be significant.if the federal court dismisses on forum non conveniens grounds,the case is dismissed.but if removal is improper,the case is remanded to the state court.thus,in a removal scenario,the sequencing of the decision may have practical consequences in sum,sinochem presents no bar to our reaching the issue of whether the province allegations invoke federal questions.here,of course,the district court made a threshold determination that it had jurisdiction under the act of state doctrine,and it is to this question we now turn.
iii.the act of state doctrine 
ultimately,the question of jurisdiction here is not particularly complex.although the province complaint is lengthy,we should not duck the jurisdictional analysis simply because we need to read and benchmark the allegations and claims against the act of state doctrine,a principle that is well established.
although there is no general federal common law,there are enclaves of federal law.banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d.one such enclave concerns the law of international relations and foreign affairs.id.at.a common law principle,the act of state doctrine precludes courts from evaluating the validity of actions that a foreign government has taken within its own borders.see kirkpatrick,at.sabbatino,at.underhill hernandez.see also timberlane lumber bank of america,cir recounting history of the doctrine born and rutledge,international civil litigation in united states courts same.the doctrine reflects the concern that the judiciary,by questioning the validity of sovereign acts taken by foreign states,may interfere with the executive branch conduct of foreign policy.kirkpatrick,at.as a result,the doctrine requires that the official act of a foreign sovereign performed within its own territory becomes a rule of decision for the courts of this country.id.at.quoting ricaud american metal.
e ven though the validity of the act of a foreign sovereign within its own territory is called into question,the policies underlying the act of state doctrine may not justify its application.id.at.citing sabbatino,at.the supreme court discussed three such policies in sabbatino 
t he greater the degree of codification or consensus concerning a particular area of international law,the more appropriate it is for the judiciary to render decisions regarding it t he less important the implications of an issue are for our foreign relations,the weaker the justification for exclusivity in the political branches.the balance of relevant considerations may also be shifted if the government which perpetrated the challenged act of state is no longer in existence.
sabbatino,at.see also kirkpatrick,at.
the supreme court leading contemporary act of state the doctrine in this way act of state issues only arise when a court must is,when the outcome of the case turns effect of official action by a foreign sovereign.when that question is not in the case,neither is the act of state doctrine.id.at.
we followed this approach to the doctrine in patrickson dole food,cir,in which we considered a complaint brought by latin american banana workers who asserted state law claims against multinational fruit and chemical companies alleging exposure to toxic chemicals.because nothing in plaintiffs complaint turns on the validity or invalidity of any act of a foreign state,we rejected application of the act of state doctrine.id.at.
the defendants in patrickson argued that,despite there being no act of state issues on the surface of the banana workers complaint,the case concerns a vital sector of the economies of foreign countries and so has implications for our nation relations with those countries.id.we did not embrace that argument,parting ways with other circuits that had more broadly interpreted the doctrine as supplying jurisdiction over any case that might affect foreign relations regardless of whether federal law is raised in the complaint.sabbatino did not create an exception to the complaint rule.id.at.what congress has not done is to extend jurisdiction to all suits where the federal common law of foreign relations might arise as an issue.we interpret congressional silence outside these specific grants of jurisdiction as an endorsement of the complaint rule.id.at.
with kirkpatrick and patrickson lighting our way,we reach the heart of the matter.
iv.the province complaint does not implicate the act of state doctrine 
the province complaint weaves together numerous allegations in a chronicle of skullduggery,toxic dumping,a collapsed dam that polluted the surrounding areas,a river flooded with poisonous mine tailings,and a corrupt government that facilitated this conduct.in sum,the province alleges that placer significantly harmed marinduque and its people,including through the contamination and degradation of the environment,which in turn caused blood diseases,skin disorders,and stomach ailments among the islanders.and since placer dome left marinduque in,it has done nothing,according to the province,to ameliorate the problems it created,and has actively evaded responsibility.
these allegations are the backdrop for thirteen causes of action under philippine law violating the public trust reckless imprudence,in violation of the philippine penal code simple imprudence,in violation of the philippine penal code violations of the philippine water code violations of a philippine fisheries law and violations of philippine pollution control laws violations of a philippine mining law negligence public private nuisance and breaches of contract and promissory estoppel.the province claimed environmental,economic,and human health damages the cost of medical monitoring and care and the cost of environmental remediation.it prayed for injunctive relief as well as damages.
in removing this suit to federal court,placer dome asserted that the complaint tendered questions of international law and foreign relations that furnished the district court with jurisdiction.the district court agreed,concluding that plaintiff complaint is replete with allegations regarding the philippine government activities,which contributed to the environmental harm that plaintiff has suffered.in particular,the district court identified five allegations that,in its view,invoked the act of state doctrine president marcos overturned a presidential proclamation to allow mining in a forest reserve marcos,and subsequent to his removal,a presidential commission,owned percent of the shares in marcopper,a subsidiary of placer dome marcos ordered a government commission to issue a permit allowing marcopper to dump toxic tailings into calancan bay marcos ordered the same pollution commission to remove restraints it had placed on marcopper dumping of waste into the bay and president aquino ordered a pollution control board not to enforce a cease and desist order against marcopper.citing these same allegations,placer dome argues that the act of state doctrine bars this suit because the complaint is premised upon conduct that occurred pursuant to governmental permits and other acts or omissions by the philippine government.
fatal to the district court removal jurisdiction,however,is that the act of state doctrine is implicated here only defensively and the complaint does not necessarily raise a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial.grable,at.as previously explained,t o bring a case within the removal statute,a right or immunity created by the constitution or laws of the unit
