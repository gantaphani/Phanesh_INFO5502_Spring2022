this is a contract case in which the republic of argentina refuses to pay certain holders of sovereign bonds issued under a fiscal agency agreement hereinafter,the faa and the faa bonds.in order to enhance the marketability of the bonds,argentina made a series of promises to the purchasers.argentina promised periodic interest payments.argentina promised that the bonds would be governed by new york law.argentina promised that,in the event of default,unpaid interest and principal would become due in full.argentina promised that any disputes concerning the bonds could be adjudicated in the courts of new york.argentina promised that each bond would be transferable and payable to the transferee,regardless of whether it was a university endowment,a vulture fund,or a widow or an orphan.finally,argentina promised to treat the faa bonds at least equally with its other external indebtedness.as we have held,by defaulting on the bonds,enacting legislation specifically forbidding future payment on them,and continuing to pay interest on subsequently issued debt,argentina breached its promise of equal treatment.see nml capital,republic of argentina,cir nml i.
specifically,in october,we affirmed injunctions issued by the district court intended to remedy argentina breach of the equal treatment obligation in the faa.see id.our opinion chronicled pertinent aspects of argentina fiscal history and the factual background of this case,see id.at,familiarity with which is assumed those injunctions,fashioned by the thomas griesa,directed that whenever argentina pays on the bonds or other obligations that it issued in or exchange offers the exchange bonds,the republic must also make a ratable payment to plaintiffs who hold defaulted faa bonds.we remanded,however,for the district court to clarify the injunctions payment formula and effects on third parties and intermediary banks,and retained jurisdiction pursuant to united states jacobson,cir.
on november,the district court issued amended injunctions with the clarifications we requested as well as an opinion explaining them,which are challenged on this appeal by argentina as well as by appellants and intervenors.see nml capital,republic of argentina,civ.tpg,wl,nml ii.recognizing the unusual nature of this litigation and the importance to argentina of the issues presented,following oral argument,we invited argentina to propose to the appellees an alternative payment formula and schedule for the outstanding bonds to which it was prepared to commit.instead,the proposal submitted by argentina ignored the outstanding bonds and proposed an entirely new set of substitute bonds in sum,no productive proposals have been forthcoming.to the contrary,notwithstanding its commitment to resolving disputes involving the faa in new york courts under new york law,at the february,oral argument,counsel for argentina told the panel that it would not voluntarily obey the district court injunctions,even if those injunctions were upheld by this court.moreover,argentina officials have publicly and repeatedly announced their intention to defy any rulings of this court and the district court with which they disagree it is within this context that we review the amended injunctions for abuse of discretion and,finding none,we affirm however,in view of the nature of the issues presented,we will stay enforcement of the injunctions pending resolution of a timely petition to the supreme court for a writ of certiorari 
in its opinion,the district court first explained that its ratable payment requirement meant that whenever argentina pays a percentage of what is due on the exchange bonds,it must pay plaintiffs the same percentage of what is then due on the faa bonds.id.at.under the express terms of the faa,as negotiated and agreed to by argentina,the amount currently due on the faa bonds,as a consequence of its default,is the outstanding principal and accrued interest.see nml i at see also appellant argentina br.at t he contractually agreed upon remedy for default is acceleration of principal,an action already taken by these plaintiffs.thus,as the district court explained,if argentina pays exchange bondholders of what has come due on their bonds at a given time,it must also pay plaintiffs of the roughly billion of principal and accrued interest that they are currently due.see nml ii at.
second,the district court explained how its injunctions would prevent third parties from assisting argentina in evading the injunctions.though the amended and original injunctions directly bind only argentina,the district court correctly explained that,through the automatic operation of federal rule of civil procedure d,they also bind argentina agents and other persons who are in active concert or participation with argentina.see id.at.d.those bound under the operation of rule d would include certain entities involved in the system through which argentina pays exchange bondholders.as the district court stated 
argentina transfers funds to the bank of new york mellon bny,which is the indenture trustee in a trust indenture of.presumably there is a similar indenture for the exchange offer.bny then forwards the funds to the registered owner of the exchange bonds.there are two registered owners for the and exchange bonds.one is cede and the other is the bank of new york depositary bny depositary.cede and bny depositary transfer the funds to a clearing system such as the depository trust company dtc.the funds are then deposited into financial institutions,apparently banks,which then transfer the funds to their customers who are the beneficial interest holders of the bonds.
nml ii at.of these,the amended injunctions cover argentina,the indenture trustee s,the registered owners,and the clearing systems.see id.the amended injunctions explicitly exempt intermediary banks,which enjoy protection under article of new york uniform commercial code,and financial institutions receiving funds from the dtc.see id.
in accordance with our october opinion,the litigation then returned to our court.argentina has challenged certain aspects of the amended injunctions,and appeals have also followed from other entities a group of exchange bondholders,styling themselves as the exchange bondholder group ebg the bank of new york mellon bny,indenture trustee to exchange bondholders and fintech advisory,a holder of exchange bonds.we further received briefing but no notices of appeal from two intervenors a group of bondholders calling themselves the euro bondholders,and ice canyon llc,a holder of securities issued by argentina.
appellate standing 
neither bny,ebg,fintech,euro bondholders,nor ice canyon intervened below,but each seeks to participate here as a.as a general rule,only parties may appeal,but we have recognized appellate standing in two situations where the is bound by the judgment and where the has an interest plausibly affected by the judgment.see official comm.of unsecured creditors of worldcom,cir.
the amended injunctions provide that bny,as a participant in the payment process of the exchange bonds,shall be bound by the terms of this order as provided by federal rule of civil procedure d.wl,at.accordingly,bny has standing to appeal.see nml capital,banco central de la república argentina,cir holding that banco central de la república argentina had standing to challenge attachment and execution order.in contrast,ebg,fintech,euro bondholders,and ice canyon are not bound by the amended injunctions.they are creditors,and,as such,their interests are not plausibly affected by the injunctions because a creditor interest in getting paid is not cognizably affected by an order for a debtor to pay a different creditor.dish network dbsd,cir evanston ins.fred tucker,cir.if argentina defaults on its obligations to them,they retain their rights to sue.and,as discussed below,their interests are not cognizably affected in any other way.consequently,ebg,fintech,euro bondholders,and ice canyon have no appellate standing,and the appeals from ebg and fintech are hereby dismissed.euro bondholders and ice canyon did not file appeals of their own.
at the same time,their arguments are not lost because they requested that,in the event they were not deemed appellants,the court consider their arguments as coming from amici curiae.because argentina contends in its own appeal that the amended injunctions should be vacated because,among other reasons,they are inequitable to exchange bondholders,we will consider the arguments of ebg,fintech,euro bondholders,and ice canyon as arguments from amici curiae in support of argentina.see fed.a 
discussion 
argentina advances a litany of reasons as to why the amended injunctions unjustly injure itself,the exchange bondholders,participants in the exchange bond payment system,and the public.none of the alleged injuries leads us to find an abuse of the district court discretion.
alleged injuries to argentina 
argentina argues that the amended injunctions unjustly injure it in two ways.first,argentina argues that the amended injunctions violate the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia by forcing argentina to use resources that the statute protects.as discussed in our october opinion,the original injunctions and now the amended injunctions do not violate the fsia because t hey do not attach,arrest,or execute upon any property as proscribed by the statute nml i at.rather,the injunctions allow argentina to pay its faa debts with whatever resources it likes.absent further guidance from the supreme court,we remain convinced that the amended injunctions are consistent with the fsia.
second,argentina argues that the injunctions ratable payment remedy is inequitable because it calls for plaintiffs to receive their full principal and all accrued interest when exchange bondholders receive even a single installment of interest on their bonds.however,the undisputed reason that plaintiffs are entitled immediately to of the principal and interest on their debt is that the faa guarantees acceleration of principal and interest in the event of default.see nml i at nml ii at.as the district court concluded,the amount currently owed to plaintiffs by argentina as a result of its persistent defaults is the accelerated principal plus interest.we believe that it is equitable for one creditor to receive what it bargained for,and is therefore entitled to,even if other creditors,when receiving what they bargained for,do not receive the same thing.the reason is obvious the first creditor is differently situated from other creditors in terms of what is currently due to it under its contract.see fin.one pub.lehman.special,cir.because the district court decision does no more than hold argentina to its contractual obligation of equal treatment,we see no abuse of discretion.
argentina adds that the amended injunctions are invalid because a district court may not issue an injunctive remedy that was historically unavailable from a court of equity.grupo mexicano de desarrollo alliance bond fund,d.however,english chancery courts traditionally had power to issue injunctions and order specific performance when no effective remedy was available at law.see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.as we explained in our october opinion,the plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law because the republic has made clear its intention to defy any money judgment issued by this court.see nml i at.moreover,argentina has gone considerably farther by passing legislation,the lock law,specifically barring payments to faa bondholders.and it is unremarkable that a court empowered to afford equitable relief may also direct the timing of that relief.here,that timing requires that it occur before or when argentina next pays the exchange bondholders.
ii.alleged injuries to exchange bondholders 
invoking the proposition that equitable relief is inappropriate where it would cause unreasonable hardship or loss to third persons,see nemer jeep eagle,jeep eagle sales,cir,argentina,ebg,and fintech argue that the amended injunctions are inequitable to exchange bondholders but this case presents no conflict with that proposition.ebg argues,notwithstanding our affirmance of the district court finding that argentina has the financial wherewithal to pay all of its obligations,see nml i at,that the amended injunctions will harm exchange bondholders because argentina has declared publicly that it has no intention of ever paying holdout bondholders like nml and,as a result,neither plaintiffs nor exchange bondholders will be paid if the amended injunctions stand.appellant ebg br.
this type of harm harm threatened to third parties by a party subject to an injunction who avows not to obey it does not make an otherwise lawful injunction inequitable.we are unwilling to permit argentina threats to punish third parties to dictate the availability or terms of relief under rule.see reynolds int l amateur athletic fed n,d stevens,in chambers.argentina contention that the amended injunctions are unfair to exchange bondholders is all the less persuasive because,before accepting the exchange offers,they were expressly warned by argentina in the accompanying prospectus that there could be no assurance that litigation over the faa bonds would not interfere with payments under the exchange bonds.under these circumstances,we conclude that the amended injunctions have no inequitable effect on exchange bondholders and find no abuse of discretion 
iii.alleged injuries to participants in the exchange bond payment system 
argentina,bny,euro bondholders,and ice canyon raise additional issues concerning the amended injunctions and their effects on the international financial system through which argentina pays exchange bondholders.the arguments include that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction over payment system participants and therefore can not bind them with the amended injunctions,the amended injunctions can not apply extraterritorially,payment system participants are improperly bound because they were denied due process,and the amended injunctions application to financial system participants would violate the protections for intermediary banks.none of these arguments,numerous as they are,has merit 
first,bny and euro bondholders argue that the district court erred by purporting to enjoin payment system participants over which it lacks personal jurisdiction.but the district court has issued injunctions against no one except argentina.every injunction issued by a district court automatically forbids others who are not directly enjoined but who act in active concert or participation with an enjoined party from assisting in a violation of the injunction.see.d.in any event,the supreme court has expressed its expectation that,when questions arise as to who is bound by an injunction though operation of rule,district courts will not withhold a clarification in the light of a concrete situation.regal knitwear.the doors of the district court obviously remain open for such applications.
the amended injunctions simply provide notice to payment system participants that they could become liable through rule if they assist argentina in violating the district court orders.since the amended injunctions do not directly enjoin payment system participants,it is irrelevant whether the district court has personal jurisdiction over them.and of course,t here will be no adjudication of liability against a without affording it a full opportunity at a hearing,after adequate notice,to present evidence.golden state bottling,d.in such a hearing,before any finding of liability or sanction against a,questions of personal jurisdiction may be properly raised.but,at this point,they are premature.similarly,payment system participants have not been deprived of due process because,if and when they are summoned to answer for assisting in a violation of the district court injunctions,they will be entitled to notice and the right to be heard.see id.at.
euro bondholders and ice canyon next argue that the amended injunctions are improper or at a minimum violate comity where they extraterritorially enjoin payment systems that deliver funds to exchange bondholders.but a federal court sitting as a court of equity having personal jurisdiction over a party here,argentina has power to enjoin him from committing acts elsewhere.bano union carbide,cir internal quotation marks omitted.and federal courts can enjoin conduct that has or is intended to have a substantial effect within the united states.united states davis,cir.
the district court put forward sufficient reasons for binding argentina conduct,regardless of whether that conduct occurs here or abroad.see nml ii at noting that if argentina is able to pay exchange bondholders while avoiding its obligations to plaintiffs,the injunctions will be entirely for naught see also oral arg.tr.t he republic has done everything possible to prevent those judgments that have been entered against it from being enforced.and the district court has articulated good reasons that the amended injunctions must reach the process by which argentina pays exchange bondholders.see nml ii at noting that,to prevent argentina from avoiding its obligations to plaintiffs,it is necessary that the process for making payments on the exchange bonds be covered id.at explaining that if argentina attempts to make payments contrary to law,then third parties should properly be held responsible for making sure that their actions are not steps to carry out a law violation.the amended injunctions do not directly enjoin any foreign entities other than argentina.by naming certain foreign payment system participants such as clearstream banking,euroclear bank,and bank of new york luxembourg,the district court was,again,simply recognizing the automatic operation of rule.
if ice canyon and the euro bondholders are correct in stating that the payment process for their securities takes place entirely outside the united states,then the district court misstated that,with the possible exception of argentina initial transfer of funds to bny,the exchange bond payment process,without question takes place in the united states.nml ii at.but this possible misstatement is of no moment because,again,the amended injunctions enjoin no one but argentina,a party that has voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the district court.if others in active concert or participation with argentina are outside the jurisdiction or reach of the district court,they may assert as much if and when they are summoned to that court for having assisted argentina in violating united states law.
argentina and fintech further argue that the amended injunctions violate article of the,which was enacted to provide a comprehensive framework that defines the rights and obligations arising from wire transfers.see.bank of the asia pulp paper,cir.two sections of that article are at issue,concerning creditor process,and,requiring proper cause before a party to a fund transfer but not an intermediary bank may be enjoined.
section defines creditor process as a levy,attachment,garnishment,notice of lien,sequestration,or similar process issued by or on behalf of a creditor or other claimant with respect to an account.within the context of electronic funds transfers efts,requires that creditor process must be served on the bank of the eft beneficiary who owes a debt to the creditor.a.the republic argues that the district court impermissibly skirts bar to creditor process except against a beneficiary bank because the amended injunctions purport to affect multiple banks and other financial institutions in active concert and participation with argentina.
section is not controlling because the amended injunctions do not constitute,or give rise to,creditor process,essentially defined in the statute as a levy or attachment.the cases cited by argentina are inapposite because they deal with attachments,and as we have seen,none has occurred here.see shipping of india jaldhi overseas pte,cir aurelius capital partners,lp republic of argentina,cir.
section,however,does apply.it provides that only f or proper cause may a court 
restrain i a person from issuing a payment order to initiate a funds transfer,ii an eft originator bank from executing the payment order of the originator,or iii the eft beneficiary bank from releasing funds to the beneficiary or the beneficiary from withdrawing the funds.a court may not otherwise restrain a person from issuing a payment order,paying or receiving payment of a payment order,or otherwise acting with respect to a funds transfer.
a.this section is designed to prevent interruption of a funds transfer after it has been set in motion,and i n particular,intermediary banks are protected from injunctions that would disrupt an eft.id.a cmt.
argentina argues that plaintiffs purport to have cause for an injunction only with respect to argentina,and therefore any transfers not involving argentina can not be enjoined.but as discussed above,the district court explained why it had good cause to issue injunctions that cover argentina as well as the exchange bond payment system.see nml ii at.moreover,taking into account ban on injunctions against intermediary banks,the district court expressly excluded intermediary banks from the scope of the amended injunctions.nonetheless,fintech argues that bny,bny paying agents,and dtc all act as intermediary banks and are all bound by the amended injunctions.we need not determine now what entities may or may not act as intermediary banks in an eft that violates the amended injunctions.whether or not an institution has assisted argentina in a payment transaction solely in the capacity of an intermediary bank will be a question for future proceedings.
we note,however,that the record does not support fintech assertions.bny does not route funds transfers originated by argentina to exchange bondholders.rather,bny accepts funds as a beneficiary of argentina eft and then initiates new efts as directed by its indenture.see,see also appellant argentina br.bny initiates its separate funds transfer to distribute payment emphasis in original.it is noteworthy that neither argentina nor bny argue that bny is an intermediary bank.
similarly,the clearing systems such as dtc and euroclear appear from the record and from their own representations to be other than intermediary banks.dtc does not route wire transfers but accepts funds that it then allocates only to the participant banks and brokerage houses who have deposited the respective securities with dtc.euroclear receives payments from paying agents and then credits such amounts to its account holders.amicus euroclear br.these are not the functions of an intermediary bank under.see in re contichem lpg,civ,wl,at,mckenna,aff sub nom.contichem lpg parsons shipping,cir explaining that a bank was not an intermediary bank for purposes of a because it did not transfer by wire,or attempt to transfer by wire,the funds in question,but simply,as a receiving bank,credited them to its customer.
iv.alleged injuries to the public interest 
in our october opinion,we considered the dire predictions from argentina that enforcing the commitments it made in the faa would have cataclysmic repercussions in the capital markets and the global economy,and we explained why we disagreed.see nml i at.on this appeal,argentina essentially recycles those arguments.we are mindful of the fact that courts of equity should pay particular regard to the public consequences of any injunction.see winter natural res.def.council,d.however,what the consequences predicted by argentina have in common is that they are speculative,hyperbolic,and almost entirely of the republic own making.none of the arguments demonstrates an abuse of the district court discretion.
the district court found that argentina now has the financial wherewithal to meet its commitment of providing equal treatment to plaintiffs and exchange bondholders.wl,at.however,argentina and the euro bondholders warn that argentina may not be able to pay or that paying will cause problems in the argentine economy,which could affect the global economy.but as we observed in our last opinion,other than this speculation,argentina makes no real argument that,to avoid defaulting on its other debt,it can not afford to service the defaulted debt,and it certainly fails to demonstrate that the district court finding to the contrary was clearly erroneous.nml i at.moreover,and perhaps more critic
