factual and procedural background 
ashlee is the daughter of and respondent samuel eaddy.and eaddy were married in las vegas in august and thereafter lived together in san diego.ashlee was born to them in march.and eaddy separated in and after,ashlee lived exclusively with.in initiated divorce proceedings and in august of that year,the san diego superior court entered a final judgment of marital dissolution in accordance with the parties marital settlement agreement,which provided in part that the parties would have joint legal custody of ashlee,with having primary physical custody and eaddy reasonable visitation rights.
in,moved with ashlee to australia,with eaddy consent,and registered ashlee as an australian citizen shortly after their arrival.in october,eaddy requested that ashlee visit san diego for a period during her school vacation and return to australia before the start of the australian school year in february.all further dates are in except as otherwise specified.agreed to this request and arranged for ashlee,keesha,to accompany ashlee on the trip.
in january,while ashlee and keesha were in san diego,eaddy told that he wanted ashlee to stay with him until june objected,but eaddy refused to abide by the original agreement and on january,keesha returned to australia by herself.that same day,eaddy filed an in pro per petition in the superior court to modify the parties custody rights to ashlee so that he would have physical custody.in support of his petition,eaddy filed a declaration indicating that ashlee had not adjusted well to life in australia and wanted to stay with him in san diego.
opposed eaddy petition,submitting her own declaration that ashlee was doing quite well in australia,was actively involved in sports and learning the native languages and culture and had gotten a job and attended a christian youth camp there.declaration described the contrasts between her home in western australia,where ashlee had her own room and access to many amenities at home and in the surrounding neighborhood,and eaddy home in san diego.contended that eaddy lived in an apartment in a blighted and dangerous area of east san diego,that ashlee shared a room there with the daughter of eaddy girlfriend,schenelle,and that schenelle was a heavy smoker who smoked in the house despite the fact that ashlee was asthmatic and eaddy had a terminal lung condition.she averred that eaddy worked six days a week,which severely limited his time with ashlee and left ashlee to be raised by schenelle,whom ashlee hardly knew.
also submitted a declaration by keesha,who confirmed that schenelle smoked in the house and said that ashlee became withdrawn and distant after they arrived in san diego and that ashlee frequently missed school while they were there.keesha stated that during her stay,eaddy and schenelle convinced ashlee to stay in san diego rather than return to australia,in part based on false stories about.she also said that ashlee lied to get her way and that eaddy let ashlee get away with a lot.
in early march,a family court services counselor filed a report in the superior court indicating that ashlee expressed desire was to stay in the united states because ashlee felt more comfortable here.ashlee reported that while she was living in australia,she was involved in numerous fights with fellow students,was suspended from school,had engaged in cutting herself and had contemplated suicide on one occasion.the counselor concluded that,even if ashlee was exaggerating her situation in australia,ashlee had marks on her arm that were incontrovertible evidence of some sort of emotional disturbance and that forcing ashlee to return to australia at this time could seriously jeopardize her safety.the report recommended that the court grant eaddy physical custody of ashlee,with visits to occur in san diego until ashlee indicated to her therapist that she felt comfortable traveling to australia.
responded to the social worker report by filing declarations and letters from people who knew ashlee in australia,including ashlee teacher,school principal,family members and a friend.this evidence showed that ashlee was prone to manipulation and lying and that,contrary to what she had told the social worker,she had many friends and relatives in australia,had done well in school and was never suspended or threatened with expulsion several of the declarants also indicated that ashlee did not show any outward signs of being suicidal or engaging in.indicated that eaddy had a spotty history of making his child support payments which started at monthly,but were later increased to a month,and felt that his decision to seek custody of ashlee was based at least in part on financial reasons.
while the custody proceedings were pending,filed a petition for ashlee return with the australian authorities.the matter was ultimately forwarded to the child abduction unit of the san diego county district attorney,which filed the current petition on behalf seeking to have the family court order ashlee return to australia.eaddy did not file any opposition or evidence in response to the convention petition.
in april,the same judge who was presiding over the parties custody proceedings held a hearing on the convention petition.the court indicated that it had reviewed the convention petition,as well as materials submitted in connection with eaddy petition to modify custody and with two additional motions that are not included in the record before this court.the court acknowledged that ashlee desire was to remain in san diego,which she considered to be her home,but also recognized that ashlee described herself as emotionally disturbed and that she was prone to exaggeration.it discussed the family law services counselor report,noting the conclusion that ashlee psychological was at risk of harm if ashlee returned to australia.
the court questioned whether australia was ashlee habitual residence under the law,noting the existence of conflicting published federal cases on that issue it nonetheless concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that returning ashlee to australia would involve a grave risk of emotional harm.it denied the petition on that basis and set the custody petition for hearing in july.appeals the denial of the convention petition.
