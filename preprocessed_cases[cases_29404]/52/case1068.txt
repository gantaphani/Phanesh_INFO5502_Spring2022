a shareholder of a publicly traded corporation filed a derivative action in california alleging breaches of fiduciary duty by corporate officers and directors.the international business,a fine jewelry company incorporated in the british virgin islands,has no other connection to that jurisdiction.the company employs people at its manufacturing facility in china.the majority of the company wholesale revenues are earned in north america,including substantial sales in california,where a few employees are based.the corporate headquarters is in hong kong,where all but one of the company directors reside the sole exception lives in colorado.the apparently does not reside in california,but part of the basis for the action is the issuance in los angeles of allegedly false and misleading financial statements.
a british virgin islands statute requires approval from the high court of that jurisdiction before a shareholder may sue derivatively.here we hold that such approval was required before the instant california lawsuit could proceed.because the plaintiff had no such approval,the trial court properly sustained demurrer without leave to amend.
factual and procedural history 
the following summary is gleaned from the complaint,as well as other sources of which we have taken judicial notice at the request of the parties 
lj international lji is a designer and distributor of fine jewelry which is listed and traded only on the nasdaq national exchange.it services wholesale customers in japan and throughout north america and western europe,and has a growing wholesale and retail presence in china.prior to the time this case arose,most of lji sales were in north america and its functional currency was the dollar 
lji is incorporated in the british virgin islands bvi,but its principal executive office is located in hong kong,where its full time employees include approximately management and executive staff.all but one of lji directors and officers reside in hong kong the company square foot production facility is located in shenzhen,china,where it employees about people.lji only full time employees outside asia are three people based in los angeles 
on october,plaintiff and appellant vaughn filed the instant derivative complaint against lji and its directors appellant asserted breaches of fiduciary duty and other misconduct by the directors based on reports issued between november and october,which allegedly overstated the company and financial results by understating tax liability falsely projected full profitability by the end of and misleadingly predicted the company would meet or exceed its goal of opening retail outlets in china before the start of the olympic games.appellant claimed the false statements resulted in company stock increasing from per share in january to by may.
the complaint further asserts that in june the company again misled investors as to the reasons for a delay in the release of its fourth quarter and first quarter financial results.when further delays were announced in july,investors began to doubt the reliability of previously reported financial results,and the nasdaq threatened to the company stock.on september,lji announced it had not achieved the financial results it had projected in january and february,and that its earnings report would be adversely affected by a tax liability.according to the complaint,this news caused the stock price to fall to less than per share 
respondents motions claiming lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens were denied.respondents demurred on the ground that appellant was not entitled to sue derivatively without leave from the high court of the british virgin islands,as required by section of the british virgin islands business companies act of bvi act.the demurrer was sustained with leave to cure and amend.appellant elected not to seek leave to sue from the bvi high court the parties stipulated to dismissal of the action and this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we engage in a de novo review of a sustained demurrer,based on a reasonable interpretation of the complaint which assumes the truth of all properly pleaded and judicially noticed facts.farm raised salmon cases cal th,fn,d,schuster gardner,supra,th at,d.the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer.young gannon th,d.
the demurrer raised a choice of law issue,whether,assuming california jurisdiction to entertain a derivative lawsuit against a business incorporated outside the united states,a leave to sue provision of the incorporating jurisdiction is applicable.after setting out the provision at issue,we will address each of appellant reasons for contending the trial court erred in ruling that the provision applicable to the present case.
british virgin islands business companies act of 
as noted above,the trial court sustained respondents demurrer on the ground that appellant had not obtained leave to sue from the high court of the british virgin islands,where lji is incorporated.the bvi business companies act,section,provides 
subject to subsection,the court may,on the application of a member of a company,grant leave to that member to a bring proceedings in the name and on behalf of that company or b intervene in proceedings to which the company is a party for the purpose of continuing,defending or discontinuing the proceedings on behalf of the company.
without limiting subsection,in determining whether to grant leave under that subsection,the court must take the following matters into account a whether the member is acting in good faith b whether the derivative action is in the interests of the company taking account of the views of the company directors on commercial matters c whether the proceedings are likely to succeed d the costs of the proceedings in relation to the relief likely to be obtained an e whether an alternative remedy to the derivative claim is available.
leave to bring or intervene in proceedings may be granted under subsection only if the court is satisfied that a the company does not intend to bring,diligently continue or defend,or discontinue the proceedings,as the case may be or b it is in the interests of the company that the conduct of the proceedings should not be left to the directors or to the determination of the shareholders or members as a whole.
unless the court otherwise orders,not less than twenty eight days notice of an application for leave under subsection must be served on the company and the company is entitled to appear and be heard at the hearing of the application.
the court may grant such interim relief as it considers appropriate pending the determination of an application under subsection.
except as provided in this section,a member is not entitled to ring or intervene in any proceedings in the name of or on behalf of a company.
procedure versus substance 
appellant vaughn contends bvi act section has no application here because,as a foreign procedural provision,it should not be applied by the forum in which the litigation is prosecuted.world wide imports,bartel d.see also witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.appellant notes that section imposes no liability and creates no cause of action rather,he argues,because it deals only with the mode of proceeding by which a legal right is enforced,it is not a substantive provision as defined by chavez keat th,d chavez.we disagree for the following reasons.
section by its own terms limits entitlement to sue to those shareholders who have complied with its provisions.although those provisions do establish what may be called a procedure for compliance,the resulting decision as to presence or absence of standing to bring an action is most appropriately characterized as resolving a substantive right.we are not persuaded that standing to sue is a matter of mere court administration or mode of proceeding as argued by appellant.as stated in hausman buckley cir,hausman 
the words substantive and procedural are not talismanic.merely calling a legal question by one or the other does not resolve it.citation.our real inquiry must be directed to the question whether appellant right to bring this action involves no more than compliance with procedural requirements extraneous to the substance of their claim,or whether it concerns the very nature and quality of their substantive rights,powers and privileges as stockholders thus defined,we think it is clear that appellants position can not prevail the issue is not just who may maintain an action or how it will be brought,but if it will be brought.
hausman held that a venezuelan law requirement that a derivative action be approved by a majority of stockholders was substantive,and therefore applicable in a federal proceeding governed by new york procedural law.as in hausman,bvi act section controls the if question,and is a substantive provision.
nothing in the authorities cited by appellant persuades us to the contrary.the abstract formulations of the concepts of procedure and substance cited in appellant quotations from secondary authorities leave much to be desired as solutions to the present dispute.as noted in chavez,the distinction between procedure and substantive law can be shadowy and difficult to draw in practice.chavez,supra,th at,d,quoting witkin,cal.procedure,supra,actions.chavez itself is not helpful here,as it involved a much different question whether california rules concerning proof of punitive damages apply to a federal civil rights action prosecuted in a california court.chavez,supra,th at,d.
appellant also cites an unpublished maryland decision which,even were we to consider its reasoning,is distinguishable because it involved a clearly procedural bvi act requirement that a plaintiff post security for costs as we have indicated,section addresses the substantive issue of standing to sue,rather than an ancillary requirement like security for costs.
finally,appellant notes that california statutes that require court approval before certain claim may be pleaded have been called procedural by the california supreme court in college hospital,superior court cal th,d.appellant pulls the terminology out of context,because the issue in college hospital had nothing to do with the difference between procedural and substantive requirements that is at issue in the present case.id.at,d,issue before the court was the meaning of the phrase substantial probability as used in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.college hospital provides no support for appellant position here.appellant also calls our attention to an unpublished federal district court case which excused a federal plaintiff from complying with california civil code section by classifying it as a procedural rather than substantive requirement the federal court reasoning highlights the distinction between section and the california statutes under discussion.the california statutes are designed to eliminate groundless accusations of various types at the prefiling stage,not to determine standing in a fundamental sense.see shafer berger,kahn,shafton,moss,figler,simon gladstone th,d.unlike section,they control the type of pleadings that may be filed against attorneys,health care professionals and religious corporations.as stated by another federal court,which was speaking about california civil code section,the requirement of a prefiling showing is essentially a method of managing or directing a plaintiff pleadings,rather than a determination of substantive rights.jackson east bay hosp.
to the extent that california statutes which require a prefiling prima facie showing may be said to confer standing to bring a claim,we simply disagree with the federal courts characterization of them as procedural because,as stated above,we view standing to sue as a substantive right.although prefiling requirements which grant or deny standing might be accurately described as hybrids,involving both procedure and substance,they must in our view be considered substantive for purposes of the present dispute.
more persuasive,in our view,are cases involving analogous statutory conditions precedent to a shareholder suit,such as hausman,supra,and cases classifying as substantive a requirement that shareholders make a demand on the board of directors before bringing a derivative action.see kamen kemper financial services,d the function of the demand doctrine in delimiting the respective powers of the individual shareholder and of the directors to control corporate litigation clearly is a matter of substance,not procedure rales blasband,fn.quoting kamen and holding that the demand requirements for a derivative suit are determined by the law of the state of incorporation.
accordingly,the common law substance versus procedure analysis does not assist appellant.that being so,we turn to appellant contentions that principles require california courts to ignore section.
choice of law principles 
although the trial court did not articulate a specific basis for its ruling,respondents opposition papers relied on the internal affairs doctrine as codified in corporations code section.that section provides that the directors of a foreign corporation transacting intrastate business are liable to the corporation,its shareholders,creditors,receiver,liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy for the making of unauthorized dividends,purchase of shares or distribution of assets or false certificates,reports or public notices or other violation of official duty according to any applicable laws of the state or place of incorporation or organization,whether committed or done in this state or elsewhere.such liability may be enforced in the courts of this state.we will discuss the internal affairs doctrine and other potentially applicable choice of law principles raised by the parties.
a.the internal affairs doctrine and corporations code section 
the internal affairs doctrine is a conflict of laws principle which recognizes that only one state should have the authority to regulate a corporation internal peculiar to the relationships among or between the corporation and its current officers,directors,and otherwise a corporation could be faced with conflicting demands.edgar mite,d,quoted with approval in havlicek analytical services,th,d havlicek.states normally look to the state of a business incorporation for the law that provides the relevant corporate governance general standard of care.atherton fdic,d.
corporations code section codifies the modern view of the common law doctrine,whereby a court will entertain an action involving the internal affairs of a foreign corporation.with certain exceptions,the law of the state of incorporation applies.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.corporations,friese superior court th,d as applied to directors liability,section is a codification of the internal affairs doctrine.
thus,in state farm mut.auto.ins.superior court th,d,where policyholders sought to hold defendant state farm liable for not declaring a dividend,the internal affairs doctrine required california courts to apply the law of illinois,where state farm is incorporated.by contrast,in friese superior court,supra,th at,d,the court held that section could not be used as a shield against a suit by a bankrupt corporation trustee alleging liability of former officers and directors for insider trading in violation of california corporate securities law of.the corporation involved in friese,although incorporated in delaware,had its headquarters and principal place of business in san diego,and the securities transactions at issue took place in california.id.at,d.the court of appeal rejected the defense claim that delaware securities regulations were applicable,reasoning that securities regulations designed to protect participants in california securities marketplace are not limited by the internal affairs doctrine.id.at,d.
the witkin treatise makes note that the internal affairs doctrine is sometimes ignored where,despite foreign incorporation,a business books,records and principal operations are located in california.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,corporations.clearly,that line of authority is inapplicable in the present case.even accepting at face value the complaint allegations concerning lji los angeles operations,it can not be said that lji principal operations,let alone its books and records,are located in california or elsewhere in the united states.
whether a permission to sue provision is governed by the internal affairs doctrine as codified in section appears to be a question of first impression in california.the plain meaning of the broad statutory language strongly supports the position of respondents and the trial court ruling.appellant contention that section,by divesting a corporation of authority to control litigation,operates outside a company internal affairs,misses the point.bvi section regulates the liability of directors to shareholders for violations of official duty,exactly as described by section.
appellant reply brief argument,that section was intended to govern only lawsuits filed in the british virgin islands,is unsupported and ignores the reality that most businesses incorporated in the bvi are unlikely to be sued there.like delaware and other similar locations,the bvi is used as a place of incorporation by businesses not located there for a variety of reasons,including enhancing confidence that a predictable legal framework will govern the relationship between investors and the corporation.this is a salutary purpose.as the united states supreme court has stated,th e beneficial free market system depends at its core upon the fact that a in the rarest organized under,and governed by,the law of a single jurisdiction,traditionally the corporate law of the state of incorporation.cts dynamics of america,d.
further,federal circuit courts have resolved very similar issues in respondents favor.in batchelder kawamoto cir,a shareholder in honda of japan attempted to bring a derivative action in california.the court found his standing to sue was governed by the law of japan under the terms of an applicable deposit agreement.id.at.the court then analyzed the case under the internal affairs doctrine,assuming the deposit agreement was inapplicable.the court stated under the internal affairs doctrine,the rights of shareholders in a foreign company,including the right to sue derivatively,are determined by the law of the place where the company is incorporated.see hausman buckley,cir,additional citations omitted.in hausman,the second circuit applied new york law in a diversity case,and concluded that a shareholder standing to sue derivatively was governed by the law of the country of incorporation venezuela pursuant to the internal affairs doctrine.id.at.
seeking to avoid the seemingly straightforward application of these principles to the present matter,appellant first contends that section in no way governs the relationship between lji and its shareholders,directors,officers or agents.we disagree.section,in establishing a condition precedent to the right of a shareholder to derivatively sue corporate directors on behalf of the company,most definitely regulates the internal affairs of the corporation.
appellant next incorrectly cites pratt robert odell d,pratt,for the proposition that former california civil code section,governing loans and obligations incurred by corporate officers applied to a foreign corporation doing business in california.in fact,pratt held the exact opposite.the decision applied former civil code section,the substantively identical predecessor to current corporations code section,the internal affairs doctrine.the court of appeal held the law of the state of incorporation delaware should be applied by california courts to an action by minority shareholders seeking restitution from corporate officers and directors for unlawful expenditures.pratt,supra,d at.thus,when accurately summarized,pratt supports respondents position in the present matter.
we reach a similar conclusion here.pursuant to corporations code section,british virgin islands business companies act,section,requiring approval of the bvi high court,governs appellant vaughn standing to bring his present derivative claims against the corporation and its directors in california.
b.the restatement second of conflict of laws 
in applying the internal affairs doctrine,the witkin treatise and many california cases rely heavily on the restatement second of conflict of laws restatement.see,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.corporations,nedlloyd lines superior court cal th,d,state farm mut.auto.ins.superior court,supra,th at,d.section of the restatement provides 
other issues with respect to powers and liabilities of a corporation issues involving the rights and liabilities of a corporation,other than those dealt with in are determined by the local law of the state which,with respect to the particular issue,has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties under the principles stated in.the local law of the state of incorporation will be applied to determine such issues,except in the unusual case where,with respect to the particular issue,some other state has a more significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties,in which event the local law of the other state will be applied.
restatement section,in turn,provides 
principles a court,subject to constitutional restrictions,will follow a statutory directive of its own state on choice of law.when there no such directive,the factors relevant to the choice of the applicable rule of law include a the needs of the interstate and international systems,b the relevant policies of the forum,c the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue,d the protection of justified expectations,e the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,f certainty,predictability and uniformity of result,and g ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.
with reference to restatement section,subdivision,we have already discussed california codification of the internal affairs doctrine in corporations code section.even putting that statutory directive aside,the factors in restatement section,subdivision favor applying bvi law to the present case.lji is a publicly traded,international corporation in which california has no extraordinary interest.appellant has demonstrated no significant california public policy that will be offended should we affirm the trial court ruling.appellant has not argued that any jurisdiction other than california has a compelling interest in determining the present issues pursuant to its law.factors a,d,f and g in section of the restatement heavily favor applying the law of the state of incorporation in the present case.those factors are addressed in comment e to restatement section 
uniform treatment of directors,officers and shareholders is an important objective which can only be attained by having the rights and liabilities of those persons with respect to the corporation governed by a single law.to the extent that they think about the matter,these persons would usually expect that their rights and duties with respect to the corporation would be determined by the local law of the state of incorporation.this state is also easy to identify,and thus the value of ease of application is attained when the local law of this state is applied.
further,comment g to restatement section states,in part 
i n the absence of an explicitly applicable local statute,the local law of the state of incorporation has almost invariably been applied.this result furthers the factors of certainty,predictability and uniformity of result,ease in the application of the law to be applied and,at least on occasion,protection of the justified expectations of the parties.this last factor is mentioned because parties who deal with a corporation will often expect,to the extent that they think about the matter,that any issue that may arise between them and the corporation will be determined by the local law of the state of incorporation.
we thus conclude that the modern view of the internal affairs doctrine,whether viewed through the prism of the restatement or that of corporations code section,favors application of the law of the incorporating jurisdiction in the present case.
