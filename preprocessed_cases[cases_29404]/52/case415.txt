in this diversity action,sidney jaffe and his wife,ruth jaffe,canadian citizens now living in mexico,seek recognition of two default in favor of sidney jaffe and one in favor of ruth jaffe.a canadian court entered the default judgments against accredited surety casualty,accredited,a florida corporation doing business in virginia.the canadian default judgments arise from the jaffes contention that,after sidney jaffe jumped bail on florida criminal charges,bail bondsmen employed by accredited kidnapped him in canada and illegally transported him to florida for trial.
the district court refused to recognize the canadian default judgments and granted summary judgment to accredited.because we must give full faith and credit to a florida court previous judgment refusing to recognize ruth jaffe canadian default judgment,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to accredited with respect to ruth jaffe default judgment.however,because virginia law is unclear as to whether the claim for relief on which sidney jaffe default judgment is based is repugnant to the public policy of virginia,or otherwise need not be recognized under virginia foreign country recognition act,ann.et.michie,we respectfully certify that question to the supreme court of virginia.
on august,sidney jaffe was arrested in florida and charged with counts of violating the florida uniform land sales practices law,as codified at.stat.ch.et.see jaffe state,so d.these charges stemmed from jaffe involvement in allegedly fraudulent real estate transactions in which he delivered rather than warranty deeds to purchasers of subdivision lots located in putnam county,florida.at the time jaffe was charged with violating the land sales practices law,a civil lawsuit filed by the purchasers of the properties had been pending in florida state court for more than two years.
jaffe was released on bond,which accredited posted on jaffe behalf.jaffe signed a bond agreement with accredited providing that accredited had the right to apprehend,arrest and surrender jaffe in the event jaffe left the florida jurisdiction without the written consent of the court and accredited or if jaffe moved from his residence without notifying accredited.
once free on bail,jaffe fled with family members to toronto,canada,without notifying or obtaining the permission of the court or accredited.jaffe subsequently failed to appear for trial in florida,scheduled for may.at that time,jaffe counsel presented evidence to the florida court that jaffe failure to appear was attributable to a basketball injury jaffe had suffered in canada.the florida court added a failure to appear charge to the original charges against jaffe and issued a warrant for jaffe arrest.the florida court also estreated,or took away,jaffe bond based on his failure to appear.accredited sought to have the estreature set aside,reiterating the representation by jaffe counsel that jaffe failure to appear was due to a basketball injury.on september,the court agreed to set aside the estreature on the condition that accredited produce jaffe within ninety days.
later that month,two accredited bondsmen,posing as police officers,located and apprehended jaffe at his condominium building in toronto,canada,as he returned from jogging.the bondsmen then took jaffe by car across the international border to niagara falls,new york,and returned with him by airplane to florida.jaffe stood trial and,on october,was convicted on all land sales practices counts and one count of failing to appear.see jaffe state,so d at.
a number of legal developments occurred over the course of the next two years,during which jaffe served sentences on the above convictions.first,in april,in the civil action related to the deeds the florida state court entered judgment against jaffe corporations in the amount of million,which was affirmed on appeal.then,in july,jaffe was charged with eight counts of criminal organized fraud,again related to the allegedly fraudulent land deals.see jaffe sanders,so d holding that the prior convictions did not collateral estoppel or double of criminal fraud charges against jaffe.two months later,in september,a state appellate court set aside jaffe convictions on the land sales act convictions due to defective wording in the indictment however,the court upheld his failure to appear conviction.see jaffe state,so d at.that same month,jaffe became eligible for parole on the failure to appear conviction and also filed a letter of credit in lieu of bond in the amount of with respect to the criminal fraud charges.when released the next month on parole,jaffe immediately fled to canada.
florida authorities filed more criminal charges against jaffe in march,while jaffe continued to reside in canada.this time,jaffe was charged with four counts of perjury stemming from answers to interrogatories in both the state civil action and in a subsequent federal civil action brought by jaffe relating to the allegedly fraudulent land deals 
in the meantime,canadian officials took a very jaundiced view of the bondsmen arrest of jaffe,who had since become a canadian citizen,in canada,without notice or surrender to canadian officials.see kear hilton,cir denying habeas relief to accredited bondsman seeking to prevent his extradition to canada for kidnapping jaffe.contrary to the law in each of the united states,in canada a surety must either obtain an order from a canadian court permitting the arrest of the accused or must surrender the accused to canadian peace officers.id.at citing criminal code,ch,can.at the request of canadian authorities,the two accredited bondsmen were extradited to canada and were charged and convicted there of criminal kidnapping.
on september,after a canadian court had convicted the bondsmen,the jaffes filed a civil suit in the ontario court of justice against accredited and its president,hank snow the jaffes alleged that the bondsmen kidnapped sidney jaffe in violation of canadian law,struck jaffe on the head,threatened him with further physical harm,handcuffed him,and threatened to kill members of his family in order to prevent his escaping.in the same action,the jaffes also sued a host of other persons whom they alleged caused or conspired in the wrongful abduction or wrongful imprisonment,including various florida state attorneys,local government and county officials in putnam county,and the attorneys who litigated the civil suit against jaffe corporations.
accredited and snow entered special appearances and filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens the canadian court dismissed that motion.see jaffe miller.accredited and snow elected not to defend further against the action.on november,the canadian court entered two default judgments against in favor of sidney jaffe for in canadian dollars,plus in dollars,plus interest,and a second and separate default judgment in favor of ruth jaffe for in canadian dollars,plus in dollars,plus interest 
on january,ruth jaffe filed an action in florida state court seeking recognition of her canadian default judgment.the florida court refused recognition,reasoning that to do so would contravene florida public policy because florida law favors and sanctions the apprehension of a bond jumper by a surety,like accredited,and because jaffe criminal act in failing to appear constituted the direct cause of the bondsmen actions.jaffe snow,no.ci,at.july,order granting summary judgment.the court concluded that ruth jaffe was not entitled to recognition of her canadian default judgment because the claim upon which it was based was intertwined with,solely derivative of and utterly dependent upon that of her husband.id.for these reasons,the florida trial court granted summary judgment to accredited the florida appellate court affirmed.jaffe snow,so d.
in,a canadian court,after a full trial,issued a comprehensive,decision resolving the jaffes claims as to the remaining defendants in the jaffes canadian action.the same court that previously had entered the default judgments in favor of the jaffes speaking through a different judge dismissed each of the jaffes claims and entered judgment in favor of one defendant on his counterclaim against the jaffes.the canadian court spared little scorn in detailing the jaffes lack of credibility and the minimal foundation supporting their claims as to the earlier default judgments entered against accredited and snow,the court declared that i t strikes me as being wrong that jaffe now has or should obtain a judgment against accredited based on his allegations of kidnapping.the court further stated 
i have no doubt that the other judge of this court granted judgment in favor of both jaffe and jaffe on the basis of misstatements or misrepresentations knowingly made to him and allow ed a recovery of money to which neither of them are entitled.i have a serious concern about this matter and question whether the judgments in favor of the jaffes should now be enforced.i think the matter of their validity should be the subject of further consideration on another occasion.
on november,the jaffes nonetheless filed this enforcement action against accredited in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,after having withdrawn a similar action from a virginia state court in.the jaffes sought enforcement of both canadian default judgments pursuant to the foreign country recognition act,ann.et.
the district court granted summary judgment to accredited.the district court reasoned that the florida court refusal to recognize the canadian default judgment barred ruth jaffe claim for recognition of the same default judgment.the court held that sidney jaffe could not succeed on his claim for recognition of his canadian default judgment because to permit this would be repugnant to virginia public policy and therefore was barred by ann.the district court explained that s uch recovery would be against public policy because it would permit sidney jaffe to benefit from his wrong doing,his,and allow a fugitive to utiliz e the american justice system to his benefit.
both jaffes appeal.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.guinness plc ward,cir.we consider first ruth jaffe claim and then sidney jaffe claim.
the full faith and credit statute,west,governs our disposition of ruth jaffe claim.that statute requires that federal courts afford state court judgments full faith and credit.id.providing that state judicial proceedings shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the united states as they have by law or usage in the courts of such state from which they are taken.
to determine whether the full faith and credit statute applies in a particular case,a court engages in a inquiry.meindl genesys pac,in re genesys data,cir citing marrese am.acad.of orthopaedic surgeons,d.first,we must refer to the preclusion law of the state in which the judgment was rendered to ascertain the preclusive effect of the judgment in that state.heckert dotson in re heckert,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted meindl,at.if the law of that state would not bar relitigation of an issue or claim decided in the earlier proceeding,then the inquiry federal court will not give it preclusive effect either.meindl,at.however,i f state law would afford the judgment preclusive effect then a federal court must engage in a second must determine if congress created an exception to.id.citation omitted.only if federal law provides an exception to can a federal court refuse to give a state court judgment the same preclusive effect given it under the law of that state.id.
we therefore must first determine whether,under florida preclusion law,the florida court judgment refusing to recognize ruth jaffe canadian default judgment bars her claim for recognition of that judgment in the present suit.florida law provides that several conditions must occur simultaneously if a matter is to be made res judicata identity of the thing sued for identity of the cause of action identity of parties identity of the quality in the person for or against whom the claim is made.albrecht state,so d,superseded by statute on other grounds,as stated in bowen florida dep t of envtl,so d.finally,under florida law,the prior cause of action must have been resolved by a final adjudication on the merits.ludovici mckiness,so d,citations omitted.
ruth jaffe does not and indeed can not maintain that the first four prongs of florida res judicata test have not been met.what ruth jaffe claims is that the florida judgment would not be entitled to res judicata under florida law because it is not an adjudication on the merits.id.she asserts that the florida public policy which provided the rationale for the florida to enforce a judgment based on sidney jaffe criminal failure to appear in inconsistent with virginia public policy.for this reason,she argues,a federal court in virginia,sitting in diversity,should hold that the florida court grant of summary judgment to accredited was not on the merits.even assuming that virginia public policy does not accord with florida public policy which is not at all clear,see infra part iii,this contention is meritless.
ruth jaffe reliance on this argument seems to arise from her confusion as to what is at issue in her case.with respect to her claim,we must determine the enforceability of the prior florida judgment refusing to enforce her canadian default judgment,not the enforceability of the canadian default judgment itself.neither the full faith and credit statute,nor the full faith and credit clause of the constitution,applies to judgments issued from foreign countries.see miller miller,cir citations omitted guinness,at.accordingly,while both federal and state courts in the united states must give full faith and credit to any judgment of a state court empowered to enter the judgment,see baker motors,d,they need only recognize the judgment of a foreign court to the extent that this recognition comports with principles of judicial comity.see hilton guyot.
for this reason,a state can refuse,as florida did,to recognize a foreign judgment on the ground that it conflicts with the public policy of that state.id.at.herron passailaigue,so,stating that a state court could refuse to enforce judgment from foreign country if contrary to some paramount rule of public policy see also uniform foreign recognition act of et,providing that a foreign country money judgment need not be recognized if,among other reasons,the claim for relief on which the judgment is based is repugnant to the public policy of this state.
but neither a state nor a federal court can refuse to give full faith and credit to the judgment of a state court because of disagreement with the public policy basis for that decision.indeed,the supreme court recently addressed this precise question and reiterated that its decisions support no roving public policy exception to the full faith and credit due state court judgments.baker,at.original emphasis omitted see also estin estin.magnolia petroleum hunt.fauntleroy lum.thus,even if florida public policy on this issue is contrary to virginia public policy,this provides no basis for a state or federal court in virginia to refuse to give a florida judgment based on its public policy full faith and credit.
ruth jaffe simply ignores this precedent and argues that because the florida judgment is based on florida public policy,it,like some rule b dismissals on limitations grounds,see semtek int l lockheed martin,d,is not a judgment on the merits for res judicata purposes.even if the line of supreme court cases from fauntleroy to baker did not apparently foreclose this argument,we would have to reject it.this is so because under florida law,even an involuntary dismissal on limitations or other grounds,except for a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or for improper venue or for lack of an indispensable party.civ.b,does constitute an adjudication on the merits for res judicata purposes.see.jur d judgments and decrees under the civil procedure rule governing involuntary dismissals a final judgment of dismissal is a final adjudication on the merits,and will bar a subsequent suit on the same cause of action between the same parties unless it affirmatively appears from the order of dismissal that it was made without prejudice.citations omitted see also,allie ionata,so d,holding that dismissal on limitations grounds is a dismissal on the merits under.civ.b and constitutes an adjudication on the merits for res judicata purposes.
accordingly,we must conclude that florida law would afford the florida court grant of summary judgment to accredited preclusive effect in any subsequent identical action,like the one at hand,brought by ruth jaffe.
we now proceed to the second step of our inquiry in resolving whether the full faith and credit statute,applies of whether congress has created a statutory exception to that permits relitigation of ruth jaffe claim.a court will recognize an exception to only if a later federal statute contains an express or implied partial repeal of an implied repeal requires an irreconcilable conflict between the two federal statutes.kremer chem.constr,d.the supreme court has noted that it has seldom,if ever,held that a federal statute impliedly repealed due to the relatively stringent standard for such findings.matsushita indus.epstein,d.
ruth jaffe has identified no statute that explicitly or implicitly repeals and so the second step of our analysis can be easily resolved.see meindl genesys pac,in re genesys,cir citations omitted.we can only conclude that congress has not repealed to create some exception in this case rather,the full faith and credit statute must be honored here.hence,the district court properly held that the prior florida judgment,refusing to recognize ruth jaffe canadian default judgment,must be given full faith and credit.
sidney jaffe claim seeking enforcement of his canadian default judgment presents a more difficult question.sidney jaffe too seeks recognition and enforcement of his canadian default judgment pursuant to virginia foreign country recognition act the act,ann.et.michie.the act,which parallels in relevant part the uniform foreign recognition act,provides that a foreign country money judgment is enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state which is entitled to full faith and credit.id.
as a condition to enforcement,however,a court must first establish that the foreign country money judgment should be recognized.see guinness plc ward,at interpreting maryland version of the uniform recognition of foreign act matusevitch telnikoff,aff,stating that pursuant to the uniform judgments recognition act,b efore a party can enforce a judgment from a foreign country in the united states,the moving party must have the foreign judgment recognized by the state in which he is seeking to enforce the judgment.a judgment that need not be recognized is not entitled to enforcement.
in relevant part,the act provides that a foreign country money judgment need not be recognized if t he claim for relief on which the judgment is based is repugnant to the public policy of this commonwealth.ann.b.we have found no cases from virginia courts applying the act public policy exception.we nonetheless look to virginia case law to determine if we can discern whether a virginia court would hold that the basis for jaffe canadian judgment is repugnant to an important public policy manifested in virginia law.
accredited principally contends that,as the district court held,recognition of sidney jaffe canadian default judgment would be repugnant to virginia public policy for two interrelated reasons.to recognize sidney jaffe default judgment would,accredited maintains,be contrary to virginia public policy because it would permit a wrongdoer to benefit from his own wrongs and allow a fugitive from justice to call upon the resources of the courts while simultaneously evading their process.
the supreme court of virginia has consistently refused to allow a party to profit from its own wrongdoing.chosar owens,see edwards lowry,refusing to reduce a father child support obligation where his changed from his the consequenc e of his own wrongdoing mcneir mcneir,refusing to award support payments when she admitted to fraudulently obtaining a divorce because it would offend a principle of law,that one can not profit by one own wrong eagle,star british dominions ins.heller,refusing to allow arsonist to recover under fire insurance policy for goods he intentionally burned.
when this principle is applied to actions in tort consent or participation in an immoral or unlawful act by plaintiff precludes recovery for injuries sustained as a result of that act.miller bennett,see also zysk zysk,stating that in a tort action,consent,freely given without fraud or duress,bars recovery,even though the conduct constitutes a crime because courts will not assist the participant in an illegal act who seeks to profit from the act commission trace mountain,special data,wl at.cir,ruling that corporate directors who fail to keep accurate records can not profit from uncertainty created by their own wrongdoing.
applying this rule,the supreme court of virginia has denied relief when t he very illegal act to which the plaintiff consented and in which she participated produced the injuries and damages of which she complains.zysk,at holding that a wife could not recover against her husband for disease contracted from him prior to marriage because she participated in and consented to unlawful premarital intercourse see also miller,at ruling that a husband,as administrator of deceased wife estate,could not maintain a wrongful death action based on an attempted abortion because his wife had participated in and consented to the unlawful abortion.
on the other hand,virginia highest court has held that this principle does not bar recovery if the plaintiff unlawful act is not the direct cause of his injuries.godbolt brawley,matthews warner,stating that trial court was not required to instruct jury that if it found that the death of the deceased was the result of his own misconduct or neglect,then the jury must find for the defendant.for example,godbolt held that the plaintiff could maintain a civil action for assault against a security guard who shot him during a bar brawl,despite the plaintiff participation in the brawl,because although the plaintiff may have intentionally engaged in assaultive behavior,he did not engage in the use of deadly force and did not consent to its use.godbolt,at.
we can not determine from these precedents whether the virginia courts would permit jaffe to recover against accredited for wrongful abduction when jaffe own illegal to accredited actions in apprehending him.under virginia law,jaffe instigating act of jumping bail constitutes a felony,see ann.michie,and,therefore,an illegal and wrongful act furthermore,like the plaintiffs in zysk and miller,jaffe expressly manifested his consent to the very conduct undertaken by the defendants that caused injury.jaffe did this by consenting,in the bond agreement,to accredited right to apprehend,arrest and surrender him if he left florida without accredited permission or moved from his residence without notifying accredited nonetheless,a virginia court might conclude that jaffe act of jumping bail and fleeing to canada was not a sufficiently direct cause of his alleged injuries,as required by the godbolt rule,to apply the principle that a party can not profit from his own wrongdoing.
similarly,we can not determine whether virginia courts would preclude jaffe underlying claim as contrary to public policy based on the fugitive from justice doctrine.pursuant to that doctrine,also known as the fugitive disentitlement doctrine,a court may dismiss an appeal or writ of certiorari if the party seeking relief is a fugitive while the matter is pending.degen united states,d see also united states,d stating that the supreme court has upheld the doctrine consistently and unequivocally.a court has discretion in determining whether to apply the doctrine,which is equitable rather than jurisdictional in nature.see molinaro new jersey,d.
federal courts have adopted the doctrine,see,goya foods,cir prevot prevot in re prevot,cir,as have some state courts.see,in re.other states have established the doctrine by statute or rule.see state bell,citing authorities see also,estelle dorrough,d.
