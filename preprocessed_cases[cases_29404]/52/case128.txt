the united states filed this interpleader action to resolve competing claims to more than million seized from a bank account held by kesten development corporation kesten,an entity incorporated in the british virgin islands.on this appeal,tammy fu and eleanor fisher,as liquidators of trade and commerce bank liquidators,a cayman islands bank,challenge the award of summary judgment entered on october,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york thomas griesa,judge,in favor of the federative republic of brazil brazil.see united states barry fischer law firm,llc,civ,wl.the district court concluded that a forfeiture judgment entered by a brazilian court pursuant to brazil successful criminal prosecution of kesten former principals and owners took precedence over the liquidators cayman islands civil default judgment against kesten.in so holding,the court rejected the liquidators invocation of the penal law rule,a common law principle whereby a sovereign in this case,the united states generally declines to enforce the criminal laws of another nation.
for the reasons explained in this opinion,we conclude that the penal law rule precludes awarding summary judgment in favor of brazil based on a forfeiture judgment of that sovereign grounded in a violation of brazil penal laws.at the same time,however,we recognize that which permits the united states attorney general,upon request of a foreign nation pursuant to a mutual forfeiture assistance treaty,to petition a united states court to enforce a foreign forfeiture judgment is a statutory exception to the penal law rule.while no request from brazil is presently before the attorney general,that nation counsel advised this court at oral argument that,if the challenged summary judgment decision were vacated based on the penal law rule,brazil would promptly file a petition pursuant to the nations mutual legal assistance treaty.
accordingly,while we conclude that the penal law rule requires vacatur of summary judgment in favor of brazil,we remand this case to the district court with instructions that it afford brazil and the attorney general a reasonable period of time to satisfy exception to that rule before reaching a final decision in this interpleader action.
background 
the background to this appeal is complex,involving criminal and civil litigation over years in the courts of four countries the united states,brazil,the cayman islands,and the british virgin islands.
a.the united states seizure of the funds at issue and its own unsuccessful forfeiture litigation 
in january,federal agents,acting pursuant to a warrant,seized approximately million in purported drug proceeds from a bank account in kesten name at the new york branch of mtb bank venus account.in june,the united states commenced a civil forfeiture action in the district of new jersey pursuant to,maintaining that the seized funds were proceeds of violations of united states money laundering laws while the district court initially granted forfeiture,the third circuit vacated judgment and remanded,whereupon the district court granted kesten motion to dismiss,holding that the government had failed to demonstrate probable cause to think that the funds in the venus account were proceeds of unlawful conduct and ordered return of the monies to kesten.see united states in currency,d,vacated and remanded,cir see id.civ.jwb,dist.lexis,at july,granting dismissal 
brazil initial effort to restrain the venus account funds 
meanwhile,brazilian authorities were investigating kesten principal pires and his associates for money laundering,tax evasion,fraud,and other financial crimes violative of brazilian penal law.in december,on the basis of prosecutors representations that pires and his confederates used kesten and other entities as shell companies to launder illicit proceeds,a brazilian court issued a seizure warrant for the venus account.soon thereafter,brazil requested assistance from the united states in executing its warrants pursuant to the nations mutual legal assistance treaty.see treaty between the government of the united states of america and the government of the federative republic of brazil on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters,u,treaty doc.
upon receipt of brazil request,the attorney general moved in the district of columbia,pursuant to,for a temporary restraining order on the funds in the venus account on january,the district court granted the motion,finding that the united states had demonstrated a substantial probability that brazil would succeed in its forfeiture action against pires.
the restraining order apparently remained in effect until september,when the united states moved for,and the district court ordered,vacatur in light of in re any and all funds or other assets,in brown.harriman.account in the name of tiger eye invs.tiger eye.in that unrelated case,the court of appeals interpreted,as then in effect,to permit the issuance of temporary restraining orders only after a foreign court has entered a forfeiture judgment.id.at emphasis in original.because the venus account was restrained on the basis of a brazilian warrant issued prior to the entry of any forfeiture judgment,the restraining order on the venus account could no longer stand consistent with tiger eye 
liquidators litigation 
separate from the described proceedings,in,the liquidators commenced a cayman islands action against arthur anderson llp,the former auditor of trade and commerce bank tcb,to recover funds purportedly misappropriated by tcb directors as part of a laundering scheme.in october,the grand court of the cayman islands dismissed the suit based on the doctrine of unclean hands,concluding that tcb had actively participated in its directors fraud.
in august,the liquidators sued kesten in the british virgin islands,alleging that tcb directors had funneled over million from the bank through kesten in an attempt to launder the allegedly misappropriated funds.when kesten failed to appear in that action,the british virgin islands court entered a default judgment in the amount of in favor of the liquidators.
the liquidators sought to domesticate that default judgment in the united states by filing suit against kesten in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.once again,kesten failed to appear,and on october,the bankruptcy court entered judgment in the full amount in favor of the liquidators.
interpleader action 
on october,approximately one month after vacatur of the district of columbia restraining order on the venus account,and approximately one week before the liquidators domesticated their default judgment against kesten the united states filed the instant interpleader action pursuant to.acknowledging various parties competing claims to the venus account funds seized more than a decade earlier,the united states asked the district court to determine to whom the money should be paid.with respect to claims by brazil,the united states alleged that the criminal actions against pires and his associates in that country were near completion,and that once the brazilian court enters a forfeiture judgment against the funds,brazil would again ask the united states,pursuant to its treaty obligations,to enforce the forfeiture judgment.interpleader compl.
brazilian judgment 
on february,the sixth specialized federal court of são paulo são paulo court entered a single judgment convicting pires of fraudulent mismanagement of a financial institution,finding the funds in the venus account to represent the proceeds of pires scheme,and ordering the venus account funds forfeited brazilian judgment.on february,after both sides appealed,pires died,prompting the brazilian appellate court to extinguish his personal criminal liability 
f.the challenged summary judgment award 
in the interpleader action,brazil and the liquidators filed for summary judgment.brazil sought transfer of the funds in the venus account to the são paulo court for it to hold pending resolution of the appeal of the brazilian judgment.brazil argued that its right to the venus account funds accrued when pires committed his financial crime and,in any event,the brazilian judgment collaterally estops the liquidators claims.the liquidators maintained that an award of summary judgment to brazil would violate the penal law rule prohibition on one sovereign enforcing another nation criminal laws.they also contested brazil invocation of collateral estoppel,arguing that neither the liquidators nor kesten was a party to the brazilian criminal action,and the brazilian judgment is not final as it is subject to de novo review on appeal.
the district court granted brazil summary judgment motion and denied that of the liquidators.it concluded that there was no genuine dispute that kesten was a shell company dominated by pires and his criminal,implying that the são paulo court findings against those individuals could thus be imputed to the corporation that they controlled.see united states barry fischer law firm,llc,wl,at.therefrom,the district court concluded that collateral estoppel prevented the liquidators,asserting kesten rights as its,from challenging the são paulo court determination that brazil is entitled to the venus account funds.the court held that the penal law rule did not preclude judgment in favor of brazil because it was not directly appl ying brazilian law,and,therefore,its award would not impinge upon brazil sovereignty or punish a party based upon a misapplication of foreign law.id.at.the district court ordered the united states to transfer the funds seized from the venus account to the são paulo court,but stayed that order pending this appeal.
ii.discussion 
we review an award of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.lynch city of new york,cir.when we do that here,we conclude,as a matter of law,that the penal law rule did not permit the district court to grant summary judgment in favor of brazil based on a criminal forfeiture judgment in the absence of a petition by the attorney general.accordingly,we vacate the award of summary judgment.
a.the penal law rule 
the penal law rule is an exception to the generally recognized principle of international comity that one nation affords recognition within its territory to the legislative,executive,or judicial acts of another nation.hilton guyot,accord,figueiredo ferraz e engenharia de projecto ltda.republic of peru,cir.the penal law rule was first invoked by the supreme court in the antelope,wheat,when chief justice marshall categorically pronounced that t he courts of no country execute the penal laws of another,id.at.the rule derives from a corollary to the presumptive equality of nations that informs international law,that no nation can prescribe a rule for others.id.at.recognizing the pronouncement of criminal rules to be a significant expression of national sovereignty,the common law had thus long understood that acts were punished as crimes only by the state or nation whose laws were violated.robert leflar,note,extrastate enforcement of penal and governmental claims,harv.
since the antelope,the supreme court has continued to treat the penal law rule as an incontrovertible maxim.wisconsin pelican ins,stating that penal laws of one sovereign can not be enforced by the courts of another country,overruled in part on other grounds by milwaukee cnty.white,holding that constitution full faith and credit clause requires american states to recognize their respective tax judgments see,pasquantino united states,recognizing rule against the enforcement of foreign penal statutes announced in the antelope banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,reciting principle enunciated in federal and state cases that a court need not give effect to the penal or revenue laws of foreign countries or sister states oklahoma ex rel.west gulf,santa fe ry,identifying rule that the courts of no country execute the penal laws of another internal quotation marks omitted.
our own court has followed suit,with learned hand expanding on the rule rationale.judge hand explained the danger in requiring united states courts to pass upon the provisions for the public order of another state,something that is,or at any rate should be,beyond the powers of a court.moore mitchell,cir,concurring,aff on other grounds.judge hand further noted that enforcement of foreign criminal laws would enmesh courts in the relations between the states themselves,a matter outside judicial competence and,in any event,intrusted to other authorities under our system of separation of powers.see also oklahoma ex rel.west gulf,santa fe ry,at holding that penal law rule applies not only to prosecutions and sentences for crimes and misdemeanors,but to all suits in favor of the state for the recovery of pecuniary penalties for any violation of statutes for the protection of its revenue or other municipal laws,and to all judgments for such penalties emphasis removed internal quotation marks omitted attorney of can.reynolds tobacco holdings,cir expounding upon justifications for revenue rule,including respect for sovereignty,concern for judicial role and competence,and separation of powers.
while judicial recognition of the penal law rule has been,the rule scope has sometimes required clarification.thus,in wisconsin pelican insurance,the supreme court explained that the penal law rule applied not only to prosecutions and sentences for crimes and misdemeanors,but also to any proceeding compelling the offender to pay a pecuniary fine by way of punishment for a criminal offense.at.in huntington attrill,the supreme court explained further that a penal law is one where the wrong sought to be redressed is a wrong to the public rather than to the individual,that is,a law punish ing an offense against the public justice of the state as opposed to afford ing a private remedy to a person injured by the wrongful act,id.at,accord la ligue contre le racisme et,cir en banc see also banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,at stating that for purposes of penal law rule,penal law is one which seeks to redress a public rather than a private wrong 
applying the penal law rule to this case 
when we apply the principles just discussed to this case,we conclude that the penal law rule barred the district court from granting summary judgment in favor of brazil and ordering transfer of the disputed funds to the são paulo court.
the sole basis for the district court decision,as brazil itself concedes,was the brazilian judgment resulting from the pires criminal prosecution.see appellee br.as a result of the pires defendants convictions,the são paulo court issued a judgment finding that the venus account funds were derived from crimes committed against brazil.in that single judgment,the são paulo court not only found pires and his guilty of charged crimes and imposed incarceratory sentences,but also determined that monies in the venus account were forfeitable to brazil pursuant to that country penal code ii b,because the funds derived from and,thus,represent proceeds of,proved violations of brazil penal laws.brazilian,supplemental app.thus,brazil request to transfer the funds seized from the venus account to its são paulo court is properly understood to seek enforcement of that country penal laws in order to redress a public,and not simply a private,wrong.see banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,at wisconsin.pelican ins,at.
in urging otherwise,brazil contends that the forfeiture judgment is more akin to a civil in rem award,not subject to the penal law rule.we are not persuaded.
first,for an action to be in rem,the property at issue generally must itself be located within the jurisdiction of the ordering court.see wisconsin pelican ins,at referencing in rem forfeiture awards respecting specific property within court jurisdiction see generally united states james daniel good real,stating that to institute and perfect proceedings in rem,the thing should be actually or constructively within the reach of the court internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.the funds seized from the venus account were not located within the jurisdiction of the são paulo court at the time of the forfeiture judgment at issue rather,the funds were within the jurisdiction of the united states.thus,it is by no means clear that the forfeiture provision of the brazilian judgment can reasonably be viewed as an in rem award.
second,and in any event,courts have long recognized that,for purposes of the penal law rule,w hat matters is not the form of the action,but the substance of the claim.attorney of can.reynolds tobacco holdings,at see wisconsin pelican ins,at.thus,at the same time the supreme court stated that a country in rem forfeiture awards will be recognized and upheld in the courts of any other country in which the title to the property is brought in issue,it cautioned that recognition of a vested title in property is quite different from the enforcement of a claim for a pecuniary penalty.wisconsin pelican ins,at emphasis added donnelly faa,upholding recognition of japanese criminal conviction as evidence in domestic proceeding.in this interpleader action,brazil does not ask the district court simply to recognize the existence of its forfeiture judgment rather,brazil seeks the district court assistance in enforcing that judgment by transferring funds presently within the united states to brazil in short,brazil asks the united states to surrender its own in rem jurisdiction over the venus account to brazil,an essential step in the enforcement of that country forfeiture judgment and the penal laws that inform it.see attorney of can.reynolds tobacco holdings,at recognizing that revenue and penal law rules bar claims for indirect as well as direct enforcement.
united states ursery,upon which brazil relies,is not to the contrary.there,the supreme court held that the double jeopardy clause of the united states constitution does not bar law enforcement officials of this country from pursuing a civil in rem forfeiture proceeding after a criminal prosecution because such an in rem proceeding is not a second punishment of the individual defendant for purposes of double jeopardy.see id.at.the supreme court had no occasion in ursery to consider,much less decide,whether a foreign forfeiture judgment is nevertheless penal for purposes of the penal law rule.nor did it have occasion to consider that question where,as here,forfeiture did not follow conviction but,rather,was decided with conviction in a single criminal proceeding and pronounced in a single criminal judgment.
nevertheless,ursery does lend some support to application of the penal law rule in this case by reiterating a point made over sixty years earlier in various items of personal property united states,an in rem forfeiture proceeding does enforce penal laws,but it does so against property rather than persons.it is the property which is proceeded against,and,by resort to a legal fiction,held guilty and condemned as though it were conscious instead of inanimate and insentient.united states ursery,at quoting various items of personal prop.united states,u.at.the penal law rule is not concerned with this distinction between property and persons.its focus is the infringement on sovereignty that occurs when one country seeks to punish an offense against the public justice of another state.huntington attrill,at.that concern is as present in the brazilian judgment enforcement of the nation penal laws against property as against persons.thus,we conclude that the penal law rule applies to brazil efforts to seek united states enforcement of its forfeiture judgment by transferring the funds at issue from the united states to brazil.
brazil asserts that the penal law rule should not apply where,as here,it is an interpleader defendant in a suit initiated by the united states,with which it has a mutual legal assistance treaty.to the extent brazil thus suggests that the united states commencement of an interpleader action somehow evinces the executive branch recognition of brazil entitlement to the venus account funds,we are not persuaded.an interpleader suit,by its very nature,identifies various possible claimants to the funds at issue,but leaves it to the court to decide which,if any,have a valid claim.indeed,to construe the united states commencement of this interpleader action as brazil urges would be to sanction bypassing the procedure set forth in,which,as we explain below,is a statutory exception to the penal law rule created by congress for enforcing foreign forfeiture judgments.this we decline to do.see generally attorney of can.reynolds tobacco holdings,at observing,in case involving revenue rule,that tax treaty between canada and united states confirms that canada has other,more appropriate,avenues by which to pursue claims.
at the same time that we conclude that the penal law rule requires us to vacate the district court award of summary judgment in favor of brazil,we recognize that brazil might satisfy the requirements of a exception,a possibility we discuss in the next section of this opinion to explain our instructions on remand.
the statutory exception to the penal law rule 
a common law principle,such as the penal law rule,may be abrogated by statute,provided the statute speaks directly to the point addressed by the common law.see united states texas,stating that statutes that invade common law must be read with presumption favoring retention of,familiar principles,except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident internal quotation marks omitted rosado civiletti,cir n othing in the doctrine enunciated by chief justice marshall in the antelope precludes a sovereign power from extending recognition to another penal laws where it chooses to do so.title speaks directly to the question addressed by the penal law rule,courts ability to enforce a foreign nation penal laws.the statute expressly authorizes a united states district court,subject to the requirements set forth in,to enforce a foreign forfeiture or confiscation judgment,defined to include judgments compelling the payment of proceeds from foreign crimes.a,c.
moreover,grants such authority subject to conditions that alleviate various concerns informing judicial adherence to the penal law rule.see moore mitchell,at,concurring accord attorney of can.reynolds tobacco holdings,at.specifically,by limiting courts enforcement authority to nations that are subject to certain international agreements or treaties and that satisfy certain statutory conditions,reserves to the legislature and the executive,the branches of government entrusted with foreign policy responsibility,the sovereign task of identifying those countries whose criminal laws the united states will consider enforcing.further,by vesting sole discretion in the attorney general to decide which particular foreign enforcement petitions to pursue,ensures that the executive alone will weigh the foreign affairs implications of any enforcement action.see b mandating that attorney general decision as to whether,in the interest of justice,to certify the request for enforcement of a foreign forfeiture judgment shall be final and not subject to either judicial review or review under the administrative procedure act.moreover,if the attorney general initiates an enforcement action,cabins the judiciary enforcement discretion by directing that district courts shall grant enforcement of a foreign judgment unless jurisdiction or due process concerns are evident,matters falling comfortably within the sphere of judicial competence to assess.see id.d 
thus,we construe to establish a statutory exception to the penal law rule for foreign judgments falling within its terms.
at oral argument,counsel for brazil represented that,if this court were to vacate the award of summary judgment in its favor based on the penal law rule,it would promptly petition the united states to initiate a proceeding.there is no reason to doubt the representation brazil petitioned for assistance with respect to the venus account in,see supra at,and has done so in other proceedings,see,in re seizure of approximately and accrued interest in currency,d.thus,we remand this case to the district court with instructions that it afford brazil a reasonable period of time to request and the attorney general a reasonable period of time to file a enforcement action.if brazil fails,or if the attorney general declines,to do so,the district co
