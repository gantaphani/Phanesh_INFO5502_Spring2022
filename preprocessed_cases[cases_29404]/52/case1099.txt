introduction 
plaintiffs,dial,llc,a california limited liability company and dial,a california corporation,appeal from an order dismissing their interpleader action filed pursuant to code of civil procedure section against defendants,david fesbinder,brenda fesbinder the fesbinders,michael rosenblum,and perpetual international trading limited perpetual,a seychelles corporation.perpetual is wholly owned by rosenblum.defendants are involved in a dispute over ownership interests of shares in plaintiffs.defendants made conflicting demands to plaintiffs for a distribution of funds in the amount of.immediately after plaintiffs filed the interpleader action,they deposited the funds into the superior court.plaintiffs sought discharge from liability against any claims by defendants for refusing to disburse the money.the fesbinders have joined plaintiffs opening brief on appeal requesting that the order dismissing the interpleader action be reversed.
rosenblum,who is a united states citizen and resident of israel,has not filed a respondent brief on appeal.however,in the trial court,rosenblum and perpetual moved to quash service of the summons and complaint of the interpleader action for lack of personal jurisdiction.in dismissing the action,the trial court refused to adjudicate the absence of personal jurisdiction contentions posited by rosenblum and his wholly owned corporation,perpetual.rather,the trial court dismissed the interpleader action sua sponte based on a private agreement by defendants to arbitrate their dispute over the ownership of the shares in plaintiffs in israel.plaintiffs are not a party to the defendants arbitration agreement.the trial judge found that the existence an arbitration clause in defendants agreements deprived the california superior court of jurisdiction to resolve the issues raised in the interpleader action.in so ruling,the trial court relied on the fact the arbitration before three rabbis was being conducted in israel.
we reach four conclusions which we will discuss later in some detail.first,the sua sponte order dismissing plaintiffs interpleader action must be reversed because the trial judge erroneously ruled that the private contractual agreement among defendants to arbitrate their dispute before a religious tribunal in israel deprived the los angeles superior court of subject matter jurisdiction.second,the trial court is to allow defendants to litigate the merits of the interpleader complaint after the remittitur issues.third,if plaintiffs discharge motion is granted,the trial court may exercise its discretion and decide whether to stay the remainder of the interpleader action which will ultimately resolve the allocation of the disputed funds among defendants pending the outcome of the arbitration in israel.fourth,the trial court is to deny the motion to quash on jurisdictional grounds brought by rosenblum and perpetual.they have sought attorney fees as the prevailing parties in the present interpleader lawsuit after the trial court dismissed the action on grounds entirely unrelated to personal jurisdiction issues,thereby submitting to the jurisdiction of the los angeles superior court.
ii.background 
on july,the fesbinders filed a petition for a court order to appoint a third arbitrator in the israeli arbitration.fesbinder rosenblum,july,no.the petition alleged that the fesbinders and rosenblum and perpetual entered into a securities and voting rights purchase agreement on july.the fesbinders and rosenblum are all israeli residents.according to the petition,the fesbinders were to sell and transfer securities and voting rights in plaintiffs to rosenblum and perpetual for.the funds were payable to a trustee in three equal installments of due july,and march,and july.the july,purchase agreement provided that notices were to be sent to the attorneys for the parties.all notices and communications were to be sent on behalf of rosenblum and perpetual to barry burten,an attorney with law firm of jeffers,mangels,butler marmaro in los angeles.notices and other communications to the fesbinders were to be sent to stacy sokol,an attorney in beverly hills,california.the july,purchase agreement also contains an arbitration clause which states any controversy or dispute arising out of this agreement shall be submitted through rabbi shuchatowitz upon the mutual consent of the parties or,if no such consent has been reached,to an orthodox bais din selected through the process of zavla bais din for binding resolution.if permitted by the bais din and applicable law,the decision of the bais din may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction and enforced according to the laws of such jurisdiction.further,the parties entered into a trust agreement to handle the transactions which were to occur under the july,purchase contract.the trust agreement provided that any dispute concerning a default was to be resolved as follows,any determination hereto made by the trustee as to the rights of the parties pursuant to this trust agreement shall be binding upon the parties and enforceable as an arbitration award in any court of competent jurisdiction in israel or in los angeles county,california.the trust agreement required notices to go to the same attorneys in los angeles and beverly hills,california as the july,purchase contract.paragraph of the trust agreement states,this trust shall be construed,administered and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of california.
a dispute arose between the parties to the july,agreement after the first installment was paid.the parties ultimately entered into an arbitration agreement that required resolution of the disputes between the parties would be resolved by a panel of three orthodox jewish rabbis.the arbitration agreement provided for the selection of three arbitrators.the first arbitrator was to be chosen by the fesbinders.the second arbitrator was to be selected by rosenblum and perpetual.the third arbitrator was to be chosen by the other two selected by the parties.the arbitration proceedings began before the panel of three arbitrators on july.however,before a final decision was reached,the arbitrator selected by rosenblum and perpetual resigned.the parties then became embroiled in a dispute over the appointment of a successor arbitrator.this led to the fesbinders filing on july,the aforementioned petition for appointment of a third arbitrator in the aforementioned case.the fesbinders petition,filed in los angeles superior court,sought appointment of the arbitrator on the grounds the securities are partnership interests in a california limited partnership and shares in a california corporation which served as the general partner of the limited partnership voting rights of the partnership and corporation are involved and paragraph of the trust agreement calls for the trust to be governed by california law.on september,rosenblum and perpetual moved to quash service of summons and petition for appointment of the third arbitrator for lack of personal jurisdiction.the motion to quash was made on the ground the california court lacked personal jurisdiction over rosenblum,an israeli resident,and perpetual which is a seychelles corporation.plaintiff is not a party to the arbitration clauses at issue in the proceeding filed by the fesbinders seeking the appointment of a third arbitrator.
on october,plaintiffs filed their interpleader complaint.the interpleader complaint alleged that plaintiffs hold and are required to distribute the sum of to the appropriate member of the limited liability company.however,the fesbinders and rosenblums had made conflicting demands for the funds with accompanying threats of lawsuits for failure to distribute the funds or for the distribution to the inappropriate party.plaintiffs alleged they were indifferent with respect to which defendants are entitled to the funds.after filing the complaint,plaintiffs deposited with the court clerk.
on october,the fesbinders filed,in the present interpleader action,a motion to compel arbitration and for a stay.the fesbinders sought to stay the present interpleader lawsuit until after the arbitration had been completed.on november,the trial court ordered the arbitration petition proceeding and the interpleader action consolidated.on november,plaintiffs filed a motion for discharge and attorney fees.plaintiffs also filed a limited opposition to the motion to compel arbitration and stay the pending interpleader action.plaintiffs indicated that they only opposed a stay of its hearing on and resolution of the discharge motion.this was so that plaintiffs,consistent with the interpleader statutes,could be released from liability to defendant.on november,rosenblum and perpetual filed a motion to quash service of the summons and interpleader complaint for defective service and lack of personal jurisdiction.
after the parties filed a number of responsive pleadings,the trial court raised several issues in minute orders dated january and,for which it requested additional briefing.the issues concerned whether a california court had jurisdiction to appoint a foreign national to a religious court to privately arbitrate according to religious law outside the united states section allows the trial court to enforce an award from a foreign country and confirmation of an award by a religious court according to religious law would violate the fundamental notion of separation of church and state.the parties briefed these issues.in their papers,the fesbinders withdrew its petition for an order appointing a third arbitrator.
on february,the trial court denied plaintiffs motion for discharge and attorney fees.the trial court also denied the fesbinders motion to compel arbitration and for a stay.the trial court then dismissed the interpleader complaint and the petition to compel appointment of an arbitrator.on february,plaintiffs filed a reconsideration motion.however,plaintiffs subsequently withdrew the reconsideration motion as moot.this was because the trial court entered dismissal orders as to both the consolidated interpleader complaint and the petition for appointment of a third arbitrator actions on march,which was prior to the hearing on the reconsideration motion.
on march,plaintiffs filed a new trial motion.on march,rosenblum and perpetual filed a motion to fix the amount of attorney fees awardable as costs as the prevailing party of a contract in the interpleader action and arbitrator appointment proceeding.on april,plaintiffs requested judicial notice of the fact that the request for attorney fees was a general appearance.the trial court denied the new trial motion on april.also,the trial court denied the attorney fees motion of rosenblum and perpetual.plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the dismissal order on may.
iii.discussion 
subject matter.the interpleader law 
plaintiffs contend the order dismissing its interpleader action must be reversed because the trial court erroneously concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.subject matter jurisdiction is conferred by constitutional or statutory law.in re marriage of jensen th,d marlow campbell th,d.the california supreme court has defined subject matter jurisdiction thusly subject matter jurisdiction is the power of the court over a cause of action or to act in a particular way.greener workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,trafficschoolonline,superior court th,d people jackson,d supp,overruled on another point in people posey cal th,fn,d.by contrast,the lack of subject matter jurisdiction means the entire absence of power to hear or determine a case,an absence of authority over the subject matter.abelleira district court of appeal cal d,accord greener workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at,d.where the evidence is not in dispute,a determination of subject matter jurisdiction is a legal question subject to de novo review.superior court th,d robbins foothill nissan th,d.
there is subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs interpleader action.section,subdivision b provides,any person,firm,corporation,association or other entity against whom double or multiple claims are made,or may be made,by two or more persons which are such that they may give rise to double or multiple liability,may bring an action against the claimants to compel them to interplead and litigate their several claims section,subdivision b expressly grants any partnership or corporation,such as plaintiffs,who admittedly owe a debt,the right to bring into court all persons who have or might make conflicting claims on the obligation and to compel the defendants to litigate their claims among themselves.city of morgan hill brown th,d williams gilmore d.an interpleader action is an equitable proceeding.union mutual life ins.broderick cal,williams gilmore,supra,d at.in an interpleader action,the court initially determines the right of the plaintiff to interplead the funds if that right is sustained,an interlocutory decree is entered which requires the defendants to interplead and litigate their claims to the funds.upon an admission of liability and deposit of monies with the court,the plaintiff then may be discharged from liability and dismissed from the interpleader action.hancock oil hopkins cal d,city of morgan hill brown,supra,th at,d van orden anderson,et.the effect of such an order is to preserve the fund,discharge the stakeholder from further liability,and to keep the fund in the court custody until the rights of the potential claimants of the monies can be adjudicated.city of morgan hill brown,supra,th at,d weingetz cheverton d.thus,the interpleader proceeding is traditionally viewed as two lawsuits in one.the first dispute is between the stakeholder and the claimants to determine the right to interplead the funds.the second dispute to be resolved is who is to receive the interpleaded funds.san francisco savings union long cal,state farm fire casualty pietak th,d lincoln nat.life ins.mitchell d.
in this case,the interpleader complaint alleged that plaintiffs,a limited partnership,and the corporation had multiple claims made against them concerning funds that might give rise to double liability and they were disinterested stakeholders.plaintiffs then tendered the funds to the court.the trial court therefore had the power under section to adjudicate the issues raised by the interpleader action including the alleged existence of conflicting claims regarding the interpleaded funds plaintiffs alleged position as a disinterested mere stakeholder and ultimately the disposition of the interpleaded funds after deducting plaintiffs attorney fees.city of morgan hill brown,supra,th at,d williams gilmore,supra,d at.
the trial court ruling 
notwithstanding this express delegation of power to act,the trial court nevertheless concluded on two grounds that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to allow plaintiffs to interplead the funds.the first ground relied upon by the trial court was the theory that defendants arbitration agreement usurped its authority to determine the ownership and disbursement issues.second,the trial court concluded it would ultimately lack power to confirm an arbitration award that was rendered by a panel of three rabbis in israel.we respectfully disagree with both conclusions.the trial court erroneously concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the defendants had chosen to privately arbitrate their ownership dispute.implicit in this conclusion are two assumptions.the first assumption is that submission to arbitration divests a court of jurisdiction.the second assumption is that a prior action in another country grants a foreign authority exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the issues but also divests california courts of such powers.we address each of these assumptions separately.
the effect of the arbitration agreement 
before analyzing the effect of the arbitration clause,it warrants emphasis plaintiffs never agreed to arbitrate any dispute with defendants.hence,plaintiffs are not bound by the arbitration agreement between defendants.eeoc waffle house,d arista films,gilford securities,th,d fields,cal.alternative dispute resolution practice b.the submission of a dispute to private arbitration does not oust the superior court of jurisdiction.brock kaiser foundation hospitals th,d preston kaiser foundation hospitals d.spence omnibus industries d.compare holmes richet cal,holding that an agreement to arbitrate does not oust the court of jurisdiction but the arbitration clause will be enforced if it is determined to be condition precedent to an action to recover palmer fix,same minton mitchell,same.in brock kaiser foundation hospitals,supra,th at page,d,the court of appeal explained in depth the effect of a private contractual agreement on the court jurisdiction c ontractual arbitration is in no sense a trial of a cause before a judicial tribunal,nor is it a usurpation or ouster of the judicial power vested in the trial court of this state by our constitution.snyder superior court d.as a result,there is nothing to prevent one of the parties to a contractual arbitration provision from resorting initially to an action at law.spence omnibus industries,supra,d at.ross blanchard d.the other party,if determined to pursue arbitration,must then take action to compel arbitration.spence,supra,d at.a right to compel arbitration is not.if a party wishes to compel arbitration,he must take active and decided steps to secure that right,and is required to go to the court where the other party action at law lies.gunderson superior court d.consequently,the party seeking to enforce the contractual arbitration clause must file the section petition in the action at law or raise it as an affirmative defense in the answer or else the right to contractual arbitration is waived.id.at.kustom kraft homes leivenstein d.see also.the party seeking resolution via contractual arbitration must also file a motion in the action at law to stay it,it will not be stayed automatically.ross,supra,d at.this assertion of a contractual arbitration agreement constitutes a plea in abatement of the action at law.gunderson,supra,d at.kustom kraft homes,supra,d at.once a court grants the petition to compel arbitration and stays the action at law,the action at law sits in the twilight zone of abatement with the trial court retaining merely a vestigial jurisdiction over matters submitted to arbitration.this vestigial jurisdiction over the action at law consists solely of making the determination,upon conclusion of the arbitration proceedings,of whether there was an award on the merits in which case the action at law should be dismissed because of the res judicata effects of the arbitration award division of labor standards enforcement williams d.rest d judgments,or not at which point the action at law may resume to determine the rights of the parties.lord garland cal d,shuffer board of trustees d.discussing effect of interlocutory judgment pursuant to abating second action at law pending resolution of first action of law.the court also retains a separate,limited jurisdiction over the contractual arbitration which was the subject of the section petition after a petition has been filed under this title,title,the court in which such petition was filed retains jurisdiction to determine any subsequent petition involving the same agreement to arbitrate and the same controversy,and any such subsequent petition shall be filed in the same proceeding.italics added.each of these considerations is of materially greater collective intellectual force given that plaintiffs are not signatories to the arbitration clause in the july,purchase agreement between defendants.
under the aforementioned standards,the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the interpleader action.in sum,an arbitration provision does not oust the court of jurisdiction to hear the matter but merely means if one party chooses to arbitrate,a petition may be filed to stay the proceedings,order arbitration and then confirm the award.brock kaiser foundation hospitals,supra,th at,d spence omnibus industries,supra,rd at.moreover,even when a stay has been issued,the court retains limited jurisdiction over the dispute.see equities group,superior court th,d after stay is issued,court retains vestigial jurisdiction to appoint arbitrators if the method selected by the parties fails and a provisional remedy,subd.b and confirm,correct,or vacate award brock kaiser foundation hospitals,supra,th at,d court retains power to confirm award and to entertain subsequent petitions by the parties preston kaiser foundation hospitals,supra,d at.court which has ordered arbitration retaining jurisdiction to entertain a petition for judicial assistance in moving arbitration forward or to dismiss for lack of diligence.therefore,because the matter had been submitted to private arbitration by defendants,but not plaintiffs,the trial court did not lose subject matter jurisdiction.federal ins.superior court th,d brock kaiser foundation hospitals,supra,th at,d.
the effect of the use of israeli arbitrators 
the trial court also erroneously concluded that a pending private arbitration in israel deprived california courts of subject matter jurisdiction and vested the israeli courts with exclusive authority to determine the matters at issue.before discussing the merits of the trial court holding,we briefly summarize the nature of the israeli arbitration proceedings.as noted previously,defendants submitted their dispute to a beth din in israel.a beth din,sometimes transliterated from the hebrew to bet din or bais din,is a rabbinic court,an authoritative forum of jewish law.blitz beth isaac adas israel congregation,fn.ainsworth schoen so d,fn,ware,arbitration and assimilation,zornberg,beyond the constitution is the new york get legislation good law pace,fn.din is hebrew for a formal court proceeding.shippee,blessed are the peacemakers approaches to dispute resolution of intern.and comp.law.literally,commentators indicate,beth din means house of judgment or house of law.sinai memorial chapel dudler d.zornberg,beyond the constitution is the new york get legislation good law,supra,pace.at,fn.murakami,symposium the evolution and impact of jewish law davis of intern.pol,fn.nadel,new york get laws a constitutional analysis colum.soc.probs,fn.encyclopaedia judaica.the actual beth din proceeding is usually conducted before three rabbis.hardin,religious postmarital dispute resolution jewish marriage contracts and civil courts ohio on disp.reso.some secular commentators refer to a beth din proceeding addressing business disputes as one before an arbitration panel.id.at.agreements to resolve disputes before a beth din have been enforced in this country courts.blitz beth isaac adas israel congregation,fn.avitzur avitzur.further,the results of beth din proceedings have been enforced in this country as though they were arbitration awards.erber goldstein misc d,ghertner solaimani,kovacs kovacs,elmora hebrew center,fishman,kingsbridge center of israel turk.in the present case,the uncontroverted evidence indicates the parties expect the three rabbis to return what will amount to an arbitration award.further,the evidence,none of which is disputed,indicates such an award would be enforceable in israeli courts.accord,azrieli,improving arbitration under the free trade agreements a framework for a free trade zone john.
as to the pendency of a dispute in the courts of another nation,the controlling rule of law is as follows the pendency of the action in a foreign country is not a bar to the institution of another action between the same parties and for the same cause of action in the courts of california,nor was it the duty of the superior court to stay the action pending the determination of the earlier suit in the foreign country,even though the entire controversy might be there disposed of.as a matter of comity,although not a matter of right,the court had power to continue the case if the circumstances warranted such action.citation.the reason why the pendency of an action in the courts of one sovereignty will not abate an action in the courts of another sovereignty is twofold first,because a foreign judgment depending on foreign law may be unjust,and could not be enforced beyond the jurisdiction of the foreign court without a new suit on it as only prima facie evidence and second,and chiefly,because the remedy in the country where the last suit is brought may be more adaptable and safe,and means for effectuating a judgment may be found in the latter and not in the former country.pesquera del pacifico superior court d,accord dayan mcdonald corporation d,rest d conf.of laws,pendency of lawsuit in foreign nation not a bar to entertaining an action in a state.thus,california is not required to dismiss an action merely because initiatory steps are taken in a foreign country.pesquera del pacifico superior court,supra,at.rather,a california judge has discretion to stay the trial in this state court pending the outcome of a foreign action.ibid.unlike those cases which discuss judicial proceedings pending overseas,in this case,no israeli court has yet to even assume jurisdiction over the present dispute thereby further attenuating the force of the absence of subject matter jurisdiction theory underlying the trial court dismissal order.stated differently,a california court has subject matter jurisdiction even though there are arbitral proceedings pending in israel.there is no pertinent authority to support the action of the present interpleader action because an arbitration,to which plaintiffs are not a party,is pending in israel.
the religious nature of the arbitration 
relying upon section,the trial court was also concerned that it would ultimately lack power to confirm an arbitration award that was rendered by a religious arbitral tribunal in israel.section states,if a petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed,the court shall confirm the award as made,whether rendered in this state or another state,unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected,vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.in that respect,the trial judge reasoned that language in section which provides that the court must confirm the award as made,whether rendered in this state or another state means that a california court would ultimately lack power to confirm an arbitration award that was rendered in israel.we disagree that the language in section divested the court of jurisdiction because of the pending arbitration before the religious panel in israel.
first,section does not,by its express terms,limit the court power in any manner to confirm an arbitration award from a foreign country,even by a religious tribunal.rather,as plaintiffs argue,the rendered in this state or another state language in section was added by the legislature in.stats,ch.the legislative counsel digest comment explains that the rendered in this state or another state language was enacted because existing law does not provide for the enforcement of an arbitration award,unless that award has been reduced to a judgment.this bill would require the enforcement of arbitration awards made out of state as specified.legis.counsel,bill.stats,summary.thus,the language was designed to alleviate the requirement that another state arbitration award be reduced to judgment in order to be enforceable in california.see stats,ch,subd.c.section does not bar a california trial judge from confirming a foreign arbitrator panel award.
second,any israeli arbitration award would be enforceable in the united states under the terms of title united states code section which compels adherence to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of june,which is commonly referred to as the new york convention fotochrome,copal,cir,parsons whittemore overseas,societe generale de du papier rakta cir.title united states code section is part of the enabling legislation adopted to enforce the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of june.employers ins.of wausau certain underwriters at lloyds,the present dispute falls within the provisions of title united states code section industrial risk insurers gutehoffnungshutte gmbh cir,bergesen joseph muller cir.there is a strong federal public policy favoring the enforcement of arbitration agreements in the international commerce context.mitsubishi motors soler,d david threlkeld,metallgesellschaft london cir.the parties to the july,purchase agreement expressly provided that the arbitrators award is enforceable in any court of competent los angeles superior court is.if no removal petition is filed,the superior court has the duty to enforce the arbitrators award pursuant to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of june,specifically title united states code section.pan atlantic group republic ins,untimely removal petition requires remand of case subject to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of june,to new york state court rest d the foreign relations law of the united states.if a removal petition is timely filed,then a federal district court would enter an order confirming an award.
third,there is no indication that an award,whether rendered by a secular or religious tribunal in israel,could not have been reduced to a judgment enforceable in california.as a general matter,an arbitration award is the equivalent of a final judgment which renders all factual and legal matters in the award res judicata.thibodeau crum th,d lehto underground constr.d.trollope jeffries d.walter national indem.d.if reduced to a money judgment,the arbitrators award would be potentially enforceable pursuant to the uniform foreign recognition act.et korea water resources lee th,d compare in re stephanie cal th,d,mexican guardianship decree may be enforced under the doctrine of comity.
finally,the fact three rabbis are the arbitrators and the decision will no doubt be based on principals of jewish law does not bar its enforceability in california secular courts.as note previously,american courts routinely enforce money judgments and other orders by beth din panels.ghertner solaimani,supra,at kovacs kovacs,supra,at.at present,it is speculative to assume that the beth din panel will return an award that will be unenforceable for some reason in california secular courts.
personal jurisdiction 
rosenblum and perpetual moved to dismiss the interpleader complaint on two grounds.first,they argued there is no constitutional basis for jurisdiction over rosenblum,a citizen and resident of israel,and perpetual international trading limited,a seychelles corporation.second,they contended service of the summons and complaint of the interpleader action violated article of the hague convention because israel does not permit private service of documents.although the parties briefed the personal jurisdiction issue,the trial court declined to decide it.rather,the trial court dismissed the interpleader action as previously noted on other grounds.
section provided a court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the constitution of this state or of the united states.the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution limits a state court power to render a personal judgment against a nonresident defendant.volkswagen woodson,d kulko california superior court,d.under the fourteenth amendment due process clause,the defendant must be given adequate notice and be subject to the personal jurisdiction of the court.peralta heights medical center,d volkswagen woodson,supra,at.the california supreme court has explained,a state court assertion of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant who has not been served with process within the state comports with the requirements of the due process clause of the federal constitution if the defendant has such minimum contacts with the state that the assertion of jurisdiction does not violate traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.international shoe washington.vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,d.personal jurisdiction over a nonresident may be either general or specific.helicopteros nacionales de colombia hall,d vons companies,seabest foods,supra,cal th at,d.
in this case,the parties presented conflicting evidence on the issues of general and specific jurisdiction.as noted above,however,the trial court did not resolve the personal jurisdiction issue.therefore,given our other rulings,typically we wou
