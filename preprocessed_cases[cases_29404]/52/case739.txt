background 
factual and procedural history 
zheng was born on february,in the fujian province in the people republic of china.in or,his father left china to come to the united states his father now lives in new york.in,zheng mother left china to come to the united states his mother now lives in guam.on april,zheng left china to come to the united states.he was years old.
zheng left china because he was in a very low position.his parents had violated china birth control policy.under china policy,if the first born is a boy,you can not have a second child zheng parents had two daughters after zheng was born.
human smugglers who transport chinese immigrants from china to the united states and other as snakeheads or seaman brought zheng,along with approximately and fifty chinese nationals,into the united states on a large boat.on or about april,zheng was apprehended seeking to enter guam.in the custody of the united states marshal,zheng lived on tinian island until june.
while on tinian island,zheng was a material witness in a criminal proceeding against the smugglers and reported all the names of the seamen and said that they tortured me,tortured us.the same evening that zheng reported the names of his smugglers,a snakehead nicknamed lu son approached zheng as he waited for the restroom.zheng testified that the snakehead told him you be careful,you will be dead for sure.zheng thought that the snakehead was going to beat me.but a police officer using a flashlight came by and the snakehead left.zheng told an adult about the snake head death threat.the adult told zheng this is not a big problem.since we are here in the united states the american government will protect us.we become their witnesses and they will be responsible for us.zheng stated that a fter i heard this,i did not report the snakehead threat.
on june,zheng was transferred to a juvenile detention center in guam.zheng stated that in guam,he was allowed to write a letter to his parents,but i was not allowed to call.one letter only i cried and ask ed to call them,but it was refused.when zheng asked why he was not allowed to contact his parents the officers said,one of them said because we were witness es,we were under protection.
in march,zheng was flown to los angeles,california.on april,zheng first appeared before the immigration judge in los angeles for removal proceedings.
on may,zheng again appeared before the ij.when asked why he was afraid to return to china,zheng testified,through an interpreter,that the smugglers they will hurt me b ecause i have been testifying.in addition,zheng testified that because his family had violated the one child policy,the chinese government will not allow me to further my studies.whatever school,i tried to apply to,they will expel me.the ij completed an asylum application for zheng.
on may,zheng appeared before the ij and testified concerning the very low position of his family because his parents had violated the birth control policy.if returned to china,zheng stated that the government would not allow him to go to school because his family had violated the birth control policy of the government and s econdly he was smuggled from china.
zheng also testified that while still in china,before leaving by boat for the united states,i was beaten by t he snakehead.the one who watched over us unintentionally i step ped on his foot and he beat me up he struck my abdomen and kicked me and asked me to kneel down on the ground and i was not allowed to block with my arm.when asked why he was afraid of being sent back to china,zheng stated that t he snakehead will kill me b ecause i am a witness for the american government against them i reported all the names of the seaman and said that they tortured me,tortured us i am afraid that the snakehead will kill me.zheng told the ij of the snakehead threat you be careful,you will be dead for sure.
zheng testified that there was n o way the chinese government would protect him from the snakeheads b ecause snakeheads are connected with the chinese government officials.as an example of the collusion between the government officials and the snakeheads,zheng testified that he saw the snakeheads give three cartons of cigarettes to the police at the harbor before they were allowed to board the boat.
the ij admitted the following into the record declarations of wu ming he and qing he,chinese immigrants also smuggled into the united states by snakeheads,the united states department of state country report for china dated april,and the trafficking victims protection act of tvpa,cong,which became the trafficking victims protection act,pub.law,stat.codified at.the declaration of wu ming he stated that it is my personal knowledge that alien smugglers have connections with local government officials.i saw with my own eyes at least four times alien smugglers feasting and patronizing night clubs with local police officers in fujian.the declaration of qing he stated that i was smuggled into the united states from the fujian province of china on a boat.on my way to guam,i saw with my own very eyes one of my fellow smugglees being tortured by the smugglers.
the state department country report for china states that china appears to be taking active measures to target people smugglers and stop illegal departures by economic migrants.several scores of people smugglers and fujian officials reportedly have been convicted,fired from jobs,or expelled from the communist party.zheng argued before the ij that this report indicated that there was official participation in alien smuggling in fujian,the province zheng is from.
in passing the tvpa,congress found,in relevant part,that t rafficking often is aided by official corruption in countries of origin enforcement against traffickers is also hindered by official indifference,by corruption,and sometimes even by active official participation in trafficking.b.in addition,congress found that traffickers often resort to violence and torture,or threats of violence and torture,to keep their victims in line.b.the ins unsuccessfully objected to the admission of the tvpa.
before stating her decision,the ij found that zheng testified credibly and consistently throughout his entire hearing.therefore,i find that the respondent is credible.the ij,however,ruled that zheng failed to establish the standard for asylum and failed to establish the standard for withholding of deportation.
after ruling that zheng was ineligible for asylum,the ij stated that t he court is more concerned with the respondent request for protection under the convention against torture.the ij found that 
the observations of the respondent where police surrounded the home where he was being detained and then,withdrew after being spoken to by smugglers.furthermore,the journey along the highway where he was not questioned in the truck where he was traveling in,though other trucks and vehicles were stopped.then,his final observation of smugglers giving cigarettes to the police and then,the respondent and others being allowed to board the ship,is some evidence of collusion between the government.if not collusion as to the violence,at least some collusion that the government condones or at least is not willing to interfere and,in a way,acquiesces to the smuggler conduct.
the ij concluded 
this court is very concerned with smuggling.the government of the united states is very concerned with smuggling.i believe that the respondent has established a clear probability of torture and that there is a sufficient nexus between the public officials and therefore,his application for protection under the convention will be granted.
zheng did not appeal the denial of asylum or withholding of removal.but the ins appealed the portion of the ij ruling that granted zheng withholding of removal to china under the convention against torture.the issue presented to the bia was w hether the respondent failed to demonstrate acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity as required by,emphasis omitted.according to the ins,t he main flaw in the immigration judge analysis was her failure to recognize the qualitative difference between localized government corruption in regard to smuggling operations,and prior and knowing government acquiescence in regard to murder or other violent crimes,emphases in original.the ins argued that the chinese government turning a blind eye to its citizens being smuggled out of the country was not tantamount to acquiescing to torture 
even if some chinese police take bribes to let refugees pass through checkpoints,this is a purely and relatively benign offense.it does not raise any inference whatsoever that such would be amenable to violence,that with prior knowledge they would allow the commission of acts of torture,
emphasis in original.
the bia sustained the ins appeal the service contends that the immigration judge decision misapplied the law.we agree.citing an en banc bia opinion,the bia stated that w hen the alien alleges a likelihood of torture from sources,he or she must demonstrate that government officials are willfully accepting of the source torturous activities.see matter of,interim decision,wl at bia.the bia found that,even assuming chinese government officials knew about the smuggling operations and failed to stop them,zheng did not show that government officials would acquiesce in harm that rises to the level of torture.the bia vacated the ij decision that granted zheng application for withholding of removal pursuant to the convention and ordered zheng removed to china.
zheng now seeks review of the final order of the bia vacating the ij grant of relief under the convention against torture.
b.the convention against torture 
the united nations drafted the convention against torture in an effort to make more effective the struggle against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment throughout the world.convention against torture,preamble,at.on december,the united nations general assembly adopted the convention by unanimous agreement.committee on foreign relations,convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,exec,at.president reagan signed the convention on april.id.one month later,the president transmitted to the senate the convention for approval with nineteen proposed united states conditions,many of which concerned the human rights community,american bar association,and other groups.cong.rec.statement of pell.one of those conditions was an understanding that the united states interpreted the term acquiescence to require that the public official,prior to the activity constituting torture,have knowledge of such activity.exec,at emphasis added.according to the senate foreign relations committee,t hose conditions,in number and substance,created the impression that the united states was not serious in its commitment to end torture worldwide.id.at.in january,the bush administration submitted a revised and reduced list of proposed united states conditions on the convention the conditions proposed in large measure eliminate d th e problem that the united states appeared insincere in its commitment to end torture worldwide.id.at.under one of the new proposed understandings,the united states no longer required a public official to have knowledge of torture to acquiesce to torture rather the public official need only an awareness of torture.id.at.the committee stated that the purpose of requiring awareness,and not knowledge,is to make it clear that both actual knowledge and willful blindness fall within the definition of the term acquiescence.id.at.in recommending ratification of the convention with the new conditions,including the understanding that acquiescence required only awareness and not actual knowledge,the committee found that r atification is a natural to the active role that the united states played in the negotiating process for the convention and is consistent with longstanding efforts to promote and protect basic human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world.id.at the senate adopted its resolution of advice and consent to ratification on october.cong.rec.on october,president clinton deposited the instrument of ratification with the united nations,and the convention against torture was entered into force for the united states thirty days later.see regulations concerning the convention against torture.
