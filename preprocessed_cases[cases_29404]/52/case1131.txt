facts and procedural history 
this case arises out of an insurance claim filed by victor borden,a resident of honduras,for the loss of one of his fishing vessels that sank in international waters.through a chain of brokers,borden obtained a marine insurance policy from insurance company and its successor,alfa insurance plc collectively referred to as alfa,a russian corporation.borden efforts to procure the insurance policy covering his three fishing vessels began when his daughter,who resides in florida contacted ocean insurance management,ocean,a florida insurance brokerage firm.ocean in turn contacted barnhardt marine insurance,barnhardt,also a florida insurance brokerage firm,which in turn contacted marine insurance consultants international mici,an insurance brokerage firm located in britain.mici then contacted southern seas uk limited southern seas,also an insurance brokerage firm located in britain.southern seas then contacted shipping trading limited,an insurance brokerage firm located in turkey.then contacted alfa,which eventually issued an insurance policy 
after the insurance policy was issued to borden,one of the fishing vessels covered under the policy sank in international waters.borden filed a claim with alfa seeking to recover for the loss of this vessel.alfa denied coverage on the basis that the vessel sank in international waters,outside the coverage area.thereafter,borden filed suit in florida state court against alfa,ocean,barnhardt,and southern seas.borden later filed an amended complaint that dropped southern seas as a defendant.barnhardt filed a notice of removal of the case to federal court to which alfa,barnhardt codefendant,consented the case was removed to federal court but,based on borden unopposed motion,was remanded back to florida state court.
upon remand and before the filing of an answer,alfa filed a motion to quash service of process for lack of personal jurisdiction in response to the initial complaint,and a renewed motion to quash service of process for lack of personal jurisdiction in response to the amended complaint.alfa asserted by affidavit that florida courts lacked personal jurisdiction over the insurer because alfa did not have sufficient minimum contacts with florida.alfa also asserted that section of the uipl may be invoked only by florida residents and is therefore unavailable to borden as a resident of honduras.in their written responses to alfa motion to quash,borden,barnhardt,and ocean argued that service of process and personal jurisdiction were appropriate under section,relying on the third district decision in winterthur.barnhardt also asserted that florida courts have personal jurisdiction over alfa under florida general statute,section,florida statutes.specifically,barnhardt argued that personal jurisdiction was available under section a,florida statutes,based on alfa alleged contacts with florida.
at the hearing on alfa motion to quash,the trial court ruled that borden ha d satisfied the requirements for in personam jurisdiction and denied alfa motion to quash.borden,so d at.on appeal,the second district reversed.the second district first addressed barnhardt assertion that florida courts had personal jurisdiction over alfa under sections a and b,florida statutes,and determined that this argument not only has no merit but also was not raised below and,therefore,is waived.id.at.the second district next addressed whether service of process and personal jurisdiction were available under section.the second district concluded that section applies only to claims brought against unauthorized foreign insurers by florida residents.the second district certified conflict with winterthur,which held that section applies to both residents and nonresidents 
the certified conflict issue before this court is whether as a matter of law section of the uipl is available only to florida residents.this issue involves a question of statutory interpretation and thus is subject to de novo review.see dep t of children families,so d.we begin our analysis by discussing the concepts of service of process and personal jurisdiction.we then explore the pertinent provisions in florida uipl.next,we review the interpretations of section by the third district in winterthur and the second district in this case.finally,we discuss why,as a matter of law,section is available only to florida residents.
personal jurisdiction and service of process 
under florida law,service of process and personal jurisdiction are two distinct but related concepts.both are necessary before a defendant,either an individual or business entity,may be compelled to answer a claim brought in a court of law.personal jurisdiction refers to whether the actions of an individual or business entity as set forth in the applicable statutes permit the court to exercise jurisdiction in a lawsuit brought against the individual or business entity in this state.see generally white pepsico,so d venetian salami parthenais,so d,stating that in order to subject a defendant to personal jurisdiction,due process requires that the defendant have certain minimum contacts with the forum.service of process is the means of notifying a party of a legal claim and,when accomplished,enables the court to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant and proceed to judgment.see shurman atlantic mortg.inv,so d,it is well settled that the fundamental purpose of service of process is to give proper notice to the defendant in the case that he is answerable to the claim of plaintiff and,therefore,to vest jurisdiction in the court entertaining the controversy.quoting state ex rel.merritt heffernan,so.personal jurisdiction over a nonresident of the state is circumscribed by constitutional considerations of minimum contacts as stated in the seminal case of international shoe washington,and its progeny as explained in venetian salami,two inquiries must be made regarding personal jurisdiction over a nonresident 
first,it must be determined that the complaint alleges sufficient jurisdictional facts to bring the action within the ambit of the statute and if it does,the next inquiry is whether sufficient minimum contacts are demonstrated to satisfy due process requirements.
so d at quoting unger publisher entry service,so d,dca.under florida rules of civil procedure b,b,and b,lack of jurisdiction over the person,insufficiency of process,and insufficiency of service of process are defenses that may be raised either in a responsive pleading or by motion.
florida unauthorized insurers process law 
chapter,florida statutes,generally addresses foreign insurers who are unauthorized to do business in florida.sections through are collectively referred to as the unauthorized insurers process law.stat.section is entitled purpose of unauthorized insurers process law and provides 
the purpose of the unauthorized insurers process law is to subject certain insurers and persons representing or aiding such insurers to the jurisdiction of courts of this state in suits by or on behalf of insureds or beneficiaries under insurance contracts.the legislature declares that it is a subject of concern that many residents of this state hold policies of insurance issued or delivered in the state by insurers while not authorized to do business in this state,thus presenting to such residents the often insuperable obstacle of resorting to distant forums for the purpose of asserting legal rights under such policies.in furtherance of such state interest,the legislature herein provides a method of substituted service of process upon unauthorized insurers and persons representing or aiding such insurers,and declares that in so doing it exercises its power to protect its residents and to define,for the purpose of this chapter,what constitutes doing business in this state 
section specifies the acts which will subject unauthorized foreign insurers to the jurisdiction of florida courts 
any of the following acts in this state,effected by mail or otherwise,by an unauthorized foreign insurer,alien insurer,or person representing or aiding such an insurer is equivalent to and shall constitute an appointment by such insurer or person representing or aiding such insurer of the chief financial officer to be its true and lawful attorney,upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action,suit,or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of an insured or beneficiary,arising out of any such contract of insurance and any such act shall be signification of the insurer or person agreement that such service of process is of the same legal force and validity as personal service of process in this state upon such insurer or person representing or aiding such insurer 
the issuance or delivery of contracts of insurance to residents of this state or to corporations authorized to do business therein 
the solicitation of applications for such contracts 
the collection of premiums,membership fees,assessments,or other considerations for such contracts or 
any other transaction of insurance.
the legislature has defined the term transact as it relates to insurance to include any of the following 
solicitation or inducement.
preliminary negotiations.
effectuation of a contract of insurance.
transaction of matters subsequent to effectuation of a contract of insurance and arising out of it.
section,florida statutes,is entitled service of process judgment by default,and specifies the procedure by which service of process is to be made for unauthorized foreign insurers subject to personal jurisdiction under section.thus,collectively sections and allow a florida court to effectuate service of process on and exercise personal jurisdiction over an unauthorized foreign insurer whenever the insurer engages in one of the acts enumerated in section.in fact,the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit has referred to the uipl as a statute specifically designed to subject insurers who are unauthorized to do business in florida to the jurisdiction of the florida courts.walter blue cross blue shield united of wisconsin,cir.the court noted that t he statute lists a number of acts which may subject an unauthorized insurer to the jurisdiction of the florida courts by allowing substituted service of process.see also bookman kah,so d,dca noting that the uipl was enacted to subject certain insurers not authorized to do business in this state to florida jurisdiction,and that the insurer doing of an act enumerated in section authorizes service of process on the insurance commissioner of florida as the insurer authorized agent.
interpretation of section,florida statutes 
among florida district courts,only the second district in this case and the third district in winterthur have specifically construed subsection of section to determine whether this subsection is available to nonresidents in winterthur,the insured,who was a resident of peru,obtained a medical insurance policy in florida from winterthur international,winterthur.so d at.winterthur was a bermuda corporation that was not authorized to do business in florida.see id.at.the insured asserted that florida courts had personal jurisdiction over winterthur under section.see id.winterthur argued,however,that section is available only to an insured who is a florida resident,and that winterthur had not performed any acts that would bring it within the reach of the statute.see id.the third district rejected the assertion that as a matter of law section is limited to florida residents,and held that subsection is available to a nonresident insured.so d at.the third district observed that unlike subsections through of section,subsection does not contain either an express or implied residency limitation.see id.at.
the third district noted that subsection uses the term transaction of insurance to describe acts which subject an unauthorized foreign insurer to service of process and personal jurisdiction under the uipl.see id.the third district observed that the term transact with respect to insurance is statutorily defined in section to include certain enumerated acts,but stated that this definition is not limited,expressly or by implication,to transactions involving florida residents.id.the third district concluded therefore that no basis appears on which such a limitation should be implied in section.id.
on motion for rehearing,the third district acknowledged that the protection of florida residents is one of the objectives of the uipl,but explained that this objective is not its sole purpose.see id.at.rather,the third district determined that the uipl has a broader statutory purpose in that it was enacted to subject unauthorized foreign insurers to the jurisdiction of florida courts in suits brought by or on behalf of insureds or beneficiaries arising out of the insurer business transactions in this state.see id.at.the third district concluded that applying section to nonresidents is consistent with this broader purpose.see id.
directly contrary to winterthur,the second district in this case held that subsection of section is available only to florida residents.borden,so d at.the second district reasoned that the legislature has expressly stated that section as a whole was meant to protect florida residents.id.at.in disagreeing with winterthur interpretation of section,the second district explained that s ubsections place a residency limitation on the very activities that are encompassed within section definition of transact.id.at.the second district concluded that to construe subsection to include,without limitation,the same activities subject to the residency limitation of subsections is to render subsections meaningless.id.further,the second district noted that subsequent to winterthur,the third district in hassneh insurance of israel,plastigone technologies,so d,dca,explicitly stated that section applies only to insurers that issue policies held by florida residents.quoting bookman.in hassneh,the third district failed to refer to or distinguish its previous decision in winterthur.
statutory construction 
our task is to determine whether,based on the language of the statute,the legislature intended to limit section to florida residents.it is a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that legislative intent is the polestar that guides this court interpretation.see state,so d,reynolds state,so d.we endeavor to construe statutes to effectuate the intent of the legislature.see white,so d at.to discern legislative intent,we look primarily to the actual language used in the statute.see golf channel jenkins,so d.further,w hen the statute is clear and unambiguous,courts will not look behind the statute plain language for legislative intent or resort to rules of statutory construction to ascertain intent.daniels.dep t of health,so d.
borden asserts that the ambiguity in this case occurs because subsection of section refers to a ny other transaction of insurance.there is no question that subsections through of section are available by their plain terms only to residents of the state.subsection specifically refers to t he issuance or delivery of contracts of insurance to residents of this state and subsections and refer to such contracts.stat.emphasis supplied.because subsection does not refer to such contracts,it is not clear whether subsection is limited to florida residents in the same manner as subsection
