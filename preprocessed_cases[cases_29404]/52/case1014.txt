ford motor company appeals from a decision of the united states court of international trade holding ford liable for grossly negligent misrepresentation of the value of import entries and imposing a penalty of,plus interest.united states ford motor,d.int l trade gross negligence decision.ford timely filed a notice of appeal on september.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
this is the second of two similar appeals involving ford import practices.a discussion of the general legal background appears in our decision,issued today,in united states ford motor.august,ford i.
this action involves duties paid on manufacturing tooling and stamping dies for the lincoln town car,known internally as the program.ford imported those dies from ogihara america corporation oac,the american subsidiary of a japanese company,ogihara iron works oiw.oiw built the dies in japan and shipped them to its subsidiary oac michigan plant.the initial tooling purchase order between ford and oac,dated may,specified a total purchase value of.
over the following four years,as a result of design changes,ford issued amendments to the base tool order and more than separate engineering change tool orders.the amendments raised the total price from to.of the amendments,occurred prior to the first of the entries disputed in this case.those amendments raised the total price from to increase of of the engineering change orders,the great issued after the last of the entries disputed this case.the engineering change orders amounted,in the aggregate,to more than million,most of which was paid to oiw for work performed while the dies were still in japan,that is,before importation.
the base tool order,the amendments,and most of the engineering change orders included a legend that stated the price set forth in this purchase order shall be adjusted so as to credit the buyer in the amount,if any,by which such price exceeds actual costs as verified.
ford made eleven disputed entries of dies relating to the program between february,and march.the declared value of each of those entries was the merchandise invoice total of.gross negligence decision,d at.ford paid in duty on that declared amount.tool order amendment,dated january,amendment closest in time to the disputed a total tooling price of.including amounts incurred via change order,the total value of the merchandise exceed million.the agency then known as the united states customs service customs ultimately determined that the undeclared value of the entries amounted to.
customs filed its complaint on january,alleging that ford undervalued the eleven entries,resulting in a material omission in violation of.it asserted,first,that ford failure to state that its prices on entry were provisional and subject to adjustment violated second,that ford certified that its declared entry values were true and correct when in fact they were not,also in violation of and third,that ford failed to notify customs at once of information received after importation indicating that entered values were no longer correct,in violation of.ford filed an answer denying liability and asserting that it had made prior disclosures of the violations at issue that precluded liability under c.it also filed a counterclaim for a refund of duties it alleged to have overpaid because of valuation errors.
in september of,ford moved for leave to amend its answer to add a counterclaim for equitable recoupment based on its alleged overpayment of duties resulting from incorrect classifications of some of the entries at issue in the case.the court of international trade denied the motion,despite finding that the government would not be prejudiced by the amendment,noting that the amounts ford sought to recoup were paid to the government voluntarily and were not subject to recoupment,and also that the motion to amend was untimely.
the court of international trade held a bench trial from february through march.on july,the court issued a decision rejecting customs claim that ford was guilty of fraud,but finding that ford had committed gross negligence in violating and.the trial court ordered ford to pay in unpaid duties and million in penalties.gross negligence decision,d at.ford timely appealed to this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
on appeal,ford argues that it had no legal duty to identify its entry values as provisional under,and that even if it had such a duty,it could not be held liable for violating it consistent with due process of law.it further argues that it fully complied with the at once disclosure obligation of that it made valid prior disclosures that insulate it from full liability that the trial court erred in calculating the penalties and that the court of international trade erred in refusing to permit ford to amend its answer to include the counterclaim.
standard of review 
we review the court of international trade legal determinations without deference.united states hitachi,hitachi ii.we review findings of fact,including findings relating to a party intent,for clear error.id.at.where,as here,congress has delegated to the judiciary discretion to determine the amount of civil penalties under a statute,we review the trial court calculation of such penalties for abuse of discretion.see,sierra club,lone star chapter cedar point oil,cir reviewing district court penalty determination under d for abuse of discretion see also atlantic states legal,tyson foods,reviewing district court penalty determination under d for abuse of discretion.
discussion 
in ford i,we concluded that,pursuant to our decision in hitachi ii,the due process clause prevents the courts from imposing upon ford liability for failing to disclose provisional pricing upon entry pursuant to.the entries at issue in this case occurred during essentially the same time period,and were subject to the same statutory and regulatory scheme,as the entries in ford i and in hitachi ii.the same due process considerations therefore apply to ford in the case at bar,absent some distinguishing factor.the government points to two potentially distinguishing facts.first,it alleges that ford had actual knowledge that importers must advise customs when the price is not final.second,it asserts that in this case,unlike the others,customs import specialists testified that the correct way to enter goods where the final price was not known was to note that fact on the entry documents.
the government arguments are not persuasive.the testimony it identifies as establishing ford actual knowledge that the law required disclosure of provisional pricing does not,in fact,do so.ford witness gibson unequivocally stated that any obligation to disclose provisional pricing was entirely based upon voluntary ford policies,not legal requirements.neither does the cited deposition testimony of ford witness kruzich in any way support the existence of such knowledge.
with respect to testimony by customs officers that the correct way to enter goods subject to variable pricing was to disclose that fact on entry documents,none of the testimony cited by the government establishes,or even purports to establish,that actual customs practice required disclosure of provisional pricing information.see united states hitachi.int l trade hitachi i.none of the witnesses relied on by the government states affirmatively that importers were required by law to disclose provisional pricing information at the time of entry at most,their testimony suggests that importers often did so voluntarily.
this case,therefore,is indistinguishable from ford i and from hitachi ii.the due process clause of the fifth amendment prevents the imposition of liability on ford for failure to disclose provisional pricing information when neither the applicable statute nor regulations clearly requires it.we therefore reverse this portion of the trial court decision.
the government also argues,however,that because most of the amendments to the tooling work order occurred prior to the relevant entry dates,ford violated by virtue of the fact that it knew with certainty that the correct prices were substantially higher than the declared prices.as of january,for weeks before the first knew that the total price based on amendments alone was million more than the declared value.if engineering change orders are included,the true value of merchandise was about million,or million more than the declared value.testimony at trial indicated that,as of the entry dates,ford could have ascertained the true total price of the goods.thus,the government asserts,even if ford had no obligation to state the provisional nature of its entry values,it clearly misrepresented what the correct values were,to the extent they were known.
ford disputes the government assertion that ford could have ascertained the costs of the engineering change orders and incorporated them into the prices declared at entry.it asserts that it could not have known whether any particular change order called for work to be done in the united which case it would be in japan.in fact,ford claims that because it froze all engineering changes in japan as of thanksgiving,all change orders issued thereafter would result in work being done in the united states,such that the company had a reasonable belief that none of those change orders would result in an increase in dutiable amounts.only years later,ford claims,after the completion of its audit,could ford know which engineering changes involved dutiable,and which involved,charges.ford also points out that even in this litigation,had access to all the relevant records for many unable to identify the value that ford should have declared in its entries,variously suggesting that it is million,million,in excess of million,and over million.if customs can not identify the correct amount with the benefit of discovery and hindsight,ford reasons,ford itself could not reasonably be expected to have done so at the time of entry.ford further suggests that customs inability to ascertain the correct amount casts considerable doubt on whether it proved at trial that ford declared value of million was incorrect.
the court of international trade,addressing these issues,concluded that ford failure to notify customs of the engineering change orders at entry constituted a material omission,in violation of.gross negligence decision,d at.because significant numbers of engineering changes were known at the time of importation,the trial court held that the entry value of the dies should have included any engineering changes dated before february.id.at.it further held that,based upon information in the purchase orders themselves,ford had sufficient data to account for the engineering changes and convey the correct information to its broker for entry.id.at.in short,the trial court concluded that a the declared values omitted information relating to the engineering change orders,and b ford had in its possession information sufficient to give it knowledge of the true value of the declared entries as of the date of entry.
we agree with the trial court.although there is conflicting evidence in the record,the court of international trade factual conclusions regarding the engineering change orders and ford knowledge of them are not clearly erroneous.the record offers sufficient,if not unequivocal,evidence supporting the findings that change orders occurred that increased the value of the declared entries that ford knew of those change orders and their effect on the value of the merchandise and that ford failed to use that knowledge to submit true and correct declared values to customs upon entry.ford certification that its entry values were true and correct at the time of entry was therefore false,in violation of.
the next question is whether that violation reflected gross negligence on ford part.an importer is guilty of gross negligence if it behaved willfully,wantonly,or with reckless disregard in its failure to ascertain both the relevant facts and the statutory obligation,or acted with an utter lack of care.hitachi ii,at.because a determination of gross negligence involves a determination of intent,it is an issue of fact,not law.id.at.as such,we review the trial court finding of gross negligence for clear error.
ford opening brief devotes very little argument to the gross negligence issue,noting only that it can not be the case that the failure to provide customs with information,the engineering change orders that would not allow it to calculate duties somehow amounted to a gross negligence.in its reply brief,ford provides a more comprehensive argument,asserting that most of the engineering orders were issued after the date of the last entry,which ford believed meant that the work would be performed in the united states that as to engineering orders issued prior to importation,ford did not know what portion of the work would be allocated to,and what portion to foreign,goods and services and that the prices listed were subject to an audit and reconciliation that was not completed until well after entry.these uncertainties,ford asserts,had to be resolved before ford could properly report adjustments to the dutiable value of the goods.the court of international trade,however,found that ford could have identified the dutiable portions of the engineering orders,but failed to do so,and further failed to offer any evidence explaining why.gross negligence decision,d at.ford has not offered arguments sufficient to lead us to believe that the trial court decision in this regard was clearly erroneous.we therefore affirm the cit finding of gross negligence.
section of title requires an importer to notify customs at once of payments affecting dutiable value,unless other arrangements have been made with customs.the trial court found that ford violated in two ways first,by failing to fully answer customs cf,which are forms submitted to importers by customs seeking additional information about an entry and second,by failing to promptly disclose the information contained in its internal audit of the program.gross negligence decision,d at.customs issued cf for seven of the eleven disputed entries the trial court found that ford substantively responded only to two of the seven,and of those two,one was submitted eight months,and the other months,after the were initially issued.id.both substantive responses,the trial court found,failed to disclose the engineering changes and their affect sic on the dutiable value of the dies.id.because ford had all the necessary information to make those disclosures at the time the were issued,the trial court concluded,its failure to do so violated the at once requirement of.
similarly,the court of international trade found that ford internal audit was completed on april of that year and contained a breakdown of all engineering orders and the allocation of work between japan and the united states.that well as information about amendment to the base tool order,which was dated january of not disclosed to customs until august.id.at.in fact,portions of the audit information about which engineering change orders involved work in japan and which did not disclosed to customs until.id.at.
the repeated failures to disclose information about the engineering orders and the internal audit,the trial court held,violated and constituted indifference and an utter lack of care regarding ford disclosure obligations,resulting in a finding of gross negligence.
on appeal,ford does not dispute the basic facts as found by the trial court but asserts,instead,that ford complied with its section obligations when it informed customs on several occasions,beginning no later than november,that entered values were provisional and that ford would not be able to determine final values until it concluded its audit and reconciled with its vendor.appellant br.at.it points to evidence in the record that customs own witnesses knew,or were aware,of the provisional nature of die and tooling entries.with respect to the engineering change orders,ford asserts that those orders did not necessarily and instantly determine the dutiable value of the goods,because it could not be known until the audit was complete the extent to which the goods or services were to be sourced in the united states or abroad.with regard to the internal audit,ford asserts that the court of international trade misunderstood the nature of that audit,which was conducted by ford finance division to permit ford to conclusively demonstrate how much it owed oac,and was only the beginning of the process by which ford would determine how much the tool order price changes had affected dutiable value.ford points to evidence that oac was working on segregating the dutiable and values until june,such that the most that can be said is that ford took about days to finalize its reconciliation and inform customs of the impact on duties of the engineering orders.finally,ford argues that this court reversed a finding of gross negligence in much more egregious circumstances in hitachi ii,and that by that standard ford conduct here could have amounted,at worst,to simple negligence.
ford explanation regarding the failure to timely report the audit results is unpersuasive.the evidence demonstrates that ford issued amendment number to the tool order in january of months before the april audit was ostensibly that amendment reduced the total tool order price by million based upon an audit reduction.the trial court found,and ford does not here contest,that the existence of amendment demonstrates that ford had knowledge of the contents of the audit long before april,but did not disclose any of those contents until august.moreover,ford asserts that it was unable to provide the audit results to customs before august,because it needed time for oac to segregate the final price paid between dutiable and nondutiable goods and services,that is,goods and services provided in japan and in the united states.the august,letter,however,does not even provide that information,merely stating conclusorily that the estimated undeclared value of the change orders was million,without providing any breakout of those numbers indicating which change orders related to work occurring in japan.in fact,the trial court found,and ford does not here dispute,that the audit information used to produce those numbers was not provided to customs until.gross negligence decision,d at.
finally,with respect to ford argument that our decision in hitachi ii compels a reversal of the trial court finding of gross negligence,we conclude that it is without merit.a finding of gross negligence is a question of fact and may be overturned only if clearly erroneous.hitachi ii,at.in hitachi ii,we reviewed a court of international trade finding that the defendant conduct was not grossly negligent.relying upon the trial court findings regarding witness credibility,a legal opinion obtained in good faith,and the restricted standard of review of factual questions,we concluded that we can not say that the court of international trade clearly erred in failing to find that gross negligence was proven by clear and convincing evidence.id.at.
the posture of this case is the opposite of that presented in hitachi ii,and the standard of review this time favors the government.the trial court found that ford acted with gross negligence,and we may overturn that finding only if it was clearly erroneous.for all the reasons set forth above,we conclude that the trial court finding of gross negligence was not clearly erroneous.
iii.prior disclosures 
section c of title provides a safe harbor for prior disclosures disclosing of import law violations before,or without knowledge of,the commencement of a formal investigation of the violation.making such a prior disclosure limits the available penalty to interest on the amount of duties,taxes,and fees of which the government was deprived by the violation.c b.a formal investigation is considered to have commenced with regard to the disclosing party and the disclosed information on the date recorded in writing by the customs service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received which caused the customs service to believe that a possibility of a violation existed.the importer has the burden of proof in establishing lack of knowledge of commencement of the investigation.
the trial court found that ford august,letter to customs disclosing the engineering changes and amendments was the only communication that could qualify as a prior disclosure.gross negligence decision,d at.it concluded,however,that customs investigation of ford began much later than march,that ford had knowledge of the investigation by june,precluding ford from taking advantage of the prior disclosure rule under c.id.in reaching those conclusions,it relied primarily on the provisions of d,which set forth the criteria for determining the start of a formal investigation.that section states that an investigation is deemed to have commenced on the earliest of the following the date recorded in writing in the investigatory record,including contemporaneous notes,as the date upon which an agent believed the possibility of a violation existed the date an investigating agent properly identified herself or himself and the nature of her or his inquiry,in writing or in person and inquired about the disclosed violation or the date an investigating agent,after properly identifying herself or himself,and the nature of her or his inquiry,requested specific books and records relating to the disclosed violation.relying on d i,the trial court concluded that on march,customs agent turner suspected a violation regarding ford and took contemporaneous notes indicating that suspicion.id.further,the trial court held,the arrival of a customs summons on june,should have alerted ford an investigation was underway.id.
on appeal,ford asserts that the customs investigation could not have begun before august,and that it could not have known it was under investigation prior to that date.it points to the first report of investigation roi specifically relating to the ford investigation,which is dated august,and which states that t his report initiates formal investigation of this matter.the roi later states that this issue was previously investigated as part of the oac case this report initiates a separate,formal investigation of ford failure to declare the full value of the stamping dies purchased from oac and oiw.another customs document,this one dated august,states that ford august,letter was provided i n response to the june,summons,and that a s a result of that august letter,customs has opened a separate,formal investigation related to ford imports.
ford arguments are without merit.we note,first,that the district court made no finding that ford submission of august,qualified as a prior disclosure.the court said merely that was the only communication that could qualify as a prior disclosure,and went on to conclude that ford was under investigation and had knowledge of that investigation prior to august.gross negligence decision,d at.the trial court never reached the question of whether ford submission qualified as a prior disclosure or not.more important,although the terms of the august,report of investigation indicate that the investigation did not begin until that date,customs regulations clearly permit a finding that a formal investigation has commenced with much less evidence than a formal roi.those regulations permit a finding that a formal investigation has begun as of the date upon which an agent believed the possibility of a violation existed,if that date is recorded in writing in contemporaneous notes.agent turner notes of march,may be ambiguous in this they focus on ford and issues,they do not make any specific reference to an investigation of turner himself testified that he was investigating ford program at that point.
ford knowledge of the investigation is a question of fact,reviewable for clear error.there is evidence in the record that ford itself understood the june summons to constitute notice that it ford was under investigation for the importation of stamping dies from ogihara.in light of this evidence,we can not conclude that the cit finding that ford had knowledge of the investigation as of june,was clearly erroneous.
iv.ford motion to amend the complaint 
the rules of the court of international trade permit the co
