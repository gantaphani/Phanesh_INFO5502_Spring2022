introduction 
plaintiffs and appellants societe civile succession richard guino,a french trust alain renoir and jacques renoir brought an action to enforce in california an april,french judgment french judgment against defendants redstar corporation,renoir,and louise hernandez.the los angeles superior court trial court enforced a portion of the french judgment for french francs but denied enforcement of that portion of the french judgment for million francs as being a provisional remedy that was not enforceable under california uniform foreign recognition act act.code civ,et the issue in this case is the meaning and effect of those portions of the french judgment that provide that defendants are to pay to plaintiffs,as a reserve Ã  titre de provision the amount of million francs and o rders the provisional execution of this measure ordonne proviso ire de cette mesure.in reversing the judgment,we hold that the french judgment monetary provisions,including the million francs,are enforceable under the act as a foreign money judgment.
background 
plaintiffs claim that defendants improperly made reproductions of certain sculptures jointly created by renoir and michel guino.on april,plaintiffs obtained a french judgment finding that the production and marketing of the sculptures from shared works by richard guino and pierre augustine renoir,without the authorization of the beneficiaries,constitutes sic acts of forgery.thus,the french judgment provides that defendants were ordered as follows to pay plaintiffs in solidium jointly and severally as a reserve,the amount of three million francs f.orders the provisional execution of this measure.condemns them,moreover,to pay the amount of thirty thousand francs f subject to article of the new code of civil procedure expenses.the french judgment adds,given articles and of the hague convention of march,to which the united states of america and frances are parties,gives letters rogatory to any french diplomatic or consular authority in the united states,to to request redstar corporation,hernandez,renoir,who,in this case,shall be represented by a counsel of their choice,to submit all accounting elements in support of the castings undertaken of the above mentioned works,and namely the log of castings,the sales accounting,and any specific detail on the nature of the promotion and distribution transactions undertaken.ask them also to specify the contents of the stocks by number,the storage place and the name and address of the company or companies assigned to do the castings.finally ask them to produce the catalogues showing the works.record their eventual comments.
in the discussion of the reasons for the judgment prior to the actual disposition,the french judgment contains the terms temporary payment paiement provision and temporary amount la somme provisionnelle.the french court stated in the french judgment that because of the extensive damages suffered by plaintiffs,it was awarding plaintiffs million francs,and that g iven the age of the events and magnitude of the prejudice,the award justifies a provisional condemnation which should be accompanied by a provisional execution.the french court further provides that letters rogatory should be submitted to french diplomatic or consular authorities to solicit defendants to provide all of the elements allowing to assess the scope of the production and marketing of the forged works.
plaintiffs commenced a proceeding in the trial court to enforce the french judgment under the act.on a prior appeal,we reversed the california judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the basis of inadequate service.renoir redstar th,d.following proper service,defendants brought in the trial court a motion to challenge judgment contending that,except for the francs in costs,the french judgment was not enforceable under the act because the other monetary provisions did not constitute a judgment of a foreign state granting recovery of a sum of money,subd.there was no dispute that the portions of the french judgment were not enforceable under the act.
after hearings,supplemental submissions,and a motion for reconsideration,the trial court ruled that the french judgment only shall be enforced as to the franc award and no other portions.the trial court stated that plaintiff has failed to establish that any portion of the french judgment is for a fixed sum,with the exception of the portion of the french judgment that awards plaintiffs francs.this court finds that the remaining sums mentioned in the french judgment are part of a provisional mechanism,which required inter alia that an equitable accounting be completed so as to fix the sum.the court is not aware that any such accounting was attempted between april,date of french judgment and april.plaintiffs have appealed,contending that the trial court erred by not enforcing the award in the french judgment.
discussion 
standard of review 
a determination of the law of a foreign nation is a question of law that is made by judicial notice,subd.b,subd.f.the interpretation of any writing is a question of law even if extrinsic evidence has been introduced,as long as the extrinsic evidence is not conflicting.parsons bristol development cal d.there is no conflicting extrinsic evidence concerning the meaning of the french judgment.it follows that the interpretation of the french judgment is a question of law.we are not bound to accept the trial court interpretation simply because different inferences may be drawn from uncontradicted evidence.id.at fn.the construction of the french statutes in question also is a matter of law.estate of arbulich cal d,see also city of los angeles city of san fernando cal d,disapproved on other grounds in city of barstow mojave water agency cal th,d,korea water resources lee th,fn,d korea water resources judicial notice.we review these questions of law de novo.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.
section of the act provides for the enforceability of a foreign money judgment the act applies to any foreign judgment that is final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered even though an appeal therefrom is pending or it is subject to appeal.the act defines a foreign judgment as any judgment of a foreign state granting or denying recovery of a sum of money,other than a judgment for taxes,a fine or other penalty,subd.section provides grounds for of a foreign when the foreign judgment is not conclusive.none of those grounds are applicable in this case.
recovery of a sum of money under the act 
the trial court denied enforcement on the theory that the award was not a fixed sum and that the amount was subject to,part of a provisional mechanism that required an equitable accounting so as to fix the sum.although the act contains no reference to a requirement of a fixed sum,the act provides that a foreign judgment is enforceable if it is a foreign state judgment granting recovery of a sum of money,subd.the french judgment here specifically provides for the payment of million francs a sum of money.the trial court suggests that the sum was not fixed because it was provisional.the phrase orders the provisional execution of this measure means that the order for payment of the million francs is immediately enforceable,notwithstanding the availability of an appeal.it does not mean that the order is provisional in the sense that it is tentative or subject to revision within the proceeding.french code of civil procedure article see also french code of civil procedure article 
plaintiffs submitted uncontradicted material from an official in the french ministry of justice and from a french huissier de justice one who has certain judicial and legal functions see dayan mcdonald d,black law dictionary ed,both of whom cited applicable laws and declared,in effect,that the french judgment was enforceable in this case whether or not it was subject to appeal and also because the appeal was dismissed as untimely 
in providing for an accounting,the french court did not suggest that its monetary order in the matter under consideration was not for a fixed sum of money.the french court did not retain jurisdiction or specify any mechanism within the proceeding before it to enforce the results of an accounting.the french judgment,in effect,required an advance payment to plaintiffs of the amount owed to plaintiffs.the amount ordered was the french court determination of the estimated minimum amount owing.as stated in the reasons for the judgment,although plaintiffs had sought more,the french court awarded the amount of million francs because the prejudice suffered by plaintiffs is extensive according to the evidence.the court added that,the age of the events and the magnitude of the prejudice justify a provisional condemnation which should be accompanied by a provisional execution,immediate enforceability.
there was no further act or proceeding to occur in the french action in which the judgment in question was rendered.even if the ordered partial payment amount of million francs is subject to a later accounting and subsequent action on that accounting to revise the amount of that,the payment order grants a recovery of a sum of money,subd.although theoretically an accounting might show an amount of less than million francs owing,that lesser amount could only be established in a separate and subsequent action.if some other action arises in which another or different money judgment occurs,then that judgment may also be enforceable.here,we deal only with the enforceability of the existing foreign money judgment.by virtue of the express language of the judgment,under french law discussed above,plaintiffs could immediately enforce that measure providing for such advance payment.thus,the trial court erred in concluding that the award was not a judgment granting recovery of a sum of money under the act.
final and conclusive and enforceable under the act 
the trial court conclusion raises the issue of whether the award of million francs qualifies under section as a foreign judgment that is final and conclusive and enforceable in france.as we have discussed,the final judgment is enforceable 
there is no indication that the french judgment was not final.even if not necessary to enforce the foreign judgment under the act,the appellate process in france had been completed there is uncontradicted evidence that the french judgment is treated in france as final and,as stated by one of the experts,has the force of res judicata.
the french judgment is conclusive under sections and.it did not fit within the terms of section,subdivision a,as being not conclusive.a provision in a final judgment for an accounting does not mean that the award of money in that judgment is not conclusive.island territory of curacao solitron devices,cir,an arbitration award allowed parties to demand further arbitration and more extensive damages the foreign judgment on the award was nevertheless final and conclusive and therefore enforceable.as noted by the french lawyer for plaintiffs,plaintiffs could obtain an accounting and then in a subsequent and independent action seek additional damages based on the accounting.
korea water resources,supra,th,d,cited by defendants,is distinguishable.in that case,a party appealed a korean judgment to the korea supreme court,which reversed the judgment on one of the several legal theories on which it was based,reduced the amount of the provisional execution order,and remanded the case for retrial.in a proceeding under the act to enforce the korean trial court judgment as a foreign money judgment,the california court of appeal held that the korean judgment was not conclusive so as to be enforceable under the act.the court said,we are not persuaded that the korean judgment is conclusive merely because it remains to some extent provisionally enforceable.the korea high court has significantly reduced the amount of the provisional execution order.this reduction indicates the amount of the judgment is in flux and is not based on a calculated damages award.as stated in the restatement second of conflict of laws,section a judgment for the payment of money will not be enforced in other states unless the amount to be paid has been finally determined under the local law of the state of rendition.id.at,d,fn.omitted.the california court of appeal noted that with respect to the judgment,there was much more than a mere potential for change on appeal rather,the continued viability of the judgment has already been compromised as a result of the appellate process.see also mayekawa manufacturing,sasaki,japanese preliminarily enforceable judgment subject to objections is not a final and conclusive money judgment that can be enforced under the uniform foreign recognition act.
as distinguished from the situation in korea water resources,supra,th,d,the french judgment had not been questioned or revised by an appellate court or remanded to the trial court.although not necessary for enforcement under the act,the appellate process had concluded with no change to the french judgment.as we discussed,there is no indication that the french court retained any continuing jurisdiction over this proceeding.unlike in korea water resources,the french judgment was not subject to further proceedings in the trial court in the case in which the judgment was rendered.
restatement second of conflicts of laws,section,page,referred to by the court in korea water resources,th at,d,is not inconsistent with our position.the amount to be paid in the french action has been finally determined in that action under french law.see rest d conflict of laws.as set forth in comments to sections and of the restatement second of conflicts of laws,section is an application of section section deals with a where further judicial action by the court rendering the judgment is required to resolve the matter litigated.rest d conflict of laws,com.a,com.d.here there is no further judicial action required of the court rendering the judgment.the french judgment is a final judgment under french law.
conclusion 
there is nothing in the enforcement or execution of the judgment section of the french code of civil procedure that suggests that the french judgment is not a final and conclusive judgment for a sum of money.see french code of civil procedure,articles,et lang uk c r as of july,see also dodd translator,the french code of civil procedure in english,supra at.the judgment requiring a payment of million francs is a final and conclusive and enforceable judgment that grants a recovery of a sum of money.thus,that portion of the judgment awarding money is enforceable under the act.
accordingly,the judgment of the trial court is reversed.we remand the matter for the trial court to enforce the french judgment and for further proceedings so as to enter a judgment in favor of plaintiffs in the sum of the united states dollar equivalent of francs.see pecaflor construction,landes d.a california court,when enforcing a foreign judgment rendered in foreign currency,must ordinarily convert the foreign currency to american dollars using the exchange rate that was in effect at the time of the foreign judgment.

as we explain,the court in the french judgment awarded a sum of money that is a final judgment,and that judgment was immediately enforceable.
