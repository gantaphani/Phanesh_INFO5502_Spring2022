in december,the office of foreign asset control ofac designated holy land foundation hlf as a specially designated global terrorist sdgt pursuant to an executive order issued under the international emergency economic powers act,et ieepa.this designation was accompanied by an order blocking all of the organization assets.hlf brought an action in the district court challenging this designation and before us now appeals the lower court decision which affirmed ofac actions and dismissed the complaint in substantial part.for the reasons explained below,we hereby affirm the district court dismissal in part,and order summary judgment for the government.
background 
the ieepa,et,authorizes the president to declare a national emergency when an extraordinary threat to the united states arises that originates in substantial part in a foreign state.such a declaration clothes the president with extensive authority set out in.under that section he may investigate,regulate,or prohibit transactions in foreign exchange,banking transfers,and importation or exportation of currency or securities by persons or with respect to property,subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.a a.of further special concern to the holy land foundation,he may 
investigate,block during the pendency of an investigation,regulate,direct and compel,nullify,void,prevent or prohibit,any acquisition,holding,withholding,use,transfer,withdrawal,transportation,importation or exportation of,or dealing in,or exercising any right,power,or privilege with respect to,or transactions involving,any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest by any person,or with respect to any property,subject to the jurisdiction of the united states 
in,the president issued executive order pursuant to the ieepa.exec.order.that order designated certain terrorist organizations,including the palestinian organization hamas,as specially designated terrorists,or sdts,and blocked all of their property and interests in property.the order also allowed for additional designations if an organization or person is found to be owned or controlled by,or to act for or on behalf of an sdt.id.
in,as part of his response to the attacks of september,the president issued executive order,similar to order,pursuant to the ieepa.exec.order.order designated specified terrorist organizations,again including hamas,as specially designated global terrorists,or sdgts,and blocked all of their property and interests in property subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.that order also allowed for additional sdgts to be designated if organizations or persons are found to act for or on behalf of or are owned or controlled by designated terrorists,or they assist in,sponsor,or provide support for,or are otherwise associated with them.id.
hlf was originally established as the occupied land fund and incorporated as a organization in california in.in it changed its corporate name to the holy land foundation for relief and development and moved to texas.it describes itself as the largest muslim charity in the united states.in december,ofac,a division of the department of the treasury,acting pursuant to the ieepa and the two executive orders and,designated hlf as both an sdt and an sdgt and blocked all of its assets.the designations were based on information supporting the proposition that hlf was closely linked to hamas.soon thereafter,hlf filed a complaint in district court challenging its designations as a terrorist organization and the seizure of its assets,and alleging that its rights under the first,fourth,and fifth amendments,its right to free exercise of religion under the religious freedom restoration act,et rfra,and its rights under the administrative procedure act,et apa,had all been violated.hlf also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,seeking to enjoin the government from blocking or freezing its assets.in support of the motion,hlf attached exhibits purportedly showing that it was not linked to hamas and therefore not a terrorist organization.subsequently,in may,the ofac redesignated hlf as an sdt and an sdgt,and filed with the district court an administrative record which included hlf motion for a preliminary injunction with attached exhibits.
in response to hlf pleadings,the government moved for summary judgment on the apa claim and to dismiss the remaining claims for failure to state a claim.hlf then filed an opposition to the government motion,attaching additional exhibits and seeking discovery.the government moved to strike all of hlf exhibits that were not part of the administrative record and to bar an evidentiary hearing.
the district court conducted a hearing,consisting entirely of oral argument by counsel,on the motions.the court then issued its decision.it granted summary judgment on the hlf apa claim dismissed,under rule b,the remaining claims except for one aspect of the fourth amendment claim and granted the government motion to strike hlf exhibits.holy land found.for relief dev.ashcroft,d.
ii.the district court opinion 
the holy land foundation attempted to supplement the record before the district court by the addition of exhibits attached to its opposition to the defendants motion to dismiss.the government moved in limine to strike the supplemental material.the district court granted the government motion,holding that apa review must ordinarily be confined to the administrative record.id.at citing camp pitts,d.the court further rejected hlf argument that the ieepa authorizes the blocking of property only where a foreign country or foreign national has a legally enforceable interest in that property,by recognizing that the text of the statute and the cases which have interpreted it impose no restraint on the broad phrase any interest and that the treasury department regular interpretation of that term to mean an interest of any nature whatsoever,direct or indirect had been repeatedly upheld by the courts.see holy land,d at citing regan wald,d.the court then commenced a detailed review of the administrative record and reiterated the evidence on which the treasury department relied in making its determination to designate hlf as an sdgt.see holy land,d at.it found that the record contained ample evidence that hlf has had financial connections to hamas since its creation in hlf leaders have been actively involved in various meetings with hamas leaders hlf funds charitable organizations hlf provides financial support to the orphans and families of hamas martyrs and prisoners hlf jerusalem office acted on behalf of hamas and fbi informants reliably reported that hlf funds hamas.id.at.the court concluded,based on the substantial evidence in the record,treasury determination that hlf acts for or on behalf of hamas was not arbitrary and capricious,and therefore,upheld the agency reasonable determination.
the court then turned to the remainder of hlf claims,and dismissed all but one under federal rule of civil procedure b.first,the court rejected hlf contention that its due process rights had been violated because the government failed to provide notice and a hearing before its assets were blocked.the court found that postponement of notice and hearing were justified in this case,under factors previously articulated by the supreme court.see id.at citing pearson yacht leasing,d.the district court also rejected hlf claim under a substantive due process theory,holding that the designation and blocking were not arbitrary and capricious and did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.see id.at.the court dismissed hlf constitutional claims finding that the designation and blocking order did not violate the entity first amendment right to freedom of association,stating that they do not prohibit membership in hamas or endorsement of its views,and therefore do not implicate hlf associational rights.id.at.additionally,the court found that hlf freedom of speech first amendment rights had not been violated because designation and blocking of funds promote the important and substantial governmental interest in combating terrorism by undermining its financial base,and there is no other,narrower means of ensuring that charitable contributions to a terrorist organization are used for a legitimate purpose.see id.at.
finally,the district court concluded that hlf lacked the ability to invoke its own free exercise rights under the religious freedom restoration act because it had not alleged it was a religious organization or that it engaged in an actual exercise of religion as an organization.id.at.likewise,the court held that hlf lacked standing to invoke the free exercise rights of third parties,such as its donors and employees.see id.at.the court denied the requested preliminary injunction because hlf had failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits and because injury to the government and the public interest supported the executive use of designation and blocking as a means to advance the government foreign policy and national security.id.at.
iii.analysis 
we review the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim under rule b de novo.see browning clinton.additionally,the actions of the treasury department in designating hlf as a sdgt are governed by the judicial review provisions of the apa,a.therefore,if the ofac actions were not arbitrary and capricious,and were based on substantial evidence,we must affirm.
as a first matter,we reject hlf claim that its designation exceeded treasury authority under the apa,and affirm the district court dismissal of that claim.the district court correctly reviewed the actions of the treasury department under the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.see citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d.the district court noted that this standard does not allow the courts to undertake their own factfinding,but to review the agency record to determine whether the agency decision was supported by a rational basis.see holy land,d at citing camp,at.at.
as demonstrated by the district court survey in the opinion below,treasury decision to designate hlf as an sdgt was based on ample evidence in a massive administrative record.hlf attacks the reasonableness of this determination by contending that treasury relied on hearsay evidence to reach its conclusion.this argument is unavailing as it is clear that the government may decide to designate an entity based on a broad range of evidence,including intelligence data and hearsay declarations.see national council of resistance dep t of state,ncor.hlf also argues that treasury was arbitrary and capricious in relying on information that predated the designation of hamas as a terrorist organization.however,as the district court noted,it was clearly rational for treasury to consider hlf genesis and history,which closely connect it with hamas.see holy land,d at.there was no plausible evidence presented which showed that these ties had been severed.the hlf officers and directors who dealt with hamas until remained with hlf in their respective capacities until hlf itself was designated.see id.there was ample record evidence,in any case,that hlf continued beyond to maintain its ties with hamas and continued to give money to entities controlled by and associated with hamas.this evidence included the testimony of numerous fbi sources and findings by both israeli and palestinian governmental authorities.
finally,the district court correctly rejected hlf argument that the ieepa permits blocking of property only where there is a legally enforceable interest to be blocked.see holy land,d at.the plain text of the statute belies hlf contention because it authorizes the blocking of property in which the designated foreign national or country has any interest.a b.the language therefore imposes no limit on the scope of the interest,and ofac has defined this statutory term,pursuant to explicit authorization from congress,to mean,an interest of any nature whatsoever,direct or indirect.we have upheld treasury authority to define these interests.see consarc iraqi ministry,treasury may choose and apply its own definition of property interests,subject to deferential judicial review.the seventh circuit eloquently dealt with the applicability of the ieepa to more than traditional legal interests in global relief foundation,cir.in that case,the global relief foundation,like the hlf in the present case,argued that the word interest in a b refer red to a legal interest,in the way that a trustee is legal owner of the corpus even if someone else enjoys the beneficial interest.id.at emphasis in original.the global relief foundation court rejected that construction as do we,reasoning that t he statute is designed to give the president means to control assets that could be used by enemy aliens.id.that risk is at least as much raised by the prospect of the foreign terrorists holding the beneficial interest,or an interest not defined in traditional common law terms as it is by a legal interest which might be a pure fiction.we find the reasoning of the seventh circuit unassailable and join it.the interest need not be a legally protected one in order to be caught within the net of.in this case,there was ample evidence of foreign interests in hlf assets.there was evidence demonstrating that hlf operated as a fundraiser for hamas in the united states and that hamas officials provided hlf with funds.therefore,ofac did not exceed its authority when it blocked the assets after the designation,because ofac needed only to determine that hamas had an interest in hlf property,and the record provided substantial evidence to support that conclusion.
the district court also properly disposed of hlf due process claims under rule b.first,ofac designation of hlf as an sdgt was not arbitrary and capricious,as demonstrated above.see holy land,d at.nor was the designation in any other way so egregiously unfair as to violate any constraints due process may place upon the substance of the agency decision.additionally,hlf was accorded all the administrative process it was due when it was redesignated as an sdgt.even if treasury initial designation arguably violated hlf due process rights,hlf funds are blocked currently by a redesignation which treasury applied in accordance with the requirements we outlined in ncor.
in ncor,we considered a due process challenge to the secretary of state designation of two foreign entities as foreign terrorist organizations under.a designation under that statute carries a similar implication to those under the executive order at issue in this case.in the record before us in ncor,the secretary of state had afforded the entities neither a predesignation notice nor an opportunity to comment on the evidence against them.we held that the constitution requires that the secretary,in designating organizations as foreign terrorist organizations under that statute,must afford to the entities under consideration for designation notice that the designation is impending,except that u pon an adequate showing to the court,the secretary may provide this notice after the designation where earlier notification would impinge upon the security and other foreign policy goals of the united states.ncor,at.additionally,the secretary must afford to entities considered for imminent designation the opportunity to present,at least in written form,such evidence as those entities may be able to produce to rebut the administrative record or otherwise negate the proposition that they are foreign terrorist organizations.id.at.
in the present case,hlf was initially designated in,in an action taken under the sanctions program,flowing from a presidentially declared national emergency,as recognized by the district court.see holy land,d at.however,in april,treasury notified both holy land and the district court that it was reopening the administrative record and considering whether to redesignate hlf as an sdgt,on the basis of additional evidence linking hlf and hamas.holy land was then given days to respond to the redesignation and the new evidence.holy land did respond and the treasury considered its response as well as the new evidence before deciding to redesignate hlf in may.therefore,treasury provided hlf with the requisite notice and opportunity for res
