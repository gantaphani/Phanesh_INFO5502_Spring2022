in,appellant pantelis antonakeas was arrested in california,where he lived at the time,and was brought to hawaii to stand trial in district court for one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and two counts of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.a jury convicted him of all three counts,and he was released on bail pending sentencing.however,instead of appearing for sentencing,appellant fled the united states and remained at large until german authorities arrested him in.the united states then secured his extradition.
finding himself once again before the district court,appellant moved to terminate the sentencing proceedings,arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction because the united states had failed to comply with certain procedural terms of the extradition treaty.the district judge rejected this argument and imposed sentence.appellant now appeals the denial of his motion to terminate the proceedings.he also argues,for the first time on appeal,that the vienna convention was violated.additionally,appellant raises numerous issues relating to his trial and sentencing constructive amendment of the indictment fatal variance insufficiency of the evidence improper rebuttal testimony brady violations improper venue erroneous refusal to give a mitigating role adjustment and erroneous sentencing based on a quantity of cocaine that was attributed to him by the sentencing judge rather than determined by the jury.we affirm the judgment entered by the district court.
factual background 
after the jury returned its guilty verdict in appellant drug trial on september,appellant was released on bail pending his sentencing,which was scheduled for january.having fled the united states,appellant failed to appear for sentencing.accordingly,he was indicted on january,for failure to appear after having been released on bail,in violation of.
german authorities arrested appellant at the munich airport on august.he has dual nationality and was traveling on his greek passport at the time.the department of justice doj asked the state department to cable the embassy in germany and request that german officials arrest and extradite appellant for both the drug conviction and the indictment for failure to appear.in its request to the state department,the doj referred to the extradition treaty between the united states and germany,and the doj assured that it would provide the supporting documents required under the treaty within the time specified by the treaty.
german officials ultimately approved appellant extradition for the drug conviction but denied it for the indictment appellant was turned over to authorities,and on march,he was again brought before the united states district court for the district of hawaii.appellant objected to the district court assertion of jurisdiction based on an alleged procedural violation of the treaty on december,after receiving briefing on the issue,the district court denied appellant motion to terminate the proceedings and sentenced appellant to months of incarceration and five years of supervised release on each count,all to run concurrently.
originally in the district court,appellant was charged with conspiracy to distribute a quantity of cocaine in excess of grams count and with possession with intent to distribute a quantity of cocaine in excess of grams counts and.the organizer of the conspiracy,vassilios liaskos,was a honolulu resident who distributed there each month multiple kilograms of cocaine that he received from several suppliers.much of the cocaine was transported to liaskos by sergio panagiotopoulos,cyriakos cyzeridis,and hristos testified at trial that appellant had sold,supplied,or attempted to supply them with cocaine on numerous occasions.the ways and means section of count alleged that,in order to achieve the objectives of the conspiracy,appellant among several others from,and continuing through obtained kilogram quantities of cocaine in california for delivery to vassilios liaskos in honolulu,hawaii.counts and also stated that the defendants knew and intended that the cocaine would be distributed in hawaii.
during deliberations,the jury sent out a note asking,to be part of this conspiracy charge count does the defendant need to have the knowledge that the cocaine was to be ultimately sold and distributed in hawaii the district judge responded the answer to that question is no.the elements of the conspiracy that the government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt are set forth in court instruction and the indictment.the court instructions did not include the hawaii nexus with regard to either the conspiracy count or the counts.
appellant argues that the hawaii nexus of each count was critical and that omitting the hawaii nexus constituted a constructive amendment to the indictment,resulted in a fatal variance between the indictment and the evidence,and resulted in the government failing to prove his involvement in the conspiracy.
appellant also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial,which contended that he was prejudiced by the government rebuttal case.on direct examination during the defense case,appellant denied any involvement in the sale or use of drugs.he claimed to be an aspiring music remixer and testified,we do not tolerate any drug abusers or users in our business.in rebuttal,the prosecution called panagiotopolous,a major participant in the conspiracy,who testified to two cocaine sales made to him by appellant.
appellant also makes two allegations of brady violations,for which he also moved for a mistrial in the district court.first,he contends that the government should have produced a dea agent debriefing report for panagiotopolous.after being arrested,panagiotopolous attempted to negotiate a plea agreement with the government.it took several months for panagiotopolous to reach an agreement because the government initially did not believe that he was telling the truth.relying on the fact that the government did not initially believe panagiotopolous,appellant argues that panagiotopolous statements,made during the plea negotiations and summarized in the report,were brady material.the district court rejected this argument and denied a mistrial.
second,appellant contends that the government should have disclosed that government witness cyzeridis had tried to bribe another government witness,vasuras.the district court denied the defense motion for a mistrial,holding that the government had no obligation to disclose anything in reference to cyzeridis.
additionally,appellant argues that venue was not proper in hawaii and that the sentencing judge erred in denying him a mitigating role adjustment.and,finally,we construe a letter filed by appellant pursuant to rule of appellate procedure j as arguing that he was sentenced,in violation of the rule announced in apprendi new jersey,d,on the basis of a quantity of cocaine that was not determined by the jury,but rather by the judge at sentencing.
discussion 
standing to raise procedural violations of an extradition treaty 
the united states argues that appellant has no standing to raise noncompliance with procedural provisions of the treaty as a bar to jurisdiction in the district court.we agree.an early supreme court case,united states rauscher,recognized the right of a person extradited to enforce what has become known as a specialty provision in a requirement that the receiving country may proceed against the person extradited only for offenses that are enumerated in the treaty and upon which extradition actually rested.in rauscher,the treaty enumerated murder as an eligible offense,and extradition rested on that offense,but the defendant was tried and convicted for the lesser offense of cruel and unusual punishment.id.at.the supreme court reversed.id.at.a more recent supreme court case,united states,d,expressed agreement that a defendant may not be prosecuted in violation of the terms of an extradition treaty,citing rauscher.but there the court held that a treaty could not be violated where it was not invoked because the defendant had in fact been kidnapped,not extradited.id.at.in united states najohn,cir per curiam,another specialty case,this court made the broad statement that the person extradited may raise whatever objections the rendering country might have.despite this broad pronouncement,however,we conclude that,unlike the substantive right of specialty,procedural violations do not give rise to individually enforceable rights.
whether or not treaty violations can provide the basis for particular claims or defenses depend s upon the particular treaty and claim involved.united states,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.unlike specialty,which is a substantive requirement that goes to the heart of the requested country decision to allow extradition,a deadline is a procedural requirement without similar import.if a deadline is missed during the extradition process,the requested country can simply refuse extradition on that ground.by contrast,once the person sought has been turned over to the requesting country for specified offenses,the requested country has no recourse if the offenses ultimately charged are different from the offenses upon which extradition was allowed.for this reason,it is necessary to allow the person extradited to raise this type of treaty violation in the requesting country because the requested country has no opportunity to enforce the specialty provision on its own behalf if the authorities in germany believed that there was a treaty violation,they could have refused extradition.there is no policy reason to accord appellant standing to raise in the district court an alleged missed extradition deadline after germany has determined that the treaty provisions were fulfilled and extradition was proper.
vienna convention 
appellant contends that his detention violated the vienna convention because he was not informed of his right to contact the greek consulate in germany and because the greek consulate was not contacted about his detention he argues that this failure prejudiced him with regard to challenging extradition.appellant did not raise the vienna convention argument in the district court.
as a general rule,this court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.bolker commissioner,cir united states greger,cir.there are three exceptions to this rule 
if there are exceptional circumstances why the issue was not raised in the trial court,the new issue arises while the appeal is pending because of a change in the law,or the issue presented is purely one of law and the opposing party will suffer no prejudice as a result of the failure to raise the issue in the trial court.
united states,cir united states carlson,cir.none of the exceptions applies.no exceptional circumstances have been alleged.there has been no change in the law.and the issue presented is heavily dependent on the facts,which have not been developed.we therefore decline to review appellant claim that the vienna convention was violated.
constructive amendment of the indictment 
in this case,appellant constructive amendment,variance,and insufficiency of the evidence arguments all boil down to the ultimate issue of sufficiency of the evidence.the fifth amendment grand jury requirement establishes the substantial right to be tried only on charges presented in an indictment returned by a grand jury.united states miller,d quoting stirone united states,d.an indictment is amended when it is so altered as to charge a different offense from that found by the grand jury.id.at.appellant constructive amendment challenge is based upon the assertion that a defendant indicted for involvement with a specific conspiracy with a hawaii nexus can not be convicted on that indictment of involvement with either a general conspiracy with no particular nexus or an isolated drug sale extrinsic to the charged conspiracy.
the supreme court discussed constructive amendment at length in miller 
convictions generally have been sustained as long as the proof upon which they are based corresponds to an offense that was clearly set out in the indictment.a part of the indictment unnecessary to and independent of the allegations of the offense proved may normally be treated as a useless averment that may be ignored.ford united states.
at.miller indictment for mail fraud alleged that he consented to a burglary of his business and lied to his insurance company about the value of his loss.id.at.his conviction was upheld,even though the proof at trial only addressed lying about the value of the loss.see id.at.the allegation in the indictment about consenting to the burglary was surplusage.id.at.
the miller court distinguished the situation where an indictment charges a certain act,but a different act is actually proven,thus broadening the bases for conviction to acts beyond those charged in the indictment.see id.at discussing stirone,in which the indictment alleged obstruction of sand shipments into pennsylvania but the proof showed obstruction of steel shipments out of pennsylvania.
in this case,appellant contends that the grand jury indicted him for a conspiracy to distribute cocaine in hawaii but the proof at trial failed to connect him to hawaii.as in miller,however,even if appellant were correct that the hawaii nexus was read out of the indictment,what was removed from the case was in no way essential to the offense on which the jury convicted.id.at.therefore,the government did not constructively amend appellant indictment.and,as discussed below,the government did in fact connect appellant to the single conspiracy to supply liaskos with cocaine for distribution in hawaii.
a variance occurs when the proof introduced at trial differs materially from the facts alleged in the indictment.charles alan wright,federal practice and procedure,criminal ed.the distinction between an amendment to an indictment and a variance is blurred 
the stirone rule,treating a variance as a constructive amendment of the indictment or information and assuming it to be prejudicial,has been limited to cases in which the prosecution presents a complex of facts distinctly different from that set forth in the charging instrument and not applied where there is a single set of facts.if there is only a single set of facts,and the matter is considered to be only a variance rather than a constructive amendment,the variance is reversible error only if it has affected substantial rights,and is not fatal unless the defendant could not have anticipated from the indictment what evidence would be presented at trial 
id.emphasis added.
as discussed below,the government proof concerned only a single set of facts the supplying of cocaine to liaskos for distribution in hawaii.moreover,appellant could anticipate the evidence that would be presented at trial,and he conducted his defense appropriately.our opinion in united states tsinhnahijinnie,cir,illustrates the type of extreme facts required for fatal variance to be found.in tsinhnahijinnie the defendant was indicted for sexual abuse of a child occurring on an indian reservation during the summer of.id.at.however,the child testimony fluctuated between placing the abuse at the place and time in the indictment and placing it off the reservation in.id.at.because the evidence adduced at trial differed significantly from the allegations in the indictment,we held that the indictment had not given the defendant adequate notice of the crime charged.id.at.and the evidence that was produced as to the indicted crime was insufficient.id.
unlike in tsinhnahijinnie,the evidence adduced and theories asserted at appellant trial covered the facts and time frame alleged in his indictment.thus his case is distinguishable from those in which a fatal variance has been found.see also jeffers united states,cir reversing convictions due to fatal variance where indictment alleged that money collected from followers of religious group was used for purposes evidence failed to prove that use was,instead showing only that use was contrary to representations made when money was collected.
appellant argues a second variance theory,stemming from kotteakos united states,that the government proved multiple conspiracies under an indictment alleging only a single conspiracy.however,the government theory throughout this case was that appellant was part of a single conspiracy to supply liaskos with cocaine for distribution in hawaii.the government did not prove multiple conspiracies it connected everything back to liaskos and hawaii.thus,kotteakos is inapplicable.see united states,cir under our precedent,kotteakos is inapplicable if the evidence supports a finding that the charged conspiracy exists.united states moore,cir rejecting kotteakos argument because appellant was not subjected to the danger that he might be convicted on the basis of evidence that related only to a conspiracy of which he was not a part.therefore,appellant claim boils down to an argument that the government did not connect him to the single conspiracy that it proved.see united states duran,cir the issue of whether a single conspiracy has been proved is a question of the sufficiency of the evidence.
sufficiency of the evidence 
claims of insufficient evidence are reviewed de novo.duran,at.the government proved beyond question that a conspiracy existed to supply liaskos with cocaine to be distributed in hawaii,and appellant does not argue otherwise.instead,he contends that the evidence was sufficient to convict him only of isolated sales of cocaine,not to connect him to the conspiracy.we disagree.evidence is sufficient to connect a defendant to a conspiracy if it shows that the defendant had knowledge of and participated in the conspiracy.id.at.in other words 
the government need not show direct contact or explicit agreement between the defendants.it is sufficient to show that each defendant knew or had reason to know of the scope of the conspiracy and that each defendant had reason to believe that his own benefits were dependent on the success of the entire venture.
united states montgomery,cir quoting united states kostoff,cir.furthermore,o nce the existence of a conspiracy is established,evidence establishing beyond a reasonable doubt a connection of a defendant with the conspiracy,even though the connection is slight,is sufficient to convict him with knowing participation in the conspiracy.united states dunn,cir.
testimony before the jury attributed to appellant the sale or attempted sale of numerous kilograms of cocaine to cyzeridis and vasuras who immediately carried the cocaine to liaskos in hawaii via commercial airline flights.these are overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy if the government connected appellant to it.the government did.
phone records reflecting calls made from liaskos apartment in honolulu to appellant house in los angeles were admitted into evidence.the government also elicited testimony from vasuras that appellant stated in february of that he knew that the cocaine he supplied was being taken to hawaii.vasuras then testified that appellant sold and attempted to arrange sales of cocaine after february of,after appellant knew that the cocaine was destined for hawaii.this evidence is sufficient for a reasonable juror to conclude that appellant realized the scope of the conspiracy as well as the dependence of his own continued benefits on the success of the conspiracy 
the government rebuttal case 
admission of rebuttal evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see jackson calderon,cir,cert.denied.united states,cir.
appellant contends that pangiotopoulos appellant had sold him cocaine on two beyond the proper scope of rebuttal.the government responds that appellant,on direct examination during the defense,opened the door for rebuttal by making sweeping denials of any involvement in drugs.we agree that this was proper impeachment by contradiction.federal rule of evidence allows the admission of extrinsic evidence to impeach specific errors or falsehoods in a witness testimony on direct examination.united states castillo,cir.in castillo,the defendant,on direct examination,testified that he worked with disadvantaged children and would not smuggle drugs for a million dollars and portrayed himself as an counselor who taught kids to stay away from drugs.id.at.after this sweeping denial,the district court allowed the government to call a rebuttal witness to impeach the defendant with testimony about his prior arrest for cocaine possession.id.this court affirmed and explained 
rule b prohibits the use of extrinsic evidence of conduct to impeach a witness credibility in terms of his general veracity.in contrast,the concept of impeachment by contradiction permits courts to admit extrinsic evidence that specific testimony is false,because contradicted by other evidence 
testimony containing a broad disclaimer of misconduct sometimes can open the door for extrinsic evidence to contradict even though the contradictory evidence is otherwise inadmissible under rules and b and is,thus,collateral.this approach has been justified on the grounds that the witness should not be permitted to engage in perjury,mislead the trier of fact,and then shield himself from impeachment by asserting the doctrine.
charles wright victor gold,federal practice and procedure,at.
in his direct examination appellant held himself out as a legitimate remixer in the music industry.he said that drugs are absolute ly not accepted in that industry.he explained that in the and a lot of careers were ruined and a lot of companies fell apart because of drug addiction so in the the music business has been very,very careful about drugs and remove to work with any people that might be involved in any extent with drugs.he finished,we do tolerate any drug abusers or users in our business.so the have been very,very clean as far as usage of drugs in the music business.with these sweeping statements disavowing any involvement with drugs,appellant opened the door to the government use of panagiotopolous in rebuttal.castillo,at united states,cir defendant government witnesses about whether he had the accouterments of wealth one might expect of a drug dealer government allowed to call expert to testify that drug couriers are generally not wealthy united states bailleaux,cir defendant opened door by testifying about prior conviction on direct government allowed on to introduce evidence of the underlying facts of that conviction to rebut inference of innocence.the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the prosecution to impeach appellant broad denial of any involvement in drugs.
alleged brady violations 
a district court denial of a new trial motion based on alleged brady violations is reviewed de novo.united states howell,cir.to prevail on a brady claim the defendant must show that the evidence was exculpatory or impeaching it should have been,but was not produced and the suppressed evidence was material to his guilt or punishment.paradis arave,cir.evidence is material under brady only if there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had it been disclosed to the defense.united states service deli,cir united states bagley,d.brady encompasses impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence.id.at.giglio united states,d.the prosecution obligation to disclose evidence favorable to the defense turns on the cumulative effect of all such evidence suppressed by the government.kyles whitley,d.moreover,this obligation is independent of whether,at the time,the prosecutor knew of the favorable evidence or appreciated its significance.see id.at rejecting arguments that prosecutor should not be held accountable for information known only by the police and that it is difficult to realize what might become important later.
appellant contends that the government violated brady by failing to disclose a dea agent report summarizing statements made by witness sergio panagiotopoulos.he argues that he was prejudiced because the reports show that inconsistent statements were made by panagiotopoulos during six months of plea negotiations.the district court rejected this argument and denied a mistrial when the government explained that it had initially thought that panagiotopoulos was lying to protect his wife.the government originally believed that panagiotopoulos wife had participated in the conspiracy however,it later concluded that she had not an
