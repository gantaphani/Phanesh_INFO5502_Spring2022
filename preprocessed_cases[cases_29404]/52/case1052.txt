in this case we decide when a foreign judgment is final for purposes of recognition under the uniform foreign recognition act ufmjra code civ,former et,added by stats,ch,repealed by stats,ch,eff,and what statute of limitations applies.
the ufmjra authorizes recognition of any foreign judgment that is final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered even though an appeal therefrom is pending or it is subject to appeal.former.when a foreign judgment is appealed,and the foreign nation law provides that a judgment on appeal is not final,does section permit a california court to recognize the judgment we conclude the answer is no.the most reasonable interpretation of the admittedly confusing statutory language is that the law of the nation where the judgment was rendered determines whether the judgment is sufficiently final,conclusive,and enforceable to be subject to recognition in california.if the foreign nation rule is that judgments are final even though an appeal is pending,a judgment may be recognized in california despite an appeal.if the foreign rule is that judgments are not final while an appeal is pending,a judgment on appeal can not be recognized in california.this interpretation is consistent with the conclusions reached by other states applying the uniform act and the apparent intent of the commissioners who drafted it.
the ufmjra does not prescribe a statute of limitations for actions to recognize foreign judgments however,the act does provide with one exception not relevant here that a foreign judgment is enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state which is entitled to full faith and credit.former.an action to enforce a sister state judgment is subject to a statute of limitations.it appears section reflects the legislature intent to apply the same limitations period to the enforcement of judgments from foreign nations.a limitations period is also consistent with the period of enforceability for california judgments.see also.et providing for extension of the enforceability period by renewal of the judgment.over a century ago,this court did hold in dore thornburgh cal,that the catchall limitations period of section applied to an action to recover upon a foreign judgment.however,dore was decided long before the legislature enacted the ufmjra.thus,it is no longer controlling.
background 
on november,the qatari company manco contracting manco obtained a judgment against krikor bezdikian in the grand civil court of doha,in the nation of qatar.bezdikian appealed from the judgment,then left the country.he now lives in california.on may,a qatari appellate court amended the judgment,reducing the award from more than million to approximately million.the qatari appellate court issued a new judgment awarding manco this new amount plus a reasonable share of court expenses and an amount for attorney fees.
on may,manco filed a complaint in the los angeles county superior court seeking to domesticate its qatari judgment under the ufmjra.bezdikian sought summary judgment,arguing that the cause of action accrued in,and was therefore barred by the statute of limitations of section,which both sides believed applied.see dore thornburgh,supra,cal.
in response,manco submitted an expert declaration stating that,under qatari law,a judgment is never final before conclusion of an appeal unless the parties previously agreed to treat the judgment as final,the judgment is nonappealable,or the time for appeal has expired.thus,manco maintained its cause of action did not accrue until may,when the qatari appellate court issued its amended judgment.the trial court rejected this argument.based on the analysis in korea water resources lee th,d korea water,the court interpreted section to provide that the ufmjra permits recognition of a foreign judgment that has been appealed,or is subject to appeal,regardless of whether the foreign country recognizes it as final under such circumstances.accordingly,the court concluded manco cause of action for recognition accrued in november,when the qatari trial court entered judgment against bezdikian.
the court of appeal reversed.disagreeing with korea water,the court interpreted section to mean that a foreign judgment is not subject to recognition under the ufmjra unless and until it is final,conclusive,and enforceable under the law where the judgment was rendered.if the foreign jurisdiction law does not consider a judgment to be final while it is on appeal,then a claim under section to recognize the judgment can not be brought until after the appellate process has ended.the court of appeal concluded the expert testimony offered by manco raised a triable issue of fact about whether the initial judgment was sufficiently final and conclusive under qatari law to satisfy section,and therefore summary judgment should have been denied.because the court interpretation of section meant that manco claim was timely even under the statute of limitations of section,the court of appeal did not consider manco additional arguments,raised for the first time on appeal,that no statute of limitations applies to a recognition action,or,alternatively,that the limitations period applicable to enforcement of sister state judgments is controlling 
we granted review to resolve both the accrual and statute of limitations questions.
discussion 
i.when a foreign judgment is final under the ufmjra 
california adopted the ufmjra in.before the legislature codified the provisions of this uniform act,the recognition and enforcement of foreign money judgments proceeded as a matter of comity.renoir redstar th,d see hilton guyot.comity remains the basis for recognizing foreign judgments not covered by the act,such as domestic relations judgments,subd.b,see in re stephanie cal th,d,observing,with respect to mexican child custody decree,that courts of this state may,but are not required to,execute the judgment of a foreign nation as a matter of comity.
the purpose of the uniform act was to codify the most prevalent common law rules for recognizing foreign money judgments and thereby encourage the reciprocal recognition of united states judgments in other countries.pt.ii west laws ann.foreign.recognition act,prefatory note,uniform act.many civil law countries make the recognition of foreign judgments dependent upon reciprocity.drafters of the uniform act believed codification of uniform rules would satisfy foreign reciprocity concerns and encourage greater recognition and enforcement of american judgments abroad.see also bank of montreal kough,the purpose of the uniform act was to create greater recognition of the state judgments in foreign nations.this was to be accomplished by informing the foreign nations of particular situations in which their judgments would definitely be recognized,and thus encourage them to recognize california judgments.
the dispute here centers on the meaning of section,which describes the type of foreign judgments that may be recognized under the ufmjra.section states this chapter applies to any foreign judgment that is final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered even though an appeal therefrom is pending or it is subject to appeal.former.california courts have disagreed about the extent to which the second clause undermines the first.
the court of appeal in this case gave primacy to the first clause,interpreting section to consider a foreign judgment final,despite an appeal,if it is otherwise final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered,italics added.the court observed that,unlike california,some foreign jurisdictions consider a judgment to be final and conclusive even if subject to appeal or modification.recognizing these differences,the court of appeal interpreted section to mean that,in all cases,recognition of a foreign judgment depends upon the judgment finality,conclusiveness,and enforceability in the country where rendered,even if the foreign country rules are different from those we apply in california.
the opposite conclusion was reached in korea water,supra,th,d.there,the court termed the second clause of section the appellate caveat.giving primacy to the caveat,the korea water court interpreted the statute to mean california will recognize foreign judgments that are final,conclusive,and enforceable,notwithstanding the fact they may still be subject to appellate review,regardless of the foreign law on this point.korea water,supra,at,d.the korea water court recognized that there is considerable tension between the two clauses.its attempt to reconcile them ultimately fails the tests of logic and practicality,however.the court observed,section reference to a final,conclusive and enforceable judgment where rendered makes it clear it is the status of the foreign judgment in the foreign country that determines whether the judgment is ripe for recognition in california.ibid.yet it ultimately undermined this observation by concluding that the appellate caveat language was meant to override any contrary foreign law concerning the effect of an appeal the appellate caveat to section makes it clear that the fact that a foreign judgment is still vulnerable to change on appeal in the foreign country is not alone enough to preclude recognition of a foreign judgment which is otherwise final,conclusive,and enforceable in the foreign country,second italics added.the court appeared to say that we look to foreign law to decide whether a judgment is final,conclusive and enforceable,but if,under foreign law,the judgment is not final because of a pending or a potential appeal,we ignore foreign law and recognize the judgment anyway.
the korea water court went on to apply this principle in the case before it,which involved a korean judgment.korea water,supra,th at,d.after the judgment was affirmed by korea intermediate appellate court,the judgment creditor filed a recognition action in california and obtained a writ of attachment on the judgment debtor assets in this state.id.at,d.however,the appellate process in korea was not finished.the judgment debtor moved for summary judgment in the recognition action on the ground that the korean judgment was not final,conclusive,and enforceable in korea because it was on appeal before the korea supreme court.id.at,d.he relied on article of the korean code of civil procedure,which states that a korean judgment shall not become final and conclusive during the period in which an appeal may be filed or when a lawful appeal has been filed within the prescribed period.korea water,supra,at,d.the trial court did not dismiss the recognition proceeding but stayed it,pursuant to section to await the korea supreme court ruling.korea water,supra,at,d.later,after the korea supreme court rejected the legal theory of liability on which the case had been tried,canceled the intermediate appellate court judgment,and remanded the case for a new trial,the california trial court concluded the korean judgment was no longer final,conclusive,and enforceable for purposes of allowing recognition here.ibid.it therefore dismissed the recognition action and discharged the writ of attachment.ibid.
the court of appeal agreed the recognition action was properly dismissed because the judgment at issue had been largely undermined by the decision of the korea supreme court.korea water,supra,th at,d.the korea supreme court ruling had rendered the judgment uncertain not only as to amount but also as to whether it is supported by a viable legal theory.ibid.as a result,the court of appeal concluded the judgment was not sufficiently conclusive,under section,to be recognized in california.korea water,supra,at,d.
however,the court of appeal also discussed whether the recognition action should have been dismissed previously because the judgment was not final and conclusive under korean law when it was on appeal.korea water,supra,th at,d.the court did not consider korea law on finality determinative.it reasoned that doing so would in effect be eviscerating the appellate caveat provision of section.korea water,supra,at,d.in other words,the court interpreted section to mean that california has chosen not to preclude recognition merely because the judgment is subject to appellate review korea water,supra,at,d,even if this result is directly contrary to the law of the country where the judgment was rendered.
perhaps recognizing the practical difficulties this interpretation could which were in fact presented in the case before it,when the korea supreme court overturned the very judgment a california court was prepared to court of appeal posited that the legislature must have included the appellate caveat to give judgment creditors access to provisional remedies.korea water,supra,th at,d.under the court view,a party could bring a recognition action to obtain provisional remedies to satisfy an appealed foreign judgment.the court could then stay the action until conclusion of the appellate process to avoid preserving a foreign judgment that might later be reversed.id.at,d.the problem is there is no basis in legislative history,or elsewhere,to indicate that this process was contemplated or intended.on the contrary,as we have explained,the stated purpose of the uniform act was to satisfy the reciprocity concerns of foreign nations and encourage them to recognize judgments from the united states.pt.ii west laws,supra,foreign.recognition act,prefatory note.korea water interpretation of section appears to run counter to this goal of international cooperation because it would permit california courts to override foreign law with respect to the finality of a judgment pending on appeal.
we believe the better interpretation of section is the one reached by the court of appeal here.that is,california courts must recognize a foreign judgment,regardless of whether it has been appealed or is subject to appeal,so long as the judgment is final,conclusive,and enforceable in the country where it was rendered.the statutory language requiring recognition even though an appeal therefrom is pending or the judgment is subject to appeal former is not an exception to the requirements of finality,conclusiveness,and enforceability in the nation of origin.rather,this language is meant to amplify the directive that finality,conclusiveness,and enforceability are to be assessed based on the law of the foreign jurisdiction where judgment was rendered.in other words,the appellate caveat operates to ensure that foreign rules regarding finality are honored,even if they differ from the california approach.
a cursory review of cases under the uniform act reveals that foreign countries have different standards governing when a judgment is final.compare chimexim velco enterprises d,romanian law regards a judgment as final despite a pending appeal dart dart,english law regards a judgment as final even though it is subject to appeal or subsequent modification with mayekawa manufacturing sasaki,under japanese law,the lodging of an appeal prevents a judgment from becoming final.indeed,even in this country,federal and state laws may differ about when a judgment is final,conclusive,and enforceable.while in california a judgment is not final and conclusive between the parties when it is on appeal,or for as long as it remains subject to appeal,the federal rule is contrary.franklin franklin owners for fair franchising th,d sandoval superior court d.see nathanson hecker th,fn,d explaining difference between california and federal law on finality.by clarifying that a foreign judgment must be recognized in california if it is regarded as final under the rendering country law,even though it has been appealed or is subject to appeal,the legislature apparently sought to deter a judicial impulse to apply california own,potentially contrary,understanding of when a judgment becomes final.if a foreign jurisdiction law provides that a judgment is final and conclusive despite an appeal,section requires california courts to recognize a judgment from that jurisdiction unless certain grounds for nonrecognition apply see former.however,in such cases section gives the court discretion to stay the recognition proceedings until all foreign appeals have concluded.
this interpretation is generally consistent with decisions reached in other states that have adopted the uniform act.for example,in dart dart,supra,at page applying michigan law and chimexim velco enterprises,supra,d at page applying new york law,the courts concluded foreign judgments could be recognized under the act,despite the fact that the judgments were on appeal chimexim or subject to modification dart,because they were final under the laws of the countries where they were rendered.
our interpretation is also consistent with the one decision we have found that addresses the precise issue before us,whether the uniform act permits recognition of a foreign judgment that is not final under the law of the foreign jurisdiction where judgment was entered.in mayekawa manufacturing sasaki,supra,at pages,a party sought recognition of a japanese money judgment that stated it could be preliminarily enforced.however,the judgment resulted from a special proceeding to which objections had been lodged,and japanese law provided that a judgment does not become final and conclusive until the time for taking an appeal or lodging an objection has expired.id.at.based on washington version of the uniform act applicability provision,which mirrors our section the court concluded it could not recognize the japanese judgment.mayekawa manufacturing sasaki,supra,at.although the judgment was preliminarily enforceable,it was not final and conclusive under japanese law,and the washington court considered this deficiency fatal to the recognition action.id.at.the court observed,however,that its ruling did not preclude a later application for recognition after the judgment became final and conclusive in japan.id.at.
to our knowledge,no court or other authority has reached the conclusion in korea water that the uniform act requirement of a final judgment refers only to finality in the trial court,a judgment that is not interlocutory korea water,supra,th at,d.if the legislature had intended to restrict the meaning of final in such a manner,it could have easily added the phrase in the trial court after final.moreover,this interpretation of final would require california courts to recognize all noninterlocutory foreign judgments,regardless of whether such judgments are considered final under the law of the country where they were rendered former.the plain meaning of the statutory language requires california courts to look to the foreign jurisdiction law to assess the finality and conclusiveness of a judgment.when foreign law holds that a judgment is not final if it is interlocutory or if it is subject to appeal,section requires a california court to honor this procedural rule.we see no basis in the statute for courts to distinguish between the types of finality for which foreign law will be considered 
it is also worth noting that the legislature recently removed the appellate caveat language so heavily relied upon by bezdikian here and by the korea water court.the newly enacted ufcmjra see ante,fn.applies to a judgment to the extent that the judgment both grants or denies recovery of a sum of money.under the law of the foreign country where rendered,is final,conclusive,and enforceable,subd.a.although provisions of the ufcmjra apply only to recognition actions begun after the act effective date of january,legislative history indicates the new uniform act was intended primarily to clarify provisions of the earlier act that had led to confusion.see com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.may,bill no.would,according to the sponsors,update and clarify the ufmjra and correct problems created by the courts interpretations of various provisions of that act over the years since its adoption in.
manco submitted evidence indicating the judgment in this case was not final under qatari law until may,when the qatari appellate court issued an amended judgment under section,a cause of action to recognize the judgment could not have been maintained before its finality in.accordingly,manco may,complaint seeking recognition of the judgment was timely even under the statute of limitation of section,and the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.as we discuss next,however,section does not furnish the limitations period for recognition actions 
ii.statute of limitations 
we last considered the statute of limitations applicable to an action upon a foreign judgment in.in dore thornburgh,supra,cal,the plaintiff brought an action to recover upon a judgment issued by an english court in.id.at.we rejected the defendant argument that the complaint was barred by the statute of limitations for an action upon a contract.instead,observing that an action on a foreign judgment is not specifically provided for by any other section of the statute of limitations,we determined the claim was governed by the catchall limitations period of section.dore thornburgh,supra,at.section stated then,as it does now an action for relief not hereinbefore provided for must be commenced within four years after the cause of action shall have accrued.
in,more than years after our decision in dore thornburgh,supra,cal,the legislature enacted the provisions of the ufmjra.the act does not specify a statute of limitations for actions to recognize foreign judgments.it simply provides that,unless certain specified grounds for nonrecognition apply,a foreign judgment meeting the requirements of section is conclusive between the parties to the extent that it grants or denies recovery of a sum of money.the foreign judgment is enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state which is entitled to full faith and credit,except that it may not be enforced pursuant to the provisions of chapter commencing with section of this title.former.the exception refers to the sister state money judgments act,which provides an expedited procedure for registering and enforcing sister state judgments in california.bank of america jennett th,d.
as initially enacted in,section stated only that foreign money judgments were enforceable in the same manner as sister state judgments.stats,ch.at that time,t he exclusive way to enforce a sister state money judgment in california was to bring an action on the judgment this traditional manner of enforcing judgments of sister states require d all the normal trappings of an original action.cal.law revision com.renoir redstar,supra,th at,d.when the legislature passed the sister state money judgments act in,it amended section to clarify that judgments secured in foreign countries can not be enforced using these new expedited procedures.stats,ch.rather,foreign money judgments must be enforced with all the normal trappings of an original action that had existed before in connection with the enforcement of sister state judgments.citations.renoir redstar,supra,at,d.
there is an analytical difference between recognition of a foreign judgment and enforcement of that judgment.a foreign judgment must be recognized before it is enforced,making enforcement,perhaps,the most common reason for filing such an action.of course,recognition may also be sought so that a party may rely on res judicata or collateral estoppel principles unrelated to enforcement of a money judgment.see rest d foreign relations law of the,com.b,renoir redstar,supra,th at,d.the parties acknowledge this difference,but they draw different conclusions about its meaning for purposes of section.
manco notes that california ufmjra does not include a statute of limitations but requires only that a foreign judgment be final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered to be subject to recognition.former,italics added.this requirement ensures that a foreign judgment will not be recognized in california if it is unenforceable under the statute of limitations,or on any other basis,in the country where it was rendered.manco argues the absence of a limitations period in the ufmjra reflects a legislative intent that no california statute of limitations can bar recognition of a foreign judgment.
the florida supreme court adopted this reasoning in interpreting its version of the uniform act.nadd le credit lyonnais,so d nadd.the court explained that the ufmjra contemplates a process before the judgment can be collected in this state.first,the judgment must be recognized then the judgment creditor must institute enforcement proceedings.id.at.because the act does not list expiration of the forum state statute of limitations as a ground for nonrecognition of a foreign judgment,the nadd court concluded no florida statute of limitations applies to the recognition of foreign judgments under its act.id.at the only limitation applicable to the recognition of a foreign money judgment is that the judgment be enforceable where rendered florida statute of limitations does not affect the recognition portion of a ufmjra action.the relevance of nadd holding to our case is questionable because,unlike california,florida has adopted a bifurcated approach.expedited procedures permit the recognition of a foreign judgment without the filing of a civil action.see id.at discussing the recognition procedure in.stat.however,florida apparently requires the bringing of a traditional action to secure enforcement.see nadd,supra,at.the florida supreme court did apply a statute of limitations to these enforcement actions.based on a provision requiring enforcement of a recognized foreign judgment in the same manner as a judgment issued in florida the court concluded an action to enforce a foreign judgment must be filed within florida limitations period for enforcement of domestic judgments.nadd,supra,at.
california has not enacted an expedited procedure for the registration of foreign judgments.rather,a party seeking recognition of a foreign judgment under the ufmjra must file a civil action.renoir redstar,supra,th at,d.in california,c ivil actions,without exception,must be commenced within a statutorily prescribed limitations period,italics added.because the ufmjra does not set forth its own limitations period for actions to recognize foreign judgments,we must decide whether the legislature intended that recognition actions be governed by a specific statute of limitations or fall under the catchall limitations period of section.
once a foreign judgment is recognized,it is enforceable in the same manner as a sister state judgment former or domestic judgment see a registered sister state judgment has same force and effect as the judgment of a california court.an action to enforce a sister state judgment is subject to a statute of limitations,subd.the period of enforceability of a domestic judgment is also years,although this period may be extended by renewal of the judgment see et.in our view,section provision that a foreign judgment meeting the requirements for recognition is enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state which is entitled to full faith and credit conveys a legislative intent that actions to enforce foreign judgments be subject to the same procedural requirements and defenses as actions to enforce judgments from other states.one such requirement is section statute of limitations.even bezdikian concedes that,under the relevant statutes,a judgment creditor has years to enforce a foreign judgment.the question he raises is whether the same limitations period properly applies to an action seeking to recognize the foreign judgment in the first place.bezdikian argues the legislature failure to specify a statute of limitations for recognition actions,as opposed to enforcement actions,means these actions must still be subject to the limitations period of section,as we concluded long ago in dore thornburgh,supra,cal.at page.
we disagree.the distinction bezdikian seeks to draw between a recognition action and an enforcement action is artificial and misleading when applied in the statute of limitations context.although california does not have expedited procedures for registration of a foreign judgment,the law of this state does not require a judgment creditor to file two successive actions,first for recognition and then for enforcement,in order to recover on a foreign judgment.when an action is brought on a foreign money judgment,enforcement,recovery of the amount of the judgment,is most frequently the ultimate goal.actions such as the one before us are commonly called domestication actions because the relief they seek is entry of a california judgment for the amount of the foreign judgment.this domestication of the foreign judgment enables the judgment creditor to pursue all the enforcement avenues available for recovering domestic money judgments.see,korea water,supra,th at,d action sought california judgment for money owed on korean judgment see also dore thornburgh,supra,cal.at,action sought to recover upon an english judgment.although it might be theoretically possible for a party to bring a recognition action without seeking to enforce the foreign judgment,the parties recognize enforcement is almost always the ultimate goal.certainly,the present case involves more than a simple claim for recognition.manco complaint seeks recognition of the qatari judgment for the purpose of enforcing it.
based on the directive of section that foreign judgments be enforced in the same manner as sister state judgments,we conclude the statute of limitations applicable to actions upon sister state judgments also applies to actions upon foreign judgments.this is so regardless of whether the action is styled as a claim for recognition or enforcement or domestication.under section,a judgment creditor may seek recognition of a foreign money judgment as soon as the judgment is final,conclusive,and enforceable under the laws of the country where it was rendered.at that point,a cause of action for recognition accrues,and the judgment creditor must bring any claim for recognition or enforcement of the judgment within years,former.
considering that the legislature has given judgment creditors years to enforce domestic and sister state judgments,and has also indicated an intent to apply this period to the enforcement of foreign judgments see former,it would make no sense to hold that a shorter limitations period applies to the preliminary proceedings necessary to recognize the judgment.in a typical domestication action,bezdikian view would require the judgment creditor to file an action within four years after judgment was entered in the foreign country even though a domesticated judgment is enforceable for years under sections and.this approach would be cumbersome,expensive,and potentially a trap for the unwary.application of section shorter limitations period would also defeat the legislature intent that foreign money judgments be enforceable in the same manner as sister state judgments former in all cases where enforcement of the judgment is the ultimate aim.subjecting actions to recognize foreign judgments to a shorter limitations period than california allows for actions upon domestic judgments or judgments would also undermine the reciprocity goal of the ufmjra.if recognition of a final,conclusive,and enforceable foreign judgment is to be barred by a state statute of limitations,we should apply the same limitations period controlling other judgments.using the limitations periods that are generally applicable to the forum state own judgments best assures reciprocity in the recognition and enforcement of our judgments abroad and gives foreign judgments uniform and fair treatment in california courts.nadd,supra,so d at.
amicus curiae northrop grumman posits reasons why the legislature may have wished to place a limit on an action to recognize a foreign judgment even as it allowed a longer time period,years,for enforcement of the same judgment.the legislature may have been especially concerned about a judgment debtor ability to prove defenses to a foreign judgment,for example,or the legislature may have been concerned about applying different statutes of limitations to foreign money judgments as opposed to other foreign judgments not covered by the ufmjra.these asserted concerns are not expressed in the legislative history of the ufmjra,however,and they are inconsistent with the legislature codification of a statute of limitations in the new ufcmjra.
section,which went into effect january,provides an action to recognize a judgment shall be commenced within the earlier of the time during which the judgment is effective in the foreign country or years from the date that the judgment became effective in the foreign country.thus,a foreign judgment may be recognized for as long as it is effective in its country of origin up to a maximum of years.the new uniform act establishes a limitations period of years pt.ii west laws ann.supp.money judg.recognition act,however,our legislature reduced this period to years to be consistent with the period of enforceability for domestic and sister state judgments.see com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.may,suggesting action to recognize a foreign judgment should have a statute of limitations just like all other state judgments.although legislative history surrounding enactment of the new ufcmjra is not controlling here,the legislature expressed concern for uniformity supports our conclusion that actions on foreign judgments should be subject to the same limitations period that applies to all other judgments.
disposition 
the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings in the trial court.
this case raises two issues under a law,the uniform foreign recognition act code civ,former et,repealed by stats,ch,eff,hereafter the former act.the first issue is whether,within the meaning of a provision of that former act,a foreign country judgment is final while it is on appeal in the foreign jurisdiction.on that issue,the majority holds,as i understand it,that the term final as used in the former act has no fixed meaning,and that the foreign jurisdiction law must be consulted to determine both the meaning of the term final and whether,applying that definition,the foreign judgment is final while on appeal.i disagree.i conclude that as used in the former act the term final means not requiring further action other than enforcement in the rendering court that is,ordinarily,the trial court and that the foreign jurisdiction law should be consulted only to determine whether,applying that definition of finality,the foreign judgment is final while on appeal.
the second issue is the statute of limitations that applied to an action brought under the former act.on that issue,the majority holds that the statute of limitations was years,the same as for an action on a judgment.here also,i disagree.i conclude that an action on a judgment under the act was governed by the limitations period of code of civil procedure section.
although i disagree with the majority conclusions on both of these issues,i agree with its disposition,which effectively remands the matter for further proceedings in the trial court.as i will explain,i agree that,on the present record,defendant bezdikian is not entitled to summary judgment.
plaintiff manco contracting manco sued defendant krikor bezdikian a former partner of manco in qatar,a persian gulf emirate.in november,the qatar trial court entered judgment against bezdikian for some million qatari riyals around million.after filing an appeal,bezdikian relocated to lebanon and then to california.in may,qatar appellate court rendered its decision reducing the amount of the award to million riyals around million,plus expenses and attorney fees.
in may,manco brought this action on the qatari judgment in los angeles superior court.bezdikian moved for summary judgment on the ground that the action was untimely.he argued that the statute of limitations was four years,that the limitations period began running in when the qatar trial court entered judgment,and that it expired in.manco argued,to the contrary,that the applicable statute of limitations was years,the same as for an action on a judgment code civ,because a provision of the former act stated that a judgment was enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state,former.manco also argued,in the alternative,that no statute of limitations applied.finally,manco argued that it was seeking recognition of the appellate court judgment,which had superseded the trial court judgment,and that the action on the appellate court judgment,having been brought less than four years after it was rendered,was timely under any potentially applicable limitations period.the parties each submitted an expert declaration describing various aspects of qatari law.the trial court agreed with bezdikian that the action was time barred,and it granted summary judgment for bezdikian.manco appealed.
the court of appeal reversed,concluding that the statute of limitations did not begin to run if,under qatari law,the trial court judgment was not final while on appeal,and that the expert declarations had raised a triable issue of fact on that point.the court of appeal declined to decide whether the limitations period was four years or years.
in,the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws commissioners promulgated the uniform foreign recognition act uniform act.they explained that because many foreign countries courts applied a rule of reciprocity,codification of state rules on recognizing and enforcing foreign country judgments would increase the chances that those foreign courts would recognize and enforce our state court judgments.in,california adopted the uniform act as code of civil procedure sections to.stats,ch.one of the provisions at issue here,former section of the code of civil procedure see of the uniform act,stated this chapter applies to any foreign judgment that is final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered even though an appeal therefrom is pending or it is subject to appeal.italics added.the first question to be decided is the meaning of the term final in this provision.
under california law,the word final has various meanings as applied to a judgment.see generally witkin,cal.procedure ed.judgment,listing various meanings of final judgment.in one sense,all california state court judgments are final because finality is part of the definition of a judgment.see code civ,a judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.in another sense,no california judgment is ever final because a judgment can always be modified or revised to correct clerical error or set aside for extrinsic fraud or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see olivera grace cal d.as applied to judgments,a common understanding of the term final is not subject to being changed or set aside to correct ordinary error of fact or law,or for abuse of discretion.even under that definition,however,there remains an ambiguity because a judgment may be final as to the trial court once the trial court has lost jurisdiction to grant a new trial,a judgment notwithstanding the verdict,or a statutory motion to vacate but not as to the appellate courts,and a court of appeal decision may be final as to that court but not as to the california supreme court see cal.rules of court,rules b,b c.
the term final in former section of the code of civil procedure might have any of these meanings,or perhaps another meaning altogether,but like all statutory terms it must have some definite meaning.the majority appears to conclude,however,that the term final in former section has no single fixed meaning but instead,it takes on whatever meaning the term has in the law of the foreign country where the judgment to be enforced was rendered.i do not understand how this can be so.
if the foreign jurisdiction laws are similar to california,the term final,as applied to a judgment or decision,will be ambiguous,carrying multiple possible meanings.how is a court in california to determine which of these meanings to apply the problem is even more intractable when,as here,the foreign jurisdiction law is written in a language other than english.the official language of qatar is arabic.before an expert can determine whether the judgment is final within the meaning of former section of the code of civil procedure,the term final must be translated into the foreign language,and this can be done only if the term is first given a single,unambiguous meaning.
here,both parties submitted declarations from experts on the law of qatar.defendant bezdikian expert properly refrained from characterizing the qatari trial court judgment at issue as final or not final.instead,he explained that t
