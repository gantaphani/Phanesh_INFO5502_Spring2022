background 
on december,narayanan boarded a british airways flight from los angeles,california,to bangalore,india,with an intermediate stop in london,england.narayanan,who suffered from an,terminal lung disease,required supplemental oxygen during the flight having been advised of his condition prior to boarding,british airways assured narayanan that he would have access to his supplemental oxygen.however,during the flight from los angeles to london,british airways denied narayanan access to this oxygen.upon arriving in london,narayanan sought medical attention and was cleared to continue onto bangalore.he received further medical treatment in india,as well as in the united states following his return on january.however,his health continued to deteriorate and,on june,narayanan died.
on march,narayanan widow and two adult children filed a claim against british airways under article of the convention,alleging that the denial of supplemental oxygen on his flight to london hastened narayanan death.they sought general,special,and survival damages for this claim.
british airways removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that the complaint was under the limitation period established by article of the convention because the flight at issue arrived on december,and the complaint was not filed until march.the district court agreed and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.this appeal followed.

discussion 
the convention,which governs all international carriage of persons,baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward,provides the exclusive remedy for international passengers seeking damages against airline carriers.convention for the unification of certain rules for international carriage by air,may,treaty doc.hereinafter montreal convention in interpreting this convention,we begin by looking to its text.medellin texas,d.
article of the convention provides that a carrier is liable for damage sustained in case of death or bodily injury of a passenger upon condition only that the accident which caused the death or injury took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.montreal convention.we have defined an accident for purposes of article as an unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger.phifer,at quoting air france saks,d.the parties do not dispute that british airways alleged failure to provide narayanan supplemental oxygen was an accident within the meaning of article.
article sets forth limits on such claims,however,providing that 
any action for damages,however founded,whether under this convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise,can only be brought subject to the conditions and such limits of liability as are set out in this convention 
montreal convention emphasis added.
at issue here is one such limit on liability,set forth in article.this provision states as follows 
the right to damages shall be extinguished if an action is not brought within a period of two years,reckoned from the date of arrival at the destination,or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived,or from the date on which the carriage stopped.
montreal convention emphasis added taken together,articles and require that a claim for damages under the convention must be filed within two years of the date upon which the aircraft arrived,or ought to have arrived,at its destination.id.
applying these provisions here,it is clear that plaintiffs complaint was untimely filed.plaintiffs brought an action pursuant to article,alleging that british airways refusal to give narayanan supplemental oxygen during an international flight hastened his death.their claim arises under the convention and is therefore subject to article.see montreal convention.this,in turn,means that plaintiffs right to damages for their wrongful death claim would be extinguished if their action was not brought within a period of two years,reckoned from the date of arrival at the destination.montreal convention see also dickson am.airlines,d.here,the flight at issue arrived on december,plaintiffs thus had until december,to file a claim.however,they did not file their complaint until march,approximately three months too late.
this analysis seems straightforward enough.however,a factual wrinkle persists even though the accident giving rise to liability under the convention occurred on december,narayanan did not die for another six months.as a result,the limitations period on plaintiffs wrongful death claim began running six months before it even accrued.the question thus becomes whether article applies irrespective of when a claim actually accrues,or whether local law governs the timeliness of any claims which were not in existence when the aircraft arrived at its destination.in answering this question,we write on a virtually blank slate we are aware of only one cursory decision by an illinois district court fifty years ago presenting similar facts.see bapes trans world airlines,summarily holding that the plaintiff wrongful death claim was under the warsaw convention where her complaint was filed within two years of the passenger death,but more than two years from the date the aircraft arrived at its destination.
plaintiffs contend that the convention limitations period should have been triggered on the day of narayanan death,when their wrongful death claim accrued under california law while this argument may have some appeal,the plain text of the convention,as well as its drafting history and relevant caselaw,convince us that we must squarely apply article,under which plaintiffs claim is.
turning again to the text,the plain language of article leaves no room for flexibility as to the commencement of the limitations period.rather,as noted above,the convention designates three specific triggering events the date of arrival at the destination the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived and the date on which the carriage stopped.montreal convention.these are the terms that the convention drafters settled on and that separate signatory nations agreed to in their efforts to accommodate or balance the interests of passengers seeking recovery for personal injuries,and the interests of air carriers seeking to limit potential liability.el al israel airlines,tsui yuan tseng,d discussing the warsaw convention.by urging us to evaluate the timeliness of their claim under the convention based upon the date upon which it accrued under california law,plaintiffs effectively ask us to write an implied fourth trigger into the convention terms.this we can not do.see chan korean air lines,d.
moreover,we are not persuaded by plaintiffs arguments as to why article does not apply to their claim.plaintiffs first pick apart article s initial clause,which states that t he ri
