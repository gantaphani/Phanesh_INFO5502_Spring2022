procedural and factual background 
karapetyan background 
karapetyan is a native of the soviet union and a citizen of armenia.he was admitted as a visitor to the united states on december,and obtained permission to remain until june.he remained in the united states beyond june,without authorization.on february,the department of homeland security dhs formerly ins issued a notice to appear,which charged karapetyan with being present in the united states in violation of a b.
at a master calendar hearing on march,karapetyan conceded the charge of removability.the ij designated armenia as the country of removal.karapetyan sought immigration relief in the form of asylum,withholding of removal,cat relief,and,alternatively,voluntary departure.
on june,the ij held a merits hearing.there,karapetyan testified and submitted documentary evidence in support of his applications for relief.
ii.karapetyan testimony 
the ij determined that karapetyan testified credibly during the merits hearing,stating the ij notes that the petitioner has testified in a credible manner.where the ij finds the applicant testimony to be credible and the bia makes no contrary finding,we accept as undisputed the applicant testimony.baballah,at.thus,we accept the testimony recounted below as true.
karapetyan was born to a family of mixed ethnicity,with a russian mother and an armenian father.when he was a teenager,karapetyan and his family moved to yerevan,armenia to escape the war in chechnya.in armenia,karapetyan family suffered humiliation and discrimination on account of its mixed ethnicity.karapetyan was called a russian pig,a chechnyan bastard,and a chechnyan pig by people in his community and by members of the military.
while completing mandatory military service,karapetyan was routinely assigned to dirty,demeaning tasks by supervisors who knew of his mixed ethnicity.he was also beaten by military members.when the military officers learned that karapetyan submitted written complaints about his treatment,karapetyan was beaten and locked in a cell.
in april,karapetyan joined the century party,a political association led by arkady vardanyan vardanyan that sought governmental change and championed human rights.in october,karapetyan participated,as a member of the century party,in a large protest involving at least attendees.several protesters were arrested,including the century party leader,vardanyan,and his attorney 
the day following the protest,military officers searched karapetyan home and arrested him.he was detained in isolation for three days while in prison,karapetyan was interrogated regarding his involvement with the century party.the military officers called karapetyan a russian pig.they used batons to beat the soles of karapetyan feet until he eventually agreed to sign false papers stating that the century party was an illegal organization and its leader,vardanyan,was a russian spy.
after his release from prison,karapetyan spoke out against his treatment on a radio station on november.he criticized the armenian government and called upon others to demonstrate against the government.
two days later,on november,four law enforcement officers came to karapetyan home and beat him like a dog,leaving bruises on his face and other parts of his body.karapetyan was hospitalized for injuries caused by those beatings the law enforcement officers told karapetyan to leave the country.they told him that,if he refused to leave,he would be put in prison or something else would happen to him.karapetyan believed he was in grave danger if he remained in armenia,and so he obtained a visa from the united states embassy on december.he arrived in the united states on december.
thereafter,karapetyan applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.he applied for voluntary departure in the alternative.
iii.ij and bia decisions 
the ij denied karapetyan request for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief,but granted the limited relief of voluntary departure.as a basis for the decision,the ij found that karapetyan was not statutorily eligible for asylum because he had failed to show that he was a refugee.alternatively,the ij found that karapetyan was ineligible for asylum because he had failed to submit his fingerprints for a security check.karapetyan moved for a continuance so that he could submit the fingerprints,but the ij denied his request.
karapetyan appealed to the bia,which affirmed the results without opinion.the bia subsequently denied karapetyan motion to reconsider.karapetyan timely appealed both decisions.
discussion 
i.the ij erroneously required corroborating evidence despite finding that karapetyan had testified credibly 
we begin by recognizing that the ij erred when she required corroborating evidence despite finding that karapetyan had testified credibly.at the conclusion of karapetyan merits hearing,the ij made an express finding that karapetyan had testified credibly.the ij concluded,the petitioner has testified in a credible manner.
yet,the ij failed to credit karapetyan testimony,in part because he did not provide corroborating documentary evidence of his persecution.pointing to the lack of corroborating documentary evidence,the ij concluded that karapetyan had failed to show that he was statutorily eligible for relief.the ij oral decision is laden with references to the lack of certain documents.see administrative record noting petitioner fail ure to present any documents establishing that petitioner was a member of the century party noting petitioner brought no documents establishing that he was ever a member of the century party.noting petitioner has presented no documents establishing that there ever was a rally noting petitioner did not present his passport noting petitioner has supplied no documents,whatsoever,to establish that he ever served in the military noting petitioner did not present anything from his friends at the radio station that he ever gave any kind of speech or talk on the radio.the ij denied karapetyan relief,in part because he did not produce these corroborating documents 
because the ij made a finding that karapetyan testified credibly,the ij failure to credit karapetyan testimony was improper.we have repeatedly held that,when an applicant has been found to testify credibly,the facts are deemed to be true,and no further corroboration is required see,kataria ins,cir w e must accept testimony as true in the absence of an explicit adverse credibility finding.ladha ins,cir reaffirming that corroboration of credible testimony is not necessary ashcroft,cir.in fact,the ij acknowledged,t he petitioner testimony alone can establish that he is a refugee.
because corroborating evidence is not necessary in the face of a credibility finding,we accept karapetyan testimony as true.
ii.the ij conclusion that karapetyan was ineligible for asylum relief is not supported by substantial evidence 
accepting karapetyan testimony as true,we must next address whether substantial evidence supported the ij finding that karapetyan testimony was insufficient to warrant asylum relief we find that the harm suffered by karapetyan compels a finding of past persecution and,accordingly,we remand the case to the bia to exercise its discretion in deciding whether to grant asylum.
this court reviews for substantial evidence the ij decision that an applicant has failed to establish past persecution or a fear of persecution.ins,d.to obtain reversal under this standard,the petitioner must demonstrate that the evidence presented was such that a reasonable fact finder would be compelled to conclude that the requisite past persecution,or fear of future persecution,existed.id.
to be eligible for a grant of asylum,karapetyan must show that he is a refugee.b.a refugee is one who is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of his or her native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.
either past persecution or a fear of future persecution provides eligibility for a discretionary grant of asylum.ratnam ins,cir.to show past persecution,karapetyan must demonstrate that his treatment rises to the level of persecution the persecution was on account of one or more protected grounds and the persecution was committed by either the government or by forces that the government was unable or unwilling to control.chand ins,cir.to show a fear of persecution,karapetyan must demonstrate that he has a fear of persecution in his country there is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution and he is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of such fear.see b.the demonstration of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption that the applicant has a fear of persecution on the basis of the original claim.see id.b.
here,karapetyan provided uncontroverted evidence of his past included physical and verbal account of his mixed ethnicity and membership in a disfavored political party.he testified that he was detained by the military,beaten by officers,called derogatory names,and assigned to demeaning tasks because his mother was russian.karapetyan further testified that he was detained in isolation,beaten,hospitalized for injuries,and warned to leave the country because of his association with the century party,a political organization that sought political change in armenia and advocated for human rights.
the ij conclusion that karapetyan is not statutorily eligible for asylum is not supported by substantial evidence.as we discuss further below,the ij made a series of factual and legal errors in reaching her conclusion that karapetyan was not statutorily eligible for asylum.
past persecution 
the ij conclusion that karapetyan failed to show past persecution is not supported by substantial evidence.the record indicates that the ij arrived at this conclusion only by misunderstanding the record and misapplying the law.see smolniakova gonzales,cir granting relief and criticizing ij for misconstruing the record.
for example,with regard to karapetyan detention,the ij stated,his testimony did not indicate that he was beaten.this pronouncement overlooks the facts in the record.on direct examination,karapetyan stated,for three days,they would not let me talk to anybody,no phone calls,anything,nothing.they sic investigating person was sic beating me in their cells.
the ij also assumed that karapetyan injuries,which resulted from his detention in early november,were not significant because karapetyan did not seek medical attention but karapetyan never testified as to whether he sought medical treatment on that occasion.the ij conclusion that karapetyan did not seek treatment was nothing more than conjecture and,thus,can not support the ij decision.see,ins,cir explaining that conjecture is not a substitute for substantial evidence.
moreover,an applicant failure to seek medical treatment for the injury suffered is hardly the touchstone of whether the harm amounted to persecution.lopez ashcroft,cir.we have repeatedly found that threats and attacks constitute past persecution even where an applicant has not been beaten or physically harmed.see,surita ins,cir concluding that the petitioner had established persecution when the evidence showed that she had been robbed numerous times in the course of seven to ten days but not physically harmed.
misconstruing the record again,the ij stated that there were no documents establishing that the october demonstration,involving the century party leader,vardanyan,had occurred.the ij specifically stated that karapetyan had produced no reports regarding the rally.however,contrary to the ij assertion,karapetyan submitted the state department report,which the ij admitted into the record.the report states 
in october,arkady vardanyan the leader of the century party,a armenian businessman who is a russian citizen,led a demonstration in yerevan of approximately persons calling for the removal of the government.after the demonstration,security forces searched vardanyan house and took him into custody he was sentenced to days detention on the charge that he had a permit for a demonstration but not a march.in november,vardanyan was charged with attempting a coup in february vardanyan was released,cleared of charges and his case was closed.soon after his release,vardanyan left the country.
the ij also erred by failing to consider the cumulative impact of the various incidents.although the ij described the beatings,threats,and verbal abuse inflicted upon karapetyan,she erroneously dismissed each incident alone as insufficient to establish persecution.addressing each incident separately,the ij stated,a short detention with no injuries does not establish that the petitioner was persecuted on account of his political opinion.later in the decision,the ij stated,offensive names do not rise to the level of persecution.and,again later in the decision,the ij remarked,petitioner claim that he served in the military and was given poor treatment does not rise to the level of persecution.
an applicant may suffer persecution because of the cumulative impact of several incidents even where no single incident would constitute persecution on its own.ins,cir,overruled on other grounds by fisher ins,cir.the court look s at the totality of the circumstances in deciding whether a finding of persecution is compelled.guo ashcroft,cir finding persecution where chinese christian was arrested,detained twice,physically abused,and forced to renounce religion.this court has found that the severity of harm is compounded when incidents of persecution have occurred on more than one occasion,particularly when an applicant is victimized at different times over a period of years.chand,at.taken cumulatively,the brutal beatings,the hospitalization,the threats of harm,the isolated detention,and the verbal insults compel a finding of persecution in this case.
on account of mixed ethnicity and political opinion 
likewise,the facts in the record compel the finding that karapetyan was persecuted on account of his mixed ethnicity and political opinion 
the ij acknowledged that karapetyan was always being ignored and being ordered to carry out the most dirtiest jobs,such as cleaning restrooms and polishing military boots of the officers.nonetheless,the ij determined that it is not clear that karapetyan was assigned insulting tasks during his military service on account of his mixed ethnicity.
the ij erred when she required karapetyan to clearly establish the motives of his persecutors.because it is difficult to conclusively prove motive,karapetyan need only provide some evidence of motive,direct or circumstantial,at,and demonstrate the connection between the government actions and his membership in a protected group,fisher,at.u ncontroverted and credible testimony is sufficient to establish that an asylum applicant was persecuted on account of ethnicity.shoafera ins,cir.under this standard,karapetyan need only provide some evidence that his persecutors were motivated by his mixed ethnicity or,alternatively,his political opinion.
karapetyan was called a russian pig,a chechnyan bastard,and a chechnyan pig while being persecuted.the use of these slurs amply establishes the connection between the acts of persecution and karapetyan ethnicity.see,duarte de guinac ins,cir noting that motivation was on account of ethnicity where persecution was coupled with explicit expressions of ethnic hatred.
additionally,there is an undeniable connection between karapetyan political activities and his persecution.his arrest occurred just one day after he attended the century party protest.karapetyan captors physically abused karapetyan to coerce him to confess that the century party was an illegal organization.the nexus between karapetyan political activism and the persecution is also established by the beatings he endured in his home just a few days after he criticized the government over the radio.
we find that karapetyan has shown credible,nonspeculative insight into the motivation of his persecutors.see shoafera,at.the use of derogatory slurs and the close connection between political events and persecution demonstrate that karapetyan abusers were motivated to persecute him based on his mixed ethnicity and political opinion.
perpetuated by the armenian government 
we further conclude that the ij conclusion that the persecution was not perpetuated by the armenian government is not supported by substantial evidence.
the applicant must demonstrate that the persecutor was the government,a group,or persons or groups that the government is unwilling or unable to control to qualify for asylum.see ins,cir.affirmative state action is not necessary to establish a fear of persecution if the government is unable or unwilling to control the agents of persecution.siong ins,cir.we will presume that the persecution was perpetrated by government agents where there is no evidence to the contrary and where there is no evidence of hostility between the applicant and actors.see njuguna ashcroft,cir.
the ij expressed disbelief that the armenian government would persecute karapetyan and other members of the century,as the basis for her decision,i t simply makes no sense that authorities in armenia would then come after karapetyan after he is a member of an illegal organization.
but the state department report corroborates the human rights violations in armenia during the relevant time.the report specifically discusses the armenian government targeting of vardanyan,the century party leader,who was detained,accused of starting a coup,and coerced to leave armenia 
the ij also expressed doubt that the men who invaded karapetyan home and beat him on november,were government actors.yet,karapetyan testified that he knew that the men were police officers.karapetyan also testified,and the ij accepted as true,that he had endured beatings at the hands of the armenian military earlier that month.and the state department report confirms that the armenian government did not always respect the constitutional prohibition of unauthorized searches.the ij provided no reason for rejecting these facts,and it is pure speculation to assume that the later beating of karapetyan was perpetrated by agents,unlike the earlier beating,where no testimony or evidence supports that finding.
an ij unsupported speculations regarding the likely actions of a foreign government are not substantial evidence.such conjecture is an invalid basis for the decision.see bandari ins,cir.thus,we conclude that the evidence in the record compels the conclusion that karapetyan mistreatment was at the hands of the government.
fear of future persecution 
because karapetyan has established past persecution on account of his mixed ethnicity and political opinion,there is a rebuttable presumption that he has a fear of future persecution.the government bears the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that changed country conditions rebut the presumption of a fear of future persecution.b i.the government has never claimed that country conditions have changed,and nothing in the record suggests that they have.accordingly,the government has failed to meet its burden.see,chand,at r emand is not appropriate where the record clearly shows that the country conditions material in the record will not serve to rebut the presumption.navas ins,cir holding that a remand is unnecessary where past persecution has been established but the ins has failed to introduce the requisite country conditions information and thus has failed to meet its evidentiary burden on that issue.
we therefore conclude that karapetyan is statutorily eligible for asylum and remand solely for the attorney general to exercise his discretion to grant asylum.
iii.the ij conclusion that karapetyan is ineligible for other forms of relief is not supported by substantial evidence 
the ij based her finding that karapetyan was ineligible for withholding of removal and cat relief upon her faulty conclusion that karapetyan had failed to meet the more lenient standard for asylum relief.for the reasons discussed in section ii,the ij erred as to the substance of the asylum claim.thus,we remand for a determination of whether karapetyan is eligible for withholding of removal and cat relief.
iv.the ij improperly denied karapetyan motion for a continuance to comply with the fingerprinting requirements 
as an alternate basis for the denial of relief,the ij found that karapetyan was ineligible for relief because he had not submitted fingerprints.karapetyan moved for a continuance so that he could submit his fingerprints.the ij denied the motion for a continuance.
a.the ij abused her discretion in denying the continuance 
the ij abused her discretion in denying karapetyan request for a continuance so that he could submit fingerprints.
under,an ij may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.in the context of immigration proceedings,the decision to grant or deny continuances is in the sound discretion of the trial judge.see nakamoto,at cir see also baires,at.but the ij discretion is limited.baires,at quoting ungar sarafite,d.we will reverse an ij decision should we conclude that her ruling results from an abuse of discretion.id.
when evaluating an ij denial of a motion for continuance we consider a number of,for example,the importance of the evidence the reasonableness of the immigrant conduct the inconvenience to the court and the number of continuances previously granted in the case.see baires,at united states flynt,cir listing factors appellate court considers when reviewing district court denial of request for continuance,amended,cir.
we recently evaluated these factors in a similar case,cui mukasey,cir,in which we held that the ij abused his discretion in denying the immigrant request for a short continuance to submit fingerprints.although a decision whether a denial of a continuance constitutes an abuse of discretion must be resolved on a case by case basis,baires,at,cui established that it is clearly an abuse of discretion for an ij to deny a request from an otherwise diligent applicant for a short continuance to submit fingerprints,particularly where the applicant was faced with an unclear fingerprint requirement and where the applicant was disserved by an ij inadequate guidance on the requirement.cui,at.
nature of the excluded evidence 
we first consider the evidence that was excluded as a result of the ij denial of karapetyan motion for a continuance.the denial of the continuance meant that karapetyan was unable to submit fingerprints for the required security check.without a security check,karapetyan could not be granted relief under the law.thus,when the ij denied his request for a continuance to submit fingerprints,the ij effectively pretermitted any hope karapetyan had of obtaining relief.the vital importance of the excluded fingerprint evidence counsels in favor of granting a continuance.see cui,at.
petitioner conduct 
another factor we consider is whether the need for a continuance arose because the petitioner behaved unreasonably.we find that karapetyan conduct was not unreasonable,given the circumstances.
first,karapetyan showed that exceptional circumstances prevented him from complying with the f
