in these consolidated appeals,several lawyers challenge a sanction of criminal contempt entered after the lawyers filed a motion and two declarations in open court,and a journalist seeks access to the filings,which have since been sealed following media reports about their contents.the underlying complaint contains sordid allegations of intrigue,corruption,and assassination in colombia,where the awful is ordinary.silva att y,cir.after the district court by letter asked the department of state whether this litigation would adversely affect the conduct of foreign affairs,the plaintiffs twice moved the district court to inform the department about the contents of a recent declaration of a former colombian official.the district court then held the plaintiffs lawyers in criminal contempt and sealed their declarations and their motion to reconsider even though a month earlier the district court had decided that too many filings had been sealed.
there are two issues presented.the first issue is whether a protective order forbidding lawyers from making extrajudicial comments about the expected testimony of a witness clearly prohibited the lawyers from filing in open court declarations of potential witnesses attached to a motion.the second issue is whether the public has a common law right of access to the declarations and the motion to reconsider providing the declarations to the department of state.derek baxter,terrence collingsworth,robert kerrigan,and daniel kovalik,the attorneys for the plaintiffs,appeal the sanction of criminal contempt,and stephen jackson,a journalist who intervened in the litigation,appeals the orders that sealed the motion to reconsider and the declarations and denied jackson motion to lift the seal.we vacate the sanction of contempt,because the filings were not clearly prohibited by the protective order,and we reverse,as unsupported by good cause,the orders that sealed the motion and declarations.
background 
in,a group of named and unnamed plaintiffs,including union leaders and relatives of deceased union members,filed a complaint against the drummond company and several of its executives.the complaint alleged that the president of drummond,the colombian subsidiary of drummond,with the knowledge of executives in the united states,hired colombian paramilitaries to kill and torture union members at a drummond coal mine in colombia.the district court allowed many of the plaintiffs to proceed anonymously based on their alleged concern for their safety in colombia.
drummond filed a motion to dismiss the complaint based on,among other arguments,the political question doctrine and international comity.the district court denied the motion and stated that the political question doctrine and issues of comity were and better addressed on a motion for summary judgment.the plaintiffs lawyers then,through their website,urged the public to contact drummond.they allegedly represented that the denial of the motion to dismiss established the validity of their complaint.
on the motion of drummond,the district court entered a protective order.in addition to requiring counsel to remove from their website allegations about the denial of the motion to dismiss,the protective order prohibited all participants,including potential witnesses from making or authorizing extrajudicial comments to the media and the public concerning the character,credibility,reputation or criminal record of a party or witness,and the expected testimony of a party or witness.the protective order also directed counsel for the parties to avoid commenting in court papers that are not filed under seal on evidence that is irrelevant to legal matters at issue therein.jackson intervened to challenge the protective order based on the first amendment.after a sharp exchange between jackson counsel and the court,the district court allowed jackson to intervene,agreed to withdraw the original protective order,and entered a revised protective order.
the revised protective order applied only to counsel of record and prohibited them from making or authorizing extrajudicial comments,and disseminating or authorizing the dissemination of information to the media and the public concerning the expected testimony of a party or witness or m atters that counsel know,or reasonably should know,will be inadmissable at trial,and would if disclosed create a substantial risk of prejudicing an impartial trial.the order allowed an attorney to state without elaboration or any kind of characterization whatsoever a n allegation or defense made in this case,i nformation properly contained in the public record of this case s cheduling information,or a ny decision made or order issued by the court that is a matter of public record.the revised protective order did not define its terms,require that any filings be made under seal,or limit references to evidence in court filings.
unbeknownst to the plaintiffs and the district court,drummond had been lobbying the department of state to intervene in the litigation,but its efforts were hindered because it could not share sealed documents with the department.without making any findings about the need to file documents under seal,the district court had allowed the parties to file motions under seal and to designate discovered material as confidential.
on december,drummond moved to unseal several documents.on april,the district court expressed its agreement with drummond that too many documents were sealed at the outset,virtually everything filed in this case has been filed under seal.the court now questions the wisdom and propriety of such a blanket order.the district court ordered the parties to identify documents that could be unsealed or redacted without jeopardizing the safety or privacy of any party or witness.the district court also join ed in the plaintiffs expressed concern about defendants unilateral contact with the state department and deem ed it advisable that certain documents in this case be provided directly to the state department for its review and evaluation by the court.the district court instructed the parties not to contact the state department about the lawsuit and proposed that it would prepare a letter to solicit the advisory opinion of the state department on whether the litigation might affect foreign relations.
on april,the district court held a hearing to determine the form of the letter and attachments and reiterated its concern that too many documents were under seal.the district court complained that as i looked back over this case,probably percent of what has been filed has been filed under seal i ca tell what going on by looking at the docket sheet.commenting on the inquiry to the state department,the district court explained that it did not intend to completely preclud e the parties from contacting the government,but the court will act as the gatekeeper.
on may,the district court notified the parties that it had sent a letter to the state department with copies of the pleadings.the district court also formally ordered the parties not to contact either executive officials of the united states or officials of colombia 
no party or counsel or representative of any party or counsel shall make any unilateral,ex parte communication with anyone at the un i t ed states department of state,united states department of justice,or any representative of the government of col o mbia regarding any information relevant to or any matter at issue in this case,or the opinion requested of the department of state.
the district court explained that it intended to arrange a telephone conference call with a representative from the state department within a month.
on may,the plaintiffs filed a motion to submit pertinent information to state justice departments to which they attached declarations of a former public official incarcerated in colombia and daniel kovalik,a lawyer for the plaintiffs.the former colombian official stated that he witnessed the head of the colombian operations of drummond hand a briefcase of cash to a paramilitary leader in exchange for killing two union leaders.kovalik declaration explained that on may,he flew to colombia and interviewed the former official.on may,drummond moved,under seal,to seal the motion and declarations.the district court immediately sealed the declarations,but not the motion itself,and denied the plaintiffs motion.
on may,the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of their motion.the plaintiffs argued that they had submitted the evidence as soon as it was available and that the evidence was relevant to the inquiry.they alleged that the district court had allowed drummond to supplement the inquiry with additional contact addresses and a request for the criminal records of a plaintiffs witness.the plaintiffs objected to the decision of the district court to seal the declarations as contrary to previous orders that the parties confer to unseal previously sealed documents and objected that they were not allowed to respond to the motion of drummond to seal the declarations.the plaintiffs also argued that the sealed motion of drummond to seal their filings was an ex parte communication with the district court because the plaintiffs never received a copy.
on may,drummond moved,again under seal,to seal the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration and notified the district court about a news article published that day in the miami herald.the miami herald reported the allegations of the former colombian official 
a former colombian intelligence officer has claimed that he saw the head of the colombian branch of a coal company hand over a suitcase full of cash to pay for the assassinations of two labor leaders,according to a document filed in a court.
the sworn statement by rafael garcia was made to lawyers for groups who filed a civil suit in alleging the killers were acting as employees or agents of the drummond company.the trial in birmingham is scheduled to begin in october.
the district court sealed the motion for reconsideration and supporting documents,denied the motion for reconsideration,and sua sponte ordered the plaintiffs lawyers to show cause why they should not be held in contempt for violating the revised protective order.the written order of the district court stated,not only did counsel gratuitously publicly file an affidavit of a potential witness,the court has before it circumstantial evidence that indicates counsel may have directly or indirectly provided such expected testimony to a reporter for public dissemination.
jackson moved to unseal the declarations,motion to reconsider,and the motions of drummond to seal.jackson argued that the seal violated the common law right of access to court records.the district court denied the motion.the district court,citing chicago tribune,cir,determined that the public had no common law right to access the documents because they were not filed in connection with pretrial motions that require judicial resolution of the merits.the court reasoned that the equities weighed against opening the declarations to the press because the declarations were incredible,appeared to be an attempt to circumvent the revised protective order,and would likely taint the jury pool and prejudice the right of drummond to a fair trial.the district court also explained that it sealed the motion to reconsider because it outlined much of the other sealed material.the district court did not provide any reasons for its decision not to unseal the motions filed by drummond.jackson appealed the orders sealing the declarations and the motion for reconsideration and the order denying his motion to unseal.
the district court held a contempt hearing without referring the matter to the united states attorney or appointing a prosecutor.the plaintiffs lawyers argued that the revised protective order was unclear and testified that they honestly thought that the state department should know that their complaint was supported by evidence.for fear of exposing attorney work product,the plaintiffs lawyers requested to explain in camera their involvement with the miami herald reporter and how they attained the declaration.the district court granted their request,and,in addition to discussing privileged work product,the plaintiffs lawyers admitted that they spoke with the reporter,testified that they did not tell the miami herald about the declaration,and asserted that,to the best of their knowledge,the reporter learned of the declaration independently.
upon returning to the courtroom,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs lawyers either had been overzealous in their advocacy or had intentionally plotted to evade the revised protective order.the district court held the plaintiffs lawyers in contempt and fined them.the district court released the drummond attorneys from the strictures of the revised protective order so that the attorneys could comment on the allegations in the declaration.
the plaintiffs lawyers appealed and moved to stay the fine during the appeal.the district court granted the request for a stay but wrote at length about its reasons for finding that the plaintiffs lawyers committed contempt.the court noted that f rom the beginning of this case,counsel have demonstrated either a lack of knowledge of,or a tendency to ignore or flaunt the rules of procedure and the rules of professional conduct.the court noted that the bar on extrajudicial comments in the revised protective order incorporated the alabama rules of professional conduct and that the original protective order,with emphasis added,had defined extrajudicial as not forming a valid part of open legal proceedings in this case.
ii.standards of review 
two standards of review apply to this appeal.first,i n reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in support of a finding of criminal contempt,we must determine whether the evidence,construed in the light most favorable to the government,would permit the trier of fact to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states maynard,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted united states turner,cir.second,we review for abuse of discretion the refusal of a district court to unseal court documents.see chicago tribune,at.
iii.discussion 
before we address the merits of the appeals,we briefly address our jurisdiction to review the orders of the district court.first,the plaintiffs lawyers argue that the district court erred by holding them in contempt of court and imposing a fine.because the district court assessed a punitive fine against the plaintiffs lawyers,the contempt order is criminal in nature.united states k s w offshore eng g,cir t he imposition of a penalty against attorneys for a punitive purpose i s a criminal contempt sanction.unlike civil contempt,an order of criminal contempt is a final decision that is immediately appealable.marrese am.acad.of orthopaedic surgeons,d.second,jackson has appealed both the orders of the district court that sealed the documents and the order that denied jackson motion to unseal the documents.these orders are appealable as collateral to the underlying action because they conclusively determine a disputed question,resolve an important issue,and are effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.see cohen beneficial indus.loan.
our discussion of the merits of these appeals is in two parts.we first address the challenge of the plaintiffs lawyers to their conviction for criminal contempt.we then address whether the district court abused its discretion when it sealed and later refused to unseal the declarations,the plaintiffs motion,and the motions of drummond to seal.
a.the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction for criminal contempt.
contempt of court may be punished as a criminal offense.the three elements of criminal contempt are a lawful and reasonably specific order that the defendant has violated willfully.united states bernardine,cir see.a federal court may punish contemptuous conduct that occurs outside its presence only after giving notice of the essential facts constituting the charged criminal contempt,request ing that the contempt be prosecuted by an attorney for the government,and affording other procedural protections.see also united states baldwin,cir discussing difference in procedure required for direct and indirect criminal contempt.the defendant is not only entitled to be informed of the nature of the charge against him,but to know that it is a charge,and not a civil suit.gompers buck stove range.see also lamar fin.adams,cir vacating contempt sanction when defendant not given specific notice that hearing was criminal in nature.i n proceedings for criminal contempt the defendant is presumed to be innocent,he must be proved to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,and can not be compelled to testify against himself.gompers,at.at.
even when these procedures are followed,the contempt power is subject to abuse.as the supreme court has observed,those who make their way to the bench sometimes exhibit vanity,irascibility,narrowness,arrogance,and other weaknesses to which human flesh is heir.sacher united states.a proceeding regarding criminal contempt demands deliberateness and caution.turner,at.most judges,however,recognize and respect courageous,forthright lawyerly conduct.they rarely mistake overzeal or heated words of a lawyer fired with a desire to win,for the contemptuous conduct which defies rulings and deserves punishment.sacher,at.at.
the reason that the district court held the plaintiffs lawyers in contempt is not clear from the record,but drummond defends the sanction on the grounds that the plaintiffs lawyers violated the revised protective order both by making extrajudicial comments to the miami herald and by filing the declarations.the plaintiffs lawyers respond that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that they told anything to the reporter that violated the revised protective order,the revised protective order was not reasonably specific if read to prohibit filing the declarations attached to a motion,and under either theory the evidence was not sufficient to find that they violated the order willfully.
the issue before us is limited to the sufficiency of the evidence.the plaintiffs lawyers do not present an argument about either the summary hearing or the notice of the charges against them.we agree with the plaintiffs lawyers that the evidence does not support their conviction.
the evidence was insufficient for a reasonable finder of fact to have found that the plaintiffs lawyers willfully violated the revised protective order by making unauthorized statements to a reporter.
the plaintiffs lawyers persuasively argue that no reasonable finder of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that they willfully made comments to the miami herald reporter that violated the revised protective order.at the in camera portion of the show cause hearing,the plaintiffs lawyers denied telling the miami herald reporter about the declaration and testified that the reporter probably obtained the declaration from the witness or by observing the public filings in the case.the record contains no evidence to the contrary and,as drummond admits,t here is no admissible evidence in the record as to how the reporter actually learned of the declaration.
even if we were to assume that the plaintiffs lawyers explanations in the in camera hearing were false,there is still no evidence that the plaintiffs lawyers ever made a statement that violated the revised protective order.the information in the miami herald article is the kind that the revised protective order explicitly allowed the attorneys to disclose to the press allegation s made in th e case and i nformation properly contained in the public record.the miami herald article neither quoted the plaintiffs lawyers nor contained information that would not have been available to anyone observing public filings in the case.if the district court based its finding of contempt on the circumstantial evidence of the existence of the article,that evidence was insufficient to prove a willful violation beyond a reasonable doubt.
the revised protective order did not forbid with reasonable specificity the filing of the declarations.
the plaintiffs lawyers argue that the revised protective order did not prohibit the filing of the declarations or,if somehow read to prohibit the filing,was not reasonably specific.again,we agree.an order meets the reasonable specificity requirement only if it is a clear,definite,and unambiguous order requiring or prohibiting the action in question.in re dupont de nemours,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the reasonableness of the specificity of an order must be evaluated in the context in which it is entered and the audience to which it is addressed.turner,at.
the revised protective order prohibited making or authorizing extrajudicial comments,and disseminating information to the media and the public concerning the expected testimony of a party or witness and m atters that counsel know,or reasonably should know,will be inadmissable at trial,and would if disclosed create a substantial risk of prejudicing an impartial trial.unlike the original protective order,the revised protective order did not address what evidence the attorneys could reference in public filings.the revised protective order also did not address what motions should be filed under seal,what supporting documents should be filed under seal,or what documents the district court might submit to the state department.
when the revised protective order is read in context with other parts of the record,it is unclear that the revised protective order prohibited filing the declarations as part of the public record.the revised protective order allowed attorneys to make unembellished statements about allegations and public filings,such as the allegations in the declarations,and the district court both had ordered the parties to unseal or redact most previous filings and warned the parties to stop routinely requesting that documents be filed under seal.the letter to the state department and the order prohibiting the parties from contacting the state department also were filed in the public record.to the extent the revised protective order can be interpreted to curtail public filings at all,its import in the context of the other rulings of the district court is ambiguous.
drummond argues,and the district court stated in its later order granting a stay of the fine pending appeal,that the revised protective order incorporated the definition of extrajudicial comments in the previous protective order.drummond contends that the revised protective order prohibited any filing determined not to be a valid part of open legal proceedings,with drummond emphasis added.drummond argues that these declarations were not valid but offers no guidance about defining the term valid.
the argument of drummond is based on a strained interpretation of the revised protective order,which does not define extrajudicial comments and does not reference the ambiguous definition in the original protective order.based on our review,the revised protective order was intended to replace,not supplement,the original protective order.it is also far from clear that the ambiguous definition in the original order is the most apt definition of extrajudicial.the most widely used legal dictionary,for example,defines extrajudicial as outside the functioning of the court system or any utterance made outside of court.black law dictionary ed.
even if we were to assume that the definition of extrajudicial proffered by drummond is correct,that definition still would not have prohibited with reasonable specificity the plaintiffs from filing the declarations.until the district court held the plaintiffs lawyers in contempt,no order of the district court had identified filing any unsealed motion or evidence as in valid.when the plaintiffs lawyers filed the first motion and attached declarations,neither the district court nor drummond suggested that the filing was contemptuous.that sua sponte suggestion of the district court came only after the plaintiffs lawyers filed their motion for reconsideration.the district court apparently expected the plaintiffs lawyers to apply an ambiguous order by importing a definition from a previous order that itself is ambiguous.no reasonable finder of fact could conclude that the attorneys were clever enough to figure out that the bar of extrajudicial co
