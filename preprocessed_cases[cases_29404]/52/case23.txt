tensions between taxpayers and the internal revenue service irs over forced disclosure of foreign bank account information implicate both statutory and constitutional rights.taxpayers have fifth amendment rights not to be forced to incriminate themselves by the compelled act of production.but where the documents are required to be kept under the regulatory scheme of the bank secrecy act bsa or the act,see currency and foreign transactions reporting act,tit.ii,stat.codified as amended at et,the question arises whether the required records doctrine under the fifth amendment trumps those fifth amendment rights.the supreme court has not directly answered this question.
we now join the unanimous view of the circuit courts that have faced the question,all of which hold that the taxpayer must comply with an irs summons for documents he or she is required to keep under the act,where the irs is investigating civilly the failure to pay taxes and the matter has not been referred for criminal prosecution.and so we affirm the district court enforcement of the summons as to documents required to be kept under the bsa.see united states chen,d.as to enforcement of the summons for documents not subject to the bsa,we vacate and remand to the district court for further explanation.
as part of an investigation into the tax liability of zhong chen and his wife,chu ng,the irs served a summons on chen on september,requiring him to appear for an interview with an irs revenue agent and to produce various financial and banking records.chen appeared for the interview,but he refused to answer any questions invoking the fifth amendment and did not provide the requested documents.on may,the government filed in the massachusetts federal district court a petition to enforce the portion of the summons seeking the production of documents.in support of its petition,the government submitted an affidavit executed by an irs revenue agent stating that i t is necessary to obtain the records sought by the summons in order to determine the federal tax liabilities of chu ng and zhong chen for the taxable period ending december.importantly,it also stated that t here is no justice department referral in effect with respect to chu ng and zhong chen for the year under examination.in response,chen asserted a fifth amendment claim of privilege,not over the documents themselves,but over his compelled act of producing the documents.see fisher united states,describing compelled act of production privilege see also in re grand jury subpoena,cir.
the district court granted,in part,the government petition to enforce the summons on july.see chen,d at.it granted the petition insofar as it relates to those documents implicated by the recordkeeping requirements of the bank secrecy act because it concluded that those documents fall within the scope of the required records doctrine.id.at.on september,after reviewing in camera the documents not covered by the bsa recordkeeping provision,as well as an in camera argumentative submission in support of chen privilege claim,the district court issued a brief order directing chen,without explanation,also to produce the documents not covered by the bsa.this appeal followed 
our holding requires an understanding of the bank secrecy act and its purposes.
the bsa was first enacted in.its preamble states its four purposes as follows to require certain reports or records where they have a high degree of usefulness in criminal,tax,or regulatory investigations or proceedings,or in the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities,including analysis,to protect against international terrorism.enforcement of criminal laws is a direct purpose,but not the sole purpose.
the act requires individuals engaged in foreign banking to maintain certain records 
t he secretary of the treasury shall require a resident or citizen of the united states or a person in,and doing business in,the united states,to keep records,file reports,or keep records and file reports,when the resident,citizen,or person makes a transaction or maintains a relation for any person with a foreign financial agency.
the secretary of the treasury has promulgated regulations specifying reporting and recordkeeping requirements.the reporting requirement provides 
each united states person having a financial interest in,or signature or other authority over,a bank,securities,or other financial account in a foreign country shall report such relationship to the commissioner of internal revenue for each year in which such relationship exists and shall provide such information as shall be specified in a reporting form prescribed under to be filed by such persons.
a.those individuals who are subject to the reporting requirement are also subject to recordkeeping requirements 
records of accounts required by to be reported to the commissioner of internal revenue shall be retained by each person having a financial interest in or signature or other authority over any such account.such records shall contain the name in which each such account is maintained,the number or other designation of such account,the name and address of the foreign bank or other person with whom such account is maintained,the type of such account,and the maximum value of each such account during the reporting period.such records shall be retained for a period of years and shall be kept at all times available for inspection as authorized by law.
id.this recordkeeping regulation is at the heart of this appeal.
congress,when it adopted the bsa,was deeply concerned about the proliferation of criminals using secret foreign bank accounts,and congress emphasized the benefits that the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the bsa would have for criminal investigations.the senate committee on banking and currency noted that t estimony before the committee and other evidence indicates that secret foreign bank accounts have been put to a number of illegal purposes,at.it stated that t he purpose of the bill is to provide law enforcement authorities with greater evidence of financial transactions in order to reduce the incidence of crime.id.at see id.at,at,reprinted in.nonetheless,rooting out criminal activity was not congress only interest,and the justifications for the bsa reporting and recordkeeping requirements extend far beyond the criminal context.merely looking at the text of the statute proves that its purposes are diverse.the text itself points to the utility of the required records in the tax,regulatory,and counterterrorism contexts.see.and to the extent one looks at legislative history,it confirms this view.
the supreme court,in reviewing a series of constitutional challenges to the bsa,stated that while concern for the enforcement of the criminal law was undoubtedly prominent in the minds of the legislators who considered the act,congress seems to have been equally concerned with civil liability which might go undetected by reason of transactions of the type required to be recorded or reported.california bankers ass shultz.indeed,the court emphasized that the fact that a legislative enactment manifests a concern for the enforcement of the criminal law does not cast any generalized pall of constitutional suspicion over it.id.at 
the bsa manifestly has purposes.a properly functioning system of foreign commerce can not operate without reporting and recordkeeping of the kind mandated by the bsa and its implementing regulations.as the house report explains 
the debilitating effects of the use of secret institutions in foreign jurisdictions on americans and the american economy are vast.it has been estimated that hundreds of millions in tax revenues have been lost.unwarranted and unwanted credit is being pumped into our markets.there have been some cases of corporation directors,officers and employees who,through deceit and violation of law,enriched themselves or endangered the financial soundness of their companies to the detriment of their stockholders 
one of the most damaging effects of an american use of secret foreign financial facilities is its undermining of the fairness of our tax laws.secret foreign financial facilities,particularly in switzerland,are available only to the wealthy i t is grossly unfair to leave the secret foreign bank account open as a convenient avenue of tax evasion.

to that end,information collected pursuant to the bsa reporting and recordkeeping requirements is shared with other agencies,including the office of the comptroller of the currency,the consumer financial protection bureau,the federal reserve board,the federal deposit insurance corporation,the national credit union administration,and the office of thrift supervision.united states under seal,cir see requiring the secretary of the treasury to make information in a report filed under this subchapter available to an agency,including any state financial institutions supervisory agency,united states intelligence agency or organization registered with the securities and exchange commission or the commodity futures trading commission,upon request of the head of the agency or organization.
congress was keenly aware that it can not abridge or challenge the right of any country to follow its own banking practices,and that it can not legitimately expect its laws to be given extraterritorial application when they conflict with the laws of another country,at.some diplomatic channels exist to assist the government in obtaining foreign bank records,such as letters rogatory or mutual legal assistance treaties,but in the face of foreign bank secrecy laws,these processes are lengthy,cumbersome,and far from foolproof.see shultz,at noting that efforts to obtain information from foreign banks are subject to time consuming and ofttimes fruitless foreign legal process quoting,at,reprinted in at.
accordingly,congress enacted the bsa so as to ameliorate the difficulties and challenges associated with obtaining records by means of a foreign treaty.in re grand jury subpoena dated,d,aff,cir.it was reasonable for congress,faced with these obstacles,to impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements on united states citizens and residents engaged in foreign banking.t he united states can legitimately require its own citizens or financial institutions to keep records and file reports on transactions with foreign financial institutions and that is the approach taken by the bill,at.the bsa recordkeeping provision and its implementing regulation are central to the legislative scheme in that compliance with them furnishes the government with the information necessary to effective regulation.varitimos united states,cir emphasis added.
there is extensive discussion elsewhere in the case law as to the evolution of the law of fifth amendment privilege and why chen fifth amendment claim fails,which we need not articulate again.we agree with seven of our sister circuits that the claim fails on the grounds that bsa records are subject to the required records doctrine.see united states chabot,cir,cert.denied.in re grand jury subpoena dated,cir united states.under seal,cir in re grand jury proceedings,cir,cert.denied.in re grand jury subpoena,cir in re special grand jury subpoena dated,cir,cert.denied.in re grand jury investigation,cir,cert.denied.
the required records doctrine prevents an individual from resisting,in the name of the fifth amendment,the production of records whose creation and maintenance is required as a condition of voluntarily engaging in a highly regulated activity.see baltimore city dep t of soc.servs.bouknight,see also in re special grand jury subpoena dated,at.in a nutshell,it is commonly accepted that courts should apply the following test for determining whether the required records doctrine applies to a particular recordkeeping scheme.f irst,the purposes of the united states inquiry must be essentially regulatory.grosso united states,citing shapiro united states.s econd,information is to be obtained by requiring the preservation of records of a kind which the regulated party has customarily kept.id.at.t hird,the records themselves must have assumed public aspects which render them at least analogous to public documents.see marchetti united states,
the government presents the analysis as occurring within two distinct analytical steps.first,the initial question is whether the government is authorized to regulate the activity in question,as the doctrine was originally articulated by the supreme court in shapiro.there is no doubt that is true here.see const,cl.granting congress power t o regulate commerce with foreign nations shultz,at.but second,the government recognizes that the court later narrowed the doctrine in three criminal cases,where the government was targeting activity that is criminal or almost always criminal.see haynes united states,grosso,at marchetti,at.chen unsuccessfully tries to fit himself into the limitations set by those cases.the government correctly does not contend that just because it has the power to regulate in an area that it also has the power to compel disclosure of required records.it acknowledges that it is not taking the position that it can simply criminalize an act and require records to be kept,which would indicate performance or of that criminal act,and that the records would then be admissible over a fifth amendment objection.the government also agrees that it could not by statute regulate an activity that is essentially or almost entirely criminal,mandate recordkeeping conditions on the activity,tell the criminal to,and then prosecute him for failing to do so.neither situation is occurring here.
by contrast,chen keeping an offshore bank account is not inherently criminal.the focus of the required records doctrine is on the characteristics of the activities about which information is sought and the composition of the group to which the inquiries are made.grosso,at.offshore banking clearly has inherently civil aspects,and one can comply with the act recordkeeping requirement without being a criminal.in fact,the act covers a great many people who are not engaged in any criminal activity.simply put,the act can not fairly be viewed as a backdoor attempt to get at a selected group engaged in illegal activities,through recordkeeping requirements and disclosure,for criminal prosecution.compare haynes,at,with varitimos,at.
to be sure,congress contemplated that the records required to be kept under the bsa would be useful in criminal prosecutions.any fair reading of the legislative history reveals as much.but w hile congress clearly intended the act disclosure requirements to be of some use in criminal proceedings,we regard the interests as substantial.united states dichne,cir upholding,over a fifth amendment challenge,a requirement under the bsa that individuals report the transportation of over in monetary instruments into or out of the united states,id.at see previously codified at now applicable to transportation of over in monetary instruments.
chen maintains,however,that despite the act civil applications,compliance with its recordkeeping provision has criminal implications.that may be so for some people covered by the act,but criminal implications are not enough to render the required records doctrine inapplicable.as chief justice burger,writing for the plurality in california byers,explained 
an organized society imposes many burdens on its constituents.it commands the filing of tax returns for income it requires producers and distributors of consumer goods to file informational reports on the manufacturing process and the content of products,on the wages,hours,and working conditions of employees comparable examples are legion.
in each of these situations there is some possibility of prosecution often a very real one for criminal offenses disclosed by or deriving from the information that the law compels a person to supply but under our holdings the mere possibility of incrimination is insufficient to defeat the strong policies in favor of a disclosure called for by statutes like the one challenged here.
id.at plurality opinion footnote omitted.
this is not unusual.in fact,courts have relied on the required records doctrine to uphold recordkeeping schemes imposed in a variety of contexts where disclosure carries a very real chance of crimin
