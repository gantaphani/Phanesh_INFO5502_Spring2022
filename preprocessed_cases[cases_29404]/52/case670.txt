petitions from the dismissal by the board of immigration appeals board of his appeal from an immigration judge ij denial of his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.we deny the petition.
a native and citizen of el salvador,entered the united states without inspection on july.prior to coming to the united states,he lived with his mother in cologne san jose la chalatenango,el salvador.this town,like many in el salvador,was plagued by gang violence instigated by the mara salvatrucha,or mara.family had a number of problems with the mara,beginning in.in july of that year,brother,jose ubidio santos,was aboard a bus when armed mara held him up at gunpoint,beat him,and took a small amount of money.after the incident,the mara searched for jose ubidio at his school and threatened him.the mara continued searching for jose ubidio for revenge because they were unable to take his shoes and clothing when they robbed him.as a result of the mara threats,jose ubidio left el salvador later that year.
when the mara realized jose ubidio was gone,they threatened the rest of family.on june,the mara shot and killed oldest brother,jose cecilio santos.the police did not investigate the murder,but testified at the hearing before the ij that jose cecilio had insulted the mara by asking them why they had a problem with his family.also testified he knew that the mara were the ones who had killed jose cecilio because the gang had sent many anonymous notes threatening the family.after jose cecilio murder,the mara began to harass youngest brother,luis alonzo santos.in august of,the mara beat luis,robbed him,and demanded that he have more money for them that afternoon or he would be killed.the mara came to home looking for luis in january of,luis left el salvador.
once his brothers left el salvador,began to receive threats from the mara.he testified that in march of,he was beaten by a group of two hundred mara,two of whom insulted him and told him that the same thing was going to happen as had happened to his other brother.his elbow was wounded with a knife,and a gang member kicked him in the back.on may,received an anonymous threat stating that he would be killed like his brother.he fled the country.
testified that during this time,no one in his family filed a complaint with police because they feared that the mara would retaliate,and because the family believed that the police were involved with the mara and would do nothing to help the family.he also testified that every time he or his brothers encountered the mara,they were looking for money and that they would bother anyone to get money or jewelry.
testified that luis currently lives with him in california and that jose ubidio is in the united states also.he has two sisters and another brother who live in el salvador in a town two hours away from his home town.none have had problems with the mara.mother remains in chalatenango.testified that three months prior to the hearing there were men who cut wires around his mother house and broke pieces off her roof,but there was no evidence that these men were mara.
testified that he feared he would be killed by the mara if he returned to el salvador.he stated that he had never insulted or spoken out against the gang,and had never belonged to any type of organization in el salvador.he stated he did not believe he could safely move to another city in el salvador because gang members are everywhere.
the day entered the united states,the department of homeland security issued him a notice to appear that charged him with removability as an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled.at an initial hearing on october,admitted the factual allegations in the notice to appear and conceded his removability he also indicated that he would apply for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.he did so,and after he presented testimony and evidence in support of his applications,the ij found credible but issued an oral decision denying asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection,and ordering removed to el salvador.
timely appealed to the board,arguing that he established he was persecuted on account of his membership in two particular social groups,his family and the class of young men in el salvador who resist the violence and intimidation of gang rule.he also claimed persecution on account of his political opinion.finally,he argued that he established it was more likely than not he would be tortured upon returning to el salvador.the board affirmed the ij denial of asylum,withholding of removal,cat claims and issued its own opinion dismissing the appeal.
the board concluded that had not established a fear of future persecution on account of membership in a particular social group.as for claim that he was persecuted on account of his family membership,the board reasoned that even if family were to be considered a particular social group,can not establish a well founded fear based upon his membership in that group because his mother has remained unharmed in el salvador since his departure.with regard to claim that he was persecuted because he was a member of a social group as a young man in el salvador resisting gang violence unstoppable by the police,the board found this social group not cognizable because it has no social visibility and is not therefore a particular social group for asylum purposes.
the board also rejected claim that his resistance to gangs or his opinions constituted political opinion,reasoning that expression of a fear of harm resulting from general conditions of violence and civil unrest does not substantiate a fear of persecution on account of political opinion.the board concluded that because had not established persecution or a fear of persecution on account of a qualifying ground,he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal.
finally,the board agreed with the ij that did not establish that he will more likely than not be tortured in el salvador,observing that his mother,who is similarly situated to him,has remained unharmed in el salvador.timely petitioned this court for review of the board decision.
we review the board legal conclusions de novo.see azanor ashcroft,cir.we give skidmore deference to the board interpretation of the governing statutes and regulations,recognizing that,while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority,these interpretations do constitute a body of experience.gonzales,cir alteration in original quoting skidmore swift.factual findings made by the board are reviewed under the deferential substantial evidence standard and will be upheld unless the evidence compels a contrary result.ochoa gonzales,cir see also b b.where,as here,the board conducts a de novo review of an ij decision,rather than adopting the ij decision as its own,we review the board decision.ochoa,at.
the government argues that we should review the decisions of both the board and the ij,and urges affirmance of the board decision based on each of the grounds given in the ij decision.however,contrary to the government suggestion,the board did not incorporate the ij decision as its own.for the most part,the board did not even refer to the ij decision or state that it agreed with the ij.the only place the board incorporated the ij decision was in its cat analysis,where the board stated that we agree with the immigration judge that the respondent did not establish that he will more likely than not be tortured in el salvador and cited the ij opinion.accordingly,except to the extent the board incorporated as its own the ij decision on cat claim,our review is confined to the decision of the board.see gonzalez ins,cir acewicz ins,cir.the sole issues for review before us with respect to asylum and withholding of removal claims are whether showed a fear of persecution based on his family membership,whether his status as a young man in el salvador resisting gang violence makes him part of a particular social group,and whether his resistance to gangs is a political opinion.
eligibility for asylum requires showing a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.the persecutor must be a government official or individuals the government is unable or unwilling to control.ins,cir.withholding of removal requires a clear probability of the same.b ins,cir.although the ij gave a number of reasons for concluding that failed to establish eligibility for asylum,the board decided the case on much narrower grounds,which we now address.
asserts eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal based on his membership in his family,all of whom,he testified,were targeted by the mara.the board assumed for the purpose of argument in this case that family was a particular social group,but rejected his claim because can not establish a fear based upon membership in that group because his mother has remained unharmed in el salvador since his departure.her continued safety undermines claim.for the purpose of our decision,we make the same assumption.but see gonzales thomas,d per curiam.challenges this decision,arguing that his mother has in fact continued to receive threats from the mara,and alternatively that,even if his mother were safe,her safety does not affect his fear because she and are not similarly situated.
substantial evidence supports the board factual finding that mother has remained safely in el salvador.at his hearing,was asked,and does your mother have any problems with the mara he responded,no.went on to explain that some men had been around his mother home during the night,and had cut some wires surrounding the home and broken pieces off of the roof,but there was no evidence that these men were affiliated with the mara.vague account of the damage to his mother house does not compel reversal of the board finding that mother has remained unharmed in el salvador since his departure.
moreover,mother continuing safety in el salvador is substantial evidence supporting the board finding that does not have a fear of future persecution.we have considered the continuing safety of family members to be an important factor in determining whether a petitioner has a fear of future persecution.see,hakeem ins,cir affirming the board decision denying petitioner application for withholding of removal and reasoning that his alleged fear of persecution on account of his religion was undermined by the fact that no one in his family had ever been charged,arrested,or harmed based on their religion.
where the claimed group membership is the family,a family member continuing safety is an even more persuasive factor in considering a petitioner fear.in aruta ins,we affirmed the board denial of asylum for a petitioner who claimed a fear of future persecution based on her father activity,cir.our conclusion was based in part on the fact that the petitioner sister,who was identically situated in terms of the danger petitioner describe d in her application and from which she sought asylum,remained safely in petitioner city.id.at.we held there,as we have in other cases,that when similarly situated members of the petitioner family live without incident in the alleged danger zone,such family evidence and the inferences drawn from it does substantially support the agency decision denying asylum.id.at internal quotation marks omitted citing ins,cir see also estrada ins,cir the absence of harassment of an alien family tends to reduce the probability of persecution.
here,too,where claim of persecution is based on his membership in the particular social group of his family,the fact that a family member has remained unharmed since he left el salvador is substantial evidence supporting the board finding that lacks a fear of future persecution based on family membership.
recognizes that ongoing family safety might mitigate a fear of future persecution,but argues that in his case,unlike in aruta,he is not similarly situated to his mother because she is a female and the maras gang targeted young males in el salvador,not older females.however,while that argument might be relevant to his claim that he was persecuted based on his membership in the social group of young males in el salvador who resist gang violence,it is not relevant with respect to his argument that he was persecuted based on membership in his family.has repeatedly asserted that the mara felt his entire family was responsible and began to harass them and that his entire family was targeted by the maras.indeed,his speculation that the mara were behind the damage to his mother house belies his assertion that she is not similarly situated to him.he has provided no coherent argument explaining why his mother was not similarly situated to him with respect to his proposed social group of his family,and so her continued safety is substantial evidence supporting the board finding.
nor does reliance on lim ins,cir,save his claim.in that case,the petitioner was a former police officer who had worked against a terrorist group from whom he personally received death threats and members of which had murdered his colleagues.see id.at.the petitioner in lim did not assert that he was subject to persecution based on his family membership,and no evidence suggested he was similarly situated to his family with respect to the risks he faced as a result of his former job.therefore,our conclusion that,although relevant,the fact that petitioner family is safe does not refute his claims of persecution,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,simply has no bearing on claim.substantial evidence therefore supports the board finding that mother continued safety in his hometown undermines his fear of persecution on the basis of his family membership,and we deny his petition based on this claim.
also asserts eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal based on his membership in the group of young men in el salvador resisting gang violence.we have defined social group for purposes of asylum,as any group united by a voluntary association which imparts some common characteristic that is fundamental to the members identities,or an innate characteristic which is so fundamental to the identities or consciences of its members they either can not or should not be required to change it.arteaga mukasey,cir.in determining whether a social group exists,we consider certain factors,including whether a group shared characteristic gives members social visibility and whether the group can be defined with sufficient particularity to delimit its membership.id.at citing in re.
argues that the board erred when it held that his proposed group of young men in el salvador resisting gang violence is not a particular social group for purposes of asylum because it has no social visibility.contends that he established that as a member of a class of young men in el salvador who share the immutable characteristic of resistence to violence and intimidation of gang rule in an atmosphere of police indifference or inadequacy,he is a member of a particular social group,deserving of protection from future persecution.
we have not considered whether young men in el salvador resisting gang violence is a particular social group under applicable asylum and withholding of removal standards.however,the board recently issued an opinion holding that a proposed group consisting of young salvadorans who have been subject to recruitment efforts by criminal gangs,but who have refused to join for personal,religious,or moral reasons,does not qualify as a particular social group.matter of.there,the board explained that membership in a purported social group requires that the group have particular and boundaries,and that it possess a recognized level of social visibility.id.at.the group of young salvadorans who have been subject to recruitment efforts by criminal gangs,but who have refused to join,satisfied neither the particularity nor the social visibility standard.while the board decision in matter of is not binding on us,we have already adopted the board particularity and social visibility requirements in determining whether a purported association or characteristic creates a particular social group.see arteaga,at.the board analysis in matter of is therefore
