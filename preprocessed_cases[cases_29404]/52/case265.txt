background 
this is a contract dispute in diversity between a thai company and a delaware corporation.finance one public company finance one,a publicly traded thai corporation with its principal place of business in bangkok,was once the largest financial company in thailand.lehman brothers special financing,lbsf,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in new york,is part of the lehman brothers family of companies,and is used as lehman brothers global vehicle for derivatives transactions.in,lbsf and finance one entered into a derivatives trading relationship.
the international swaps and derivatives association isda,the principal industry association of the derivatives industry,publishes a standard form contract known as the master agreement,which is the industry standard in general use worldwide for formalizing derivatives trading arrangements the master agreement consists of pages of terms uniform across contracts,and calls for parties to attach a schedule containing other terms individually tailored to their particular relationship.the master agreement contains a clause directing parties to specify governing law in the schedule.it contains a clause requiring parties to submit to the jurisdiction of either english or new york courts if the schedule selects english or new york law,respectively,to govern the agreement.lbsf and finance one executed a contract consisting of the master agreement and an attached schedule on june.in the schedule,the parties chose new york law as the governing law.individual transactions were to be documented in confirmations whose form was specified in the schedule.
in and,lbsf and finance one entered into four derivatives transactions.the parties entered into and currency swap transactions on july,january,and october.on february,another lehman company entered into a currency option transaction with finance one that it subsequently assigned,with the consent of finance one,to lbsf effective april.each of the swap transactions,and assignment of the currency option transaction,was negotiated by finance one representatives in bangkok and lbsf representatives in tokyo or hong kong,and was listed in lbsf records as originating in the tokyo or hong kong offices of lbsf.the confirmations were mailed from lbsf new york headquarters.
in september and october,finance one issued seven bills of exchange,with a total face value of thai baht,to lehman brothers thailand,lbt,a thai company with its principal place of business in bangkok,and another member of the lehman family.these bills were thai negotiable debt instruments with a one year term to maturity.in march lbt purchased from a third party an additional five bills of exchange issued by finance one,with a total face value of thai baht and a maturity date of january.
in thailand,like much of southeast asia,entered the throes of a financial crisis.the thai ministry of finance intervened in an attempt to mitigate the damage to the country financial sector,ultimately issuing an order on june,suspending business operations of finance one for thirty days.on june or,before the ministry of finance order was issued,representatives of lbt and lbsf had negotiated the transfer of the bills of exchange to lbsf.in return for transferring the bills to lbsf,lbt received a credit on accounts in the amount of the value at which the bills had been carried on lbt books.the bills were endorsed over to lbsf by their custodian,bangkok bank,on june,pursuant to authorization from lbt.
on july,representatives from lbsf hong kong and tokyo offices visited finance one bangkok office to propose that finance one allow lbsf to set off the face value of the bills of exchange against lbsf derivatives obligations,offering finance one a million bonus to seal the deal.finance one rejected the offer,stating that payment of the bills was prohibited by the ministry of finance june order.that same day,a lehman representative wrote to finance one terminating the four derivatives transactions in accordance with the terms of the confirmations relating to such transactions.also that same day,an lbsf representative presented the bills for payment at finance one bangkok office,was refused,and filed a customary notice of dishonor and protest with the royal thai police department.the ministry of finance issued another order dated july,extending finance one suspension indefinitely.
by letter dated july,lbsf notified finance one that it had calculated the aggregate amount lbsf owed to finance one under the derivative transactions as,and was setting off against this amount the value of the bills,which was,leaving a balance of in finance one favor,which lbsf paid.on december,finance one ceased operations entirely and was placed under the supervision of the newly created financial sector restructuring authority to wind up its affairs,liquidate its assets,and pay off its creditors.
on september,finance one commenced this lawsuit,in which it seeks in damages for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing based on lbsf failure to pay the entirety of its derivatives obligation.after discovery was completed,both parties declared their intention to move for summary judgment at a status conference in september.because the parties disagreed about the applicable law,lbsf asserting that new york law applied and finance one that thai law applied,the district court ordered a preliminary round of briefing on the issues.by memorandum opinion and order filed december,the district court found that to the extent that lbsf argued that its setoff right was created by the master agreement,this issue would be governed by new york law in accord with the master agreement clause,but in the event that lbsf had to rely on other sources of law,the court was not prepared to decide which jurisdiction law governed the question whether an setoff right existed by operation of law.finance one pub.lehman.special,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.finding the parties briefing inadequate to resolve how new york courts would answer this question,the court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the outstanding issues.by opinion and order filed august,the court held that the master agreement did not itself either confer a setoff right or prohibit setoff,and that thai law governed the existence or nonexistence of an setoff right.finding it impossible to decide which party experts on thai law to credit,the court ordered that the parties submit lists of proposed special masters to identify and apply thai law.see finance one pub.lehman.special,d.the parties submitted their lists and objections,and the court appointed sompong sucharitkul,a professor at the golden gate university school of law,as special master.
the special master submitted a report on january.the parties differ in their characterization of the report,finance one characterizing it as finding no right to setoff under thai law,but nevertheless going on to create one based on the master view of the equities,and lbsf characterizing it as finding an absolute right to setoff under thai law,but nevertheless going on to limit it based on the master view of the equities.in fact,the master clearly recognized the existence of a statutory right to setoff under section of the thai civil and commercial code.however,noting that it was unclear whether lbsf satisfied the statute requirement that it be a bona fide purchaser for value,the master recommended that the court apply the law of thailand as if the court were to sit in judgment as a national court on site,exercising all the judicial discretion pertaining to thai justices in simile casu.he explained that lbsf could be deemed to have a right to which is not unqualified a thai court could exercise its judicial discretion in an equitable manner it would be for the trial judge to assess the residual value or the market value of the bills of exchange in question for purposes of.the master then proposed a means of valuation in order to ensure that lbsf was treated with the same priority as any other finance one creditor,lbsf would receive a proportion of the bills face value equal to finance one ratio of assets to liabilities,or.the master stated that by this solution,justice would be better served than either of the two extremes 
in response to the court request for clarification,the master submitted a supplemental report on april.the master reiterated that a statutory right to setoff existed,but explained that the bare right to setoff was not conclusive of the value that lbsf was entitled to set off,and stated that his proposed solution was authorized by thai law in order to further thailand policy of protecting creditors.
by memorandum opinion and order filed may,the district court accepted the special master recommendation,calculated the precise amount of the setoff,yielding a figure of,and held that finance one was entitled to the balance of the outstanding derivatives obligation as damages.finance one pub.lehman.special,civ,wl,dist.lexis may.on may,the court ordered briefing on the applicable rates of pre and interest.by memorandum opinion and order filed july,the court found the appropriate rates to be for pre and for interest.finance one pub.lehman.special,civ,wl,dist.lexis july.judgment was entered to that effect on july.
on july,finance one moved for clarification and correction of the judgment under.a,and lbsf moved to reconsider,alter,or amend,under.e and b.the court denied lbsf motion on the grounds that it was untimely,and that it sought to relitigate issues already considered and rejected and to raise new issues.the court granted finance one motion,entering judgment with amended rates of interest.finance one pub.lehman.special,civ,wl,dist.lexis.
both parties timely appealed,finance one claiming that no right to setoff existed and it was entitled to payment in full,and lbsf claiming that it was entitled to its original setoff of the full face value of the bills,and so had no further obligations to finance one.lbsf additionally challenged the district court calculation of the rates of pre and interest.we affirm the district court determination that thai law governs lbsf claimed setoff right,but,finding lbsf entitled to setoff under thai law,we reverse the judgment entered for finance one and order that judgment be entered for lbsf.we therefore need not reach the issue.
discussion 
choice of law 
we review the district court choice of law de novo.curley amr,cir.as jurisdiction is grounded in diversity,we apply the forum state rules.id.at.lbsf argues that new york law should be applied to the question of its setoff rights,on three grounds.first,lbsf argues that before applying law,a court is required to find as a threshold matter that the differences between the two jurisdictions rules would be outcome determinative.second,lbsf argues that the setoff issue falls within the scope of the provisions in the master agreement and accompanying schedule,which select new york law.third,lbsf argues that under new york interest analysis,new york courts would apply new york law to the setoff question.
material conflict 
lbsf argues that because finance one has alleged that the outcome under either thai law or new york law would be the setoff would be barred and finance one would receive the whole of lbsf outstanding derivatives obligation as one therefore fails to allege a material conflict between the two jurisdictions rules and is thus precluded from seeking the application of law.
lbsf is correct that we would not have occasion to embark on a analysis in the absence of an actual conflict between the applicable rules of two relevant jurisdictions.see in re allstate ins.however,lbsf argument hinges on its assumption,unsupported by any authority,that actual conflict exists only where the choice of which rule to apply has been demonstrated to be outcome determinative.this assumption is incorrect.rather,the requirement is that the applicable law from each jurisdiction provides different substantive rules curley,at.the differences must be relevant to the issue at hand,tronlone lac du quebec,ltee,app.div.dep t,and must have a significant possible effect on the outcome of the trial,simon philip morris,d,emphasis added.but a party seeking application of law is not required,as lbsf implies,to demonstrate that its case would be lost were the court to apply forum law.such a requirement would be absurd,and so it is no surprise that lbsf cites no authority that supports it.rather,lbsf relies solely on cases holding that where the court has determined that the result would be the same under either jurisdiction law,it need not decide which to apply.see,commercial union ins.flagship marine,cir.this is a very different,and quite unremarkable,proposition.naturally a court need not decide issues whose resolution it has determined can have no possible effect on the ultimate disposition of the case.this does not imply,however,that before embarking on a analysis a court must apply the relevant substantive rules of each jurisdiction to the facts of the case and determine what the various results would be and whether they would differ.
finance one identifies a number of provisions of thai substantive law that are potentially decisive and that have no new york law equivalent the legal effect to be given to the thai finance ministry orders thai case law holding conduct allegedly similar to lbsf to be in bad faith as a matter of law various alleged requirements before the bills could be validly transferred under thai law significant differences between the new york and thai statutes governing setoff,with the thai statute imposing a number of requirements not found in the new york statute and a thai public policy of treating similarly situated creditors equally.these are certainly relevant substantive differences that could have a significant impact on the outcome of the case.this is all that finance one is required to demonstrate in order to invoke a analysis.
b.the master agreement and clauses 
paragraph of the master agreement provides 
governing law and jurisdiction 
a governing law.this agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law specified in the schedule.
b jurisdiction.with respect to any suit,action or proceedings relating to this agreement proceedings,each party irrevocably 
i submits to the jurisdiction of the english courts,if this agreement is expressed to be governed by english law,or to the jurisdiction of the courts of the state of new york and the united states district court located in the borough of manhattan in new york city,if this agreement is expressed to be governed by the laws of the state of new york 
the attached schedule provides 
h governing law.this agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york without reference to choice of law doctrine.
lbsf argues that the clause,in light of the clause,is sufficiently broad to require that new york law be applied to lbsf setoff claim.the effect of the clause depends on both its validity and its scope.
the validity of a contractual clause is a threshold question that must be decided not under the law specified in the clause,but under the relevant forum rules governing the effectiveness of such clauses.see,valley juice evian waters of france,cir in diversity case transferred from massachusetts federal district court,applying massachusetts law to determine validity of contractual clause specifying that new york law governed contract.in this case,neither party disputes the validity of the clause instead,they differ over its scope.
determining which jurisdiction law governs the scope of a valid clause is not a simple matter.on the one hand,once a court finds that a contractual clause is valid,the law selected in the clause dictates how the contract provisions should be interpreted,and so arguably that law should also dictate how the is itself one of the contract be interpreted.see odin shipping drive ocean v mv,table,wl,at.lexis,at cir.may,unpublished the scope of a provision is a matter of contract construction and interpretation,however,which would in turn be governed by the law selected in the provision.more commonly,however,courts consider the scope of a contractual clause to be a threshold question like the clause validity.courts therefore determine a clause scope under the same law that governs the clause law of the forum.see,krock lipsay,cir applying new york law to interpret scope of clause that selected massachusetts law maltz union carbide chems.plastics,in diversity case transferred from texas federal district court,applying texas law to determine scope of clause that specified new york law hodom stearns,app.div.dep t applying new york law to interpret scope of clause specifying that suits under contract be brought in oregon courts.different states may approach the question of what law governs the scope of a clause in different state a,the law selected in the clause might govern that clause scope,while in state b,forum law,which governs the clause validity,might also govern the scope.finally,parties they rarely in the clause itself what law should govern questions about the clause scope.
the district court in this case,sitting in diversity,was bound to apply new york law to determine the scope of the contractual clause.new york courts decide the scope of such clauses under new york law,not under the law selected by the clause,which here also happens to be new york law.see acquisition stavitsky,misc d.county applying new york law to determine scope of clause that selected new jersey law.lbsf argues that under new york law as explained in turtur rothschild registry international,cir,the clause in the schedule,in light of the clause in the master agreement,is broad enough to encompass setoff rights arising from sources,like the bills of exchange,outside of the contract.
lbsf appeal to turtur is unavailing,for a simple reason the court in turtur did not apply new york law to determine the scope of the contractual clause at issue in that case,it applied texas law.the underlying dispute in turtur began in texas state court and was removed to the united states district court for the southern district of texas.id.at.five years later,after all defendants except a new law firm had been dismissed,the case was transferred to the southern district of new york.id.the transfer was ordered not because venue was improper in the texas federal district court,but rather for the convenience of the parties and witnesses pursuant to a.appellants br.at,turtur,available at wl.following such a transfer,the transferee court must follow the rules that prevailed in the transferor court.ferens john deere,d.the transferor court in turtur was a texas federal district court,and the second circuit,in reviewing the new york federal district court decision,was bound texas rules to determine the validity and scope of the contractual clause at issue.
although the discussion of this issue in turtur was limited,the court focused primarily on distinguishing a texas state case,at,and concluded that w e agree with the texas district court,which originally ruled on this issue,as to the scope of the clause in dispute.id.at.by stating that both new york and texas recognize the right of contracting parties to agree to choice of law and citing one texas and one new york case,turtur obscured which state law dictated the validity and scope of the clause at issue.and because the clause at issue selected new york law,it is understandable that subsequent to distinguish between the law governing a clause scope and the law selected by the read turtur as applying new york law governing the scope of clauses.see,krock,at bibeault advanced health,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at may.nevertheless,turtur is better read as having applied texas law to determine the validity and scope of the contractual clause at issue.as authority for new york law,therefore,turtur is irrelevant to this case,except to the extent that its reasoning is persuasive and consistent with governing new york law.
we turn,therefore,to the leading new york case on the scope of clauses,knieriemen bache halsey stuart shields,app.div.dep t,overruled on other grounds,rescildo macy,app.div.dep t.knieriemen involved a contract between a new orleans brokerage firm and a customer that contained a clause that recited that t his contract shall be governed by the laws of the state of new york.at brackets in original.the broker lost a substantial amount of the customer money,and the customer sued for fraud,breach of contract,negligence,and churning.the court held that the contractual clause did not reach tort claims that the parties agreed that their contract should be governed by an expressed procedure does not bind them as to causes of action sounding in tort id.at.
knieriemen indicates a reluctance on the part of new york courts to construe contractual clauses broadly to encompass causes of action.more recent decisions reflect a similar tendency.in twinlab paulson,app.div d dep t,a suit by a company against outside consultants for and tort claims based on florida civil rico statute,the court considered the scope of and clauses that provided as follows the choice of law provision stated,inter alia,that the validity,interpretation,construction and performance of the agreement would be governed by and construed in accordance with new york law.it also designated new york as the forum for any actions relating directly or indirectly to the consultant agreement.id.the court held that the florida civil rico claim,which was based on the defendant alleged criminal activities,which were unrelated to his duties as a consultant,fell outside the scope of the contractual and provisions.id.
under new york law,then,tort claims are outside the scope of contractual provisions that specify what law governs construction of the terms of the contract,even when the contract also includes a broader clause.see krock,at under new york law,a provision indicating that the contract will be governed by a certain body of law does not dispositively determine that law which will govern a claim of fraud arising incident to the contract.twinlab,at citing krock.presumably a contractual clause could be drafted broadly enough to reach such tort claims.see krock,at stating that a sufficiently broad clause would reach claims of tort arising incident to the contract.however,no reported new york cases present such a broad clause.
case law applying new york law thus provides little guidance on the question raised in this case whether the clause in the master agreement and schedule,in light of the clause,is sufficiently broad to reach a setoff claim arising from an source.based on new york courts reluctance to read clauses broadly,however,together with the fact that the parties could have,but did not,include within their agreement a provision creating setoff rights,we hold that as a matter of new york law,setoff rights fall outside the scope of the clause in the master agreement and schedule.
the schedule provides that this agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york without reference to choice of law doctrine.emphasis added.this language is essentially the same as the clause construed in knieriemen which provided that t his contract shall be governed by the laws of the state of new york,at,a clause found not broad enough to reach tort claims incident to the contractual relationship.the clause in the master agreement is admittedly broader than the clause it provides that with respect to any suit,action or proceedings relating to this agreement emphasis added,the parties submit to the jurisdiction of the federal district courts in new york given that the clause selected new york law.but no one disputes that the clause has been given its full claims relating to the master agreement and schedule,including lbsf claim of an setoff right,were heard in the contractually selected forum.the and clauses use different language there is no reason to think that they have the same scope.
most importantly,lbsf claimed setoff right does not arise from the contract,so there is no reason that a clause specifying that new york law governs t his agreement should also reach lbsf setoff claim.setoff claims by definition aris e out of different transactions they are distinguished from recoupment which involves claims arising from the same transaction.in re midland ins.the relationship between lbsf setoff claim,which arises from the bills of exchange,and lbsf obligation under the derivatives contracts governed by the master agreement,is purely incidental.it so happens that lbsf is asserting finance one debt under the bills of exchange to set off lbsf debt under the derivatives contracts,but lbsf could just as easily have sought to recover under the bills in a completely separate proceeding.in short,lbsf setoff claim is effectively a permissive counterclaim,and there is no reason to expect the same law to govern both a plaintiff claim and a defendant permissive counterclaim.see cipa allied golf,c,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.june,because setoff does not destroy the plaintiff right of action,a claim for setoff is not an affirmative defense.instead,a claim for setoff embodies a counterdemand based on some transaction entirely extrinsic to the plaintiff cause of action and as such it constitutes a defense only in the practical sense that it operates to reduce the than the debt.as a result,a claim for setoff is properly characterized as a permissive counterclaim brackets in original,internal citations omitted.
of course,if lbsf setoff right were created by the master agreement and schedule,new york law would govern that right because the clause would reach it.the district court held,however,that the master agreement and schedule create no setoff rights,and lbsf does not challenge this conclusion on appeal.see finance one,d at.moreover,such a challenge would be unsuccessful because,as the district court explained,the reference to setoff rights in paragraph e of the master agreement is simply a placeholder for any setoff rights that are negotiated in separate schedules or that exist by operation of law.id.at citing authoritative commentary on the isda master agreement.the parties did not negotiate any setoff rights in the schedule that they executed.had finance one and lbsf wished to ensure that new york law would govern the existence and scope of any setoff rights that either party might assert,they could have easily negotiated a clause creating setoff rights in the schedule.they did not do so.we do not believe that new york courts could stretch the master agreement clause,which requires the parties agreement to be governed by and construed in accordance with new york law,to encompass setoff rights that arise from outside the agreement,given that the parties declined to include within the agreement any provision creating such rights.
application of new york principles 
new york applies separate approaches to contract and to tort claims.in contract cases,new york courts apply t he center of gravity or grouping of contacts choice of law theory allstate ins,at.by contrast,the preferred analytical tool in tort cases is to apply interest analysis,where the policies underlying the competing laws are considered.id.at.lbsf putative setoff right,however,is not clearly either a tort claim or a contract claim.recognizing this,the district court concluded that it sounds more in public law than in private law,it was more like a tort claim than a contract that therefore new york courts would resolve this choice of law issue through interest analysis.finance one,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.we agree with this conclusion,which neither party disputes.
interest analysis,adopted by new york in the landmark case of babcock jackson,is the bedrock principle that underlies new york entire regime babcock remains the backdrop of new york conflicts jurisprudence when specific rules fail to accommodate modern case realities.simon,d at.thus,when no specific other approach is called it is in contract analysis is generally appropriate.further,disputes over rights in property are subject to interest analysis.here,the dispute over lbsf claimed setoff right is arguably a type of property dispute insofar as the parties disagree whether lbsf has a property right that it can assert in this lawsuit to diminish finance one recovery.see in re istim,applying interest analysis to determine which jurisdiction law to apply to dispute over rights in a settlement fund.we therefore agree with the district court that under new york law,we must apply interest analysis to determine whether thai or new york law governs lbsf claimed setoff right.
interest analysis is a flexible approach intended to give controlling effect to the law of the jurisdiction which,because of its relationship or contact with the occurrence or the parties,has the greatest concern with the specific issue raised in the litigation.cooney osgood,internal quotation marks omitted.the contacts of the parties and occurrences with each jurisdiction are thus factors to be considered in applying interest analysis,together with the policies underlying each jurisdiction rules,the strength of the governmental interests embodied in these policies,and the extent to which these interests are implicated by the contacts see karaha bodas perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,cir allstate ins,at.
here the contacts between thailand and the underlying occurrences are strong,while contacts with new york are virtually nonexistent.the derivatives transactions involved lbsf,a company organized under delaware law that does business in new york,but virtually all of the negotiations and other activities related to the transactions took place in thailand,hong kong,or tokyo.the bills of exchange were initially negotiated between two thai companies finance one and lbt,and the only apparent new york contact is that the bills were subsequently assigned to a company that does business in new york lbsf.the only connection of the parties to new york is that lbsf has its principal place of business in new york.finance one has no apparent contact with new york other than its relationship with lbsf.
the policies that lbsf contends provide new york with a strong interest in the issues presented by this litigation are 
new york strong public policy interest in protecting the justified expectations of its citizens by applying new york law to disputes arising out of international finance transactions they enter into with foreign countries,in insuring the stability and predictability of international financial markets,and in maintaining new york role as the world leading financial center.
appellant br.at internal quotation marks omitted.lbsf also points to new york public policy in favor of rights and in protecting new york creditors.id.at.
the first of these purported justified begs the question.we have already decided that the parties did not agree in the master agreement to have new york law govern the existence of a setoff right,and so we must turn somewhere else to determine what the parties were justified in expecting at the inception of their relationship.new york courts have inferred the parties justified expectations from the contacts of the parties and their dispute with new york.see,zeevi sons,grindlays bank uganda,holding that new york law governed where payment was to be rendered in new york and new york was locus of repudiation.lbsf argument seems to suggest that new york citizens involved in international finance may always justifiably expect new york courts to apply new york law to their disputes with foreign citizens,regardless of the lack of any specific government interest in,or significant new york contact with,the dispute.new york courts have not gone this far.
the next two new york interests relied on by lbsf are entirely generic,and seem to suggest that new york has a strong governmental interest in having its law apply to any legal dispute that affects the global economy.the cases relied on by lbsf,zeevi and wells fargo,while containing sweeping language referring to new york as the financial capital of the world,wells fargo,at zeevi,at,concerned claims where the contracts had significant connections to new york,and relied on the need to respect the parties justified expectations that new york law would apply based on those contacts.here there are no such significant contacts of the underlying transactions with new york that would lead us to conclude that the parties justifiably expected that new york law would apply.
lbsf does articulate one governmental interest of new york that is particularized to the instant york policy of protecting its creditors by assuring them setoff rights.while the strength of this interest is perhaps diminished,as argued by finance one,by the fact that lbsf only became a creditor by having the rights of finance one original creditor,lbt,assigned to it,this remains an interest of new york that we must consider.
finance one articulates two strong governmental interests of thailand in finance one dispute with lbsf thailand interest in enforcing the orders of its ministry of finance and thereby ensuring the stability and of its economy and its interest in ensuring equitable treatment and adequate protection for all creditors of finance one.appellee br.at.lbsf is incorrect in arguing that these interests are illegitimate.first,even if,as lbsf contends,the ministry orders do not bar lbsf setoff rights,thailand has a strong interest in having the effect of its government orders determined in accordance with thai law.second,lbsf contends that thailand interest in ensuring equal treatment of finance one creditors is not implicated because finance one bankruptcy proceedings did not commence until six months after lbsf claimed its setoff.however,the ministry of finance orders suspending and then terminating finance one business operations in june and july of were clearly aimed at protecting finance one creditors,among other things,and therefore this interest,which the special master identified as springing not from the bankruptcy proceeding but from the notion of public order or good morals of the thai people,is implicated to the extent that lbsf setoff sought an advantage not held by other creditors who were not also debtors to finance one.
unlike most of the interests articulated by lbsf,the interests articulated by finance one are particularized to,and appear to be actually implicated by,the dispute at hand.the special master identified them as strong policies of thailand.given the minimal contacts of the parties or transactions to new york and the limited identified interests of new york in application of its law,these interests are sufficient to tip the balance of interests in favor of applying thai law.
ii.finance one reliance on the master agreement 
finance one contends that the master agreement expressly prohibits lbsf setoff because lbsf set its obligation under the agreement off against the face value of thai baht instruments that were in fact valueless,with the result that finance one did not receive the amount due in dollars as required by the agreement.we disagree.
we review contract interpretation de novo.united states fid.guar.braspetro oil servs,cir.finance one relies on the following language in the master agreement 
contractual currency 
a payment in the contractual currency.each payment under this agreement will be made in the relevant currency specified in this agreement for that payment the contractual currency.to the extent permitted by applicable law,any obligation to make payments under this agreement in the contractual currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the contractual currency,except to the extent such tender results in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed,acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into the contractual currency,of the full amount in the contractual currency of all amounts payable in respect of this agreement.
in the schedule the parties adopted dollars as the generally applicable contractual currency in the event of termination payments.since the language of paragraph a of the master agreement clearly allows lbsf to pay finance one in the thai baht equivalent of the dollar amount owing,finance one argues that lbsf payment in the form of discharging finance one obligation to pay it under the bills was prohibited because the bills were valueless and it therefore did not actually receive payment in the full amount of currency owing.this is a creative argument,but this contractual provision appears concerned only with ensuring that currency amounts are converted to their equivalent and does not speak to the form of payment.lbsf paid in the form of discharging a legal obligation of finance one to pay a debt in thai baht equivalent to the dollar amount owed,and the contractual language does not prohibit this.finance one argues,somewhat disingenuously,that because the bills were valueless in the secondary market it received nothing from lbsf.finance one received the discharge of its obligation to pay and,despite the fact that the ministry of finance orders would have otherwise prevented it from paying the full face value for the time being,absent the discharge lbsf would be entitled to claim in the bankruptcy proceedings and receive,apparently,exactly what the special master recommended and the district court of the bills face value.
lbsf argues,and the district court correctly held,see finance one,d at,that language in the schedule even more clearly authorizes lbsf to render its payment in the thai baht equivalent of the dollar amount owing,notwithstanding that finance one did not actually receive the correct dollar amount after good faith conversion.paragraph g of the schedule states that 
termination currency means usd,except that upon the occurrence of an event of default,it means the currency which is a freely available contract currency in respect of at least one current transaction and selected by the or the party 
thai baht was a contract currency of a number of the derivatives transactions.events of default are defined in paragraph a of the master agreement,and include bankruptcy,which is defined to include the situation where t he party becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts or fails or admits in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as they become due while the relevant language requires as a prerequisite to the party right to select an alternate contract currency only that an event of default have occurred,finance one argues that because lbsf chose to announce its termination of the derivatives transactions on the ground of material adverse change,which is defined as a termination event and not an event of default under the agreement,it may not take advantage of this provision.lbsf announcement is irrelevant,however,because the agreement requires only that the event of default have occurred.therefore,an exception to the general provision specifying dollars as the contractual currency applies,and lbsf was expressly authorized to pay in thai baht.
iii.application of thai law 
we review the district court interpretation and application of foreign law de novo.seetransport wiking trader schiffahrtsgesellschaft mbh navimpex centrala navala,cir.the principal relevant thai statute is section of the thai civil and commercial code,which states in relevant part 
if two persons are bound to each other by obligations whose subject is of the same kind and both of which are due,either debtor may be discharged from his obligation by setoff to the extent to which the amounts of the obligations correspond,unless the nature of one of the obligations does not admit of it.
section of the code provides that s is made by a declaration of intention by one party to the other,which may not be subject to any condition or time of commencement or ending and which relates back in its effect to the time when both obligations could first have been set off.the setoff right is limited by section of the code which states that a claim against which there is a defence may not be set off.both parties agree that section of the code imposes a requirement that the party claiming setoff,in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his obligations,act in good faith.under section of the code there is a rebuttable presumption of good faith.
finance one challenges the validity of the setoff on five grounds.first,finance one argues that the ministry of finance orders suspending its business created a defense to its payment obligation under the bills of exchange,so that setoff w
