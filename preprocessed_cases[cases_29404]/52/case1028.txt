on january,intervenor deere deere filed a complaint with the itc alleging violations of section by the importation into the united states,and sale in the united states,of certain used agricultural vehicles that infringed united states registered trademark,and the deere trademarks.in particular,deere alleged that deere forage harvesters that had been manufactured solely for sale in europe the european version forage harvesters were being imported into the united states.deere argued that the european version forage harvesters were materially different from the forage harvesters manufactured and authorized for sale in the united states the north american version forage harvesters.thus,deere claimed that the european version forage harvesters constituted gray market goods such that they infringed deere trademarks.the itc commenced an investigation on february.on january,the alj issued his initial determination in which he found that appellants importation of used deere european version forage harvesters violated section.the alj recommended that the itc issue a general exclusion order covering the infringing deere forage harvesters and cease and desist orders against bourdeau,ok,and other respondents.appellants filed a petition for review on january,and on march,the itc issued a notice indicating that it had decided not to review the initial determination.on may,after analyzing the proposed remedy and the effect of any remedial orders on the public interest,the itc followed the alj recommendation and issued both the general exclusion order and the cease and desist orders.appellants timely filed a notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

section a c forbids t he importation into the united states,the sale for importation,or the sale within the united states after importation by the owner,importer,or consignee,of articles that infringe a valid and enforceable united states trademark registered under the trademark act of.thus,section grants the itc the power to prevent the importation of goods that,if sold in the united states,would violate one of the provisions of the federal trademark statute,the lanham act.
many of the goods that are forbidden from importation under section are what are referred to as gray market goods products that were produced by the owner of the united states trademark or with its consent,but not authorized for sale in the united states.gamut trading int l trade comm n.the rationale behind preventing importation of these goods is that the public associates a trademark with goods having certain characteristics.id.at.to the extent that foreign goods bearing a trademark have different characteristics than those trademarked goods authorized for sale in the united states,the public is likely to become confused or deceived as to which characteristics are properly associated with the trademark,thereby possibly eroding the goodwill of the trademark holder in the united states.id.at 
thus,gray market theory recognizes both the territorial boundaries of trademarks and a trademark owner right to control the qualities or characteristics associated with a trademark in a certain territorial region.as such,the basic question in gray market cases is not whether the mark was validly affixed to the goods,but whether there are differences between the foreign and domestic product and if so whether the differences are material.id.we have applied a low threshold of materiality,requiring no more than showing that consumers would be likely to consider the differences between the foreign and domestic products to be significant when purchasing the product.id.
however,even though the threshold of materiality is low,a plaintiff in a gray market trademark infringement case must establish that all or substantially all of its sales are accompanied by the asserted material difference in order to show that its goods are materially different.skf,at emphasis added.as we noted in skf,the sale by a trademark owner of the very same goods that he claims are gray market goods is inconsistent with a claim that consumers will be confused by those alleged gray market goods.id.to permit recovery by a trademark owner when less than substantially all of its goods bear the material difference would allow the owner itself to contribute to the confusion by consumers that it accuses gray market importers of creating.id.that is,a trademark owner has the right to determine the set of characteristics that are associated with his trademark in the united states however,a trademark owner can not authorize the sale of trademarked goods with a set of characteristics and at the same time claim that the set of characteristics should not be associated with the trademark.
this case involves the importation and sale of used forage harvesters manufactured by deere.deere sells and series forage harvesters in both the united states and europe through a network of authorized dealers and distributors.the series is manufactured exclusively in the united states,regardless of the market for which it is destined,while the series is manufactured exclusively in germany.both the and series forage harvesters fit generally into two categories the north american version forage harvesters,which are manufactured for sale in the united states and north america,and the european version forage harvesters,which are manufactured for sale in europe.although the north american and european version forage harvesters are sold under the same series numbers,they have certain differences,including labeling differences and differences in certain safety features,discussed at greater length below.
appellants are involved in the importation into the united states and the resale of used european version forage harvesters of both the and series.the itc determined that the european versions of these forage harvesters are materially different from their north american counterparts and that the importation and sale of these forage harvesters violates section.
as a threshold matter,appellants argue that,because the series forage harvesters are manufactured in the united states,they are not gray market goods and thus that importation and sale of these forage harvesters can not violate section.appellants point to the supreme court decision k mart cartier,d,in which the court,while addressing whether certain customs regulations were consistent with,discussed the meaning of the term gray market goods.the court noted that a gray market good is a good,bearing a valid united states trademark,that is imported without the consent of the united states trademark holder.k mart,at.although the court did not purport to exclusively define the term gray market goods in k mart,it articulated three of the scenarios in which a gray market may exist 
t he prototypical gray market victim case is a domestic firm that purchases from an independent foreign firm the rights to register and use the latter trademark as a united states trademark and to sell its products here the second context case is a situation in which a domestic firm registers the united states trademark for goods that are manufactured abroad by an affiliated manufacturer and i n the third context case,the domestic holder of a united states trademark authorizes an independent foreign manufacturer to use it.usually the holder sells to the foreign manufacturer an exclusive right to use the trademark in a particular foreign location,but conditions the right on the foreign manufacturer promise not to import its trademarked goods into the united states.
id.at.emphasis in original.appellants argue that the court did not include in these three scenarios a case in which a domestic firm manufactures a product in the united states for sale abroad and that good is to the united states for later sale without the trademark owner permission.thus,appellants argue that a good manufactured domestically for export can not be a gray market good and hence can not violate section.
however,k mart did not address violations of either section or of the lanham act.rather,the case discussed gray market theory as the background to an analysis of whether certain customs regulations were consistent with section of the tariff act of,which attempted to regulate,for the first time,the importation of gray market goods.see k mart,at.both the regulation at issue,and specifically refer to f articles or merchandise of foreign manufacture.id.at.quoting and.thus,it is not surprising that the court description of gray market theory focused on goods of foreign manufacture.further,the court noted that t he regulations implementing have not applied the prohibition to all goods.id.at.thus,k mart should not be read to limit gray market theory,as it is applied in the context of section,to goods of foreign manufacture.
in addition,the itc has already determined that trademarked goods manufactured in the united states exclusively for sale in foreign countries may violate section if they are imported into the united states without the trademark owner permission and if they are materially different from the trademarked goods authorized for sale in the united states.see certain cigarettes packaging,thereof,inv,usitc pub,commission opinion at,int l trade comm n,cigarettes finding that cigarettes manufactured in the united states but intended for sale exclusively abroad violated section.although the itc expressly declined to refer to the goods in cigarettes as gray market goods,using instead the terms or,the itc analyzed whether the goods violated section using the material difference standard we applied in gamut 
indeed,section a c makes no reference to the term gray market.in addition,unlike the statute at issue in k mart,it does not distinguish between goods of domestic manufacture and goods of foreign manufacture.rather,the statute simply declares unlawful t he importation into the united states,the sale for importation,or the sale within the united states after importation by the owner,importer,or consignee,of articles that infringe a valid and enforceable united states trademark registered under the trademark act of.a c.
finally,although this court noted in gamut that t he term gray market goods refers to genuine goods that in this case are of foreign manufacture,we did not expressly limit the term gray market goods nor yet the reach of section goods.at emphasis added.rather,we noted that t he principle of gray market law is that the importation of a product that was produced by the owner of the united states trademark or with its consent,but not authorized for sale in the united states,may,in appropriate cases infringe the united states trademark.id.at.thus,gray market law is not concerned with where the good was manufactured,nor is it concerned with whether the trademark owner controlled the manufacture of the product or authorized the use of the trademark on that product in another country.instead,gray market law is concerned with whether the trademark owner has authorized use of the trademark on that particular product in the united states and thus whether the trademark owner has control over the specific characteristics associated with the trademark in the united states.
as such,we agree with the itc,and we hold that the importation and sale of a trademarked good of domestic manufacture,produced solely for sale abroad and not authorized by the owner of the trademark for sale in the united states,may violate section if the imported good is materially different from all or substantially all of those goods bearing the same trademark that are authorized for sale in the united states.
in order to find a violation of section,the imported goods must be materially different from all or substantially all of those trademarked goods authorized for sale in the united states.the materiality threshold is low,requiring no more than showing that consumers would be likely to consider the differences between the foreign and domestic products to be significant when purchasing the product,for such differences would suffice to erode the goodwill of the domestic source.gamut,at.indeed,there need only be one material difference between a domestic and a foreign product in order to determine that the latter is a gray market good eligible for exclusion.see,id.at,affirming itc finding of material difference based solely on the absence of warning and instructional labels on foreign goods.however,the plaintiff must establish that all or substantially all of its sales are accompanied by the asserted material difference in order to show that its goods are materially different.skf,at.
in this case,the alj found that there were numerous differences between the european and north american versions of both the and series forage harvesters that a customer in the united states would be likely to consider significant when purchasing the product.initial determination,slip op.at.while,for the most part,the appellants do not contest the existence of differences between the north american and european version forage harvesters,they argue that substantial evidence does not support the alj findings that these differences are material 
however,substantial evidence supports the alj determination that there are several differences between the north american and european version forage harvesters of both the and series that a customer would be likely to consider significant when purchasing the product.both the and series harvesters contain differences in safety features that a customer would be likely to consider significant when purchasing the product.first of all,there are material differences between the lighting configuration and lighting functions of the north american and european forage harvesters,including the type of lights used during transport,the manner in which hazard lights and turn signals function,and whether safety warning lamps exist.there are also material differences between the warning labels and safety decals on the north american forage harvesters,which carry pictures and english writing,and european forage harvesters,which carry only pictures.see in re certain agric.tractors under power takeoff horsepower investigation,wl int l trade comm tractors finding that the absence of warning and instructional labels on foreign goods constituted a material difference,aff,gamut.
there are several other material differences between the north american and european versions of both the and series forage harvesters.there is a material difference in the hitch mechanism of the north american and european forage harvesters,as the mechanism in the european forage harvesters is not compatible with wagons used in north america.in addition,the operator manuals of the european version forage harvesters are in the language of the target country,while the american forage harvesters manuals are in english.although appellants claim that north american manuals are often provided to purchasers of european version forage harvesters,this only serves to heighten confusion,as the north american and european manuals contain different information due to other differences in the products.
finally,there are differen
