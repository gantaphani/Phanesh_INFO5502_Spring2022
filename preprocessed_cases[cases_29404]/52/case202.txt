background 
on january,azucena mendez,a mexican citizen,was smuggled across the border from mexico into arizona by a coyote who had been hired by her husband,julio gabriel perez.mendez had unsuccessfully attempted to enter the united states on two separate occasions earlier that same week.after being driven to las vegas on her third attempt,she flew to macarthur airport on long island,where she expected to meet her husband who was planning to come from his home in asbury park,new jersey.she arrived at the airport in dirty clothes,muddy shoes,and with no luggage.mendez does not speak english.when mendez arrived at the airport,she could not find perez.while waiting for him,defendant rodriguez approached her and told her,in spanish,that she should go inside because it was cold.inside,rodriguez told mendez that it was unsafe for her to wait outside for perez because the police parked in front of the terminal were from immigration.rodriguez told her that if the police noticed her,she would be arrested.
mendez tried to explain to rodriguez that she was waiting for her husband to pick her up.rodriguez reiterated his warning about immigration officers.mendez was frightened,as she had been caught twice before by immigration officials and returned to mexico.rodriguez then asked mendez if she had the phone number for the person who was supposed to meet her,and told her to give him the number so that he could call the person for her.mendez wanted to call perez herself,but rodriguez insisted that he would do it.mendez gave rodriguez the number,and he purported to make a call from his cell phone.he claimed that nobody answered.rodriguez then offered to give mendez a ride,reiterating again that if she waited in the airport for too long,she would be arrested.mendez believed rodriguez warning,and she agreed to go with him.
rodriguez escorted mendez to a van,being driven as a gypsy cab by defendant reynoso.rodriguez told her to get in,which she did.rodriguez then said that he was going back to the terminal to see if the person mendez was waiting for had arrived.after sitting in the van for about fifteen minutes,mendez saw perez in front of the terminal.mendez told reynoso that she saw her husband and that she wanted to get out of the van to meet him.reynoso told her no,no,no,because immigration is following us.mendez was frightened by reynoso warning,so she remained in the van but asked reynoso to call rodriguez so that rodriguez could tell perez where she was.reynoso agreed,but when he supposedly dialed rodriguez number,there was no answer.even though mendez could see her husband,she did not try to leave the van because she was afraid that she would get caught by immigration officials.reynoso told mendez that he would take her home,and she agreed.as she explained,this was the first time i was in the reynoso scared me,telling me that immigration was following us.so i had no other alternative but to say yes.reynoso and mendez left the airport without rodriguez.
reynoso and mendez drove for a while and at some point stopped at a convenience store where rodriguez joined them.mendez did not try to leave the van.she explained that she was too afraid to get out,had no money,did not speak english,and did not know where she was.
previously,rodriguez had called the number that mendez had given him and spoke with alejandra luna,whose family lived with perez in asbury park.rodriguez offered to take mendez home,but luna said that perez was on his way to pick her up at the airport.rodriguez insisted that he would bring mendez home,but luna repeatedly told him no.luna then called perez and reached him while he was being driven to macarthur airport.she gave perez the number that had shown up on her caller id when rodriguez called her.the cell phone number where luna reached perez belonged to edgar mancilla,whom perez had hired to drive him to macarthur airport and then back to new jersey.while driving to the airport,perez tried to call the number luna had given him,and after four attempts,rodriguez finally answered the phone.perez told rodriguez who he was and asked about mendez.rodriguez claimed he was a customs service employee,and told perez that he had seen mendez and had directed her to a car because she could not wait around the airport for a long time.
perez called rodriguez again,explaining that he was desperate and nervous,but rodriguez claimed that he did not know the person who mendez left with.when perez arrived at the airport,he looked for his wife but could not find her and left the airport after looking for about twenty minutes.ten minutes from the airport,he called rodriguez again.this time,rodriguez told perez that mendez had left with a mexican man who was driving her to new brunswick,new jersey.
rodriguez then called perez back,and arranged to meet him on the long island expressway.perez and mancilla waited on the shoulder of the expressway for rodriguez.rodriguez arrived,shook hands with perez,and said,i want to take care of this.ga rodriguez told perez that he would try to get in contact with the person who was driving mendez.rodriguez then advised perez that he should come to an arrangement with the person driving mendez to pay for her trip,and another man accompanying rodriguez told perez he was sure the driver will take her to where you live.rodriguez told perez to call him after to get the number for the man who was driving his wife.
after rodriguez left,perez repeatedly called rodriguez,and when he finally got through,rodriguez told perez that he was with mendez.rodriguez briefly spoke to perez and then gave the phone to mendez.mendez started crying when she heard her husband voice,and,in her testimony,said that she was terrified.perez told mendez that he would come get her,and rodriguez then took the phone and told perez to meet him at a gas station in the monmouth service area on the garden state parkway in new jersey.
rodriguez,reynoso,and mendez arrived at the service area before perez and mancilla.reynoso parked in an empty employee parking lot about yards away from the gas station.perez and mancilla arrived at the gas station shortly after,and when they did not see appellants,they called them on a cell phone.rodriguez directed mancilla to drive towards the parking lot,and when he and perez got close to the van,rodriguez directed them to turn off the car lights.mancilla parked his car in front of the van.perez approached the van,in which he could see his wife and the two defendants.
when mendez saw her husband,she got up to leave the van,but rodriguez,in an angry and annoyed voice,shook his finger at her and told her no,no,no,wait.you can not get out until the driver speaks with your husband.mendez complied because she was frightened and did not leave the van.
perez attempted to open the rear door to the van,but rodriguez locked the door.perez then demanded that rodriguez let mendez out,but rodriguez refused and told perez that he had to come to an arrangement with the driver.reynoso then got out of the van and told perez,y ou have to pay me.perez told reynoso that he was not going to pay anything.from inside the van,rodriguez responded that if perez did not pay,he would call the police.perez again told appellants that he would not pay and that he would call the police himself.rodriguez responded,okay,call.we see who will be the loser.
perez went back to the car and told mancilla what happened.mancilla immediately called and explained the situation.the operator received the call at ten minutes later,three officers arrived on the scene from the new jersey state police.as soon as they arrived,they spoke briefly with perez and mancilla and then approached the van.one officer opened the passenger door where rodriguez was sitting,saw mendez in the back seat,opened the rear door,and let her out of the van.the police arrested both reynoso and rodriguez.
the interval from the time rodriguez told perez that mendez would be released only if he paid until the police secured her release was no more than fifteen minutes,as the government acknowledges,and during most of that interval,the defendants,mendez,and perez were waiting for the police to arrive.
indictment and trial.a superceding indictment charged rodriguez and reynoso with conspiracy to commit hostage taking,see count one,the substantive offense of hostage taking,see id.count two,kidnapping,see id.a count three,conspiracy to transport an illegal alien for commercial advantage,see a a v i count four,and the substantive offense of transporting an illegal alien,see id.a a ii count five.
prior to trial,the government obtained the district court permission,pursuant to.b,to admit,solely against rodriguez,evidence that in,while driving a cab,he had helped to kidnap marvin portillo,a illegal alien at jfk airport.portillo had arrived on a flight from arizona after illegally entering the united states.rodriguez drove portillo to the home of portillo brother and demanded a sum of money far in excess of what the cab fare should have been.for that offense,rodriguez pled guilty to attempted petit larceny and was sentenced to probation.following the district court ruling,reynoso unsuccessfully moved for severance,arguing that he would be prejudiced by rodriguez prior criminal history.at trial,the district court gave a limiting instruction that rodriguez offense was admissible only against rodriguez and was admitted only on the issue of intent.
after a jury trial,the defendants were acquitted of conspiracy to violate the hostage act count one and of kidnapping count three,convicted of the substantive hostage act offense count two,and convicted of the transportation of an illegal alien offenses counts four and five.
sentencing.the presentence report psr started the guidelines calculation for both defendants with a base offense level of,see kidnapping,abduction,unlawful restraint,added levels for a ransom demand,see id.b,added levels for a vulnerable victim,see id.b,and levels for obstruction of justice,see id.the adjusted offense level of in criminal history category i yielded a sentencing range of months to life.the district court accepted the psr guidelines calculation,but elected to impose a sentence and sentenced each defendant to months imprisonment on count two hostage taking and concurrent sentences of months imprisonment on courts four and five conspiracy to transport and transporting an illegal alien for financial gain.the sentences also included five years of supervised release and a special assessment.
discussion 
the appellants raise nine issues on appeal improper venue in the eastern district of new york for the hostage taking conviction,admission of rodriguez prior act evidence,denial of reynoso motion to sever,denial of rodriguez motion for mistrial based on a juror apprehension,denial of rodriguez motion for a mistrial based on evidence of reynoso incarceration,insufficiency of the evidence for the hostage taking conviction,impermissible vouching by the government,error in the charge on the elements of the counts,and procedural and substantive sentencing errors.it will be convenient to consider first the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence for the hostage taking conviction.
sufficiency of the evidence to violate the hostage act 
before considering,under the applicable standard,see jackson virginia,d,whether the evidence permitted the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants violated the hostage act,we face the threshold issue of the applicability of the hostage act to the defendants conduct.the defendants contend that the act may not be applied to what they characterize as essentially a taxi fare dispute.in considering this issue,we note that the defendants make no claim that the evidence was insufficient to support their substantive and conspiracy convictions for unlawful transportation of an alien.
initially,it might be questioned whether the hostage act may be validly applied to any conduct that is not related to international terrorism.the conference report on the act makes clear that it implements the international convention against the taking of hostages.see conf,at.the preamble to the convention states that the convention binds its signatories to adopt effective measures for the prevention,prosecution and punishment of all acts of taking of hostages as manifestations of international terrorism.convention,preamble,emphasis added.president reagan sent to congress draft legislation that was the predecessor of the hostage act t o demonstrate to other governments and international forums that the united states is serious about its efforts to deal with international terrorism.see message from the president of the united states transmitting four drafts of proposed legislation to attack the pressing and urgent problem of international terrorism,doc,sess,at april.as the department of justice has acknowledged,the offense created by the hostage act is defined in substantially the same manner as under the convention.department of justice,handbook on the comprehensive crime control act of and other criminal statutes enacted by the congress december handbook.indeed,the hostage act did not become effective until the convention came into force and the united states became a party to it.see,historical and statutory notes,effective and applicability provisions handbook.
furthermore,when this court considered a constitutional challenge to the hostage act on the ground that the convention itself was beyond the treaty power of article ii of the constitution,we emphasized that the convention addresses a matter of grave concern to the international community hostage taking as a vehicle for terrorism.wang kun lue,at.and we upheld the hostage act because it plainly bears a rational relationship to the convention.id.at.
a scheme to detain a person in order to extort a taxi fare,even an excessive taxi fare,is not a manifestation of international terrorism.
however,although the first case involving the hostage act arose out of a terrorist hijacking of an international flight,see united states yunis,the case law that has developed under the act has not limited it to conduct related to international terrorism,and has applied it to several instances of confining illegal aliens and demanding payment for their release.see united states tchibassa,united states si lu tian,cir united states ferreira,cir united states fei lin,supplemented by united states fei,cir table wang kun lue,at united states,cir united states,cir see also united states montenegro,cir confinement of aliens to demand payment for narcotics united states,cir confinement of united states citizen infant to demand ransom for her release united states hung shun lin,confinement of aliens to demand payment of telephone bills.
even though the case law has now established that a hostage act violation does not require a link to international terrorism,the original purpose of the statute serves as a frame of reference to caution against stretching the coverage of the act.in the
