plaintiff john magan appeals from the grant of summary judgment by the united states district court for the southern district of new york,naomi reice buchwald,judge,in favor of defendant lufthansa german airlines lufthansa.he argues that the court erred when it decided as a matter of law that injuries sustained in the course of light or moderate turbulence as described by faa turbulence reporting criteria can never qualify as resulting from an accident under the warsaw convention for purposes of imposing liability on an airline and determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the degree of turbulence experienced by lufthansa flight on its march,flight to sofia,bulgaria,in the course of which magan sustained injuries.because we agree with magan on both counts,we reverse the judgment and remand to the district court.
background 
both sides in this case moved for summary judgment on the question whether the occurrence leading to magan injuries amounted to an accident under the terms of the warsaw convention the materials submitted in support of their motions reveal the following facts.magan was a ticketed passenger on lufthansa flight from munich,germany,to sofia,bulgaria,on march.he was seated in row seven,seat f.the plane,a british aerospace avro regional jet,has a center fuel tank that protrudes into the passenger cabin.it creates an overhang roughly nine inches deep that extends across the ceiling of the cabin from row five to row eight of the aircraft.magan had to pass under this overhang on the way to his seat as he boarded the aircraft.the bottom of the overhang stands at a height of six feet,three inches,while magan stands at six feet,four inches.
about two hours into the flight,and about half an hour before landing,magan went to the lavatory at the front of the aircraft.while in the lavatory,magan heard the pilot announce that passengers were to return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts.the pilot noted in his deposition that he had observed heavy thunderstorms illuminated in red on his radar as the plane approached sofia.anticipating turbulence as a result,he issued the instruction.
magan indicated that he finished up as quickly as he could and exited the lavatory.according to magan,the aircraft was pitching violently at this point,making it difficult to stand.he was forced to use the backs of the seats to negotiate his way back to his row.indeed,the pilot log indicated that the flight experienced what the pilot characterized as both light and medium turbulence.a fellow passenger also stated that the plane experienced very significant turbulence at this time.
although magan does not recall the precise details,before he could reach his seat and as he approached the overhang,something caused him to violently strike his head on it.the impact broke magan nose and dislodged a dental bridge from his mouth.magan vision became blurred and his nose began to bleed.magan recalls that he either temporarily blacked out or greyed out,but somehow managed to get back in his seat.
soon thereafter,a flight attendant offered him ice and some aspirin.the pilot radioed the air traffic control tower from the air to send an ambulance and medics,which met the plane upon landing.magan was eventually taken to a hospital in bulgaria where he received treatment.since the incident,magan has suffered from severe headaches diagnosed by his doctor as cluster headaches.
magan filed a claim against lufthansa in the district court for his injuries under article of the warsaw convention.lufthansa subsequently moved for summary judgment.the sole basis for its motion was the argument that the incidence of both parties assumed for purposes of summary judgment caused magan to hit his head on the overhanging ceiling of the not an accident for which the convention contemplated liability.the district court agreed and entered judgment in lufthansa favor.see magan lufthansa german airlines,d.
discussion 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo.green door realty tig ins,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no genuine issues of material fact and a moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.if the evidence is such that,when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,a reasonable fact finder could return a verdict for that party,then a genuine issue of material fact exists,and summary judgment is not warranted.see green door,at.
a passenger whose injuries fall within the scope of the warsaw convention is either entitled to recovery under the convention or not at all.el al israel airlines,tseng,d see also king am.airlines,cir.the parties here agree that the warsaw convention provides the exclusive remedy for magan injuries and,accordingly,that liability in this case must be determined under article of the convention which provides 
the carrier shall be liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger,if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.
warsaw convention,emphasis added.
as we recently noted in wallace korean air,this provision creates a presumption of carrier liability for passenger injuries sustained in the course of air travel,cir the supreme court has held that the imposition of this virtual strict liability,wallace,at internal quotation omitted,is subject to at least one important condition,however.under the terms of article quoted above,in order for an airline to be liable for a passenger injury,the injury must be caused by an accident.warsaw convention,see also wallace,at characterizing the occurrence of an accident as an essential predicate for carrier liability.in air france saks,the supreme court interpreted the term accident more strictly than to include simply any event or occurrence,d.the court held that the term accident connotes an unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger,id.at,and went on to qualify that,when an injury indisputably results from a passenger own internal reaction to the usual,normal,and expected operation of the aircraft,it has not been caused by an accident.id.at.thus,imposition of liability on air carriers for passenger injuries without regard to the air carriers degree of fault is limited to only certain circumstances 
although saks helped clarify the meaning of accident,courts have continued to struggle with its meaning in particular cases.indeed,as the court in saks noted,i n cases where there is contradictory evidence,it is for the trier of fact to decide whether an accident as here defined caused the passenger injury.id.at.furthermore,it exhorted courts to apply the definition flexibly after assessment of all the circumstances surrounding a passenger injuries.id.we agree with magan that,here,the district court did not follow the court admonitions when it granted lufthansa summary judgment.
lufthansa relies on criteria developed by the federal aviation administration and the national weather service for pilot communications regarding turbulence in making its argument that the events leading to magan injuries did not constitute an accident.it argues that,regardless whether turbulence caused magan to strike the overhang in the passenger cabin light and moderate turbulence as described in the which passengers may experience difficulty walking and strain against their seatbelts,and in which unsecured objects may become an expected part of every normal flight and therefore can never meet the definition of accident found in saks.according to lufthansa,however,severe and extreme which walking is impossible and unsecured objects are tossed about the meet the definition because they are much rarer.the district court adopted this argument,crafting a new rule of law which,using the criteria to delineate the boundary for liability,bars recovery for any injuries that are the result of light and moderate turbulence.magan,d at.the district court stated the rule as follows w here a passenger sustains an injury that is caused by turbulence,
