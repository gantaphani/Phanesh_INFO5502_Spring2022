mahmoud reza banki banki appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york convicting him,following a jury trial,of conspiracy to violate the iranian transactions regulations the itr and operate an unlicensed business violating the itr operating an unlicensed business and two counts of making false statements in response to government subpoenas.
on appeal,banki argues that the district court erred in several respects when instructing the jury on the conspiracy,itr,and counts.he also argues that he is entitled to a new trial on the false statement counts because the government constructively amended the indictment.he further accuses the government of misconduct in its rebuttal summation,which he claims necessitates a new trial on all counts.finally,he argues that he should be resentenced because the district court miscalculated the applicable offense level.
we affirm in part,reverse in part,and vacate and remand in part.
statement of the case 
born in tehran,iran,banki is a naturalized citizen who has lived in the united states since he was.after completing high school in iran,banki moved in to the united states to attend college.while banki has lived in the united states,many of his family have continued to reside in iran,including his father,mother,uncle,and cousin.
in iran,banki family owned three power companies and a pharmaceutical company his uncle was a director of all four companies,and his cousin was the ceo of one of the power companies.
beginning in may,banki family began to transfer large amounts of money totaling some million from iran to the united states.at trial,the defense argued these transfers were necessary to protect the family assets.banki mother testified that the money was intended to be used to purchase an apartment in the united states for herself,banki,and his brother.
the transfers were effectuated through an informal system called a hawala.the hawala system is widely used in middle eastern and south asian countries,and is primarily used to make international funds transfers though there are many forms of hawala,in the paradigmatic hawala system,funds are transferred from one country to another through a network of hawala brokers,hawaladars,with one hawaladar located in the transferor country and one in the transferee country.in this form,a hawala works as follows if person a in country a wants to send to person b in country b,person a contacts hawaladar a in country a and pays him.hawaladar a then contacts hawaladar b in country b and asks hawaladar b to pay in country b currency,minus any fees,to person b.the effect of this transaction is that person a has remitted minus any fees to person b,although no money has actually crossed the border between country a and country 
eventually,hawaladar b may need to send money to country a on behalf of a customer in country b he will then contact hawaladar a,with whom he now has a credit due to the previous transaction.hawaladar a will remit the money in country a to the designated person there,thus clearing the debt between the two hawaladars.typically,hawaladar a and hawaladar b would engage in many parallel transactions moving in both directions.a number of transactions might be required before the books are balanced between the two hawaladars.if after some period of time their ledgers remain imbalanced,the hawaladars may settle via wire transfer or another,more formal method of money transmission.the hawala system operates in large part on trust,since,as in the example above,a hawaladar will remit money well before he receives full payment,and he does so without the benefit of a more formal legal structure to protect his investment.
to send money to banki in the united states,banki family retained the services of ali bakhtiari,a hawaladar.in contrast to the paradigmatic,system discussed above,bakhtiari used a matching hawala system to facilitate the transfer of funds from iran to the united states.under the matching system,when bakhtiari knew that banki family wanted to send a sum of money to the united states,he would search among his contacts for someone who wanted to send approximately the same amount to iran.if he was unable to find a match among his contacts,which was often the case,he would reach out to his network of brokers to see if any of them knew of a match.these brokers generally did not reveal the identity of their contact,for fear of being cut out of the transaction by bakhtiari instead,bakhtiari would give the broker banki account information,which the broker would relay to his contact.the contact would then transfer into banki account a sum comparable to the amount banki family wished to send.once bakhtiari confirmed that the contact had transferred the money into banki account,he would pay an equivalent amount to the contact intended recipient or to the broker who facilitated the match for the broker to distribute to the intended recipient.bakhtiari and the broker would split the profits,which were derived from the difference in the buy and sell exchange rates,on any completed transaction.
between may and september,banki received as many as deposits in his bank of america account from at least different individuals and companies.most of the deposits were made via wire transfer,but some were made via atm deposit,counter credit,or check.wires for the transfers included references to one contract for pistachios and to another for tomato paste and transportation.the denominations of the individual deposits ranged from to.there were nine deposits of or less deposits of between and and six deposits of more than.in total,almost million was deposited into banki account.banki retained this million for his personal use,including the purchase of a million apartment in new york city.
the majority of the depositors were individuals,but some were business entities,located all over the world,including hillmarcs construction in the philippines,united gulf exchange company in kuwait,torgovy dom atlanta in russia,and the trenton group,llc,in latvia.banki did not personally know any of the depositors.
for most of these deposits,after the funds were deposited into banki account,banki a family member,almost always his father,to confirm that he had received the funds.for example,on may,banki received a wire transfer of from united gulf exchange account at a kuwaiti bank then,on may,banki wrote an to his father stating,here is a list of what i have received so far in the account may,from kuwait 
though most of banki did not explicitly acknowledge that there was a corresponding payout in iran for each deposit into banki account,one august email exchange clearly displayed banki knowledge that money was moving to iran,at least with respect to the august transaction.on august,banki uncle sent banki an that stated i told your father that a friend of mine wants to send usda to iran.i asked him to send the money to that account you gave me before.shortly thereafter,ahmad sheikholeslami transferred into banki account,and banki his uncle to confirm receipt of the money.according to sheikholeslami,a defense witness,banki uncle was doing him a personal favor by facilitating the transfer,and bakhtiari was not involved in the transaction.sheikholeslami claim that the transaction was unrelated to bakhtiari hawala was confirmed by bakhtiari ledgers,which did not reflect the transaction.this transfer was undisputed by banki.
the transfers into banki account came to the attention of the government,and in,the treasury department office of foreign asset control ofac served banki with two administrative subpoenas.both subpoenas requested information about transfers into banki account and advised banki that knowingly falsifying or concealing a material fact in his response is a felony.the january subpoena requested information about a transfer into banki account in january.by letter dated january,banki responded,identifying his cousin as the source of the transfer.then,in a june subpoena,ofac requested details of all payments banki had made,received,or facilitated in any manner involving iran since july.in his response,banki again identified his cousin as the source of the funds,and stated that banki had made no payments to anyone in iran since arriving in the united states in.
proceedings below 
in january,banki was indicted and arrested in new york city.in march,the government filed a superseding indictment the indictment,charging banki with five counts as follows 
count one conspiring to a violate the itr,pt,and b operate an unlicensed business,in violation of 
count two violating,or aiding and abetting the violation of,the itr 
count three conducting,or aiding and abetting the conduct of,an unlicensed business 
count four making materially false representations in response to a january,ofac subpoena and 
count five making materially false representations in response to a june,ofac subpoena.
at the conclusion of a day jury trial in may,the jury convicted banki on all counts.on counts two and three,the jury found banki guilty as an aider and abettor,not as a principal.
raising largely the issues he raises on appeal,banki moved for a new trial under rule.in a written decision,the district court john keenan,denied the motion.united states banki,d.in august,the district court sentenced banki to months imprisonment,below the guidelines range of months.
this appeal followed.

jury instructions 
this court reviews a claim of instructional error de novo and will set aside a conviction only where,viewing the charge as a whole,there was prejudicial error.united states hassan,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord united states amato,cir.jury instructions must be viewed in the context of the entire trial,not separately and in isolation.united states reese,cir.

itr instructions counts one and two 
the international emergency economic powers act ieepa grants the president broad authority to issue regulations that restrict or prohibit international trade where he declares a national emergency with respect to an unusual and extraordinary foreign policy or national security threat.
though the president has exercised his authority under ieepa to restrict trade with iran since,the trade restrictions at issue here date to.that year,president clinton issued executive order,which found that the actions and policies of the government of iran constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,foreign policy,and economy of the united states,and declared a national emergency to deal with that threat.exec.order.a subsequent executive order,executive order,imposed comprehensive trade and financial sanctions on iran it prohibited,inter alia,the exportation from the united states to iran,the government of iran,or to any entity owned or controlled by the government of iran,or the financing of such exportation,of any goods,technology,or services.exec.order,may.
pursuant to executive orders and,the secretary of the treasury promulgated the itr,pt.like executive order,the itr generally prohibit the exportation of goods,technology,or services to iran 
prohibited exportation,reexportation,sale or supply of goods,technology,or services to iran.
except as otherwise authorized pursuant to this part,the exportation,reexportation,sale,or supply,directly or indirectly,from the united states,or by a united states person,wherever located,of any goods,technology,or services to iran or the government of iran is prohibited 
thus,unless otherwise authorized in part of title of the code of federal regulations,a united states or person located in the united states may not export a service to iran.those who willfully violate the itr are subject to criminal penalties.a,c.
banki raises two challenges to the district court itr instructions.first,he argues that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that executing money transfers to iran on behalf of others qualified as services under the itr only if undertaken for a fee.second,he argues that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that remittances to iran,including family remittances,are exempt from the itr ban.
the requirement of a fee 
in united states homa international trading,this court held that the execution on behalf of others of money transfers from the united states to iran is a service under the itr,cir per curiam.in so holding,the court observed,the term services is unambiguous and refers to the performance of something useful for a fee.id.at emphasis added citing united states all funds on deposit in united bank of switzerland,civ jsr,wl,at.banki relies on this language,arguing that executing money transfers to iran on behalf of others does not violate the itr unless performed for a fee and that,accordingly,the district court erred by failing to so instruct the jury 
as a close reading of homa reveals,however,the language in homa suggesting that the receipt of a fee is a necessary element of a service is dicta.the defendant in homa,in challenging the sufficiency of the evidence,did not argue that the receipt of a fee was required to be convicted of exporting a service to iran in violation of the itr.rather,he argued it is simply unnatural to think of a transfer of funds as an exportation of services.if anything is being exported,it is the funds themselves.brief of defendant appellant at,homa.thus,the court was called upon to decide whether exporting funds on behalf of another constituted the exportation of a service,not whether a service required receipt of a fee.accordingly,the statement in homa that t he term services is unambiguous and refers to the performance of something useful for a fee is dicta,and we are not bound by it.
our conclusion that the language on which banki relies is dicta does not,however,end our inquiry.it merely clears the path for our analysis of whether the receipt of a fee is a necessary element of a service.
in interpreting an administrative regulation,as in interpreting a statute,we must begin by examining the language of the provision at issue.resnik swartz,cir see united states gagliardi,cir.the itr do not define services.see see also id.general definitions.thus,we must determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in this case.gagliardi,at.
for its definition of service,the homa court cited united states all funds on deposit in united bank of swizerland,which in turn quoted black law dictionary.see homa,at all funds,wl,at noting that black defines service as the act of doing something useful for a person or company for a fee quoting black law dictionary ed.although black defines service as having a fee component,other dictionaries do not.see,merriamwebster collegiate dictionary ed defining service as useful labor that does not produce a tangible commodity webster third new international dictionary unabridged ed defining service as the performance of work commanded or paid for by another emphasis added.in fact,the very edition of black cited in all funds contains another definition of service that does not have a fee component.black law dictionary ed defining service as a n intangible commodity in the form of human effort,such as labor,skill,or advice.we therefore look to the broader text and purpose of the itr to aid our interpretation.see united states pesaturo,cir adopting an interpretation of a regulation because it was more persuasive both textually and in the context of the government stated purpose.we have no difficulty concluding that the transfer of funds on behalf of another constitutes a service even if not performed for a fee.
the iranian embargo is intended to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security,foreign policy,and economy of the united states posed by the actions and policies of the government of iran.exec.order,may,exec.order.the embargo is primarily concerned with a few key actions and policies at the heart of the threat posed by the iranian government namely,the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,terrorist activity,and efforts to frustrate middle east diplomacy.see homa,at.
by design,however,the embargo is deliberately overinclusive.thus,for example,the itr prohibit the exportation of not only advice on developing iranian chemical weapons but also advice on developing iranian petroleum resources,see not only services to the iranian government but also services to iranian businesses,see and not only bombs but also beer,see.in other words,to reform the actions of the government of iran,executive order and the itr adopt a blunt instrument broad economic sanctions intended to isolate iran.see homa,at t he obvious purpose of executive order is to isolate iran from trade with the united states.quoting united states ehsan,cir.
given that isolation of iran is the tool that the embargo employs,there is no sound reason for the itr to distinguish between the exportation of a service to iran for which the service provider received a fee and the exportation of a service to iran for which the service provider did not receive a fee,prohibiting only the former.after all,both exportations have the same impact in iran.
banki argument that the term services has an inherent fee requirement also proves too much,for it would permit anomalies,such as permitting a entity to render uncompensated legal or consulting services to an iranian corporation.we see no principled reason why the itr would permit the exportation of consulting services to an iranian corporation gratis but prohibit the exportation of the same consulting services for a fee.
indeed,even without such broad economic sanctions intended to isolate iran,banki argument that a fee is required fails because it would exempt from the itr ban certain particularly transfers.specifically,a fee requirement would provide a dangerous and unintended loophole for persons in the united states who are motivated to export services to iran without regard to monetary compensation,including those seeking to foster the very actions and policies that prompted the establishment of the iran embargo.
thus,we conclude that the execution of money transfers from the united states to iran on behalf of another,whether or not performed for a fee,constitutes the exportation of a service.
non commercial remittance exception 
banki also argues that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that remittances to iran,including family remittances,are exempt from the itr ban he seeks a judgment of acquittal or,alternatively,a new trial on count two and a new trial on count one.
as discussed above,the itr generally prohibit the exportation of services to iran.see.in arguing that the itr exempt remittances from the itr ban,banki relies on,which reads as follows 
payment and united states dollar clearing transactions involving iran.
a united states depository institutions are authorized to process transfers of funds to or from iran,or for the direct or indirect benefit of persons in iran or the government of iran,if the transfer is covered in full by any of the following conditions and does not involve debiting or crediting an iranian account 
the transfer arises from an underlying transaction that is not prohibited by this part,such as a remittance to or from iran,a family remittance not related to a enterprise 
emphasis added 
the parties disagree as to the meaning of the regulation.banki argues that,by its plain language,a permits a remittance to or from iran,including a family remittance.the government argues,on the other hand,that permits noncommercial remittances between the united states and iran only if such remittances are processed through a depository institution.
we hold that,at a minimum,the regulation is ambiguous in this respect.consequently,we are required to interpret the regulation in banki favor,for t he rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them.united states santos.the rule vindicates the fundamental principle that no citizen should be held accountable for a violation of a statute whose commands are uncertain.id.here,the meaning of the regulation is uncertain.
first,the plain wording of supports banki view that family remittances are not prohibited at least not by pt.indeed,the statute explicitly lists a family remittance as an example of a transaction that is not prohibited by part.the relevant language,which appears as an enumerated condition under a,provides that depository institutions are authorized to process a transfer of funds to or from iran when t he transfer arises from an underlying transaction that is not prohibited by this part,such as a remittance to or from iran,a family remittance not related to a enterprise.a emphasis added.on its face,then,the regulation would seem to be clear a family remittance is not prohibited by part.
the conclusion that family remittances are not prohibited under part does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that they are permitted under the complete regulatory scheme.see requiring that transactions comply with all other applicable laws and regulations.nevertheless,the fact that a specifically lists family remittances as an example of the type of transactions depositary institutions are authorized to process suggests that such actions do not contravene other applicable laws or regulations.
second,the government contention that only depository institutions are authorized to process the permitted transfers is inconsistent at least arguably with the language of the regulation a fair reading of is that it tells depository institutions and securities brokers and dealers that they are permitted to process remittances,including family remittances,but the regulation does not provide that only depository institutions and securities brokers and dealers may do so.indeed,nothing in section specifically prohibits anyone from making a family remittance.the government assertion that the regulation provides that family remittances must be transacted through banks,gov t br.at emphasis added,is not supported by the language of the regulation.if the intent were to permit only banks and brokers and dealers to process these remittances,the regulation could have easily so provided.
we acknowledge that textual arguments can be made both ways.by authorizing banks and securities brokers and dealers to process these transactions,without authorizing anyone else,the regulation arguably limits the authorization to the specified entities.moreover,under banki view,because remittances are not prohibited,arguably anyone could process a remittance for another.if that were the case,there would be no apparent need to authorize a depository institution to do so,and the first clause of a would be rendered a nullity,in violation of the principle of statutory construction requiring courts to give effect to every clause and word of a statute,if possible.dietz united states,cir accord corley united states,a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all of its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
we are not persuaded by the government that unambiguously grants depositary institutions exclusive authority to process remittances between the united states and iran.first,it is not at all clear that banki interpretation of the regulation would render the first clause a nullity.given the complexity of the regulatory scheme,the number of prohibitions and exemptions contained in the itr,the nature of the banking industry,and the criminal nature of the violations,it is appropriate that financial institutions are given explicit guidance that they may process these specific transactions.the processing of money transfers is undoubtedly a service,and the language in the regulation makes clear that banks can process remittances without running afoul of the ban on providing services.without the language authorizing banks to provide this service,banks would not be able to process noncommercial remittances,even if they are not prohibited.we do not agree with the assertion that under banki interpretation anyone could process a transaction under the more general ban on providing goods,technology,and services,providing a service of processing remittances would be barred.hence,the language in the first clause is necessary to permit banks to provide this service.
second,the same principle of statutory construction can be applied to the government interpretation of the regulation if the first clause means that only banks and securities brokers and dealers are authorized by the first clause to process noncommercial remittances,arguably the language providing that such transactions are not prohibited likewise would be superfluous.the two clauses can both have meaning noncommercial remittances are not prohibited,and banks are authorized to provide the service of processing them.
moreover,no provision in the itr prohibits a united states person from remitting his own funds to an individual in iran for a purpose.see prohibitions see also prohibiting exportation of goods,technology,or services to iran,but not prohibiting exportation of funds.while there are provisions prohibiting the remitting of funds for certain purposes there is no general bar to the remissions of funds,see pt,and a expressly provides that noncommercial remissions are not prohibited.in contrast,the sanctions enacted during the iranian hostage crisis specifically prohibited the transfer of funds to iran,and even then family remittances were excepted.exec.order,revoked by exec.order,exec.order,revoked by exec.order.a fair question thus exists as to whether a person could without violating the itr transmit funds herself to iran,for example,by personally carrying cash on a plane to iran,assuming compliance with any applicable customs laws.
the government also argues that its interpretation would further the purposes of the itr.the itr impose recordkeeping and reporting requirements on depository institutions when processing transactions.see,c requiring depository institutions to verify that an underlying transaction is not prohibited by the itr before initiating payment on behalf of a customer see also requiring retention of transaction records for five years,requiring reports to be submitted under oath.construing the regulation to provide that only banks and securities brokers and dealers are authorized to process remittances would further the itr evident purpose of subjecting transactions to and from iran to oversight and regulation.all funds,wl,at.the government fairly argues that it seems unlikely that the itr would impose such strict compliance procedures on depository institutions processing noncommercial remittances,but impose no such requirements on hawalas transmitting remittances.
at the same time,the itr were adopted to address the actions of the iranian government while limiting the adverse impact of the sanctions on the iranian people.see exempting from regulation certain personal communications,humanitarian donations,information and information materials,and travel exec.order,finding that the actions and policies of the government of iran constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat emphasis added 
in light of the ambiguity in the regulation,banki conviction on counts one and two can not stand.
money transmitting instructions counts one and three 
count three charged banki with conducting,or aiding and abetting the conduct of,an unlicensed business,in violation of.
under,w hoever knowingly conducts,controls,manages,supervises,directs,or owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business is subject to criminal penalties.a.as used in 
the term unlicensed money transmitting business means a money transmitting business which 
a is operated without an appropriate money transmitting license in a state where such operation is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony under state law,
b fails to comply with the money transmitting business registration requirements under,which require businesses to register with the secretary of the treasury or 
c otherwise involves the transportation or transmission of funds that are known to the defendant to have been derived from a criminal offense or are intended to be used to promote or support unlawful activity 
see a any person who owns or controls a money transmitting business shall register the business whether or not the business is licensed as a money transmitting business in any state with the secretary of the treasury.new york,where banki lived during the relevant time period,prohibits engag ing in the business of transmitting money without a license,and violators can be convicted of a misdemeanor or felony,depending on the amount transmitted.banking law,mckinney.it is undisputed that banki neither possessed a new york license nor registered with the secretary of the treasury.
section defines money transmitting broadly money transmitting includes transferring funds on behalf of the public by any and all means including but not limited to transfers within this country or to locations abroad by wire,check,draft,facsimile,or courier.id.b.the parties do not dispute that transferring funds through a hawala qualifies as money transmitting under.
relying on this court definition of money transmitting business in united states velastegui,banki argues that the district court,in instructing the jury,erred by failing to define money transmitting business as an enterprise not a single transaction that is conducted for a fee or profit.see united states velastegui,cir defining a money transmitting business as the transmission of money for a fee involving more than a single,isolated transmission of money.banki requested such an instruction below but the district court declined to give it,instructing the jury instead as follows 
the term money transmitting business includes any business which provides check cashing,currency exchange or money transmitting or remittance services or issues or redeems money orders,travelers checks and other similar instruments or any other person who engages as a business in the transmission of funds,including any person who engages as a business in an informal money transfer system or any network of people who engage as a business in facilitating the transfer of money domestically or internationally outside of the conventional financial institutions system.it is for you to determine whether the quantity and nature of the transmittals constitute a business.however,i instruct you that a hawala is a money transmitting business.
the district court,in denying banki rule motion,explained that it declined to define business because the term is a business is not a complex or legal concept.no juror needs a judge charge of law to comprehend that a business is an ongoing enterprise carried out for financial gain there is no other interpretation of the term business the jury could have possibly applied.banki,d at vargas keane,cir weinstein,concurring the phrase reasonable doubt is and is its own best definition.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
while we largely agree with the district court that the term business is,we conclude that the district court erred in its charge here.
first,banki requested charge was legally correct.han,at in united states velastegui,we held that an agent could not face federal criminal prosecution under for an isolated instance of improper transmittal of money because section a requires that the unlicensed entity be an illegal money transmitting business.at.thus,to find a defendant liable for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business,a jury must find that he participated in more than a single,isolated transmission of money.see id.likewise,giving the term business its plain and unambiguous meaning,see united states fuller,cir,under a business is an enterprise that is carried on for profit or financial gain.see merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed defining business as a commercial or sometimes an industrial enterprise webster ii new riverside university dictionary defining business as a commercial enterprise or establishment.see velastegui,at a money transmitting business receives money from a customer and then,for a fee paid by the customer,transmits that money to a recipient emphasis added.
second,there was a foundation in the trial evidence,united states russo,cir,for banki request for an instruction that a business must involve more than a single,isolated transaction.the evidence at trial was such that a rational jury could have concluded that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that banki knew funds were moving to iran in only one transaction the sheikholeslami transaction.although the associated with the transaction clearly showed that banki knew that funds were moving to iran as part of the transaction,relating to other hawala transactions were far less explicit.in addition,bakhtiari testimony and ledgers supported the inference that bakhtiari was not involved in the transaction thus,the jury could have concluded,as the defense argued,that the transaction was a favor for a family friend.the jury could have concluded that the government failed to prove that banki knew funds were moving to iran in more than one transaction,and,accordingly,banki was entitled to the substance of his requested instruction that he could not be convicted under for a single,isolated transmission of money.
third,the district court compounded the problem by stating,in its charge to the jury i instruct you that a hawala is a money transmitting business.by doing so,the district court arguably relieved the government of its burden of proving that banki knowledge that money was moving to iran extended beyond the transaction.see prohibiting knowingly conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business velastegui,at,holding that a money transmitting business must involve more than a single,isolated transmission of money.in its background instructions,the district court had charged the jury,in this case you have heard allegations that the defendant operated a hawala,an unlicensed value transfer system,through which money was sent to iran.tr.at emphasis added.by later instructing the jury that a hawala is a money transmitting business,the district court arguably was instructing the jury that if it found that banki operated a hawala,then he necessarily operated a money transmitting business,thereby taking the latter issue away from the jury.simply put,looking at the charge in the context of the entire trial,we are uncertain of the theory on which the jury chose to convict.
accordingly,we vacate banki convictions on count one to the extent it alleged that banki operated an unlicensed business in violation of and count three and remand for a new trial.
customer or beneficiary instruction counts one,two,and three 
banki next argues that the district court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that a mere customer or beneficiary of a hawala transaction can not be held criminally liable,either as an aider and abettor on counts two and three,or as a conspirator on count one 
with respect to the count,banki argues that the district court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that a mere customer or beneficiary of an unlicensed business is exempt from criminal liability.in so arguing,banki draws an analogy between his case and this court case law excepting certain minor participants in illegal gambling businesses and drug transactions from criminal liability.banki reliance on these cases is misplaced.
first,as to the gambling analogy,count three charges banki with violating,which imposes criminal penalties on a person who knowingly conducts,controls,manages,supervises,directs,or owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business.a.similarly,which was the model for,see,at imposes criminal sanctions on any person who conducts,finances,manages,supervises,directs,or owns all or part of an illegal gambling business.a.
we have interpreted to prohibit a broad range of conduct the statute reaches not only the upper,but also the lower,echelon of a gambling business,including agents,runners,independent contractors,and salesmen.united states grezo,cir united states becker,cir,vacated on other grounds.mere betting customers,however,do not conduct the gambling business within the meaning of.grezo,at.
but not all bettors are isolated from criminal liability under.in grezo,the defendant,who was an independent bookmaker who placed layoff bets with a larger gambling business that was the target of the indictment,was accused of conducting the target gambling business.id.at.rejecting the defendant argument that he was a mere bettor or customer,we held that when otherwise independent bookmakers whose gambling businesses do not meet the definition of business under regularly place consistent,substantial layoff bets with a gambling business as defined by,they should be considered to conduct that business within the meaning of,despite any superficial similarity which their activities may bear to those of the average customer.id.at.in so holding,we reasoned that because a layoff bettor bets help a bookmaker balance his own book of bets and maintain a uniform line among bookmakers,the bookmaker and defendant layoff bettor shared a community of interest,which separated the layoff bettor from a mere bettor.id.at.
second,banki draws an analogy to abuelhawa united states.in abuelhawa,the defendant placed six phone calls to arrange two cocaine purchases transactions that amount to misdemeanors under the controlled substances act.at.instead of charging abuelhawa with misdemeanors,however,the government charged abuelhawa with,and obtained convictions on,six felony counts of using a communication facility to facilitate drug distribution,b.at.the supreme court reversed abuelhawa convictions,reasoning that where a statute treats one side of a bilateral transaction more leniently,adding to the penalty of the party on that side for facilitating the action by the other would upend the calibration of punishment set by the legislature.id.at.
even assuming,however,that a mere customer or beneficiary exemption,as requested by banki,applies in the context of,we would conclude that banki was not entitled to such an instruction.
a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on a defense theory for which there is any foundation in the evidence.united states russo,cir emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.here,there was no foundation in the evidence for a mere customer or beneficiary instruction.
banki was convicted of facilitating the transfer of money to iran,not with receiving money from iran.the indictment alleged in count three that banki effectuated,and aided and abetted,the transfer of funds to residents within iran.indictment emphasis added.in addition,the district court repeatedly instructed the jury that it was banki role in the transfer of funds to iran,not his receipt of funds from iran,that potentially subjected him to criminal liability.see tr.in this case you have heard allegations that the defendant operated a hawala,an unlicensed value transfer system,through which money was sent to iran i remind you that the defendant is charged with sending money to iran,not with receiving money from iran.see tr.banki is not charged with transmitting money or services to the iranian government he is charged with sending money to people in iran.thus,the jury could only convict banki for for his role in transferring funds to iran.
with respect to the transfer of funds to iran,banki role was that of an intermediary not a customer or beneficiary.by finding banki guilty on the count,the jury necessarily found that banki knew that he was facilitating the transfer of funds to iran.see a.the defense argues that if banki had the requisite knowledge with respect to any transaction,it was only the transaction.but even with respect to that transaction,banki was an intermediary not a customer or beneficiary.simply put,where the crime charged is transmitting money to iran without a license,the customer is the wire originator the intended recipient.
nor was banki entitled to a mere customer or beneficiary instruction on the itr count.the itr count charged banki with violating the itr by providing money transfer services,through the o
