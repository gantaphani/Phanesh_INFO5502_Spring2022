ursula,filed suit against two german banks,dresdner bank and deutsche bank,to recover assets from her family estate.the plaintiff alleges that the banks,through the nazi regime program of aryanization,stole her family interest in its manufacturing company,orenstein koppel.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendant banks on multiple grounds,including the political question doctrine,international comity,statute of limitations and failure to state a claim.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
a.the history of the orenstein interests in 
in,the plaintiff,benno orenstein,together with arthur koppel,created,which became germany sixth largest manufacturer of machinery.the company produced heavy equipment and railway lines benno orenstein was the director general of until his death in,when his son,alfred orenstein,became managing director.at this time,the orenstein family shares of were distributed equally among benno orenstein four children,although members of the family were not permitted to sell the shares without alfred orenstein permission for ten years.alleges that the family maintained a controlling interest in the company,including hundreds of thousands of preferred shares and common shares 
does not have precise information on what happened to the shares once the nazi party came to power.she alleges that because the orensteins were jewish,their ownership in was vulnerable to aryanization,a program in which jewish assets were transferred to by way of boycotts,force,terror and coercion.jewish owners were ousted from the boards of german corporations and assets were sold to at nominal values.german banks,including the defendants in this action,acted as trustees for jewish assets and aided the german government in transferring these assets away from their jewish owners.the plaintiff alleges that both defendant banks were voluntarily involved in and profited from the state practice of aryanization.she further alleges that the defendant banks continue to this day to conceal documentary evidence of their actions.
in the case of,alleges that dresdner bank,with the assistance of deutsche bank,successfully ousted the orensteins from their positions on the board and effectively stole their stock.in her initial complaint,she maintains that the nazi government and the dresdner bank pressured and coerced the orenstein family into an agreement whereby erich niemann,a dresdner bank managing director,took over control of and became a trustee for all of the orenstein shares of preferred and common stock.niemann was replaced by karl rasche,another dresdner bank representative in.by,all of the jewish members of board,as well as the boards of both banks,had been removed,and alfred orenstein had relocated to south africa to manage the company branch there.later terminated its contract with alfred orenstein.the plaintiff alleges that,by,deutsche bank owned of all shares and had completely divested the orensteins of their interests in the company.there is only one record of any payment to an orenstein family member for shares of stock rm to alfred orenstein.
connection to 
each of benno orenstein four children received an equal share of the family stock upon his death.one of benno daughters,lili,married and had two daughters,ursula ulla and liselotte.ulla had a son,peter ungaro,and a daughter,ursula the plaintiff.liselotte had no heirs and left all of her assets to her sister ulla,peter,and ursula.the plaintiff now claims to represent,along with her brother,of the estate of benno orenstein.the plaintiff only learned in that she was of jewish descent.she did not discover until that she was the of benno orenstein.her grandmother,lili orenstein berliner,did know about the family history and attempted to ascertain what had happened to her interest in.in,lili berliner,through an attorney,wrote to deutsche bank requesting an accounting of her assets.apparently lili berliner and her attorney took no further action.the plaintiff maintains that the bank did not provide any information and alleges that it still has failed to account for the assets.
c.the international agreements addressing wwii claims 
after the end of wwii,there were several international agreements addressing restitution and reparations.in its sector of occupied germany,the united states enacted military laws requiring that property taken by the nazi regime be restored and providing that individuals could bring claims for restitution of identifiable property.in,the united states government,together with the british and french governments,entered into an agreement to unite their sectors into an independent west german government.see termination of the occupation regime in the federal republic of germany.this agreement reaffirmed germany obligation to provide restitution as prescribed by united states military law 
in addition to claims by german nationals,the west german government also faced claims based on its wartime activities by other governments and foreign nationals.many of the treaties called for reparations,but the london debt effort by western powers to reindustrialize west germany to help fight the cold these obligations.the suspension of claims was viewed as a suspension of the reparations question until a final treaty on germany was concluded,which did not occur until when germany was reunified.in the,lawsuits against the german government and private german companies increased dramatically in american courts,which caused considerable concern in germany.in an effort to stem american litigation,the german government sought to enter into an international agreement with the united states to remove this litigation to an alternative forum based in germany.
in,president clinton entered into an agreement with the german government the foundation agreement aimed at achieving a legal peace.see agreement concerning the foundation remembrance,responsibility and the future,july.in the agreement,the german government agreed to establish a private foundation,the foundation remembrance,responsibility,and the future the foundation,to hear claims brought by victims of the nazi regime the foundation is funded by voluntary contributions from the german government and german companies.both the united states government and the german government argue that this fund offers compensation to victims of the nazi regime that would not be available through traditional litigation.
in return,the united states agreed to encourage its courts and state governments to respect the foundation as the exclusive forum for claims from the national socialist era.the agreement,however,did not suspend or transfer lawsuits in american courts to germany.instead,the united states promised to file a statement of interest in any lawsuit dealing with wwii restitution or reparations the statement would inform united states courts that it is in the foreign policy interests of the united states for the case to be dismissed on any valid legal ground but would not suggest that the agreement itself provides an independent legal basis for dismissal.
ii.discussion 
the district court dismissed the case on five grounds political question,international comity,statute of limitations,failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted and a lack of capacity to sue the district court rejected the defendants assertion that the act of state doctrine was another independent ground for dismissal.we affirm the district court opinion based on international comity.
federal common law of foreign affairs 
at the outset,we need to specify the source of law governing the present claim.we hold that federal law,rather than florida law,governs notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff brought state law claims against the defendant banks.
under the erie doctrine,a federal court adjudicating state law claims applies the substantive law of the state.see erie tompkins.klaxon stentor electric.the supreme court,however,has carved out exceptions to this doctrine where there are uniquely federal interests at stake.see hinderlider la plata river.one such exception applies to litigation that implicates the nation foreign relations.see banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,d applying federal law rather than new york law republic of the philippines marcos,cir applying federal law because the foreign relations implications of the litigation created uniquely federal interests.because our foreign relations could be impaired by the application of state laws,which do not necessarily reflect national interests,federal law applies to these cases even where the court has diversity jurisdiction.as the supreme court explained in sabbatino 
we could perhaps in this diversity action avoid the question of deciding whether federal or state law is applicable to this aspect of the litigation 
however,we are constrained to make it clear that an issue concerned with a basic choice regarding the competence and function of the judiciary and the national executive in ordering our relationships with other members of the international community must be treated exclusively as an aspect of federal law.it seems fair to assume that the court did not have rules like the act of state doctrine in mind when it decided erie tompkins.soon thereafter,professor philip jessup,now a judge of the international court of justice,recognized the potential dangers were erie extended to legal problems affecting international relations.he cautioned that rules of international law should not be left to divergent and perhaps parochial state interpretations.
here,the federal government has engaged in years of negotiations and,in,concluded an executive agreement with the german government addressing litigation arising from the national socialist era.in addition,the supreme court determined that this agreement preempts any contrary state law because such state laws would interfere with the president foreign affairs power.see am.ins.ass garamendi,d finding that a california law requiring insurance companies to disclose nazi era life insurance policies was preempted by the executive agreement.thus,like the litigation in sabbatino,the present litigation has sufficient ties to our nation foreign relations that we apply federal law rather than state law.
b.the foundation agreement 
to resolve the present litigation,we begin by examining the foundation agreement,the agreement between the united states and germany the plaintiff argues that the agreement does not cover her suit because the relevant transactions took place before world war ii,but the treaty scope includes any actions committed during the national socialist era.article states 
the parties agree that the foundation remembrance,responsibility and the future covers,and that it would be in their interests for the foundation to be the exclusive remedy and forum for the resolution of,all claims that have been or may be asserted against german companies arising from the national socialist era and world war ii.
foundation agreement,art.i,para,at emphasis added.furthermore,the agreement explicitly covers property claims.in annex b,the united states government agreed to submit a statement of interest to federal courts announcing that the foundation is the preferred forum for the resolution of all asserted claims against german companies arising from their involvement in the national socialist era and world war ii,including without limitation those relating to damage to or loss of property,including banking assets and insurance policies.foundation agreement,annex b,para,at emphasis added 
the foundation agreement,however,does not provide the substantive law to resolve the case before us because it neither settles the outstanding claim nor directs that all claims be transferred to the foundation settlement procedures.rather,the united states simply promises to announce that such a transfer is in the united states national interests.in annex b,the united states government is obliged to inform domestic courts that its policy interests favor dismissal on any valid legal ground,but does not suggest that its policy interests concerning the foundation in themselves provide an independent legal basis for dismissal.foundation agreement,annex b,para,at.thus,by its own terms,the agreement does not provide a basis to dismiss or suspend litigation against german companies stemming from their actions during the national socialist era.
because the foundation agreement firmly establishes that issues related to litigation against german corporations from the national socialist era are governed by federal law,but does not provide any substantive principles by which to adjudicate this case,we must examine federal law not based in treaty to resolve the issues presented here.
in the following sections,we first determine that the case is justiciable.although the case has implications for our foreign relations,our consideration of the claim is not barred by the political question doctrine.second,based on the principle of international comity,we defer to the tribunal created by the foundation agreement to adjudicate the issues raised here.
c.the political question doctrine 
the district court found that this case implicates american foreign relations and,thus,is a political question,in domestic courts.we disagree.
the political question doctrine is based on the proper relationship between the judiciary and the political branches of government.baker carr,d.courts refuse to adjudicate a claim under the political question doctrine where there 
is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion or the impossibility of a court undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.
issues related to foreign affairs often are beyond the competence of the federal courts to resolve because they require judicial intervention in policy areas reserved to the political branches or could express a lack of respect due the other branches.yet not all issues that could potentially have consequences to our foreign relations are political questions.as the supreme court stated in baker carr,it is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance.id.at.see also japan whaling ass am.cetacean soc y,d holding that federal courts have the authority to construe treaties and executive agreements even when it can have foreign affairs implications.
here,none of the factors that advise against judicial resolution are present.adjudication of the present claim would not interfere with the executive handling of foreign relations or show a lack of respect to the executive power in foreign affairs.indeed,the plain text of the foundation agreement anticipates that federal courts will consider claims against german corporations.the entirety of annex b of the agreement is dedicated to explaining what the united states government will include in its statement of interest to american courts hearing these cases.furthermore,the agreement itself provides that it does not provide an independent legal basis for dismissal.see foundation agreement,annex b,para,at.thus,the executive opted not to settle these claims or to transfer the claims to the foundation,although it had the power to do so 
as a result,federal court consideration of the present case does not reflect a lack of respect for the executive nor does it interfere with american foreign relations.the united states is in full compliance with the foundation agreement so long as it files a statement of interest to courts urging respect for the foundation as the exclusive forum to resolve these claims.this statement of interest from the executive is entitled to deference and we give the executive statement such deference in our international comity analysis.see republic of austria altmann,d stating that should the state department choose to express its opinion on the implications of exercising jurisdiction over particular petitioners in connection with their alleged conduct,that opinion might well be entitled to deference as the considered judgment of the executive on a particular question of foreign policy.a statement of national interest alone,however,does not take the present litigation outside of the competence of the judiciary 
the other four factors similarly do not lead us to conclude that the issue raised here is a political question.first,the issues addressed in the present litigation are not constitutionally committed to a coordinate political branch.the present litigation against two foreign corporations is subject to the political question analysis only because the executive has entered into international negotiations over this topic.thus,the courts should look to the results of those negotiations to determine if judicial resolution of the claim would interfere with the executive conduct of foreign relations.the foundation agreement is unambiguous in its expectation that federal courts will consider these cases and should dismiss them based on ordinary principles of federal law.annex b states 
plaintiffs in these nazi era cases face numerous legal hurdles,including,without limitation,justiciability,international comity,statutes of limitation,jurisdictional issues,forum non conveniens,difficulties of proof,and certification of a class of heirs.the united states takes no position here on the merits of the legal claims or arguments advanced by plaintiffs or defendants.the united states does not suggest that its policy interests concerning the foundation in themselves provide an independent legal basis for dismissal,but will reinforce the point that policy interests favor dismissal on any valid legal ground.
see foundation agreement,annex b,para,at emphasis added.the president could have settled these cases.in that case,federal courts would be interfering with the executive conduct of foreign relations if we continued to exercise jurisdiction.such is not the situation here.the president has purposefully chosen not to settle these claims directly and,instead,has instructed the federal courts to use existing legal grounds.
second,consideration of the present case will not lead to multifarious pronouncements that could potentially embarrass the executive.quite the opposite,the governments anticipated that federal courts would consider cases against the german government or german corporations.third,the issues raised here can be resolved through judicially discoverable and manageable standards.federal courts adjudicate claims against foreign corporations every day and can consider the nation foreign policy interests and international comity concerns in their decisions.finally,adjudication of the present case does not require the courts to make a policy determination.
international comity 
international comity reflects the extent to which the law of one nation,as put in force within its territory,whether by executive order,by legislative act,or by judicial decree,shall be allowed to operate within the dominion of another nation.hilton guyot.it is an abstention doctrine a federal court has jurisdiction but defers to the judgment of an alternative forum.turner entm t degeto film,cir international comity serves as a guide to federal courts where the issues to be resolved are entangled in international relations.in re maxwell communication,cir.the district court dismissed this case on international comity grounds in favor of resolution at the foundation because the foundation is a specialized system,supported by the united states government and the international community,for addressing nazi era claims.the district court further considered that all of the relevant transactions leading to this suit took place in germany and,thus,germany was the most appropriate forum state for the resolution of these claims.
the doctrine of international comity can be applied retrospectively or prospectively.when applied retrospectively,domestic courts consider whether to respect the judgment of a foreign tribunal or to defer to parallel foreign proceedings.see,finanz ag zurich banco economico,cir affording comity in deference to concurrent foreign bankruptcy proceedings turner entm t,at staying domestic legal proceedings to defer to concurrent german proceedings on the merits of the dispute cunard salen reefer servs.ab,cir deferring to foreign bankruptcy proceedings see also canada southern ry.gebhard.dismissing the claims of american railroad bond holders in favor of canadian legislation and legal proceedings aimed at reorganizing the railroad corporate structure.
when applied prospectively,domestic courts consider whether to dismiss or stay a domestic action based on the interests of our government,the foreign government and the international community in resolving the dispute in a foreign forum.see bi union carbide chems.plastics,cir dismissing the claims of indian nationals injured by a chemical plant explosion in bhopal based on indian legislation granting the indian government exclusive standing to represent all victims see also jota texaco,cir considering whether to dismiss proceedings related to environmental damage in equador based on equador interest in foreign or domestic resolution and holding dismissal on grounds of forum non conveniens and comity erroneous pravin banker assocs.banco popular del peru,cir considering whether to stay proceedings brought by an american holder of peruvian debt while peru attempted to renegotiate its commercial debt under the brady plan.
the analysis for both forms of international comity embody similar concerns with foreign governments interests,fair procedures,and american public policy,but they emphasize different issues.when applied retrospectively,federal courts evaluate three factors whether the foreign court was competent and used proceedings consistent with civilized jurisprudence,whether the judgment was rendered by fraud,and whether the foreign judgment was prejudicial because it violated american public policy notions of what is decent and just.turner entm t,at.courts also consider whether the central issue in dispute is a matter of foreign law and whether there is a prospect of conflicting judgments.id.at.
applied prospectively,federal courts evaluate several factors,including the strength of the united states interest in using a foreign forum,the strength of the foreign governments interests,and the adequacy of the alternative forum.see jota,at holding that courts should consider the adequacy of the foreign forum and the strength of the foreign government interests pravin banker,at considering the strength of american public policy interests in debt enforcement and the foreign government interest in debt reorganization bi,at considering the strength of the foreign government interest in efficiently addressing a mass tort that took place within its borders.our determination of the adequacy of the alternative forum is informed by forum non conveniens analysis.see jota,at noting that forum non conveniens analysis on the adequacy of the foreign forum is equally pertinent to international comity analysis see also ford brown,finding that the international comity analysis and the forum non conveniens calculus were intertwined.
here,we decide to abstain based on the strength of our government interests in using the foundation,the strength of the german government interests,and the adequacy of the foundation as an alternative forum.the united states government has consistently supported the foundation as the exclusive forum for the resolution of litigation against german corporations related to their acts during the national socialist era.the president entered into negotiations with the german government and determined that the interests of american citizens,on the whole,would be best served by establishing the foundation agreement the agreement offers monetary compensation to nationals who were used as slave labor and were victims of insurance fraud as well as those deprived of their property.the fund
