factual and procedural history 
on december,john doe,acting as doe guardian ad litem,filed a complaint on her behalf against united and richard samson.the complaint alleged that on august,samson sexually assaulted and molested doe while they were passengers on an airliner operated by united,and that united wrongfully failed to protect doe from samson.the complaint contained a tort claim against samson,and claims for negligence and premises liability against united 
united sought summary judgment on doe claims,contending she could not show that she had suffered bodily injury within the meaning of the treaty known as the warsaw convention,officially entitled convention for the unification of certain rules relating to international transportation by air,stat,eff,warsaw convention,which governs international commercial air travel.the trial court granted summary judgment on may,and entered judgment in united favor on june.
on june,doe filed a motion for a new trial.she submitted a declaration from lilli friedland,a clinical psychologist,who opined that samson assault had caused doe to experience stress disorder ptsd.on july,the trial court ordered a new trial on the ground that friedland declaration constituted n ewly discovered evidence creating a triable issue of fact whether doe had suffered bodily injury code civ,subd.
discussion 
united contends the trial court erred in granting doe motion for a new trial.we agree.as explained below,the trial court properly granted summary judgment,and erred in ordering a new trial.
new trial motion following summary judgment 
generally,a defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the record establishes as a matter of law that none of the plaintiff asserted causes of action can prevail.citation.molko holy spirit cal d.in moving for summary judgment,all that the defendant need do is to show that the plaintiff can not establish at least one element of the cause of example,that the plaintiff can not prove element aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,fn.omitted aguilar.
an order granting summary judgment is properly challenged by a motion for a new trial.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.this is so,even though,strictly speaking,summary judgment is a determination that there shall be no trial at all,quoting green investments,d.the new trial motion may seek reversal of the summary judgment on the ground that there are triable issues of fact.see green investments,supra,d at.in addition,the motion may assert that the summary judgment should be reversed because there is n ewly discovered evidence code civ,subd.scott farrar d.scott.

warsaw convention 
the key issues before us concern the requirements for the recovery of damages under the warsaw convention.the warsaw convention is a treaty of the united states and as such it preempts local laws in the areas in which it applies.citations.the purpose of the warsaw convention is to facilitate international air travel by providing uniform rules for such travel.citation.it provides a limitation of potential liability for international air carriers,and provide s rules to facilitate recovery.citation.airfast services,indonesia superior court d.the parties do not dispute that the warsaw convention provides the exclusive basis for doe claims against united 
article of the warsaw convention,as translated from the original french text,provides the carrier shall be liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger,if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.warsaw convention eff,stat.thus,an air carrier is liable for passenger injury only when a passenger suffers bodily injury in an accident that occurred while on board,embarking,or disembarking.terrafranca virgin atlantic airways,cir,terrafranca.
the leading case concerning the interpretation of the term bodily injury,as used here,is eastern airlines,floyd,d floyd.there,a group of passengers asserted claims against an airline after their airplane suffered engine failure over the atlantic ocean and made an emergency landing.id.at.each passenger sought damages solely for mental distress.ibid.following a careful analysis of the original french text of article,the united states supreme court determined that the french term translated as bodily injury l√©sion corporelle carries a narrow meaning excluding purely mental injurie s,and concluded that an air carrier can not be held liable under article when an accident has not caused a passenger to suffer death,physical injury,or physical manifestation of injury.id.at.
newly discovered evidence 
in ordering a new trial,the trial court determined that friedland declaration constituted newly discovered evidence that doe had suffered bodily injury.generally,a party seeking a new trial on this basis must show that the evidence is newly discovered he or she exercised reasonable diligence in discovering and producing it and it is material to the party case.plancarte guardsmark,llc th,d.if the party showing is clearly lacking in essential particulars,the grant of a new trial is an abuse of discretion.slemons paterson cal d.as we explain below,doe established none of the required elements.
underlying proceedings 
united filed its motion for summary judgment on february.to establish that doe had not suffered any physical injury as the result of samson assault and molestation,united submitted excerpts from doe deposition.according to doe,the misconduct occurred while she was flying to korea after a visit to the united states.she had played tennis strenuously before the flight,and her muscles and right hand were strained and painful.after she fell asleep,she felt pain in her right hand,and awoke to find that the man seated next to her was holding her hand on or near his penis.
doe attributed the pain that awoke her to her strained muscles.when united counsel examined her about her injuries,the following colloquy occurred 
q aside from the psychiatric or psychological counseling and care that you had,did you sustain any physical injury from anything that happened on board this airplane 
q did you have any cuts or bleeding of any kind because of anything that happened on this airplane 
q did you have any bruises of any kind because of anything that happened on board this airplane 
q did you have any injury to either your arm or your hand or any other part of your body as a result of anything that happened on this airplane 
q did you have any pain or discomfort in any part of your body,other than the emotional distress and anxiety,as a result of anything that happened on board this airplane 
doe filed her opposition to the motion on april,and filed supplemental evidence on may,although doe contended there were triable issues whether samson misconduct had injured her physically,none of the evidence she submitted in opposition to summary judgment challenged or contradicted her deposition testimony at the may hearing on united motion,doe counsel asserted that a psychologist had examined doe after the filing of her opposition and concluded that doe suffered from ptsd.doe counsel neither explained why he had not submitted a declaration from the psychologist nor requested a continuance in order to do so.the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment,finding that doe deposition testimony established that samson misconduct had not resulted in any bodily injury to her within the meaning of the warsaw convention.
although doe notice of intention to seek a new trial cited several grounds for a new trial,her motion relied solely on the ground of newly discovered evidence code civ,subd.doe tendered a declaration from friedland,who opined that samson misconduct had had profound effects on doe,including ptsd.friedland further stated ptsd has a physical basis which includes alteration in brain chemistry,physiology and the neurologic al system.attached to the declaration was friedland report on her examination of doe,which disclosed that in examining doe,friedland had reviewed doe medical records,interviewed her,and administered several psychological tests.according to the report,doe ptsd involved depression,anxiety,feelings of estrangement from other people,and an inability to manage her emotions the report also stated that scientific research had tied some of these symptoms to specific changes in the brain and nervous system.
doe motion was also supported by a declaration from her counsel,who stated i was unaware that doe suffered from ptsd or any other specific clinical disorder prior to the expert witness stage of this case.in april i retained friedland as an expert witness in this action.in june friedland provided me with a report in which she concluded that doe suffers from ptsd as a result of the richard samson.
the trial court granted the new trial motion,concluding that friedland declaration was unavailable at the time of the may hearing on the motion for summary judgment,and that the declaration raised a triable issue whether doe had suffered bodily injury within the meaning of the warsaw convention.
reasonable diligence in producing new evidence 
on this record,doe did not display reasonable diligence in tendering her new evidence.generally,when a party seeking a new trial knew,or should have known,about the pertinent evidence before trial but did not exercise due diligence in producing it,the grant of a new trial is error.see schultz mathias d,reversed on another ground in scala jerry witt sons,cal d,fn.nonetheless,as the court explained in scott,a party claiming the discovery of new evidence following summary judgment is held to a less demanding standard of reasonable diligence than a party asserting this claim after trial.scott,supra,d at.there,the party opposing summary judgment deposed a witness for the first time after the hearing on the summary judgment motion,and sought a new trial on the ground that the witness testimony constituted newly discovered evidence.ibid.when the trial court denied a new trial,the appellate court reversed,reasoning that the testimony was unknown to the moving party prior to the deposition,and the date of the deposition had been set shortly after the inception of the action in the regular course of discovery,which the moving party had pursued with reasonable diligence.id.at.
here,unlike scott,the evidence was neither newly discovered nor produced with reasonable diligence.doe counsel knew about friedland opinion at the hearing on the summary judgment motion,yet he neither submitted a declaration from friedland nor sought a continuance in order to do so,despite having submitted other evidence three days before the hearing.moreover,while doe counsel stated he did not engage friedland until april well after united filed its summary judgment motion,he asserted no facts demonstrating that he was unable to obtain a declaration before the may hearing on united motion for summary judgment.nor did he attempt to explain why he failed to seek a continuance in order to present admissible evidence of an opinion of which he was admittedly aware on the date of the summary judgment hearing the trial court thus erred in determining that doe had shown elements and.
materiality of the evidence 
we further conclude that friedland declaration was not material to the ruling on the motion for summary judgment.the mainstream view among federal courts is that floyd does not bar passengers from recovering damages for mental distress caused by physical injuries they sustain in an accident.ehrlich american airlines,cir,in re air crash at little rock cir,air crash.here,we confront a distinct but related issue doe contends that she is entitled to recover for alleged changes to her brain and nervous system tied to ptsd she developed following samson assault.as explained above see pt,ante,friedland declaration stated that ptsd has a physical basis which includes alteration in brain chemistry,physiology and the neurologic al system,and her attached report linked some of ptsd characteristic symptoms with identifiable changes in the brain and nervous system.the key question,therefore,is whether this showing raises a triable issue about the existence of bodily injury within the meaning of the warsaw convention.
following floyd,several courts have addressed the extent to which the physical manifestations and effects of various forms of mental bodily injury for recovery of damages under the warsaw convention.in jack trans world airlines,jack,an airliner experienced an abortive takeoff,crash,and fire.although no passenger died,the incident traumatized many of the passengers.ibid.in the subsequent litigation,the airline sought summary judgment on the claims of the passengers who sought damages for their emotional distress.id.at.
to raise a triable issue regarding bodily injury,the passengers submitted a declaration from a psychiatrist,martin blinder,who opined that their mental distress had intrinsic physical effects.jack,supra.at.the court determined that this declaration did not constitute a showing of bodily injury under floyd blinder comments regarding the physiological component of emotional distress would apply to any near death experience,including that suffered by the plaintiffs in floyd thus,under blinder theory,even the floyd plaintiffs would have survived the supreme court floyd ruling.application of blinder opinion would eviscerate floyd.jack,supra.at see also carey united airlines cir,carey physical manifestations of plaintiff emotional distress did not constitute bodily injury under the warsaw convention.
in terrafranca,supra,the third circuit addressed directly whether ptsd constituted bodily injury.there,the plaintiff and her family were on an international flight when the pilot learned of a bomb threat.id.at.in accordance with the airline protocol,the pilot told the passengers of the threat.ibid.after the plane landed,it was discovered that the threat was a hoax.ibid.the plaintiff sued the airline,alleging that the ordeal had caused her to suffer extreme emotional distress,including ptsd,anorexia,and a loss of desire to socialize,and that she had lost pounds.id.at.
pointing to the statement in floyd that recovery under the warsaw convention is limited to death,physical injury,or physical manifestation of injury floyd,supra,at,the plaintiff contended that her weight loss constituted the requisite physical manifestation of injury.terrafranca,supra,at.the court rejected this contention,reasoning that floyd limited recovery to direct,concrete,bodily injury as opposed to mere manifestation of fear or anxiety.id.at.it thus held that the plaintiff could not obtain damages for her ptsd and other purely psychic injuries,or for her weight loss,which was merely a physical manifestation of her emotional distress.id.at.
the sole court to reach a contrary conclusion did so in a decision later vacated.weaver delta airlines,d,vacated per stipulation april,d weaver there,the plaintiff alleged that she had developed ptsd after the plane on which she was a passenger made an emergency landing.id.at.she offered declarations from two doctors,who stated,respectively,that ptsd has a physical basis that is secondary to alteration in brain chemistry,physiology,and anatomy,and that the emergency landing had physical impacts upon the plaintiff brain and neurologic al system.id.at.finding that the airline had failed to present evidence contradicting the plaintiff assertion of bodily injury,a brain injury,the court granted the plaintiff partial summary judgment on the issue of liability.ibid.
other courts have not followed weaver.in air crash,the eighth circuit reversed a jury verdict in favor of a plaintiff who claimed to have suffered ptsd as a result of a plane crash.air crash,supra,at.the plaintiff evidence had included the testimony of a psychiatrist who opined that the plaintiff had a physical injury to her brain due to her chronic ptsd,and that her brain was not functioning normally as evidenced by lack of sleep and concentration,as well as the flashbacks.id.at.the circuit rejected this evidence as proof of bodily injury.noting that the plaintiff had undergone no tests demonstrating actual physical changes to her brain,the court observed that the only evidence that the plaintiff brain had undergone a physical change was the doctor opinion which,in turn,was based on the plaintiff symptoms of disrupted sleep,reduced concentration and flashbacks.the court concluded that such evidence was not adequate,as a matter of law,to establish physical change to the plaintiff brain.id.at.
the court reached a similar conclusion in bobian csa czech airlines d,bobian.there,the plaintiffs asserted that they had suffered emotional distress after the airliner on which they were passengers flew through severe turbulence.when the airline sought summary judgment,some of the plaintiffs submitted a declaration from a psychologist,who opined that they suffered from ptsd,which had caused biochemical and structural changes to their brains.id.at.in concluding that this declaration failed to raise a triable issue regarding bodily injury,the court stated plaintiffs apparently hope that by recharacterizing ptsd in terms of its effects on the brain,they can escape the controlling effect of terrafranca rejection of claims for ptsd and other purely emotional injuries.but their argument proves far too much.given that all human thoughts and emotions are in some fashion connected with brain activity,and therefore at some level physical,to accept p laintiffs argument would be to break down entirely the barrier between emotional and physical harms that the warsaw convention requires us to maintain.id.at.
the majority rule,as disclosed by our survey of case authority,is that alterations in an individual body and behavior intrinsically or characteristically associated with mental distress do not constitute bodily injury under the warsaw convention.this rule encompasses alterations or changes in an individual brain and nervous system characteristically tied to ptsd.at bottom,the rule rests on the recognition that mental distress typically and regularly manifests itself in an individual brain,nervous system,body,and behavior.accordingly,absent the rule,plaintiffs who suffer mental distress could avoid floyd merely by pointing to changes in their body that characteristically constitute the physical manifestations of their form of distress.under this rationale,weaver,which does not comply with the majority rule,is wrongly decided.we find the rationale compelling,and thus follow the majority rule,rather than the vacated decision in weaver.
here,friedland did not conduct a physical examination of doe,and her declaration and report identify only changes in the brain and nervous system that have been generally associated with some symptoms of ptsd.doe sole authority for her contention that friedland showing raises a triable issue regarding bodily injury is weaver.for the reasons explained above,we reject weaver,and conclude that under the reasoning of air crash and bobian,the showing was inadequate the trial court thus erred in determining that the showing was material to the summary judgment motion,and in ordering a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.
alternative ground for the new trial order 
doe contends that the new trial order was proper on another ground,namely,that samson misconduct,taken by itself,constituted bodily injury under article of the warsaw convention,even if it did not cause any physical injury she argues that her claim against united is predicated on a sexual battery by samson,and thus falls outside the scope of floyd and its progeny,which apply solely to claims for emotional distress where there has been no physical contact.we disagree.as explained above see pt,ante,article of the warsaw convention provides the exclusive basis for doe claims against united.because the warsaw convention is a treaty,the terms of article,as understood by the signatories of the treaty,establish the essential elements for recovery,including bodily injury.floyd,supra,at.
nothing in the language of article suggests that a passenger may recover for physical contact,however offensive,that does not result in some bodily injury,the supreme court held in be understood to include only death,physical injury,or physical manifestation of injury,and to exclude purely mental injuries floyd,supra,at.thus,in salis ghana airways,the plaintiff,who alleged that airline employees had twisted his arm when he tried to board an aircraft,sought damages under article for what he characterized as an assault.the court concluded that summary judgment had been properly granted with respect to this claim because he had failed to show an objective identifiable injury to his body.id.at.again,in morris klm royal dutch airlines,a old female passenger on an international flight awoke and discovered a male passenger touching her thigh from the hip to the knee.the law lords concluded that her claim under article failed for want of a showing of physical injury from the touching.id.at.
the cases doe cites in support of her contention are inapposite.each case addressed the conditions under which misconduct between passengers may constitute an accident for the purpose of establishing an air carrier liability under article,but contained little or no discussion of the issue before us.in wallace korean air cir,a female passenger asleep on a flight awoke to find that the male passenger seated next to her had unbuckled her belt,unzipped and unbuttoned her jeans,and placed his hands in her underpants to fondle her.he removed his hands when she turned away,but soon resumed his touching.ibid.she struck him and then moved away.ibid.following a careful analysis,the second circuit held that the male passenger misconduct constituted an accident within the meaning of article.id.at.in so concluding,it stated we express no opinion on any other aspect of the plaintiff warsaw convention claim.id.at.because an opinion is not authority for an issue not considered therein santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d,wallace provides no support for doe contention that samson sexual battery,taken by itself,constitutes a cognizable injury under article.
in langadinos american airlines,cir,the plaintiff complaint alleged that while he was in an airliner lavatory,another passenger entered the lavatory and grabbed the plaintiff testicles,causing excruciating pain.after the district court sustained a demurrer to the complaint,the first circuit reversed,concluding that the complaint alleged an accident under article.id.at.in a footnote,the first circuit remarked that the complaint also adequately pleaded bodily injury in view of the allegation that the plaintiff had suffered excruciating pain in the groin area after the attack.id.at,fn.here,unlike langadinos,doe herself attributed the pain she felt while samson held her hand to her strenuous tennis,and she testified that she had suffered no physical injury as the result of his conduct.whereas the allegation of pain in langadinos raised the reasonable inference that the battery had injured the plaintiff groin,doe deposition testimony conclusively foreclosed any similar inference from her pain.
finally,in tsevas delta air lines,wl,the plaintiff complaint alleged that an intoxicated male passenger made unwanted romantic and sexual advances to her,including grabbing her,fondling her,attempting to kiss her,and biting her
