kohler,the manufacturer of plumbing products,brought suit for a refund of federal income taxes.it won on summary judgment,d,and the government appeals.
in,kohler decided to build a plant in mexico that it estimated would cost at least million.it needed pesos in order to pay for land,building contractors,and other inputs.how to get them 
now it happened that mexico had defaulted on its foreign debt,and in an effort to restore its credit had adopted an ingenious swap program pioneered by chile.the program entitled a foreign company that wanted to invest in mexico,and therefore needed pesos,to purchase defaulted mexican debt on the open market and then swap it with the mexican government for pesos that could be spent only in mexico rather than exchanged for dollars.international business corporation,swaps how to tap an emerging market.the program enabled the mexican government to retire some of its debt without having to pay hard is,foreign currency,or,what would amount to the same thing,pesos convertible to foreign currency.
bankers trust,the american bank,owned mexican debt in the face amount of million.this debt traded at a substantial discount because of mexico default,fiscal instability,and general lack of creditworthiness.as a result,kohler was able to buy the debt from bankers trust for only million,slightly less than half its par face value.the bank preferred the bird in the hand million dollars to two birds,consisting of claims against the mexican government,very deep in the bush.
kohler knew that under the terms of the swap program the mexican government would swap the million debt that kohler had bought from bankers trust for million worth of pesos as calculated at the then current market exchange rate of pesos to the dollar.the qualification in as calculated at the then current market exchange rate is critical.if for one reason or another that was not the right exchange rate to use for this transaction,the pesos that kohler received may not really have been worth million.that they were worth less is shown by mexico willingness to offer million in pesos for debt that kohler had purchased for only million.mexico had to compensate kohler for accepting pesos that came with restrictions that reduced their dollar value.the pesos had to be spent in mexico on projects approved by the government and could not be freely converted to dollars or other foreign currencies until.so although the market exchange rate was,as we said,pesos to the dollar,kohler received a rate of pesos to the dollar,which is what turned million of dollar debt into million in pesos.kohler did however use all the pesos to pay for real estate and other costs that it incurred in building its plant.
on its federal income tax return it treated the purchase of the debt and its sale to the mexican government as a wash,yielding no taxable income,just as if the government had paid it million in dollars rather than paying it in pesos.the internal revenue service disagreed with this treatment and instead added to kohler taxable income for,the year of the transaction,the difference of million between the price that kohler had paid bankers trust for the mexican debt and million.
one might have thought that the way to account for kohler purchase of mexican debt would have been to add million to the basis of kohler investment in the mexican plant,so that if it ever sold the plant the difference between on the one hand the sale price and on the other hand the sum of million and all the other costs of the plant would be the taxable income attributable to the sale.then if the mexican government purchase of million in debt from kohler for million in pesos was a windfall for kohler,reducing the real cost of the plant,kohler would realize a greater profit from the eventual sale of the plant than it would have realized otherwise,and that profit would be taxable.even if the plant was never sold,the windfall would give kohler higher profits presumably taxable on sales of the plant output because the deductions from taxable income that it could take for depreciation of the cost of the plant would be lessened by the million reduction in its basis.
an alternative way of accounting for the swap would have been to accept kohler argument that the value of the debt that it purchased was unascertainable at the time of purchase and treat the exchange of the debt for the peso account as a swap yielding no taxable income.any capital gains that resulted in the future from kohler use of the pesos to purchase goods and services for its project would be taxable.so if it used the entire amount to buy real estate and construction services before any change in the exchange rate,it would be deemed to have realized a capital gain of million million minus million on the purchase.
still another alternative would be to deem the difference between the two amounts a contribution of capital to kohler enterprise by the mexican government.such a contribution would not be included in kohler gross income,a,though it would be recorded on kohler books as having a zero basis,c,and so could not be depreciated.although this approach was adopted in the nearly identical case of trading commissioner of internal revenue,cir,we are dubious about it.compensation for a specific,quantifiable service can not be classified as a contribution to capital,united states chicago,burlington quincy,d and the mexican government,to the extent it overpaid kohler for the bonds,was buying a service from kohler retirement of a part of mexico foreign debt.see scott shane,a policy toward swaps,pol.econ.stud.morris goldman,conversion a strategy for easing third world debt,heritage foundation reports.
the court in trading thought the purpose of the mexican swap program was to encourage foreign investment in mexico.that was a purpose,but it was secondary to mexico desire to retire its foreign service for which it paid kohler by exchanging dollar debt for pesos.in deciding at what rate to exchange foreign debt for pesos,moreover,mexico ranked projects according to their investment value,and kohler type of project was rated below several others,such as projects designed to privatize state industries.international business corporation,supra,at morgan guarantee trust company,debt equity swaps,world finance markets.the debt held by companies that planned to use their pesos for the investments most favored by the government was redeemed in pesos at par.remember that the par face value of the debt that kohler bought from bankers trust was million,or billion pesos at the market exchange rate of pesos per dollar.kohler was offered only percent of this amount billion pesos.mexico would not have gone out of its way to encourage kohler project had it not been for the opportunity to retire some of its foreign debt.in fact it was decision to build the plant predated the swap approached the mexican government about initiating a swap,rather than vice versa.
no doubt the government motives were mixed,as indicated by the fact that some companies that tendered dollar debt for redemption in pesos were given the less attractive exchange rate of to the dollar,compared to kohler their projects were not the kind of foreign investment that the government especially wished to attract.kohler project was what is called a maquiladora,a project whereby in the usual case a plant imports raw materials into mexico for processing into finished products that are exported.thus,as a further condition of the swap,kohler promised to export at least percent of the output of its plant,which would earn dollars for mexico,which wanted to encourage foreign investment that would build its dollar holdings.that condition doubtless induced the favorable exchange rate that kohler received,and maybe the difference between that rate and the bottom rate of pesos per dollar,translated into dollars,could be considered a contribution to capital by mexico.
there is no need to pursue the issue.the parties have taken none of the paths we laid out.the us as the most practical,as it involves no conjecture.they treat the sale of the mexican debt for the peso account as just taxable with the rule that an exchang
