we consider whether the district court erred in denying choe habeas corpus petition challenging certification of his extradition to the republic of korea.
choe is a korean citizen and a resident of los angeles.in the,he traveled frequently to korea on business,where he was acquainted with important political figures.during one of his visits to korea,choe learned that he was under criminal investigation.choe thereupon left korea in secret and returned to los angeles.after korea requested choe extradition,the united states took him into custody.pursuant to et,magistrate judge marc goldman determined that choe was subject to surrender under the terms of the extradition treaty between the government of the united states of america and the government of the republic of korea,june,treaty,and certified two crimes for extradition choe then petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court summarily denied his petition,relying on the magistrate judge determination that choe is extraditable.choe appeals 
because the district court denied choe petition in a minute order,we review the magistrate judge memorandum and order certifying the crimes for extradition.barapind enomoto,cir en banc per curiam.
acceptance of bribe through good offices 
article of the treaty provides that an offense shall be an extraditable offense if it is punishable under the laws of both nations.treaty.this is known as the dual criminality requirement.clarey gregg,cir.in determining whether korea has satisfied the dual criminality requirement,we consider the totality of the conduct alleged.treaty see also clarey,at the primary focus of dual criminality has always been on the conduct charged the elements of the analogous offenses need not be identical.emami dist.court,cir a ll the principle of dual criminality requires is that the particular acts alleged constitute a crime in both jurisdictions.in re russell,cir t o satisfy the dual criminality requirement,i t is enough that the conduct involved is criminal in both countries.we review de novo the determination that an offense is extraditable.united states van cauwenberghe,cir.
the extradition papers allege that choe improperly influenced the korean government on behalf of alsthom.alsthom submitted a bid to supply the korean government with high speed rail cars for a national rapid transit railway system.the papers allege that choe promised myung soo hwang,who was then the secretary general of the ruling party and a member of the national assembly,a sufficient reward if hwang exerted his influence on alsthom behalf and the bid were successful.alsthom won the contract and promptly paid choe over million choe,in turn,paid hwang approximately.
it clear that this alleged and then paying a bribe to a public official in exchange for an official a crime under law.choe conduct,if committed in the united states,would be punishable under several statutes including b,which makes it illegal to bribe any public official in order to influence his official actions a,which makes it a crime to bribe recipients of federal funds and,which allow for prosecution of individuals who deprive citizens of the honest services of a public official.see united states blumeyer,cir.in short,the totality of the conduct alleged,treaty,is punishable under the laws of both nations,id.
choe nevertheless contends that the offense is extraditable because article of the treaty further requires that the korean and laws be substantially analogous.choe argues that the korean law under which he has been of bribe through good offices is substantially analogous to any law.the korean statute provides any person who receives,demands or promises any money or interest in connection with a mediation of matters belonging to the duties of the public official,shall be punished choe points out that this language seems to criminalize conduct that we would consider mere lobbying.according to choe,the vague phrase in connection with a mediation of matters belonging to the duties of the public official is broad enough to cover the activities of a lobbyist who helps provide access to public officials in a legitimate attempt to influence their official actions.
but choe misconceives the meaning of the term substantially analogous.just three months before the treaty was signed,we adopted the following definition w hen the laws of both the requesting and the requested party appear to be directed to the same basic evil,the statutes are substantially analogous.clarey,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.korea statute is directed to the same basic evil as our bribery laws,namely,the corruption of public officials.the fact that the korean law is broader than ours,and thus punishes conduct that would not be unlawful here,is of no consequence,so long as the particular conduct choe is charged with is prohibited in both countries.id.
choe further contends that the united states has established probable cause that he committed the acts with which he charged.the treaty requires such information as would provide reasonable grounds to believe that the person sought has committed the offense for which extradition is requested.treaty c.the magistrate judge found that the united states satisfied this requirement,and we must uphold that finding if competent evidence supports it.zanazanian united states,cir.
the magistrate judge memorandum and order discusses the extensive evidence that alsthom paid choe million for his services,but does mention any evidence that choe promised hwang a reward,that choe gave hwang anything,or even that choe met with hwang.though the extradition papers accuse choe of doing these things,accusations are not evidence.see in re sauvage.this failure is particularly significant because the korean prosecutor who prepared the extradition papers had before him the complete statement of ki choon ho,choe alleged accomplice in the crime,yet there no indication in the papers that ho implicated choe in bribing hwang.
to be sure,the magistrate judge had evidence that choe may have committed some violation of the acceptance of bribe through good offices statute.that statute prohibited choe from receiv ing alsthom money in connection with a mediation of matters belonging to the duties of the public official,so it likely that choe violated the korean law the moment he allegedly took alsthom money,whether or not he then paid any of it over to hwang.but the treaty is satisfied by proof that choe probably committed some violation of the statute it requires probable cause that choe committed the particular acts of which he accused,namely,bribing hwang.see treaty c see also extradition requires evidence sufficient to sustain the charge leveled against the fugitive emphasis added quinn robinson,cir section requires probable cause to believe the accused committed the particular charged offense.
because there no competent evidence to support the magistrate judge finding of probable cause that choe committed the particular acts for which extradition is requested,treaty c,we reverse the district court denial of habeas corpus as to this offense 
stowaway control act 
choe petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeks relief from the magistrate judge certification for choe violation of the stowaway control act and,curiously,the parties discuss this issue at length in their briefs.but the magistrate judge did not certify this offense for extradition,so korea ca prosecute choe for it,see treaty a,infra,and the united states ca appeal the magistrate judge adverse determination,see united states doherty,cir.the issue is thus not properly before us and we do not consider it.
offering bribe 
after korean authorities launched an investigation into choe lobbying activities,choe allegedly bribed a korean police officer,yoon ki jeon,to exert his influence to close the investigation.such conduct,if proven,would violate a korean statute titled offering bribe.choe concedes that this is an extraditable offense but claims that the evidence does not support probable cause.as discussed above,see supra,the treaty requires such information as would provide reasonable grounds to believe t
