introduction 
oliver willmer oliver appeals from an order confirming registration of a german judgment for child and spousal support.he argues that there is no reciprocity between germany and the united states regarding child and spousal support orders,that principles of comity do not apply,and that the german judgment is invalid because it was fraudulently obtained and the german court lacked jurisdiction over him.we affirm.
procedural and factual background 
oliver and katina willmer katina were both born in germany.in,they lived in canada and were involved in a relationship.they moved to germany in december,but were married in canada in august.the couple child was born in germany in january.
the relationship ended in october,while the couple lived in germany.oliver indicated in his declaration that both parties were represented by german legal counsel i n the ensuing days after katina moved out of the couple home on october,and all correspondence was exchanged via this route.during november and december,oliver sought the assistance of the german child services agency to establish visitation with his daughter.he indicated that he was u nable to make arrangements to see his daughter and settle any issues with regards to child support,recovery and division of assets,and never received any form of divorce or support orders.oliver returned to canada to begin a new employment position on january.
on march,the bad schwalbach district court in germany entered a default judgment,in which it ordered oliver to pay deutsch marks per month in child support,and deutsch marks per month in spousal support.the judgment indicated that oliver present residence was unknown.
on april,the contra costa county department of child support services department filed a notice of registration of the german judgment,a prerequisite to enforcing it in california under the uniform interstate family support act,et.uifsa oliver resides in contra costa county,and was served with the pleadings.katina and the minor live in germany.
the related german court documents filed by the department indicated that the parties were d ivorced on november.the support obligations were restated in euros and dollars,indicating that child support was per month,spousal support was per month,and that oliver was in arrears in the amount of.
oliver filed a request for a hearing to contest registration of the support order.he sought cancellation of the registration claiming that the german court had no jurisdiction over him,the support order was obtained by fraud,katina had actively hidden the child from him since october,and the support sought included spousal support.
at the hearing on june,oliver attorney also argued that,because the march,german judgment stated that oliver residence was unknown,oliver had not received notice and therefore his due process rights were violated.the court continued the hearing,ordered the department to obtain from the german court the judicial basis of the judgment or order that was entered against willmer,and suspended enforcement of the support order pending a determination of the validity of the judgment.
the department obtained additional documentation from the german central authority,indicating that oliver was served with the order and judgment by publication under german law.the german central authority also indicated that the german court had jurisdiction because the family last habitual residence was in germany.
in an order filed november,the november order,the court held that the german court had jurisdiction to enter the support order and the order was valid and enforceable.this timely appeal followed.
of foreign judgments 
oliver argues that the german judgment may not be enforced in california under the uifsa because germany is not a foreign reciprocating country,and only the secretary of state may declare whether a foreign country is reciprocating for the purpose of enforcing support orders.he also claims that the german judgment may not be enforced under principles of comity because there is no specific authority for the family law court to enforce a decree for support from a foreign nation he is mistaken.
the uifsa authorizes a procedure by which a foreign judgment for child or spousal support may be enforced in california.the uifsa was enacted in,as required by the federal personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of prwora.the uifsa governs,inter alia,the enforcement of child and spousal support orders from another state,subd.s.state is defined to include a foreign jurisdiction that has enacted a law or established procedures for issuance and enforcement of support orders which are substantially similar to the procedures under this chapter,the uniform reciprocal enforcement of support act,or the revised uniform reciprocal enforcement of support act,subd.s.under prwora,the united states secretary of state is authorized to make federal declarations of reciprocity for child support establishment and enforcement.caswell,international child fam.the secretary of state has not yet declared germany a reciprocating country under the prwora pub.notice fr.nevertheless,prwora provides that individual states are expressly authorized to enter into their own arrangements with foreign jurisdictions up until such time as countries are declared foreign reciprocating countries under the act.caswell,international child,supra,fam.at.
section provides that the california attorney general may declare the foreign jurisdiction to be a reciprocating state for purposes of establishing and enforcing support obligations when he or she is satisfied that reciprocal provisions will be made by a foreign jurisdiction for the establishment of support orders for obligees in california,or for enforcement of support orders made within this state.germany has enacted the act for the recovery of maintenance in relations with foreign states as the official reciprocating act dehart,comity,conventions,and the constitution state and federal initiatives in international support enforcement fam,fn.thus,the california attorney general has declared that the federal republic of germany is a reciprocating state.id.at see historical note,west civ.proc.ed.foll.former.
therefore,contrary to oliver contention in his brief,the uifsa authorizes enforcement of a foreign judgment for child or spousal support in california,and germany is a reciprocating state for purposes of the uifsa.consequently,the german judgment is enforceable under the provisions of the uifsa.
validity of german support order 
oliver next maintains that the german order is invalid because the german court had no jurisdiction over him.he also claims the order was obtained by fraud because katina await ed oliver leaving the country to begin proceedings against him to avoid the niceties of personal jurisdiction and notice the uifsa provides that these two claims are grounds for challenging registration of a foreign support order.section provides that the obligor may challenge registration of a foreign support order if the issuing tribunal lacked personal jurisdiction over the contesting party.the order was obtained by fraud,subd.a.the contesting party has the burden of proving these defenses,subd.a.
oliver argues the trial court erred in finding that the german court had jurisdiction over him,claiming he is neither a german resident nor a german citizen.he also asserts that the german court had no jurisdiction over him because his habitual residence was not in germany.
the german central authority provided documentation regarding personal jurisdiction in family support matters under german law.under section of the german code of civil procedure,german courts have jurisdiction if one of the parties is german or has habitual place of residence in germany.the german court also has jurisdiction in the judicial district of which the child has its legal domicile or,if the child has no legal domicile,its habitual place of residence in germany.in this case,the german authorities found that the family had its last habitual residence in germany.ibid.
oliver asserts that there was no proof that his temporary residence i
