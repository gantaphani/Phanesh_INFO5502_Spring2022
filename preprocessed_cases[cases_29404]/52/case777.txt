this appeal presents three questions whether it is constitutional to prosecute a wife for harboring her fugitive husband or for being an accessory after the fact to his crime whether the federal proscription against harboring a fugitive confers jurisdiction even if the harboring occurs outside the united states and whether an accessory indictment that fails to specify the principal crime is legally sufficient.because we hold that the answer to the first two questions is yes and the answer to the third question is no,we affirm patricia king hill harboring conviction but reverse her accessory conviction.
facts and procedural history 
this case arises from one man efforts to avoid paying more than in child support.in,charlie hill charlie divorced his wife,victoria,in new mexico.as part of the divorce decree,charlie acknowledged that he was the father of two children born of the union and agreed to pay victoria per month for their support.despite this agreement,he has made no voluntary support payments since.
in november,charlie married the defendant appellant,patricia king hill hill,an attorney and of substantial means.the hills lived in france and luxembourg before settling on a ranch in umpqua,oregon.in,just two years into their marriage,charlie unpaid obligation caught up with the couple when the irs garnished part of their joint tax refund because of charlie child support arrears.
in,victoria filed suit in new mexico to collect the child support that charlie owed her.when charlie failed to appear and respond to that state order to show cause,the court found him in contempt.in december,hill witnessed charlie arrest on this contempt warrant.indeed,hill posted charlie bail and then retained counsel to defend the suit brought by victoria,which by then had yielded a default judgment against charlie.
in may,two department of health human services investigators attempted to interview charlie at the oregon ranch concerning his failure to pay child support.while there,the investigators informed both charlie and hill that the matter was now being investigated as a potential violation of federal criminal law.
charlie fled to mexico soon after the investigators visit.before doing so,he told a ranch hand,in hill presence,that he was fleeing because of the child support charges.shortly thereafter,hill listed her oregon ranch for sale and began looking for similar property in mexico.the couple located property in june,and hill purchased it in august.
hill subsequently invested in improving the mexican ranch property,where charlie lives and works.in addition,between may and december,hill wired money to charlie in mexico and transferred money from her personal account to the couple joint account so that charlie would have something to withdraw.
on october,a federal judge in oregon signed a criminal complaint charging charlie with a misdemeanor violation of child support recovery act.an arrest warrant issued the same day.a week later,on october,a federal agent who did not know that charlie had fled to mexico returned to the hills oregon ranch in order to arrest him.the agent did not apprise hill of the outstanding warrant,and she refused to divulge charlie location.
in december,agents again visited hill at her oregon ranch,and she again refused to divulge her husband whereabouts.by this time,however,she had been informed that there was a misdemeanor warrant for charlie arrest.agents served hill with a subpoena commanding her to appear before a grand jury on december.
the night before her scheduled appearance,hill met with steve kimball,one of her former ranch hands,at a local restaurant.during that meeting,hill asked kimball if he would drive a truck and trailer to a destination that she would name later if she and her husband paid all of his expenses.kimball agreed.
when she appeared the next morning before the grand jury,hill refused to answer questions,invoking both her right against and the privilege not to testify against one spouse.as soon as she finished,she flew to chicago and then to mexico,where she joined charlie.
later that same day,the grand jury indicted charlie for felony violation of the deadbeat parents punishment act of and a felony warrant was issued for his arrest.by the time federal agents tried to notify hill of this,however,she was gone.accordingly,they notified four other people hill business attorney in chicago,her criminal defense attorney in eugene,steven kimball,and vicki powell,who looked after the house for the hills.all were requested to inform hill of charlie felony indictment and the warrant for his arrest at their first opportunity.vicki powell later testified that she did so during the first or second week of.
sometime in the first few days of january,charlie contacted kimball and told him that hill wanted him to drive the couple truck,trailer,pets and belongings to the mexican border.hill later called her business partner in illinois and asked him to send a cashier check to kimball in oregon.when kimball received the check via federal express on january,he notified the federal agents with whom he was then cooperating.a few days later,on january,a federal judge in oregon signed a criminal complaint charging hill with being an accessory after the fact,and a warrant issued for her arrest as well.
sometime after january,but,according to vicki powell,after she had informed hill of the felony warrant for charlie arrest,kimball embarked on his trip to mexico along the way,kimball had second thoughts about cooperating with the government.accordingly,while talking by phone with charlie,who had flown with hill from morelia,mexico,to hermosillo,mexico,to meet him at the border,kimball told charlie that federal agents were following him.at that point,hill took over the negotiations with kimball and tried to persuade him to deliver the truck,trailer,and belongings to one of the hills associates and to fly back to oregon using a ticket they would purchase on his behalf.the associate refused to become involved,however,so kimball turned the truck around and drove back to oregon pursuant to law enforcement advice.while the hills were waiting for kimball to deliver their belongings and were negotiating with him,a deputy marshal spoke with hill and entreated her to come across the border and retrieve her pets and belongings.hill declined,saying she could not drive such a large truck.
on january,hill flew from mexico to the cayman islands to look into setting up a bank account that would be safe from government forfeiture.two days later,police arrested hill when her return flight made a stopover in miami.there she spent five days in jail before disclosing the address of her ranch in mexico and being released.
after hill waived her right to a jury trial,the district court convicted her of both of the charged counts harboring a fugitive and being an accessory after the fact she was sentenced to three years of probation,no fine,no time in custody,and was told that the court would look favorably upon a motion to terminate her probation should charlie return to face the charges against him.
as of july,charlie remained at large in mexico hill appeals her convictions.
analysisa.hill constitutional challenge 
hill first argues that the harboring and accessory statutes are unconstitutional as applied to her because they criminalize conduct in which she is entitled to engage under the first and fifth amendments to the constitution.specifically,hill alleges that the statutes impermissibly infringe upon her rights of association,marriage,privacy,and due process.we find no merit in hill constitutional challenge,which we review de novo 
hill relies on griswold connecticut in griswold,the supreme court stated that the marriage relationship lies within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.accordingly,courts must examine carefully the importance of the governmental interests advanced and the extent to which they are served by laws that operate directly on an intimate relation of husband and wife,or laws that slic e deeply into the family because freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the due process clause.from this unassailable general proposition,hill proceeds directly to the conclusion that the harboring and accessory statutes unconstitutionally intrude upon her marriage.this leap of logic is unwarranted.
the mere fact that a statute affects the marriage relationship does not mean that the statute runs afoul of griswold.the problems in griswold were that the statute operated directly on an intimate relation of the marriage and sought to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon the marital relationship,thus sweep ing unnecessarily broadly.the issue is whether the harboring and accessory statutes do the same in this case.
the harboring and accessory statutes prohibit,among other things,providing shelter,material support,assistance and comfort to a criminal or fugitive.providing such to a spouse is the norm in the context of,it is expected and integral to the relationship.thus,caring for a spouse in the normal and expected manner could provide a basis for liability under the harboring and accessory statutes.similarly,the statutes might create an incentive for terminating such normal care and support,in order to avoid liability.thus,the statutes could conceivably operate directly on an intimate relation of a marriage and exert a maximum destructive impact upon it.in other words,basing a harboring or accessory conviction on normal and expected spousal conduct might well violate griswold.
however,it does not follow that griswold categorically bars harboring or accessory liability based on conduct between spouses.unlike the griswold statute,the harboring and accessory statutes do not sweep unnecessarily broadly.harboring and accessory liability is limited to conduct intended to prevent the fugitive discovery or arrest,or to hinder or prevent the fugitive apprehension,trial or judgment.thus,by their terms,the harboring and accessory statutes reach only conduct that is intended to frustrate law enforcement this conceptually simple proposition does not readily yield an easily applied rule for deciding cases,however,because intent is generally inferred from conduct.thus,the core griswold issue in the context of harboring and accessory liability is where lies the line between conduct that is normal spousal support and sharing of resources,and conduct that demonstrates an intent to frustrate law enforcement.
fortunately,we need not,and do not,decide this question here.hill provision of shelter,employment,money,food and other material support to charlie after he fled to mexico,and while hill and charlie attempted to orchestrate kimball delivery of their possessions to mexico,was intended to assist charlie in evading discovery or apprehension by law enforcement officials.in short,there can be no doubt that hill intended to frustrate law enforcement efforts.accordingly,we hold that the harboring and accessory statutes are not unconstitutional as applied to hill.because this is not a close case where we need to fully reconcile the harboring and accessory statutes with griswold,we leave that task for another day.
harboring conviction 
in addition to her constitutional challenge,hill assails her harboring conviction based on insufficiency of the evidence and on jurisdictional grounds.we reject these challenges as well.
sufficiency of evidence.
the harboring statute that hill was convicted of violating,requires proof of four elements first,proof that a federal warrant had been issued for the fugitive arrest.second,that the appellant had knowledge that a warrant had been issued third,that the appellant actually harbored or concealed the fugitive.finally,that appellant intended to prevent the fugitive discovery or arrest.there is sufficient evidence to support hill harboring conviction if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found those essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt we hold that the evidence meets this standard.
that a felony arrest warrant was issued for charlie is beyond peradventure.when hill found out about it is less clear.the district court found that hill learned of charlie felony indictment during the first week of january.nonetheless,hill contends without citation to the record that the government was unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that prior to january,hill was aware that a felony warrant against hill had issued.the only evidence we are able to find regarding timing is a statement by vicki powell that she apprised hill of the felony warrant sometime around the first or second week of january,before kimball left in the truck.accordingly,we assume for the sake of argument that,to prove hill guilty of felony harboring,the government needed to prove that she harbored her husband after january.the government did so.
hill is correct that to have harbored or concealed her husband,she must have done more than give him money.although supplying funds may make one an accessory after the fact,s upplying financial assistance to a fugitive does not rise to the level of harboring or concealing.courts draw a distinction,however,between paying money to a fugitive so that he may shelter,feed or hide himself,which is not harboring and providing that shelter,food,or aid directly,which is harboring.a ny physical act of providing assistance,including food,shelter,and other assistance to aid the fugitive in avoiding detection and apprehension will make out a violation of section.
there is evidence that hill provided charlie food,shelter,and other assistance after january.on january,hill paid to the araiza inn,a hotel in hermosillo,mexico,where she and charlie had stayed and dined for the two previous days.while in hermosillo,hill rented a car so she and charlie could get around.if hill had done these things in cancun,mexico,a vacation area far from the border,it would be more difficult to characterize these actions as harboring her husband because it would be very hard to show that they were done for the purpose of preventing his discovery or arrest.but hill chose a border town,and she chose that town for a reason.the evidence showed that charlie and hill went together to hermosillo to collect their pets and belongings,which hill had previously arranged for kimball to drive down from oregon.in other words,hill provided charlie with food and shelter in northern mexico so that he would not have to go back to the united states to retrieve their belongings himself,and she did so after she knew there was a felony warrant for his arrest.in light of this evidence,hill conviction for harboring was sufficiently supported.
extraterritorial application of the harboring statute.
because hill harbored her husband in mexico,we must decide whether the united states has extraterritorial jurisdiction to prosecute her.united states teaches that it does.in,we considered whether the united states had extraterritorial jurisdiction over a defendant who was charged with being an accessory after the fact to the kidnapping and murder of a dea agent in mexico.we held that to determine whether a given statute has extraterritorial application,we examine the statute text for any indication that congress intended it to apply extraterritorially and compliance with principles of international law we also determined that if the underlying substantive statute applies extraterritorially,the statute also applies extraterritorially when invoked in connection with an extraterritorial violation of the underlying statute.
we discern no meaningful difference between hill harboring offense and the offenses of being an accessory after the fact,aiding and abetting,and conspiracy,all of which have been deemed to confer extraterritorial jurisdiction to the same extent as the offenses that underlie them accordingly,if there is extraterritorial jurisdiction over violations of,the deadbeat parents punishment act,then there is extraterritorial jurisdiction over hill harboring offense.
title does not explicitly state that the united states has jurisdiction over anyone who violates the statute outside its borders.however,a,which makes it a punish
