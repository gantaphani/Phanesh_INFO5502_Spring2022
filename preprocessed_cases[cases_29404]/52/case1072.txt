this court issued an osc in response to this petition for writ of mandate because it presents an issue of some public importance that has not yet been squarely faced by a california state court,in a published opinion,in this particular context the question of whether a japanese manufacturer can be served under california law simply by serving the japanese manufacturer american subsidiary.the trial court ruled that a japanese manufacturer could indeed be validly served that way.the method just seemed too easy a way to get around the hague service convention and we scheduled an osc on the petition to give us the chance to study the issue.
on review,however,it turns out that,yes,it really is that easy and not only that,there is nothing this court,as a matter of california common law,can do about it.we are a court under authority,and there is a,california supreme court case,cosper smith wesson arms cal d,that makes service on the california representative of a foreign parent is,valid as to the foreign california law.and not only that,but there is a federal united states supreme court case,volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft schlunk,supra,d schlunk,that says when service is valid under state law on the american subsidiary of a foreign manufacturer,there is no need to serve papers in accord with the hague service convention.accordingly,we have no choice but to deny the petition for writ of mandate.
background 
the plaintiff was allegedly injured when he was out riding on a yamaha rhino on his birthday.his complaint includes two defendants which we will call and.
plaintiff served and also sought to serve by serving through agent for service of process.his theory was and is that is general manager in this state.
filed a motion to quash service,arguing that is only a subsidiary of,not general manager in california,and therefore service should have been made through the hague service convention.at the very least,serving through the hague service convention would have meant incurring the expense of translating the pleadings into japanese.see honda motor superior court th,d petitioner correctly points out that the service is also flawed by the omission of a japanese translation.plaintiff admits that the central authority for japan requires that documents served under the convention be accompanied by a japanese translation.
here are the undisputed facts about relationship to is wholly owned domestic subsidiary in the united states.principal business is to act as the exclusive importer and distributor of yamaha vehicles,including the rhino in this case,manufactured by.provides the warranty and owner manuals for yamaha vehicles.conducts testing,including suitability testing,for yamaha vehicles.provides marketing for yamaha vehicles and receives all customer complaints and accident reports for the united states involving yamaha vehicles.finally,annual report describes as regional headquarters for north america.
the trial court denied the motion,reasoning that is general manager in this state.then filed this petition for writ of mandate,and it is supported by a brief from the association of international automobile manufacturers.
ii.discussion 
federal law makes the validity of the service dependent on state law 
rarely do lower courts have a precedent from a higher court as close on the facts as the united states supreme court of schlunk to the case before us.in schlunk,a plaintiff sued both volkswagen of america or vwoa as described in the opinion and volkswagen aktiengesellschaft or vwag as described in the opinion in illinois state court for defects in the automobile that contributed to the plaintiff parents deaths in an accident.more specifically,the plaintiff successfully served,got back an answer denying that had designed or assembled the car in question,so he then amended his complaint to add as a defendant.the plaintiff then attempted to serve the amended complaint on by serving as agent.schlunk,supra,at.
made a special and limited appearance to quash service.the illinois state trial court denied the motion on the ground that,under illinois state law,the fact that and were so closely related that was agent for service of process as a matter of law,even though had not appointed as its agent.schlunk,supra,at.the illinois intermediate appellate court agreed,holding that,under illinois law,was involuntary agent for service of process.it further held that serving by serving did not violate the hague service convention.ibid.when the illinois state supreme court refused to take the case,petitioned the united states supreme court,and it granted certiorari to address the issue,which the federal high court noted had given rise to disagreement among the lower courts.id.at.
the federal supreme court framed the issue as whether an attempt to serve process on a foreign corporation by serving its domestic subsidiary which,under state law,is the foreign corporation involuntary agent for service of process was compatible with the convention on service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters,hague service convention.the federal high court then agreed with the illinois state courts and answered yes.see schlunk,supra,at.the issue and the answer.
the hague service convention applies where there is and this is the precise language from the treaty occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.
now,one might think that in any case where a foreign person had an agent for service of process in another country that there would still be occasion to transmit the is a judicial document to the foreign person in his,her or its home all,he,she or it is going to have read the document there,so the convention should still apply.
no.the united states supreme court rejected that precise argument in schlunk,reasoning that if service,under state law,did not necessarily require transmittal of the relevant documents,the hague service convention simply was not implicated.because,under illinois law,there was no necessity to send any documents abroad to complete service even though,as a practical matter,they would be sent anyway,the convention did not apply,and the service on as agent for was proper.
if california law were the same as illinois law,we could end this opinion here.we have a united states supreme court case construing federal law,on all fours.but,of course,the two states do not have identical statutes and common law construing those statutes,so we now turn to whether california law,like illinois law in schlunk,provides for proper service of process on a foreign corporation by serving its domestic subsidiary which,under state law,is the foreign corporation involuntary agent for service of process.schlunk,supra,at.as we shall see,the answer is yes.
california law allows service on a foreign corporation by serving its domestic subsidiary 
the relevant statutes 
the first of california service of process statutes is section of the code of civil procedure,which expressly contemplates that the rules governing summonses are subject to the provisions of the hague service convention 
we pause for a moment to note that subject to does not mean pursuant to the rules of.if the legislature wanted all service on foreign nationals to be pursuant to the procedures of the hague service convention,it could have said so.it did it merely recognized that treaties trump conflicting state law,mitsubishi materials superior court th,d state law allowing former pows to sue successors of japanese companies who exploited them as slave labor in world war ii conflicted with treaty that ended hostilities between the two countries.
code of civil procedure section governs how to serve corporations.it says that service on a corporation may be made if authorized by any provision in section of the corporations code or sections to,inclusive,of the corporations code,as in effect on december,with respect to corporations to which they remain applicable.
corporations code section says that delivery by hand of a copy of any process to the general manager in this state of a foreign corporation shall constitute valid service on the corporation.
