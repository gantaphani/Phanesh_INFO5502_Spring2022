factual background 
nayeem mehtab chowdhury chowdhury or plaintiff,who is the managing director of worldtel bangladesh worldtel ltd and a stockholder and officer of world communications investments wcii,instituted this suit against his former business associate,amjad hossain khan khan and one of khan businesses,worldtel bangladesh holding wbh.at all times relevant to this appeal,chowdhury and khan were citizens of bangladesh with legal permanent resident lpr status in the united states.prior to the events giving rise to the current dispute,two of their businesses wbh and wcii jointly controlled a third entity,world bangladesh ltd wbl,with both chowdhury and khan serving as members on its board of directors.at trial,chowdhury,who was wbl managing director,testified that wbl had a year license to provide a full range of telecommunications services in bangladesh,with projected profits estimated to be in excess of a hundred million dollars.joint app x.
in,at chowdhury initiative,wbl issued new shares and took out additional debt,with the effect of reducing the interest that wbh controlled by khan had in wbl,from fifty percent to less than one percent.khan claims that chowdhury employed improper corporate procedures and forged various signatures,including khan,in order to effect this change.khan thereafter filed several official complaints against chowdhury in bangladesh,petitioning over agencies and divisions of the bangladeshi government for an official investigation of chowdhury actions.
khan first complained to the chief metropolitan magistrate in bangladesh and to the criminal investigative department of the ministry of home affairs,each of which declined to pursue khan complaint after an independent investigation khan next sought redress in with the directorate general of forces intelligence dgfi,an intelligence agency connected to the military.following this complaint,in the summer of,chowdhury was summoned before the dgfi with khan present and detained for days,without charges and without access to anyone outside his room of confinement.chowdhury testified at trial that he was released without any violence against his person during this period of detention by the dgfi.
however,chowdhury also testified that on november,the rapid action battalion rab,a paramilitary unit of the bangladesh national police to which khan had also complained,arrested chowdhury and held him,without any charges,until november.at trial,chowdhury stated that during this second period of confinement,from november to,the rab tortured him,at khan direction,in order to force him to turn over his business interests in bangladesh to khan.chowdhury further stated that,during his confinement by the rab,he was blindfolded and handcuffed before electric shocks were applied to his thigh and arms through the use of an unidentified prodding device.chowdhury testified that he was then lifted off his feet and suspended from the prison door by his handcuffs.he also stated in trial testimony that his interrogators told him they were acting at the behest of bahdi,which is a bangla word for khan.joint app x.
chowdhury testified that he was subsequently transferred out of the rab custody and into the custody of the dhaka central jail for medical treatment stemming from injuries sustained during the rab interrogation.chowdhury also testified that,after the medical treatment,he was held for a further five months in jail before being released without any lasting medical symptoms aside from continuing nightmares.
chowdhury parents testified that they,and other family members,met with khan during chowdhury detention by the rab.the circumstances of that meeting were disputed at trial.chowdhury parents stated that khan asked to see them and told them,upon meeting,that chowdhury had been subjected to electric shock interrogation khan was present for the interrogation and khan could make the interrogations stop if chowdhury agreed to transfer his business interests to khan and leave bangladesh entirely.chowdhury parents testified that they refused to agree to these alleged demands.in contrast,khan testified that chowdhury parents requested the meeting and subsequently asked him to withdraw the charges he had filed with bangladesh authorities against chowdhury which he refused to do.khan also flatly denied seeing chowdhury during his detention,having any influence over his treatment in detention,or offering to release chowdhury if he agreed to transfer his business interests to khan.there is no dispute that chowdhury refused to transfer his interest in wbl and remains its managing director.
procedural history 
on april,chowdhury,worldtel ltd,and wcii jointly,plaintiffs filed a complaint against khan and wbh jointly,defendants,alleging that khan subjected chowdhury to torture.on this basis,plaintiffs brought claims under the alien tort statute ats,and the torture victim protection act of tvpa,stat,note following u,seeking monetary damages,punitive damages,and injunctive relief.in pressing these claims,plaintiffs alleged that defendants directly committed violations cognizable under the two statutes,as well as aided and abetted bangladesh authorities in violations of the same.defendants moved,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,to dismiss the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.upon review,the district court dismissed with prejudice all claims by the plaintiff corporations chowdhury aiding and abetting claims under both the ats and tvpa and chowdhury tvpa claim against wbh.chowdhury worldtel bangladesh holding,d.the district court dismissed chowdhury remaining claims those alleging that his interrogation by the rab constituted direct violations by khan of both certain customary international law norms actionable in federal court under the ats and of the tvpa and granted chowdhury leave to replead.id.
on january,chowdhury,as the sole plaintiff,filed an amended complaint alleging only that the defendants engaged in conduct prohibited,or otherwise made actionable,by the ats and tvpa.specifically,chowdhury alleged that khan caused the rab to torture him through electrical shocks and painful shackled standing and offered to prevent future torture in exchange for control over wbl.
the parties then conducted discovery,which concluded on may.the case proceeded to trial on august.the jury,on august,returned a general verdict form in favor of chowdhury in which it concluded that khan and wbh were liable for torture.it found khan and wbh liable for million in compensatory damages and khan alone liable for in punitive damages.the jury further determined that wbh should not be held liable for punitive damages.
following the jury verdict,defendants brought a motion pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and a seeking judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative,a new trial.the district court denied the motion,concluding that the evidence at trial was not only legally sufficient to present the case to the jury,but one sided in plaintiff favor.chowdhury worldtel bangladesh holding,civ.bmc,wl,at.the district court also noted that the jury could have reasonably determined from testimony not only that khan had knowledge that chowdhury was being tortured,but also that the rab was acting at the behest of khan and that khan attended the torture id.overall,the district court concluded that under a theory of agency or conspiracy,t he facts set forth were more than sufficient to permit the jury to infer that defendant had a deal with the torturers to extract business concessions from chowdhury by doing what they do best.id.
in considering the motion,the district court also rejected multiple evidentiary challenges by defendants.as relevant here,defendants contended that chowdhury should not have been allowed to testify regarding statements by rab agents that they were torturing him at khan direction.id.at.in dismissing this challenge,the district court concluded that the statement was properly admitted as the statement of an agent or because the jury could reasonably infer that the reason the rab let chowdhury know why they were torturing him was to induce surrender which would further the aims of the agency and conspiracy.id.
the district court entered judgment in favor of chowdhury on august,and denied defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law on september.
this appeal followed.after oral argument on february,our resolution of the appeal was held in abeyance pending the supreme court review of another ats case from this circuit,kiobel royal dutch petroleum,cir.on october,the supreme court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari in kiobel to consider whether the law of nations recognizes corporate liability.see kiobel royal dutch petroleum,d kiobel.following oral argument on february,the supreme court,on march,restored the case to its calendar for reargument on the additional question of w hether and under what circumstances the ats allows courts to recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than the united states.kiobel royal dutch petroleum,d order directing supplemental briefing and reargument.reargument was held on october,and on april,the supreme court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals,but on different grounds,holding that the presumption against applies to claims under the ats,and that relief under the ats for violations of the law of nations occurring outside the united states is barred.at.the kiobel action having concluded,we directed the parties in the instant appeal to submit supplemental briefing on the impact,if any,of the supreme court decision in kiobel.we now address their arguments.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,defendants raise four principal arguments chowdhury ats claims against both khan and wbh must be dismissed under the supreme court holding in kiobel due to their nature under the general verdict rule,chowdhury tvpa claim against khan must also be dismissed chowdhury tvpa claim ought to be dismissed because the underlying conduct was extraterritorial and did not constitute actionable torture,and because the claim was predicated on improper agency theories of liability and chowdhury testimony regarding the rab statements constituted hearsay under federal rule of evidence and was improperly admitted because it was unfairly prejudicial.we consider these arguments in turn.
standards of review 
we review de novo a denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.see highland capital mgmt.lp schneider,cir.in undertaking this review,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against which the motion was made and draw all reasonable inferences regarding the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses in favor of the id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we review a district court denial of a rule motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion.see united states rigas,cir see also in re sims,cir explaining that the term of art abuse of discretion includes errors of law,clearly erroneous assessments of the evidence,or decisions that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions internal quotation marks omitted.we explain the relevant standard of review regarding khan challenge to the admission of statements in our discussion of that issue.
ats claims 
defendants first argue that the judgment entered against them pursuant to the ats must be reversed in light of the supreme court recent ruling in kiobel.the unique history and purpose of the ats has been described at length by the supreme court,by the lower courts,and by scholars,and need not be reiterated here the ats provides original jurisdiction in the federal district courts over any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.in sosa alvarez machain,sosa,the supreme court recognized that the ats is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action,but that it indicates congressional intent that the common law would provide a cause of action for a modest number of international law violations based on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the paradigms familiar to those who enacted the statute.sosa,at see also id.at explaining that the ats,although a grant of jurisdiction,carries with it an opportunity to develop common law.
while this appeal was pending,the supreme court in kiobel further clarified the scope of the ats by holding that the presumption against extraterritoriality applies to claims under the ats,and concluding that relief under the ats for violations of the law of nations occurring outside the united states is barred.at citing morrison australia bank,d.writing for the court,the chief justice further noted that all the relevant conduct in kiobel took place outside the united states,and therefore the plaintiffs case seeking relief for violations of the law of nations occurring outside the united states is barred.id.
applying the holding of kiobel to the facts of this case,we conclude that,pursuant to the rule enunciated by the supreme court,there is no legally sufficient basis to support the jury verdict with respect to plaintiff claim under the ats.as described in part i,ante,all the relevant conduct set forth in plaintiff complaint occurred in bangladesh,kiobel.at,and therefore plaintiff claim brought under the ats is barred,id see also balintulo daimler ag,cir c laims under the ats can not be brought for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than the united states i f all the relevant conduct occurred abroad,that is simply the end of the matter under kiobel.accordingly,the judgment must be reversed insofar as it rests on plaintiff claims under the ats.
tvpa claim 
general verdict rule 
second,defendants argue that it is impossible to know whether the jury found in favor of plaintiff on the basis of an ats or tvpa theory of liability.as a consequence,defendants contend,if the ats claim must be vacated then the judgment must be vacated in its entirety and the cause remanded for a new trial.
the supreme court decades ago announced the general verdict rule,that a new trial will be required where there is no way to know that an invalid claim was not the sole basis for a verdict.united sandy hook pilots ass halecki,d see also sunkist growers,winckler smith citrus prods,d tire eng g distribution,llc shandong linglong rubber,cir the supreme court has recognized that when a jury issues a general verdict on multiple theories of liability and one of those theories is overturned on appeal,the entire verdict falls.
numerous subsequent courts,however,have engrafted a harmless error gloss onto the basic principle.muth ford motor,cir.so it is that we have recognized,in this context,that h armless error arises when we are sufficiently confident that the verdict was not influenced by an error in the jury charge.bruneau kortright cent.sch,cir,abrogated on other grounds by fitzgerald barnstable sch,d see also tire eng g distribution,at gillespie sears,roebuck,cir w e have generously applied the harmless error concept to rescue verdicts where we could be reasonably sure that the jury in fact relied upon a theory with adequate evidentiary support.
applying a harmless error analysis to the facts of the instant case,we have no difficulty in concluding,as we discuss below,that there was indeed adequate evidentiary support for a jury to find the defendants liable for torture under the tvpa.under the straightforward circumstances of this case,plaintiff claim brought under the ats and his claim under the tvpa both stemmed from the same alleged acts of torture,and khan can point to no circumstances in which the jury could have found him liable under the ats but not the tvpa.
ii.other challenges to the tvpa claim extraterritoriality,torture,and agency 
extraterritoriality 
defendant khan also raises other challenges to the validity of judgment entered against him under plaintiff tvpa claim.all of his arguments lack merit.
first,khan asserts that the conduct underlying the tvpa claim here do es not touch and concern the united states,appellant supp.letter br.quoting kiobel.at,and we must therefore exercise a vigilant door keeping function,id.quoting sosa,at,to bar it.we find no support in kiobel or any other authority for the proposition that the territorial constraints on causes of action under the ats apply to the statutory cause of action created by the tvpa.rather,we must conduct a separate statutory analysis with respect to the tvpa to determine whether that the ats gives clear indication of an extraterritorial application.kiobel.at quoting morrison.at.under this separate analysis,we conclude that the tvpa,unlike the ats,has extraterritorial application.
our analysis begins with the text of the statute.congress created civil liability in the tvpa,inter alia,for torture and extrajudicial killing carried out by an individual with actual or apparent authority,or color of law,of any foreign nation.tvpa a emphasis supplied.although this language could conceivably refer to conduct occurring within the united states,the provision is more naturally understood to address primarily conduct occurring in the territory of foreign sovereigns the legislative history of the tvpa unambiguously supports that conclusion.see,a state that practices torture and summary execution is not one that adheres to the rule of law.consequently,the torture victim protection act tvpa is designed to respond to this situation by providing a civil cause of action in courts for torture committed abroad,pt,noting judge bork skepticism in teloren libyan arab republic,as to whether victims of torture committed in foreign nations could bring a cause of action under the ats absent an explicit grant of a cause of action and stating that the tvpa would provide such a grant.thus,we find no bar on the basis of extraterritoriality to chowdhury tvpa claim 
second,khan argues that the facts presented do not constitute torture under the tvpa,because not all police brutality is actionable under the statute.it is clearly true,of course,that not all conduct falling under the journalistic and political rubric of police brutality,whether here or abroad,can be described as torture,but a review of the particular facts of this case persuades us that the jury could have properly found the conduct presented to constitute torture under the tvpa.the tvpa defines torture as 
any act,directed against an individual in the offender custody or physical control,by which severe pain or suffering other than pain or suffering arising only from or inherent in,or incidental to,lawful sanctions,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on that individual for such purposes as obtaining from that individual or a third person information or a confession,punishing that individual for an act that individual or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,intimidating or coercing that individual or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.
tvpa b.while torture under this definition does not automatically result whenever individuals in official custody are subjected even to direct physical assault,price socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,we conclude that the term torture can apply to powerful electric shocks administered to the body,when the determines that the shocks are sufficiently severe.this conclusion is bolstered by the numerous courts of appeals that have referred to electric shocks as an instrument of torture.see,jean pierre attorney general,cir noting that electric shock can constitute torture within the meaning of the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat,treaty doc,the multilateral international convention upon which the tvpa was based see also cherichel holder,n cir electric shock may rise to the level of torture abdel rahman gonzales,cir same lhanzom gonzales,cir same united states webster,cir same price,at zubeda ashcroft,cir same.
additionally,the tvpa contemplates the purposes for which torture might be undertaken by the perpetrator,and specifically lists intimidating or coercing the victim among them.tvpa b.here,defendants subjected chowdhury to electric shocks for the distinct purpose of coercing him to relinquish his business interests to khan.
in this case,moreover,the district court took particular care to instruct the jury on the definition of torture in a manner consistent with the one provided by the tvpa,stating that t he severity requirement is crucial in determining whether conduct is torture and that an act must be a deliberate and calculated act of an extremely cruel and inhuman nature specifically intended to inflict excruciating and agonizing physical or mental pain or suffering in order to constitute torture joint app x.accordingly,we find that plaintiff allegations of being subject to electric shock while detained by the rab were properly actionable as torture under the tvpa.
third,khan claims that the jury verdict was predicated on improper agency theories of liability,arguing that any brutality by rab agents was not attributable to him.we disagree.the weight of authority makes clear that agency theories of liability are available in the context of a tvpa claim.
for a claim of torture to be actionable under the tvpa,a plaintiff must demonstrate,inter alia,that a defendant acted under actual or apparent authority,or color of law,of any foreign nation.tvpa a.to determine whether a defendant acted under color of foreign law,we look to principles of agency law and to jurisprudence under.kadic karadzic,cir.under those principles,f or purposes of the tvpa,an individual acts under color of law when he acts together with state officials or with significant state aid.khulumani barclay nat.bank,cir per curiam internal quotation marks omitted,aff for want of a quorum sub nom.am.isuzu motors,ntsebeza,d kadic,at same arar,at t o state a claim under the tvpa,plaintiff must adequately allege that the defendants possessed power under foreign law,and that the offending actions derived from an exercise of that power,or that defendants could not have undertaken their culpable actions absent such power.khan,who was found to have conspired with state authorities in bangladesh,thus clearly acted under color of law within the meaning of the tvpa.
agency law,however,does not simply apply to the question whether a defendant acts under color of law it also can provide a theory of tort liability if a defendant did not personally torture the victim.as the supreme court recently explained in mohamad palestinian authority,d,congress is understood to legislate against a background of adjudicatory principles,id.at quotation marks omitted,and therefore the tvpa contemplates liability against officers who do not personally execute the torture or extrajudicial killing,id.citing chavez carranza,cir.
congress has not,in other words,specified any intent that traditional agency principles should not apply under the tvpa.meyer holley,d see also,at noting that responsibility for torture extends beyond the person or persons who actually committed those acts aldana del monte fresh produce,cir holding that the tvpa reaches those who ordered,abetted,or assisted in the wrongful act.accordingly,an individual can be liable for subject ing the victim to torture even if his agent administers the torture see tvpa a,and the district court did not err in permitting agency theories of
