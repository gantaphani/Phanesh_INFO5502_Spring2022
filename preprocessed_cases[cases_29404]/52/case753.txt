we are called on to decide whether a voluntarily joined foreign sovereign may remove a case from a territorial court to a federal district court when the foreign sovereign obtained the original defendant interest by assignment after the commencement of the litigation.we answer that question yes and,accordingly,affirm the district court exercise of jurisdiction over this case.
factual and procedural history 
eie guam corporation eieg is a guam corporation that is a wholly owned subsidiary of a japanese corporation,eie international.in july of,eieg obtained a loan of million from the long term credit bank of japan bank for the construction of the hyatt regency guam hotel hotel.in exchange,eieg executed a construction loan agreement,note,and mortgage on the hotel.the mortgage allowed the bank to foreclose on the hotel if eieg defaulted on the loan.
eieg defaulted on the loan in.the loan was extended for one year,but then fell back into default.a forbearance agreement was executed by the parties,but collapsed.eieg has made no payment to the bank since.
facing possible foreclosure,eieg filed suit against the bank and the other lenders in guam superior court in august.the bank counterclaimed.the other lenders were dismissed by stipulation.in june,the guam superior court enjoined the bank from foreclosing on the hotel.
in august of,the bank assigned to the resolution and collection corporation rcc,a japanese corporation,its notes,security instruments,and claims in the litigation with eieg.in january,the bank moved to join the rcc as a defendant and counterclaimant under guam rule of civil procedure c two months later,eieg stipulated to the rcc voluntary joinder.the court filed a joinder order.the rcc then immediately removed the entire action to federal district court under the provisions of the foreign sovereign immunities act of fsia.
thereafter,the parties engaged in mediation on the island of maui,hawaii.at the end of the mediation session,and just six days before the trial in federal district court was scheduled to begin,the parties executed a document they called the maui term sheet,settling the present litigation and agreeing to dismiss a related action.
in an attempt to iron out their remaining differences,the parties engaged in further negotiations.those negotiations proved fruitless,however,and the parties reached an impasse.the parties then filed motions in federal district court,asking the court to interpret and enforce the maui term sheet.the court filed an order in july,interpreting and enforcing the maui term sheet.that order held that the maui term sheet constituted an enforceable settlement agreement.additionally,it interpreted several of the provisions of the agreement whose meaning the parties disputed,and required that the parties conform to those interpretations.
the parties nonetheless failed to agree on the forms of the releases to be executed between them and,therefore,failed to close the deal by the august,deadline provided in the maui term sheet.the bank and the rcc asked the district court to schedule the case for trial,claiming that this was the remedy called for in the maui term sheet.eieg countered with a motion to enforce the settlement,maintaining that the court should order specific performance of the agreement.in two orders issued in may of,the district court held that it had the power to enforce the settlement agreement summarily.it interpreted the disputed provisions and ordered the parties to do everything in their power to implement the settlement.the district court set a new closing date of november.instead of working to close the deal by that date,the parties brought these timely appeals of the district court two may orders

discussion 
eieg presents four arguments to support its assertion that removal of the case to federal court was improper.eieg argues that a the rcc is not a foreign state within the meaning of the fsia b the action is not against the bank and the rcc,so the fsia removal provision does not apply c the rcc could not remove because it is an assignee that took the assignment after the litigation was underway,and then voluntarily joined the litigation and d the rcc submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the guam superior court.we will address each of those arguments in turn.
a.the rcc is a foreign state under the fsia.
the foreign sovereign immunities act provides the exclusive source of subject matter jurisdiction over suits involving foreign states and their instrumentalities.gates victor fine foods,cir joseph office of consulate of,cir.the fsia grants federal courts subject matter jurisdiction over actions brought against an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.a.an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state means any entity 
which is a separate legal person,corporate or otherwise,and 
which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,and 
which is neither a citizen of a state of the united states as defined in section c and d of this title,nor created under the laws of any third country.
the parties,and we,agree that the rcc satisfies the requirements of b and b.the only point of dispute is whether the rcc satisfies one of the alternative conditions of b.t here are two ways in which an entity can fulfill the requirements of b.either the entity can be an organ of a foreign state,or the entity can have a majority of its shares or other ownership interest owned by a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof.corporacion mexicana de servicios maritimos,de respect,cir quoting gates,at.in this case,the first condition is met,so we need not consider the second 
we have observed that the fsia legislative history suggests that congress intended the terms organ and agency or instrumentality to be read broadly.gates at.for example,the house report stated that 
entities which meet the definition of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state could assume a variety of forms,including a state trading corporation,a mining enterprise,a transport organization such as a shipping line or airline,a steel company,a central bank,an export association,a governmental procurement agency or a department or ministry which acts and is suable in its own name.
at,reprinted in.we have also explained 
in defining whether an entity is an organ,courts consider whether the entity engages in a public activity on behalf of the foreign government.in making this determination,courts examine the circumstances surrounding the entity creation,the purpose of its activities,its independence from the government,the level of government financial support,its employment policies,and its obligations and privileges under state law.
patrickson dole food,cir,cert.granted in part,d citing corporacion mexicana,at gates,at.an entity may be an organ of a foreign state even if it has some autonomy from the foreign government.patrickson at see also gates at stating that because the state is not directly involved in the activities of the entity does not mean that it is not exercising control over the entity.
the japanese government created the rcc expressly to perform a public function.the district court found that the rcc was created pursuant to several laws enacted by the japanese diet,namely article of tokeutei jutaku kinyu senmon kaisha no saiken saimu no shori no sokushin tou ni kansuru tokubetsu sochi hou,and supplementary provisions of yokin hoken hou.the district court stated that t he japanese government created the rcc to carry out japanese national policy related to revitalization of the japanese financial system.additionally,the district court found that o ne of the primary functions of the rcc is to purchase,administer,collect and dispose of loans purchased from failed financial institutions,such as the bank,at the request of the deposit insurance corporation of japan,dicj,in accordance with japanese law.the district court also noted that many of the rcc activities are performed exclusively by the rcc and the dicj and that o ther companies are not permitted to perform such activities even if they are in the loan collection business.further,the district court found that t he rcc is funded by the japanese government,that japanese law provides that the dicj will compensate the rcc for all losses at the end of every fiscal year,and that t he financial impact of any failure to collect the eieg loans and guarantees assigned by the bank to the rcc,or of a monetary damage award in favor of eie guam against the rcc,will ultimately be borne by the japanese government and the japanese taxpayers.the district court findings of fact all are supported in the record and thus are not clearly erroneous.
those factors all point toward the rcc being an organ of the japanese government and,therefore,an instrumentality covered by the fsia.eieg attempts to overcome the weight of those factors by pointing out that the rcc is a private company that is engaged in a primarily commercial concern that other japanese companies are authorized by the japanese ministry of justice to collect distressed loans and assets that the rcc employees are not civil servants and that the rcc is not a public corporation,a designation which,in japan,is reserved for corporations established by the national government by special law as instruments for activities required by the state.
none of those arguments is availing.a company may be an organ of a foreign state for purposes of the fsia even if its employees are not civil servants.gates,at.as discussed above,the rcc and the dicj engage in exclusive functions that other loan collection companies may not perform.as to the commercial nature of the rcc work,we have held that congress statement in the legislative history that a state trading company and an export association can be organs of a foreign state indicates congress belief that an entity involvement in commercial affairs does not automatically render the entity.id.finally,the district court key assertion that the rcc purpose is to carry out japanese national policy related to the revitalization of the japanese financial system is well supported in the record.
on balance,the relevant factors weigh in favor of a conclusion that the rcc is an organ of japan.additionally,the rcc compares favorably with other entities that we have labeled organs of foreign states under the fsia.
in gates,we held that alberta pork,a canadian marketing board for hog producers formed pursuant to alberta law,was an organ of the province of alberta.id.this was so despite the fact that the alberta agricultural products marketing council,which established the board,did not exercise control over the board,but had only an active supervisory role.id.at.the council could authorize the board to set quotas for hog farmers,require farmers to provide information relating to the production and marketing of specified products,pay service charges,and the like.id.at.noting the many ways in which the council could delegate tasks to alberta pork,we held that the board was an organ of the province of alberta.id.
in corporacion mexicana,we held that a subsidiary of a mexican agency that owned and exploited that nation petroleum resources was an organ of mexico.the subsidiary was a separate legal entity.it was empowered to own property and carry on business in its own name and was administered by eight board members who were appointed by the federal government.at.the government of mexico guaranteed the subsidiary performance.id.in holding that the subsidiary was an organ of mexico,we quoted the district court explanation that 
the subsidiary is an integral part of the united mexican states.it was created by the mexican constitution,federal organic law,and presidential proclamation it is entirely owned by the mexican government is controlled entirely by government appointees employs only public servants and is charged with the exclusive responsibility of refining and distributing mexican government property.
the rcc shares important similarities with the mexican subsidiary in corporacion mexicana each body was created directly by public law,and the government guaranteed each body performance.the rcc is even more clearly an organ of a foreign state than alberta pork was in gates.
in view of the circumstances of its founding its funding and financial connection to the government and taxpayers of japan its mission and its purpose,we hold that the rcc is an organ of the japanese government.it is therefore a foreign state within the meaning of the fsia and is entitled to exercise the rights afforded foreign states under the fsia.
b.the action by eieg is against the rcc.
title d permits removal to federal district court of a ny civil action brought in a state court against a foreign state as defined by the fsia.emphasis added.eieg asserts that this action was not removable under d because eieg brought no claims against the rcc.in support,eieg cites the maxim that the plaintiff power to prevent removal 
continues with the plaintiff throughout the litigation,so that whether such a case is nonremovable when commenced shall afterwards become removable depends not upon what the defendant may allege or prove or what the court may order,but solely upon the form which the plaintiff by his voluntary action shall give to the pleadings 
great ry.alexander.see also self motors,cir citing great ry.
we are not persuaded.eieg clearly is asserting a claim against the rcc,even though eieg did not explicitly name the rcc as a defendant.as the district court correctly observed 
the complaint asserts substantial claims against the rcc,as the assignee of the bank interest in the loans,mortgages,guarantees and security interests relating to the hotel.inter alia,eie guam action seeks to preclude the rcc from enforcing those agreements and mortgages.eie guam also asserts that the rcc is affirmatively liable to eie guam for damages,at least through setoff.
the primary issue in dispute relates to the validity and enforceability of the loans,mortgages,guarantees and security interests executed by eie guam in favor of the bank relating to the hotel.the bank has assigned the loans,mortgages,guarantees and security interests to the rcc.eie guam is no more willing to honor its obligations now that they have been assigned to the rcc 
the district court cited the second circuit decision in citibank,nyland,cir,for the proposition that minimal adversity between a foreign state and the plaintiff suffices to justify the foreign state removal of the action pursuant to the fsia.in nyland,one defendant alleged that the philippines was only a nominal defendant and that,therefore,the philippines did not have the power to remove the case to federal court under d.id.at.the second circuit disagreed,stating 
there is nothing in the text of the statute or in the legislative history to support appellant contention that the philippines interests must be completely adverse to those of the plaintiff in order to remove this case to a federal court the philippines has adequately demonstrated that its interests are adverse to those of citibank.we therefore reject appellant contention that the case should have been remanded to state court.
we agree with the second circuit approach.in this case,there is no question that the rcc interests are adverse to eieg.nor can there be any doubt that eieg claim is against the rcc in a logical seeks rulings from the court that would permit it to avoid paying money to the rcc that the rcc claims it is owed.the only question is whether eieg can avoid this obvious result simply by choosing not to name the rcc in its complaint.it can not.
eieg quotes the principle that,to determine whether an originally nonremovable case became removable,we must rely solely upon the form which the plaintiff by his voluntary action shall give to the pleadings.self,at.that passage does not support eieg assertion that its mere failure to name the rcc explicitly as a defendant means that this is not an action against the rcc.eieg voluntary action,for example its litigation efforts to avoid paying a debt to the rcc,have in fact created claims against the rcc.in self,the same case on which eieg relies,we made clear that the determination of whether federal jurisdiction exists depends only upon plaintiff complaint and the context in which it is found.id.emphasis added.we are not limited to the pleadings but must also examine the context of the case as a whole in other words,we do not exalt form over substance.the context of this case shows that it is in substance an action against the rcc,among other parties.
c.the rcc may remove despite the fact that it is a voluntarily joined assignee.
eieg argues that,even if the rcc is a foreign sovereign,the rcc may not remove because it obtained its interest voluntarily after the litigation had commenced.as a voluntarily joined assignee,eieg claims,the rcc may exercise only the removal rights if any that were available to the original defendant,the bank.the question we must answer is whether a foreign sovereign defendant who gained its interest in the litigation voluntarily,through an assignment after the suit had commenced,may remove the case to federal court under the fsia removal provision,d.
the text of the removal statute of the fsia 
to answer that question,we begin with the text of the statute.see ins,cir stating principle.the removal procedure established by d reads 
any civil action brought in a state court against a foreign state as defined in section a of this title may be removed by the foreign state to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.upon removal the action shall be tried by the court without jury.where removal is based upon this subsection,the time limitations of section b of this chapter may be enlarged at any time for cause shown.
on its face,d contains no restrictions on a foreign sovereign right to remove.indeed,even the usual time limit on the right of removal is relaxed.under the most natural reading of the statute,a foreign sovereign that obtained a defendant interest by assignment satisfies the criteria contained in the removal provision.here,for instance,the suit is a civil action,was brought in state court,and is against the rcc,a foreign state.under a straightforward reading of d,then,a foreign sovereign assignee apparently enjoys the same right of removal as a foreign sovereign that is an original defendant in a suit filed in state court.
nevertheless,there is another plausible reading of the statute that could justify an opposite conclusion.when a plaintiff sues a nonforeign sovereign defendant in state court,only to have the original defendant transfer an interest in the case to a foreign sovereign that then joins and removes,arguably the action was not brought against a foreign state,d,but rather was transformed into such an action after the case was brought.
that reading is not unreasonable theoretically,but it is inconsistent with the way courts have interpreted the statute in other contexts.for example,other circuits have held that a foreign state that is brought into an action as a defendant,rather than as an original defendant by the plaintiff,may remove the entire action to federal court.see,davis mccourt,cir we find that d allows a foreign defendant to remove an entire action from state court to district court.in re air crash disaster near roselawn,cir citing nolan boeing,cir,with approval in re surinam airways holding,cir the fsia intended to render uniform in procedure and substance the treatment of foreign sovereigns subjected to suits in american courts.making a federal forum available to a foreign state furthers this goal,whether the foreign state is a defendant or a defendant.citations and internal quotation marks omitted nolan,at w e can perceive no significant distinction between the authorization for removal of an entire action by a sovereign,and removal of an entire action by a sovereign defendant.obviously,if a foreign state is brought into an action as a defendant,the civil action was not originally against a foreign sovereign.nevertheless,a foreign sovereign may remove pursuant to the fsia in such circumstances.that the action is against the foreign sovereign at the time of the removal suffices to satisfy the requirements of the fsia.
in short,there is nothing in the text of d,as interpreted by our sister circuits,to support eieg argument that a foreign state must be an original defendant in order to enjoy the power to remove under the fsia.however,as eieg points out,the rcc is not a defendant,brought into this litigation without its active consent.rather,it is a voluntarily joined defendant.
the fact that a foreign state that is brought into an action involuntarily may remove under d does not necessarily mean that a foreign state that chooses voluntarily to join litigation in progress,even as a defendant,enjoys the same right because the text of the fsia removal statute does not answer this question,we turn next to its legislative history to ascertain congress intent.see united states davidson,cir where the plain language of a statute is ambiguous,a court may go beyond the words of the statute to examine the textual evolution of the contested language and the legislative history that may explain or elucidate it.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
congressional intent 
the house report for the fsia states in view of the potential sensitivity of actions against foreign states and the importance of developing a uniform body of law in this area,it is important to give foreign states clear authority to remove to a federal forum actions brought against them in the state courts,reprinted in.indeed,the house report reflects congress belief that allowing foreign sovereigns to litigate in federal courts is so important that sovereigns should be permitted to drag along unconsenting into federal court 
new subsection d of section permits the removal of any such action at the discretion of the foreign state,even if there are multiple defendants and some of these defendants desire not to remove the action or are citizens of the states in which the action has been brought.
the house report indicates that congress did not intend to allow foreign sovereigns to sit on their removal rights indefinitely,only to exercise them at a more strategic point in the litigation.however,although foreign sovereigns do not have carte blanche,the usual time limitations on removal are more relaxed for foreign states than for other defendants,clearly suggesting that congress contemplated the possibility of late removal by a foreign state 
as with other removal provisions,a petition for removal must be filed with the appropriate district court in a timely manner.however,in the view of the period provided in section c in the bill and in view of the bill preference that actions involving foreign states be tried in federal courts,the time limitations for filing a petition of removal under may be extended at any time for good cause shown.
logically,congress twin potential political sensitivity of actions against foreign states and the importance of developing a uniform body of federal law in this equally to a foreign state that is a voluntary defendant and to a foreign state that is an involuntary defendant.if the foreign sovereign interests are at play,the voluntary nature of the sovereign participation does nothing to diminish congress concerns about the need for sensitivity to foreign states and the need for uniformity of law in this area.
in this case,of course,the rcc knew that the present litigation was underway when it acquired its interest in the litigation.however,the rcc took on that interest pursuant to the policies of the government of japan,and any obligations arising from a judgment in eieg favor would be borne by the government and the taxpayers of japan.the need for sensitivity and uniformity is as strong here as in any other circumstance in which a foreign sovereign is a defendant.
eieg counters that,despite the legislation history and stated aims,congress did not expressly allow volunt
