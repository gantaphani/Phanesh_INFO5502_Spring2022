john peterson sued the royal kingdom of saudi arabia and one of its agencies,the general organization of social insurance collectively,saudi arabia,seeking to recover mandatory contributions his employers made to a retirement program.finding no exception in the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia or act,et,applicable to peterson claims,the district court dismissed his law suit for lack of jurisdiction.see peterson royal kingdom of saudi arabia,d,reprinted in joint appendix at.he now appeals,arguing that saudi arabia is not entitled to sovereign immunity because the fsia expropriation and commercial activity exceptions apply to the claims he presses.neither exception applies,we conclude,and thus there is no basis for federal court jurisdiction over saudi arabia for the purpose of peterson suit.we therefore affirm the district court judgment.
we accept as true the facts peterson alleges in his complaint and briefly recount them now in november,saudi arabia established the general organization of social insurance gosi by royal decree to promote foreign commerce and attract badly needed foreign workers to saudi arabia.gosi has two distinct branches the occupational hazards branch,which provides insurance coverage for injuries,and the annuities branch,which provides retirement and death benefits.
from until,saudi arabia required employers and their employees,regardless of national origin or citizenship,to make contributions to gosi.employers were required to contribute two per cent of their employees salaries to the occupational hazards branch.each employer and each employee were responsible for contributing thirteen percent of the total value of the employee wages and other benefits to the annuities branch,the employer contributing cent and the employee the remaining five per cent.all contributions,however,were made for the benefit of,and in the name of,the employee.gosi invested the contributions it received in domestic corporations and organizations as well as international banks.
in saudi arabia issued royal decree no,which excluded workers from gosi annuit ies branch.the upshot of the royal decree was that workers were no longer eligible for retirement and death benefits.at some point between and,however,saudi arabia decided to refund to workers a portion of the contributions made to the annuities branch in their names.peterson,who had worked for multiple engineering and construction companies in saudi arabia from to and made contributions to gosi,applied for and eventually received in a refund of the five per cent contribution he made to the annuities branch.along with his refund check,peterson received the following notice attached is a check for the value of your entitlements,due to you as per the applicable rules for this purpose.this payment represents your full dues from gosi.
peterson alleges that saudi arabia failed to publicize the refund program,failed to explain its decision to refund only five per cent of the contributions made in his name and failed to state when the remaining eight percent would be paid.throughout june,peterson contacted the saudi arabian embassy in washington,by telephone,by mail and by facsimile to ask for a date certain by which he would receive the remaining cent contribution his employers made in his name.peterson notified the embassy that he would give saudi arabia until june,to answer his inquiry and that he would deem its failure to respond a constructive denial of his request.he received no answer.
peterson then sued saudi arabia in the district court on august.his complaint alleges four claims based on saudi arabia failure to refund the full amount paid into the gosi annuities branch in his behalf arbitrary and discriminatory expropriation of his property in violation of international law breach of contract conversion of his property and unjust enrichment.saudi arabia subsequently filed a motion to dismiss,which the district court granted on august.see peterson,d at.
the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain peterson suit under fsia because his claims failed to meet the act expropriation or commercial activity exceptions.see id.at.with respect to the expropriation exception,the district court concluded that the eight percent gosi contribution,characterized by the plaintiff as an expectation interest in payments,does not qualify as a right in tangible property and the expropriation exception does not apply here for that reason.id.at.the fact that the property in question is not tangible property is,it explained,dispositive of the question whether the expropriation exception of the fsia can apply to defendants.id.at.turning to fsia commercial activity exception,the district court found it inapplicable as well because t he termination of gosi benefits for foreign workers is a sovereign,not a commercial,act and the termination can not be understood to have had a direct effect in the united states.id.at quoting a.the termination was distinctly sovereign,to the court mind,because a private player in the market certainly could not engage in the particular actions of initiating,administering,and ending a scheme of mandatory social insurance.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.and there was no direct effect in the united states,the court explained,because b ased on the record before the court,it appears that,to the extent peterson expected a refund of his gosi contributions in a particular place,it can at most be described as an implied agreement for payment in the united states.id.at.in the alternative,the district court further concluded that peterson claims were barred under any applicable statute of limitations.id.
he now appeals.see.on de novo review,we affirm the judgment of the district court,see princz fed.republic of germany,foreign government entitlement to sovereign immunity is question of law subject to de novo review,cert.denied,d,as set forth below.
in the united states,there is only one way for a court to obtain jurisdiction over a foreign state and it is not a particularly generous fsia.see argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d t he fsia provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this country accord world wide minerals,republic of kazakhstan.fsia provides that a district court has jurisdiction over a civil action against a foreign sovereign for any claim with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity.a see world wide minerals,at.but under the act,a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction of federal and state courts alike,see a id,and remains so unless an international agreement,see id.a,or one of several exceptions in the statute provides otherwise,see id.see phoenix consulting,republic of angola.in the absence of an applicable exception,the foreign sovereign immunity is complete t he district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff case.id.citation omitted see also saudi arabia nelson,d u nless a specified exception applies,a federal court lacks jurisdiction over a claim against a foreign state.citations omitted.peterson maintains that saudi arabia is not entitled to sovereign immunity under either of two fsia expropriation exception or the commercial activity one.we conclude neither applies.
peterson first maintains that saudi arabia is not entitled to sovereign immunity because it arbitrarily and discriminatorily expropriated his property in violation of international law.under fsia,
a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states or of the states in any case in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property or any property exchanged for such property is present in the united states in connection with a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or that property or any property exchanged for such property is owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and that agency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the united states.
a.thus,for a claim to fit within this statutory exception,it must meet three requirements at issue must be rights in property that were taken in violation of international law and the property at issue or any property exchanged for it must either a be present in the united states in connection with a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or b owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and that agency or instrumentality engages in commercial activity in the united states.id.our analysis begins and ends with the exception first two requirements.see id.
the parties make assorted arguments regarding whether the cent gosi contributions made by peterson employers on his behalf constitute a right in property,the parties dispute whether the cent contribution constitutes property at all,what kind of property it or,if it is property,to whom it in fact belongs.they direct most of their attention to the question whether the employers gosi contributions constitute tangible or intangible property.saudi arabia contends that fsia expropriation exception encompasses only tangible property such as physical assets,not intangible property such as a right to receive payment,and therefore does not apply to peterson employers gosi contributions,which it characterizes as securing an e xpectation interest in social insurance benefits.see appellees br.at.peterson disagrees,arguing that such a cramped interpretation is shortsighted,overly formalistic and contradicts congressional intent,appellant br.at,and that his employers gosi contributions constitute tangible property in any event.
the parties focus on this question is not surprising inasmuch as the district court found the question pivotal,as have other district courts.some courts have held that the term property as used in fsia expropriation exception means physical property not the right to receive payment.lord day lord socialist republic of vietnam,d,internal quotation marks citations omitted expropriation exception inapplicable because claim based on entitlement to funds was fatally flawed accord,sampson fed.republic of germany,expropriation exception inapplicable to claim not involving loss of tangible property because property under this section refers to tangible property internal quotation marks citation omitted,aff,cir intercontinental dictionary series de gruyter,intangible intellectual property rights or the right to receive payment on a contract alleged by ids are not grounds for applying the expropriation exception canadian overseas ores compania de acero del pacifico,expropriation exception inapplicable to breach of contract claim because it is on its face inapplicable to a contractual right to be paid,aff,cir see generally de sanchez banco cent.de nicaragua,cir declining to decide issue but citing cases hirsh state of israel,assuming reparation payments were expropriated,exception nevertheless inapplicable,as it has been interpreted to apply only to the expropriation of tangible property,not to the right to receive payments.in fact,this case is not the only instance in which our circuit district court has analyzed the distinction in assessing subject matter jurisdiction under fsia expropriation exception.see rong liaoning provincial gov t,d,t he fsia applies where the property at issue is tangible property.internal quotation marks citation omitted.arguing against this precedent,peterson relies on a ninth circuit decision construing the second hickenlooper amendment,e in which the court observed that the characterization of property interests is a distinction without a difference.west multibanco comermex,cir.for our part,we have not decided the question and need not do so today.
regardless whether the cent gosi contributions constitute tangible or intangible property or what significance,if any,the latter classification may carry under fsia expropriation exception,a,peterson has failed to allege sufficient facts demonstrating that the contributions constitute a right in property in the first place.peterson maintains that his substantial cash investments in gosi constitute tangible property.complaint at,reprinted in at.but his contributions were not placed in a private account in his name rather,if gosi had remained in force with respect to foreign workers,the contributions peterson and his employers made would have been returned to him in the form of an annuity upon his retirement at age,provided he met certain conditions.see.the annuity,moreover,would not have been based on his cent and his employers cent contributions to gosi but instead on the average monthly wages he received in the two years preceding his retirement.see according to saudi arabia social insurance law base amount is computed by multiplying of the average monthly wages by the number of insurance years.peterson counsel made two concessions at oral argument that confirm that peterson had no right,contractual or otherwise,to this benefit stream,which resembles our social security system more than a as a k plan.peterson counsel conceded both that peterson was not guaranteed a return of the cent contributions his employers made to gosi in his behalf,see tr.of oral argument at,and that saudi arabia could have unilaterally eliminated the gosi program for all workers,foreign and domestic,see tr.of oral argument at.taken together,these factors rebut peterson assertion that his and his employers contributions to gosi constitute rights in property of which he was deprived in derogation of international law.see brewer socialist people republic of iraq,cir expropriation exception inapplicable because breach of contract did not create rights in property see also human rights in china bank of china,civ,wl,at may,expropriation exception inapplicable because plaintiff had no legal right to the property after funds transferred to third party.
peterson nonetheless makes two arguments to the contrary,neither of which we find persuasive.citing various another circuit opinion,altmann republic of austria,cir,to a decision of the european court of human rights,skórkiewicz poland,app,eur,reprinted in at,to a law review article,diego claudia martin,the international human rights status of elderly persons,am.int l peterson first contends that we should heed emerging international norms prohibiting a government taking of a person property interest in his contributions to a pension plan.but,as we noted,the gosi program is not a pension plan but a social insurance system.thus it is of no moment that saudi arabia royal decree no.affected only one group of gosi beneficiaries,employees.citing united states supreme court cases,including kaiser aetna united states,d and perry sindermann,d,as well as ours,nixon united states,and hall ford,for the notion that property is made up of mutually reinforcing understandings,nixon,at,peterson additionally argues that his employers cent gosi contributions constitute his property because saudi arabia treated it as such by refunding to him his cent gosi contribution.t here is no common sense,or legal difference between the ownership of the contribution and the contribution made by the employer in the employee name,his argument goes.appellant br.at.while it is debatable that saudi arabia refund of peterson cent contribution to gosi represents a mutual understanding that the contribution was peterson property,it is indisputable that the refund does not further represent a mutual understanding that his employers cent contributions also constituted peterson property inasmuch as the refund notified peterson that the refund constituted full dues from gosi.
peterson next maintains that fsia commercial activity exception supplies the necessary jurisdiction.under this exception,
a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states or of the states in any case in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsew
