background 
are the european community ec and various of its member states ec plaintiffs,as well as certain departments of the nation of colombia the departments of colombia collectively,plaintiffs this appeal arose from three actions that were treated as related and decided together by the district court.see ec i,at.the plaintiffs made substantially similar allegations,sought the same damages,and relied on the same legal theories in their three complaints.id.in two of the complaints,the ec plaintiffs alleged that tobacco companies directed and facilitated the smuggling of contraband cigarettes.id.in a third complaint,the departments of colombia made similar allegations,claiming that tobacco companies directed and facilitated the smuggling of cigarettes into their country.id 
the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had participated in a smuggling enterprise within the meaning of rico and committed various predicate acts of racketeering,including mail and wire fraud,money laundering,and others.id.at.the complaints all sought to recover treble damages,pursuant to rico,for duties and taxes not paid on the cigarettes.they further sought to recover funds which they had been required to expend to fight against cigarette smuggling.id.at.finally,the complaints sought various forms of injunctive relief that would end the defendants alleged smuggling and help ensure future compliance.id.the district court dismissed all of the claims as barred by the revenue rule.id 
the plaintiffs appealed to this court.we held that the revenue rule barred the foreign sovereigns civil claims for recovery of lost tax revenue and law enforcement costs.see at.we affirmed the judgment of the district court on the revenue rule question and the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari from the supreme court.see wl.
while the petition was pending,the supreme court issued its opinion in pasquantino united states,d,a case dealing with the revenue rule application to the criminal prosecution of smugglers under the wire fraud statute.in pasquantino,the supreme court specifically declined to express a view as to whether a foreign government,based on wire or mail fraud predicate offenses,may bring a civil action under rico for a scheme to defraud it of taxes.at.not long after pasquantino was decided,the supreme court vacated our judgment in ec i and remanded it to us for further consideration in light of pasquantino.see european cmty.rjr nabisco,d.we requested letter briefs addressing the impact of pasquantino,which the parties provided.we now reconsider our decision in ec 
discussion 
we are bound by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they are overruled either by an en banc panel of our court or by the supreme court.united states wilkerson,cir.we recognize an exception to this general rule where there has been an intervening supreme court decision that casts doubt on our controlling precedent.union of needletrades,industrial textile employees ins,cir.the supreme court has taken two relevant actions since ec i its decision in pasquantino united states,d,and its order that we reconsider ec i in light of pasquantino.see,d.we will of course reconsider ec i as instructed,but we reinstate it as our controlling precedent because the intervening decision in pasquantino does not substantively cast doubt on it.
i.the revenue rule and civil rico claims by foreign governments 
under the common law doctrine known as the revenue rule,the courts of one nation will not enforce final tax judgments or unadjudicated tax claims of other nations.canada,at.in canada,the canadian government sought recovery under rico of tax revenue and law enforcement costs lost to smuggling.id.at.we held that recovery of unpaid taxes would constitute direct enforcement of a foreign sovereign tax laws,and recovery of law enforcement costs would constitute indirect enforcement.id.at.we concluded that rico did not abrogate the revenue rule,see id.at,and that both claims were therefore barred by that rule.id.at 
the plaintiffs in the present case,as in canada,are foreign sovereigns suing under rico for law enforcement costs and tax revenue lost to smuggling.ec i,at.in the briefs and argument which led to our decision in ec i,the plaintiffs argued that the revenue rule had been abrogated by amendments to rico embodied in the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism usa patriot act of,stat.the patriot act.
the patriot act added certain smuggling or export control violations to the list of rico predicate acts under c.these new provisions dealt with precisely the type of conduct alleged by the plaintiffs in ec ec i,at nevertheless,we found that neither the amendments nor their legislative history evidenced congress intent to abrogate the revenue rule to allow claims such as the plaintiffs.see id.
we stressed in our opinion that the revenue rule is designed to address two concerns first,that policy complications and embarrassment may follow when one nation courts analyze the validity of another nation tax laws and second,that the executive branch,not the judicial branch,should decide when our nation will aid others in enforcing their tax laws.id.at.these twin concerns for sovereignty and separation of powers are important to the revenue rule analysis,because they imply certain exceptions to the rule.in particular,when the executive branch affirmatively consents to litigation,by initiating it in a criminal prosecution,there is little reason to worry about infringing on the executive sphere of,and the rule will not be applied.id.at.
ii.pasquantino and its impact 
pasquantino considered whether the revenue rule precluded a criminal prosecution for wire fraud under for use of interstate wirings as part of a scheme to smuggle liquor into canada.the supreme court first determined that canada right to collect tax money was property for purposes of the statute,and that a plot to smuggle liquor into canada was a scheme to defraud canada of that right to collect tax money.at.thus,the plain language of the statute created liability for this type of smuggling.id.the court then held that the revenue rule did not preclude criminal prosecutions of this kind.
none of the cited cases applying the revenue rule involved a domestic sovereign acting pursuant to authority conferred by a criminal statute.the difference is significant.an action by a domestic sovereign enforces the sovereign own penal law.a prohibition on the enforcement of foreign penal law does not plainly prevent the government from enforcing a domestic criminal law.
id.at second emphasis added.the court admitted that this criminal prosecution enforces canadian revenue law in an attenuated sense,but held the connection too attenuated to trigger the rule.id.at.
the supreme court also analyzed the question in light of the purposes of the revenue rule and found that concerns about sovereignty and separation of powers were not implicated where the united states government brings a criminal prosecution.see id.at.first,in light of the government decision to prosecute,the court found little risk of causing the principal evil against which the revenue rule was tr
