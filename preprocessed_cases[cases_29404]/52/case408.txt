in this appeal,ibrahim,a citizen of the republic of yemen,contests his prosecution and conviction for violating g b west,which prohibits possession of a firearm by a alien.principal argument is that,as the family member of a diplomat,he possessed diplomatic immunity at the time of his arrest and that the state department later tried to revoke that immunity retroactively,in violation of the vienna convention on diplomatic relations and the united states constitution.finding that the state department interpretation of who is a member of the family of a diplomatic agent forming part of his household member of the family for purposes of the vienna convention is reasonable,we accept its certification as conclusive evidence that,at the time of his arrest,was not a member of the family and hold that did not have diplomatic immunity.we also hold that the state department actions in this matter did not violate the constitutional guarantee of due process.
on february,officers from the federal bureau of investigation fbi and the immigration and naturalization services ins executed a search warrant at the annandale,virginia apartment of ibrahim.upon entering the residence,one of the occupants told the officers that kept a rifle in the apartment.soon thereafter,the agents discovered a loaded caliber rifle with a telescopic site in closet.was subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury on april,for possession of a firearm by a alien,in violation of g b.

was born in yemen on november,but moved to the united states in when his father,ahmed ali saleh,was appointed as a minister at the republic of yemen embassy in washington.the government agrees that in and his father possessed diplomatic immunity pursuant to the vienna convention.celebrated his birthday in november.he was not enrolled in school at the time,and his diplomatic identification card,given to all persons with diplomatic immunity,expired on december.the yemeni embassy applied for a new identification card for on december,but the state department requested more information before it would grant the request.no further information was provided,and was never issued a new identification card,however,continued to be issued after and has entered the united states with an visa on numerous occasions since.
on march,the state department sent a letter to the yemeni embassy stating that father lost his diplomatic immunity on that date because he no longer performed services for yemen at the embassy.on may,in response to motion to dismiss the indictment,the state department certified that lost his diplomatic immunity on november,the date of his birthday.thus,according to the may certification,did not possess diplomatic immunity at the time of his arrest.
on appeal,principal argument is that he possessed diplomatic immunity at the time of his arrest on february,and was thus immune from prosecution.he also contends that the state department may,certification retroactively revoked that immunity,in violation of his substantive and procedural due process rights as guaranteed by the fifth amendment of the constitution we address each of these arguments in turn.

in pertinent part,the vienna convention states that a diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving state.vienna convention at.article reads members of the family of a diplomatic agent forming part of his household shall enjoy the privileges and immunities specified in articles to.vienna convention at art.the diplomatic relations act,which made the vienna convention applicable to the united states,see tabion,at,provides that the phrase members of the family means the members of the family of a member of a mission who form part of his or her household.a west.that act also provides,quite clearly,that a ny action or proceeding brought against an individual who is entitled to immunity with respect to such action or proceeding shall be dismissed.west.thus,under the plain language of the statute,if,at the time he was arrested,was entitled to diplomatic immunity under article of the vienna convention,the criminal proceedings against him must be dismissed.
in its may,letter,the state department certified that lost his diplomatic immunity in november.the state department based its certification on a circular diplomatic that it issued in.united states department of state,circular diplomatic note of november.at.that circular note articulated the state department position that the phrase members of the family,as set forth in the vienna convention and the diplomatic relations act,did not include children over the age of.at.the circular note provided,however,that children of certified diplomats still enrolled in school are considered family members until their birthday.id.at.the circular note was provided to all foreign missions and remains in force,but because the republic of yemen was not formed until,it did not receive the circular note during.
in,the state department published guidelines for administrative officers that restated the age limitations on children who are considered members of the diplomatic family as had been originally stated in the circular note and explained that it is generally agreed that host states may formulate reasonable definitions of the phrases used in the vienna convention.united states department of state,foreign diplomatic and career consular personnel in the united for administrative officers at.the state department provided that publication to all foreign embassies in the united states,including the yemeni embassy.
the government forcefully argues that the state department certification of lack of immunity is conclusive and thus judicially unreviewable.the government concedes,however,that the state department can not act outside the vienna convention in issuing a certification and also admits that in this case the state department certification is based upon its own interpretation of the vienna convention,not the plain language of that document.thus,we believe we first must ensure that the state department certification was not based on an impermissible interpretation of the vienna convention.then,we will examine the evidentiary effect of the state department certification made pursuant to that interpretation.
when interpreting a treaty,we first look to its terms to determine its meaning.united states,d.when the text is ambiguous or unclear,we turn to nontextual sources for guidance.see united states li,cir en banc tabion mufti,cir.when looking at nontextual sources,we are reminded that a lthough not conclusive,the meaning attributed to treaty provisions by the government agencies charged with their negotiation and enforcement is entitled to great weight.sumitomo shoji america,avagliano,d see also iceland steamship united states dep t of the army,giving great weight to the state department interpretation of a defense treaty.therefore,because the state department is charged with the responsibility of enforcing the vienna convention,we give s ubstantial deference to the state department interpretation of that treaty provisions.tabion,at see also li,at.
the phrase members of the family of a diplomatic agent forming part of his household is not free from ambiguity,as seen by the differing interpretations offered by both and the government.as mentioned,the state department,since,has consistently interpreted the member of the family provision of article to include only children under the age of as forming part of the household unless they are continuing their education.argues that diplomatic immunity extends to all members of the family and contends that the vienna convention does not allow for an age restriction at its core,argument asks us to find that his interpretation of the vienna convention language is more reasonable than the state department interpretation.we give substantial deference to the state department interpretation of a treaty,and in the context of diplomatic immunity,the receiving state always has had broad discretion to classify diplomats.abdulaziz metropolitan dade county,cir.moreover,and perhaps most important,has failed to show how the state department interpretation violates the dictates of the vienna convention or infringes upon the convention purpose of ensur ing the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions as representing states.preamble of the vienna convention.although interpretation is not unreasonable,given the substantial deference we owe the state department and the lack of any showing that the state department interpretation either infringes on the purpose of the vienna convention or is disconsonant with its plain language,we hold that the phrase member of the family can reasonably be interpreted to exclude children who have reached years of age and children still in school who have reached the age of.see also iceland steamship,at holding that where state department has wide latitude in interpreting a treaty,a court should defer to the agency reasonable interpretation quotation marks omitted.
having concluded that the state department certification was based on a reasonable interpretation of the vienna convention,we address the issue of its evidentiary weight.the government,as discussed above,argues that such certifications are conclusive on the matter of diplomatic immunity.for support,the government relies upon two supreme court cases from the nineteenth century and more recent circuit court precedent.in in re baiz,the supreme court relied upon a state department certification in finding that an individual was not a foreign minister.in re baiz.the court stated that because article ii of the constitution gave the executive branch the power to send and receive ambassadors,the certificate of the s ecretary of s tate is the best evidence to prove the diplomatic character of a person accredited as a minister.id.at.the court concluded,we do not assume to sit in judgment upon the decision of the executive in reference to the public character of a person claiming to be a foreign minister.id.at.six years prior,in ex parte hitz,the supreme court denied a writ requesting original jurisdiction in the supreme court.at that time,the supreme court possessed original,mandatory jurisdiction over all cases involving ambassadors,but the court relied upon the state department finding that hitz was no longer an accredited diplomat to conclude that the writ was discretionary with the court and denied the writ.ex parte hitz,at.
in cases of more recent vintage,circuit courts have continued to find the state department certification conclusive.see,carrera carrera,noting it is enough that an ambassador has requested immunity,that the state department has recognized that the person is entitled to it,and that the department recognition has been communicated to the court abdulaziz,at finding courts have generally accepted as conclusive the views of the state department as to the fact of diplomatic status.in fact,it appears that no reviewing court has ever held that the state department certification is anything but conclusive.
the only authority that remotely counsels against judicial acceptance of state department findings in the context of diplomatic immunity is gutierrez de martinez lamagno,d.in lamagno,the supreme court held that certifications made by the attorney general under the westfall act,d west,were subject to judicial review.the westfall act provides u pon certification by the attorney general any civil action shall be deemed an action against the united states.d.the court held that b ecause the statute is reasonably susceptible to divergent interpretation,we adopt the reading that accords with traditional understandings and basic principles that executive determinations generally are subject to judicial review.lamagno,at.we do not find lamagno controlling or persuasive here.unlike the westfall act,the traditional view in cases involving diplomatic immunity and the article ii power to send and receive ambassadors is not one of judicial review.instead,the traditional view in these cases,as stated in ex parte hitz and in re baiz,is one of judicial acceptance of the certifications of the state department.moreover,the lamagno court was concerned with the attorney general incentive to grant certification when the united states was immune from suit,thereby shielding a federal employee from liability while not exposing the united states to liability.lamagno,at.the state department has no similar incentive to deny diplomatic immunity to deserving individuals and thereby risk international disfavor.as the supreme court has stated,the certificate of the secretary of state is the best evidence to prove the diplomatic character of a person.in re baiz,at.
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that the state department certification,which is based upon a reasonable interpretation of the vienna convention,is conclusive evidence as to the diplomatic status of an individual.united states kostadinov,cir determining first that individual was not automatically covered by the vienna convention because of his employment in an embassy building and then accepting the state department determination as to whether the individual was a diplomatic agent.thus,we will not review the state department factual determination that,at the time of his arrest,fell outside of the immunities of the vienna convention because he had passed his birthday and he was no longer in school.lacking diplomatic immunity,was subject to the criminal laws of the united states on february,when he was found in possession of a firearm.
next argues that,even assuming the state department was correct that his diplomatic immunity should have expired in,the state department continued to issue him visas after november,and thus continued to certify his diplomatic status.this argument is unavailing.a circular note stated that possession of an visa,standing alone,did not prove the diplomatic status of an immigrant.united states department of state,circular note of october.at.moreover,a publication explained,the only authoritative diplomatic identity document is the identity card issued by the united states department of state.see united states department of state,diplomatic and consular for law enforcement and judicial authorities the guidance.at.an visa,the guidance explained,was merely a document that allowed foreigners linked to diplomatic or humanitarian missions to enter the united states.id.at.we conclude that possession of an visa,standing alone,can not confer diplomatic immunity upon him unfortunately,evidence of diplomatic immunity,his identification card,expired in and was never reissued.accordingly,the state department issuance of an visa to did not confer diplomatic status,and he was subject to the criminal jurisdiction of the united states at the time of his arrest.
also alleges that the state department certification that his diplomatic immunity had lapsed violated his fifth right to due process here,argues that the state depa
