background 
on october,sakar presented for importation into the united states travel chargers for personal digital assistants pdas and for pdas,all of which were products of the people republic of china.upon examination,customs determined that the goods were counterfeit in that they made unauthorized use of two registered united states trademarks.specifically,the travel chargers bore the ul trademark registered to underwriters laboratories,whereas the displayed the flying window trademark of microsoft corporation.customs seized the goods on december,pursuant to its statutory authority under section e of the tariff act of,as amended,e.section e provides in relevant part that any merchandise bearing a counterfeit mark imported into the united states shall be seized and,in the absence of the written consent of the trademark owner,forfeited for violations of the customs laws.in a letter dated december,customs notified sakar of the seizure,and informed sakar that the goods would be disposed of in accordance with unless,within days,the trademark owners consented in writing to the importation of the goods.consent was not received consequently,on august,customs destroyed the goods.
subsequently,customs exercised its discretion under f to impose a civil fine upon sakar customs set the amount of the fine at,which was twice the amount that customs determined to be the manufacturer suggested retail price msrp of the goods in response to a petition filed by sakar,customs mitigated the fine by to.eventually,in a letter dated december,customs adjusted the msrp it had initially used to calculate the fine.this recalculation resulted in a further reduction of the fine to.in the december letter,customs stated that the letter constituted the final administrative review available to sakar and that customs would accept n o further petitions.
following customs action,sakar filed suit in the court of international trade.sakar first amended complaint complaint challenged customs mitigated fine by alleging,among other things,that customs had acted contrary to law in calculating the msrp of the seized goods and in concluding that the goods were counterfeit.sakar,d at.customs eventually moved to dismiss the complaint under uscit rule b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or,alternatively,under uscit rule b for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.id.
sakar complaint purported to base the court of international trade jurisdiction on several different provisions of.the court declined to exercise jurisdiction under all but one of those provisions,concluding that jurisdiction was proper only under section i as it relates to section i.id.at.section i provides in pertinent part as follows 
t he court of international trade shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced against the united states,its agencies,or its officers,that arises out of any law of the united states providing for 
embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the protection of the public health or safety or 
administration and enforcement with respect to the matters referred to in paragraphs of this subsection 
the court concluded that customs seizure of sakar goods amounted to an embargo within the meaning of section i and that the fine issued by customs thus related to the administration and enforcement of an embargo within the meaning of section i.id.at.based upon that conclusion,the court held that it had jurisdiction over sakar claim under section i as it relates to section i.id.
next,the court of international trade considered whether,under uscit rule b,sakar first amended complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted.the court first explained that none of the statutory provisions actually cited by sakar created a cause of action.id.at.consequently,the court reasoned that,if sakar was entitled to bring any claim at all,the claim had to be premised upon the apa right of review provision.section generally entitles any person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute to judicial review thereof.id.however,in the court view,even if sakar first amended complaint had ascribed its cause of action to the it did would have been unable to satisfy the apa requirement of a final agency action under sakar,d at.according to the court,that was because the action taken by customs was neither the consummation of the agency process nor one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.id.at quoting bennett spear,d.
the court explained that,although the december,letter stated it was the final administrative review available to sakar,the letter did not actually represent the consummation of the agency process because customs retained discretion over the ultimate decision of whether or not to sue sakar in a district court in order to collect the fine.id.at.further,the court reasoned,the letter did not determine any legal rights or obligations because the letter expired according to its own terms when sakar failed to pay the fine within days.id.at.by the time sakar initiated its suit in the court of international trade,the mitigated fine set forth in the letter no longer had any legal effect.id.according to the court,any subsequent suit by customs to collect the fine would be a de novo proceeding in federal district court.id.at.thus,the court determined that the findings of fact and conclusions of law customs made during the administrative proceeding are no longer of any binding legal effect.id.at.
because the action taken by customs was not final agency action,the court held that sakar had failed to plead a cause of action that could entitle it to relief under the apa.id.at.moreover,the court found that sakar had not alleged a,constitutional cause of action despite sakar purported due process claim.id.therefore,the court granted the government motion to dismiss sakar first amended complaint under uscit rule b.id.at.
discussion 
we have jurisdiction over sakar appeal pursuant to a.on appeal,sakar argues that the court of international trade erred in dismissing its complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.sakar contends that the administrative fine set forth in customs december,letter was sufficiently final for judicial review by the court of international trade.with respect to the merits of the case,sakar asserts that customs acted contrary to the law in calculating the msrp of the seized goods.the government responds that the court of international trade erred in ruling that it had jurisdiction over sakar suit.at the same time,the government argues that,assuming it had jurisdiction,the court of international trade did not err in dismissing sakar complaint under uscit rule b.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the court of international trade erred in ruling that it had jurisdiction over sakar suit.we therefore vacate the court decision and remand the case to the court with the instruction that it dismiss sakar complaint for lack of jurisdiction.
whether the court of international trade had subject matter jurisdiction over sakar suit is a question of law that we review de novo.int l custom,united states,citing xerox united states.as stated above,the court held that it had jurisdiction over sakar claim under i as it relates to i because customs seizure of sakar goods amounted to an embargo within the meaning of section i and,thus,the fine assessed against sakar by customs related to the administration and enforcement of an embargo within the meaning of section i.sakar,d at.
however,the government,relying upon kmart cartier,d,argues that the seizure of sakar goods did not constitute an embargo.hence,the government urges that the court of international trade erred when it held that it had jurisdiction over sakar claim.
in kmart,the supreme court considered whether a,which makes it unlawful to import into the united states goods bearing a registered trademark without the trademark owner written consent,creates an embargo within the meaning of i.the court concluded that the word embargo should be interpreted according to its ordinary meaning,which is a governmentally imposed the importation of merchandise.id.at.the court explained that a n importation prohibition is not an embargo if rather than reflecting a governmental restriction on the quantity of a particular product that will enter,it merely provides a mechanism by which a private party might,at its own option,enlist the government aid in restricting the quantity of imports in order to enforce a private right.id.emphasis in original.according to the court,section a creates an importation prohibition of the latter type.id.the court reasoned that section a is very different from an embargo because t he trademark owner has the sole authority to decide that all products bearing its trademark will enter or that none will,and to decide what entity may import them,under what conditions,and for what purpose.id.at.
the government argues that the supreme court holding in kmart with respect to a applies with equal force to e,the statutory provision under which the government acted in this case.that is,the government contends that a seizure of goods under section e does not constitute an embargo because it is not a governmentally imposed quantitative restriction on the importation of merchandise.thus,a civil fine issued by customs under section f does not relate to the administration and enforcement of an embargo.for these reasons,the government contends that the court of international trade did not have jurisdiction over sakar claim under section i as it relates to section i.
in response,sakar argues that the court of international trade correctly determined that it had jurisdiction.specifically,sakar distinguishes kmart by urging that section e,unlike section a,constitutes a complete ban on the importation of counterfeit goods.according to sakar,the governmentally imposed restrictions of section e establish an embargo under section i,and,therefore,the fine issued by customs to sakar relates to the administration and enforcement of an embargo under i.thus,sakar contends that section i as it relates to section i provided the court of international trade with jurisdiction over sakar claim.
section i grants the court of international trade exclusive jurisdiction over cases against the united states that arise out of any law providing for embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of merchandise section i,in turn,grants the court of international trade jurisdiction over cases arising out of any law that provides for administration and enforcement with respect to the matters referred to in section i.thus,section i as it relates to section i provides the court of international trade with jurisdiction over cases that arise out of any law providing for the administration and enforcement of an embargo.
the critical question in this case is whether e establishes an embargo.section e provides,in relevant part 
any such merchandise bearing a counterfeit mark within the meaning of section of title imported into the united states in violation of the provisions of section of title,shall be seized and,in the absence of the written consent of the trademark owner,forfeited for violations of the customs laws.
by its terms,section e incorporates provisions of the lanham act in order to identify which imported merchandise customs shall seize.specifically,under,no imported merchandise found to copy or simulate a registered trademark shall be admitted to entry at any customhouse of the united states.
examining these provisions,the court of international trade determined that the import restrictions imposed by sections e and together were sufficiently dissimilar to those imposed by section a that the supreme court kmart decision was not controlling.sakar,d at.in kmart,the supreme court determined that section a did not create an embargo because t he private party,not the government,by deciding whether and how to exercise its private right,determines the quantity of any particular product that can be imported.at.because section a does not create a governmentally imposed import restriction,it does not fall within the plain meaning of embargo.id.here,the court of international trade concluded that section e differs from section a in that it establishes a governmentally imposed prohibition on the importation of counterfeit merchandise.sakar,d at.central to that conclusion was the court belief that the trademark owner,as a private party,does not control whether or not counterfeit merchandise is seized by customs under section e.the court reasoned that section e does not permit the owner of a trademark to import counterfeits of its trademarked merchandise.nor does it permit goods bearing a counterfeit trademark to be released into commerce,even with the consent of the owner of the genuine trademark.id.in short,the court of international trade determined that section e is a governmentally imposed quantitative the importation of merchandise.in the court view,under section e,the government alone,not the private party,determines the quantity of any particular product that can be imported.accordingly,the court held that section e falls within the plain meaning of embargo as set forth in kmart.
we do not agree with the court of international trade interpretation of section e.section e does not constitute a governmentally imposed quantitative limit on importation,because under that provision the trademark owner,not the government,retains ultimate control over whether or not the counterfeit merchandise is imported.in that regard,section e,like section a,merely provides a mechanism by which a private party might,at its own option,enlist the government aid in restricting the quantity of imports in order to enforce a private right,kmart,at,and,thus,does not create an embargo within the meaning of section i.
section e sets forth a two step process.first,any counterfeit merchandise imported in violation of shall be seized by customs.e.only in the absence of written consent from the trademark owner,however,is the merchandise ultimately forfeited.id.customs regulations set forth the specific procedures to be followed once goods are seized.upon seizure of counterfeit merchandise,customs must promptly notify the trademark owner.c.the seized merchandise is subsequently forfeited u nless the trademark owner,within days of notification,provides written consent to importation of the articles,exportation,entry after obliteration of the trademark,or other appropriate disposition id.e.importantly,under this regime,it is the trademark owner that ultimately controls the disposition of the merchandise.at any time within days of notification,the trademark owner may consent to the importation of the seized merchandise.we therefore think that the court of international trade e
