discussion 
we review dismissals pursuant to rule b de novo,taking all the material allegations of the complaint as true and liberally construing the complaint in favor of the plaintiffs.roberts.power light,cir.a court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.hishon king spalding,d.applying this standard,we consider each of the district court rulings in turn.
dismissal of cajuste claims pursuant to the statute of limitations 
under the tvpa and the atca,plaintiffs have ten years from the date the cause of action arose to bring suit for torture,extrajudicial killing and other torts committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.cabello,cir citation omitted see also papa united states,cir holding statute of limitations applies to the tvpa and atca doe islamic salvation front,d,same wiwa royal dutch petroleum,civ,wl,at,same.however,this statute of limitations is subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling.cabello,at see also papa,at hilao estate of marcos,cir.
the detention,beating and torture giving rise to cajuste claims occurred between april and june.as the district court noted,cajuste first filed his tvpa and atca claims on october,over ten years after the cause of action arose.thus,the question before the district court was whether equitable tolling would permit cajuste claim.the district court ruled that it would not and dismissed cajuste complaint saying only that equitable tolling should not be applied in this case.jean,slip op.at.because equitable tolling is clearly legally applicable to the claims,the question on appeal is whether it appears beyond doubt that cajuste can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled.beck deloitte touche,cir.
initially,we note that cajuste has adequately stated a cause of action under the tvpa and atca.he alleges that because he was outspoken about the military regime which seized power during a coup,he was taken by police in april of to the police station and physically beaten with brass knuckles and fists on his back,abdomen,arms and face.as a result,he lost consciousness and remained in a cell without medical treatment,a toilet or room to move,and with little food or water for three days.after a united nations official demanded cajuste be removed from prison,he was moved to a military hospital,where he remained until approximately june.
cajuste further alleges that from to the defendant dorélien was a colonel in the haitian military and was chief of personnel or assistant chief of staff in,a position that made him responsible for military personnel,including the management,supervision,discipline and administration of military justice.as alleged in the second amended complaint,dorélien remained in power,holding that position until september,when the military regime was removed under threat from the united states.dorélien,cajuste claims,arrived in the united states sometime after he fled haiti in september thus,cajuste claims that because dorélien was in power until as well as not physically present in the united states,the statute of limitations must be tolled until at least.we agree.
equitable tolling is appropriate when a movant untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.sandvik united states,cir citing irwin department of veterans affairs,d cabello,at calderon united states dist,cir.
first,pursuant to the tvpa,the statute of limitations must be tolled at least until dorélien entered the united states and personal jurisdiction could be obtained over him.see,at stating that only defendants over which a court in the united states has personal jurisdiction may be sued.in considering the tvpa,the senate report stated 
the statute of limitations should be tolled during the time the defendant was absent from the united states or from any jurisdiction in which the same or a similar action arising from the same facts may be maintained by the plaintiff,provided that the remedy in that jurisdiction is adequate and available.
at see also hilao,at the senate report on the tvpa states that the statute is subject to equitable tolling,including for periods in which the defendant is absent from the jurisdiction.
second,cajuste has alleged sufficient facts to equitably toll the statute of limitations until dorélien was removed from power.cajuste claims i the military regime was characterized by widespread state sponsored human rights violations,including abuses committed by the haitian armed forces,resulting in the death of thousands of haitians ii that he and the union organizations he worked with were targets of human rights abuses committed by the haitian armed forces iii that he was well known throughout haiti for his unionist activities advocating against the military regime and that the military forces,under dorélien control would sack cities and attack civilians it believed were not supporting the military regime iv that during this time,he,his mother,daughter,two brothers and a sister were living in haiti under the military regime v that this campaign of repression and the threat of retaliation continued throughout the period of military rule and the regime did not lose its grip over haiti until september and vi that it was not until october that the democratically elected government regained power.
we find these allegations sufficient to support a claim of equitable tolling.congress acknowledged that plaintiffs face unique impediments such as reprisals from death squads and immunity of government officials in bringing human rights litigation.litigation will often not be possible until there has been a regime change in the plaintiff country of origin,after which the plaintiff can investigate and compile evidence without fear of reprisals against him,his family and witnesses.see also,pt,at the general collapse of democratic institutions characteristic of countries scourged by massive violations of fundamental rights rarely leaves the judiciary intact.the tvpa would respons d to this situation.collett socialist peoples libyan arab jamahiriya,d,relying on senate report instruction mandating equitable tolling to conclude that the statute of limitations for the plaintiffs claims must be tolled to begin when the defendants were stripped of their immunity.see generally ellis motors acceptance,cir to decide whether and how equitable tolling applies to federal statutes of limitations,courts examine the purposes and policies underlying the limitation provision,the act itself,and the remedial scheme developed for the enforcement of the act internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
we note that every court that has considered the question of whether a civil war and a repressive authoritarian regime constitute extraordinary circumstances which toll the statutes of limitations of the atca and tvpa has answered in the affirmative.see,hilao,at tolling statute of limitations for claims of torture,disappearance,and summary execution against former philippine dictator ferdinand marcos until he left power and the country regained democratic rule doe saravia,d,tolling statutes of limitations during and after el salvadoran civil war due to fear of retaliation from military,government and death squads if plaintiffs brought litigation in united states doe unocal,atca and tvpa claims should be tolled during burmese dictatorship based on plaintiffs alleged inability to obtain access to judicial review in burma and the threat of reprisal from the government if plaintiffs attempted to access courts in the united states forti,plaintiffs raised issue of fact that equitable tolling applied during argentine military rule given the pervasiveness of military reign of terror.
thus,the district court erred in finding that equitable tolling should not be applied in this case.the pattern and practice of torture,mass murder,intimidation and reprisals against perceived opponents of the government during the military regime in haiti from to as alleged in cajuste complaint clearly qualify as extraordinary circumstances to toll the statute of limitations until dorélien was removed from his position,the repressive security forces were dismantled and the democratically elected government resumed power.because cajuste filed his claims on october,he filed within ten years of the statute of limitations being tolled,and his claims as alleged are therefore,timely.
dismissal of jean claim for failure to exhaust remedies 
the district court dismissed jean complaint pursuant to the provision of the tvpa stating that,a court shall decline to hear a claim if the claimant has not exhausted adequate and available remedies in the place in which the conduct giving rise to the claim occurred.b.we reverse the district court determination for several reasons.
first,the exhaustion requirement does not apply to the atca.see kadic karadzic,cir abiola abubakar,d,sarei rio tinto plc,d,see also jama,d,there is nothing in the atca which limits its application to situations where there is no relief available under domestic law.accordingly,the exhaustion requirement should not have been applied to jean atca claim against dorélien.
second,the exhaustion requirement pursuant to the tvpa is an affirmative defense,requiring the defendant to bear the burden of proof see hilao,at,estate of rodriquez drummond,d,citing wiwa royal dutch petroleum,wl,at,sinaltrainal v.the coca cola,wl.march.this burden of proof is substantial.the senate report to the tvpa specifically stated 
t he committee recognizes that in most instances the initiation of litigation under this legislation will be virtually prima facie evidence that the claimant has exhausted his or her remedies in the jurisdiction in which the torture occurred.the committee believes that courts should approach cases brought under the proposed legislation with this assumption 
more specifically,the exhaustion requirement should be informed by general principles of international law.the procedural practice of international human rights tribunals generally holds that the respondent has the burden of raising the nonexhaustion of remedies as an affirmative defense and must show that domestic remedies exist that the claimant did not use.once the defendant makes a showing of remedies abroad which have not been exhausted,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to rebut by showing that the local remedies were ineffective,unobtainable,unduly prolonged,inadequate,or obviously futile.the ultimate burden of proof and persuasion on the issue of exhaustion of remedies,however,lies with the defendant.
at emphasis added see enahoro abubakar,cir t o the extent that there is any doubt both congress and international tribunals have mandated that doubts concerning the tvpa and exhaustion are to be resolved in favor of the plaintiffs.barrueto larios,d,citing mehinovic vuckovic,d,wiwa,wl,at holding that defendant raising tvpa exhaustion defense did not meet initial burden of demonstrating that plaintiffs had not exhausted alternative and adequate remedies in nigeria cabiri,noting that the legislative history of the tvpa indicates that the exhaustion requirement was not intended to create a prohibitively stringent condition precedent to recovery under the statute xuncax gramajo,holding that when foreign remedies are unobtainable,ineffective,inadequate,or obviously futile,exhaustion pursuant to tvpa is not required quoting.
in finding that jean had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies,the district court relied exclusively on an affidavit reflecting that jean had obtained a legally binding judgement in haiti against dorélien.however,the district court failed to consider jean allegations and assertions that this judgment is ineffective and currently unenforceable in haiti.jean alleges that several years after the removal of the military regime in late,haiti established a tribunal to try those responsible for atrocities during the military regime.in this tribunal,dorélien was tried in absentia for the raboteau massacre,in which the haitian army and paramilitary groups attacked the civilian population in raboteau,haiti.during this attack,the military opened fire,as jean husband,michel pierre,and others tried to flee by boat.michel pierre and at least unarmed civilians were killed and more than fifty homes were destroyed.in november a haitian court found dorélien liable for the raboteau massacre.
however,jean claims that events have changed drastically since the november judgement against dorélien.in,a violent rebellion broke out,in which dorélien was freed from and returned to a position of power.jean alleges that the house of the prosecutor who prosecuted dorélien for the raboteau massacre was burned and armed men attacked the haitian judge who presided over the raboteau massacre trial.jean also cited an amnesty international report finding that former members of the military regime,including dorélien,threaten the current rule of law in haiti.
in his brief,dorélien does not dispute that there was a recent violent rebellion,that dorélien was freed during the rebellion or that dorélien was returned to a position of power.moreover,he does not dispute that those involved with prosecuting him for the raboteau massacre have been targets of violence,nor does he assert that the political structure is such that jean could presently file her claims in haiti and be successful.in short,dorélien has not in any way met the requisite burden of proof to support an affirmative defense of nonexhaustion of remedies and the district court erred in failing to require him to do so.moreover,the motion at issue was a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,not a motion for summary judgement for these reasons,we reverse the district court dismissal of jean complaint.
