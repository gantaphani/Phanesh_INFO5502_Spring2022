farhan warfaa alleges that in,a group of soldiers kidnapped him from his home in northern somalia.over the next several months,warfaa claims he was beaten,tortured,shot,and ultimately left for dead at the direction of yusuf ali,a colonel in the somali national army at the time.warfaa later sued ali under the alien tort statute ats,and the torture victim protection act of tvpa,stat.codified at note,alleging several violations of international law.
after lifting a stay,the district court dismissed warfaa ats claims,finding they did not sufficiently touch and concern the united states so as to establish jurisdiction in united states courts under kiobel royal dutch petroleum,d.the district court allowed warfaa tvpa claims to proceed after holding that ali was not entitled to immunity as a foreign official.both warfaa and ali appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
throughout the,somalia experienced a period of political upheaval a military dictatorship led by siad barre controlled the country government,and barre dictatorship employed violence and intimidation to maintain control and stay in power.among other things,the somali government targeted members of certain opposition clans through killings,torture,and property destruction.warfaa clan,the isaaq,was targeted.
ali supported the barre regime and commanded the fifth battalion of the somali national army stationed in gebiley,the area where warfaa lived.early one morning in december,two armed soldiers from the fifth battalion appeared at warfaa hut,rousted him from his sleep,and forced him to a nearby collection point.there,warfaa and several other local farmers learned that they were accused of supporting an opposition organization,the somali national movement snm.soldiers then forced the men to march to another village where an army truck drove them to fifth battalion headquarters.some of the other farmers were freed,but warfaa,as a member of the isaaq clan,was detained and placed in a small,windowless cell with ten other prisoners.
warfaa alleges he was subjected to many acts of violence during his detention at the direction of ali.for instance,warfaa claims that soldiers hit him with the butt of a gun,tied him in a painful position,kicked him,and stripped him naked.he was taken to ali office,where ali personally questioned him about his supposed support of snm and his rumored involvement in the theft of a water truck.later,soldiers again stripped warfaa naked,beat him to unconsciousness,woke him with cold water,and then beat him again.once more,ali interrogated warfaa after this torture,this time with warfaa hands and feet chained.during the early months of,ali and his soldiers committed similar acts of torture against warfaa at least nine times.
in march,snm fighters attacked fifth battalion headquarters while ali was interrogating warfaa.after ordering his soldiers to defend the base,ali shot warfaa in the wrist and leg,causing him to fall unconscious.ali thought he had killed warfaa and ordered his guards to bury the body.when warfaa regained consciousness,however,he convinced the guards to accept a bribe,and they released him.warfaa still resides in somalia today.
the barre regime collapsed in,but ali had departed the country in advance of the fall and immigrated to canada in december.canada deported ali two years later for serious human rights abuses,and he then came to the united states.the united states began deportation proceedings soon thereafter,but ali voluntarily left the country in.for reasons not explained in the record,ali returned to the united states in december and now resides in alexandria,virginia 
warfaa,identified only as a john doe,and a jane doe originally filed suit against ali in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia in.plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the complaint and refiled it in june.
for most of its duration,this case has been stayed.in august,the district court stayed the case until a party could provide a declaration from the united states department of state indicating that the action would not interfere with foreign policy.in april,after the case briefly resumed,the district court granted a consent motion to further stay the case pending the supreme court decision in kiobel.after the supreme court issued its kiobel decision in april,the district court again extended the stay and invited the state department to express its view as to whether the issues before the court would affect united states foreign policy.the state department decline d to express views on the subject and,upon further request,explained that it was not in a position to present views to the court concerning this matter at this time.
on april,the district court lifted the stay and ordered warfaa to file an amended complaint.warfaa amended complaint contains six counts attempted extrajudicial killing torture cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment or punishment arbitrary detention crimes against humanity and war crimes.all six counts allege torts purportedly committed in violation of international law,with jurisdiction arising under the ats.in addition,the first two counts attempted extrajudicial killing and torture are alleged to violate the tvpa,which provides a jurisdictional basis separate from the ats.see note kiobel.at kennedy,concurring noting the tvpa addresses human rights abuses committed abroad.
ali filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b.although the motion did not address kiobel,the district court subsequently ordered warfaa to explain at a scheduled hearing why his ats claims were not barred by the supreme court ruling.see.at the hearing on the motion to dismiss,the district court stated that it was going to dismiss the ats claims from this case on the basis of kiobel because t here is absolutely no connection between the united states and ali conduct in somalia.it further indicated that it was not inclined to dismiss the tvpa claims.
in a subsequent written opinion,the district court granted ali motion to dismiss as to the ats claims,but denied the motion as to the tvpa claims.the district court dismissed the ats claims because such claims,generally speaking,must be based on violations occurring on american soil.in this case,however,all the relevant conduct occurred in somalia,carried out by a defendant who at the time was not a citizen or resident of the united states.id the district court rejected ali motion to dismiss the tvpa counts,concluding that ali could not claim official acts immunity because his alleged acts violated jus cogens norms 
both parties timely appealed.ali appeals the district court decision to reject the defendant plea of common law immunity from suit.see yousuf samantar,cir explaining that a foreign official is entitled to lodge an immediate appeal from a pretrial order denying him common law immunity.warfaa appeals from the final judgment on the ats claims.this court has jurisdiction under.
whether the ats bars claims related to extraterritorial conduct presents an issue of subject matter jurisdiction,al shimari caci premier,cir,which the court considers de novo.johnson am.towers,llc,cir.likewise,the district court denial of foreign official immunity presents a question of law that the court must decide de novo.see smith ray,cir reviewing a district court decision to deny qualified immunity de novo wye oak,repub.of iraq,cir considering a question of immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act de novo.
the ats does not expressly provide any causes of action.kiobel.at.rather,it grants district courts original jurisdiction over any civil action by an alien for a tort committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.
passed as part of the judiciary act of,the ats was invoked twice in the late century,but then only once more over the next years.kiobel.at.after,ats claims became more common,often relying on the second circuit decision in filártiga peña irala,cir.in that case,the second circuit applied the ats to a claim of torture committed abroad,with all of the acts involving foreign nationals.id.at.filártiga opened the door to more ats claims and launched modern ats litigation,perry bechky,homage to filártiga,litig,but recent supreme court decisions have significantly limited,if not rejected,the applicability of the filártiga rationale.see kiobel.at holding that ats includes implicit geographic limits sosa alvarez machain,d holding federal courts can not recognize claims brought via the ats unless plaintiffs premise those claims on specific,universal,and obligatory international norms 
alien plaintiffs,like warfaa,have sought to invoke the ats as a means to seek relief for alleged international violations.the supreme court has explained,however,the reach of the ats is narrow and strictly circumscribed.kiobel.at.
in kiobel,the supreme court considered whether an ats claim may reach conduct occurring in the territory of a foreign sovereign.id.the answer,for the most part,is no,as the supreme court has applied a presumption against extraterritorial application.id.the presumption provides that when a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application,it has none,and reflects the presumption that united states law governs domestically but does not rule the world.id.a court that applies the ats extraterritorially risks interference in united states foreign policy.id.at t he principles underlying the presumption similarly constrain courts considering causes of action that may be brought under the ats.accordingly,in kiobel,the petitioners case seeking relief for violations of the law of nations occurring outside the united states wa s barred.id.at.the supreme court emphasized that the ats can create jurisdiction for such claims only where they touch and concern united states territory with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application.id.
this court has applied kiobel only once,in al shimari caci premier,cir.in that case,four plaintiffs sued an american military contractor and several of its employees who were alleged to be american citizens directly responsible for abusive mistreatment and torture at the abu ghraib prison in iraq.id.at.we recognized that the clear implication of the supreme court touch and concern language is that courts should not assume that the presumption categorically bars cases that manifest a close connection to united states territory.id.at.to find that the presumption against extraterritoriality applies,it is not sufficient merely to say that the actual injuries were inflicted abroad.id.instead,courts should conduct a analysis.id.
applying this analytical framework,we found that the al shimari plaintiffs alleged extensive relevant conduct in united states territory,which distinguished their case from kiobel.id.based on that extensive relevant conduct,the plaintiffs claims sufficiently touch ed and concern ed the united states to establish jurisdiction under the ats id.at.
al shimari thus is best read to note that the presumption against ats extraterritorial application is not irrefutable.a plaintiff may rebut the presumption in certain,narrow circumstances when extensive united states contacts are present and the alleged conduct bears such a strong and direct connection to the united states that it falls within kiobel limited touch and concern language.the usual case will not present the strong and direct touches we recognized in al shimari.
an ats claim premised on no relevant conduct in the united states will fit within the heartland of cases to which the extraterritoriality presumption applies.doe drummond,cir i f no relevant aspects of an ats claim occur within the united states,the presumption against extraterritoriality prevents jurisdiction.mujica airscan,cir the allegations that form the basis of plaintiffs claims exclusively concern conduct that occurred in colombia.chowdhury worldtel bangl.holding,cir a ll the relevant conduct set forth in plaintiff complaint occurred in bangladesh,and therefore plaintiff claim brought under the ats is barred.cardona chiquita brands int l,cir holding that the presumption applied because the alleged torture occurred outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states balintulo daimler ag,cir kiobel forecloses the plaintiffs claims because the plaintiffs have failed to allege that any relevant conduct occurred in the united states.
warfaa asks the court to apply kiobel and al shimari to permit a claim against a resident,ali,arising out of conduct that occurred solely abroad.we analyze that claim by beginning with kiobel strong presumption against extraterritorial application of the ats,recognizing al shimari is the rare case to rebut the presumption.
warfaa claims fall squarely within the ambit of kiobel broad presumption against extraterritorial application of the ats as with kiobel,in this case,all of the relevant conduct took place outside the united states,in somalia.kiobel.at.nothing in this case involved citizens,the government,entities,or events in the united states.the alleged campaign of torture and intimidation was launched,managed and controlled by the somali army.ali inflicted all the injuries against warfaa in somalia.warfaa ultimate escape thus ending the violation occurred in somalia,as well.
the only purported touch in this case is the happenstance of ali residence in the united states long after the alleged events of abuse mere happenstance of residency,lacking any connection to the relevant conduct,is not a cognizable consideration in the ats context.see kiobel.at indicating the defendant mere presence in the united states does not afford jurisdiction.kiobel resort to the presumption against extraterritoriality extinguishes ats cases with foreign parties and conduct,at least where all of the relevant conduct occurs outside the united states,even when the perpetrator later moves to the united states.bechky,supra,at 
in sum,warfaa has pled no claim which touches and concerns the united states to support ats jurisdiction.the district court thus did not err in granting ali motion to dismiss the ats counts in the complaint for lack of jurisdiction 
the district court allowed warfaa tvpa claims to go forward,finding ali lacked foreign official immunity for jus cogens violations under yousuf samantar,cir.in samantar,we held that foreign official immunity could not be claimed for jus cogens violations,even if the acts were performed in the defendant official capacity.id.ali does not contest that the misdeeds alleged in the complaint violate jus cogens norms he concedes that they do.rather,his challenge is a simple one samantar was wrongly decided,and jus cogens violations deserve immunity.
ali would have us overrule samantar entirely,but that course is not open to us.one panel decision is binding,not only upon the district court,but also upon another panel of this and until it is reconsidered en banc.doe charleston area med,cir see also,united states spinks,cir.true,the court has the statutory and constitutional power to reconsider its own decisions.mcmellon united states,cir en banc.but we have decided collectively not to exercise that power as a matter of prudence outside the en banc context.id.the district court properly concluded samantar forecloses ali claim to foreign official immunity.
for the reasons described above,the district court correctly held that warfaa ats claims lacked a sufficient nexus with the united states to establish jurisdiction over those claims.the district court also correctly rejected ali claim of foreign official immunity.the district court judgment is therefore 
i write separately to dissent from part iii of the majority opinion,as i would hold that the supreme court decision in kiobel royal dutch petroleum,d,does not foreclose the possibility of relief under the alien tort statute ats here.
in kiobel,a group of nigerian political asylees brought suit against royal dutch petroleum company,shell transport and trading company,and their joint subsidiary,shell petroleum development company of nigeria,alleging that these companies aided and abetted the nigerian government in committing human rights abuses against them.at.the defendants only contacts with the united states were listings on the new york stock exchange and an affiliation with a public relations office in new york.mujica airscan,cir citing kiobel.at id.at breyer,concurring.the court explained that c orporations are often present in many countries,and it would reach too far to say that mere corporate presence suffices to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality.kiobel.at.the court,however,was careful to leave open a number of significant questions regarding the reach and interpretation of the alien tort statute.id.kennedy,concurring.
following kiobel,a number of our sister circuits have considered and rejected ats claims brought against corporations and their corporate officers for aiding and abetting foreign actors who commit human rights abuses.see citing doe drummond,cir chowdhury worldtel bangladesh holding,cir cardona chiquita brands int l,cir mujica,at balintulo daimler ag,cir.but no circuit court has decided a ats case premised on principal liability brought against an individual defendant who has sought safe haven in the united states,a key difference the majority does not address.this is not to suggest that kiobel applies only to corporate defendants,see,but that the analysis and relevant considerations may differ where the defendant is a natural person.
several cases brought prior to kiobel considered situations involving individual,more akin to those presented here.in filartiga pena irala,cir,two paraguayan citizens brought an action against pena irala pena,a paraguayan police officer,for the torture and death of a relative.pena had come to the united states,overstayed his visitor visa,and had been residing in the united states for over nine months when one of the plaintiffs served him with a summons and civil complaint.id.at.while acknowledging that the alien tort statute ha d rarely been the basis for jurisdiction during its long history,the second circuit found little doubt that the action was properly in federal court.id.at.this is undeniably an action by an alien,for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations.id.thus,jurisdiction under the ats was proper.id.at see also kadic karadzic,cir finding jurisdiction for ats claims brought by croat and muslim citizens of bosnia herzegovina against bosnian serb leader for violations of the law of nations committed during the bosnian civil war in re estate of ferdinand marcos human rights,cir finding jurisdiction for ats claim brought by philippine citizen against former philippine official for violations of the law of nations committed abroad.
the majority states that recent supreme court decisions have significantly limited,if not rejected,the applicability of the filartiga rationale.citing kiobel.at sosa alvarez machain,d.nothing in those opinions,however,explicitly overrules filartiga or its progeny.in fact,the supreme court in sosa referred to filartiga and marcos with approval,suggesting that the ats allowed a claim for relief in such circumstances.kiobel.at breyer,concurring citing sosa,at.even congress has recognized that filartiga was met with general approval,pt,at,at.therefore,filartiga is still good law,and its reasoning is instructive here.
this case involves allegations of serious violations of international law committed by a natural person who has sought safe haven within our borders and includes claims that are not covered by the torture victim protection act nor the reasoning and holding of kiobel.id.at kennedy,concurring.thus,the proper implementation of the presumption against extraterritorial application in this case requires further elaboration and explanation.id.blithely relying on the fact that the human rights abuses occurred abroad ignores the myriad ways in which this claim touches and concerns the territory of the united states.
as the majority correctly states,claims are cognizable under the ats where they touch and concern the territory of the united states with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application.citing kiobel.at.the supreme court use of claim rather than conduct to describe the circumstances in which the presumption may be displaced,however,suggest s that courts must consider all the facts that give rise to ats claims,including the parties identities and their relationship to the causes of action.al shimari caci premier,cir.
if we consider,as we must,a broader range of facts than the location where the plaintiff actually sustained his injuries,there are three facts that distinguish this case from kiobel.id.at.first,ali status as a lawful permanent resident alone distinguishes this case from kiobel,where the corporate defendant was merely present.kiobel.at.this court found a defendant citizenship status to be a relevant touch in al shimari,where we observed that such case s do not present any potential problems associated with bringing foreign nationals into united states courts to answer for conduct committed abroad,given that the defendants are united states citizens.al shimari,at citing sexual minorities uganda lively,d,holding that kiobel did not bar ats claims against an american citizen,in part because t his is not a case where a foreign national is being hailed into an unfamiliar court to defend himself.to the extent that we rely on citizenship status as a factor,we do so in the good company of our dear colleagues sitting on this very court.see.as a legal permanent resident,ali has a binding tie to the united states and its court system.yousuf samantar,cir see also id.at finding relevant the fact that residents who enjoy the protections of law ordinarily should be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts.
second,ali residence in this country is not mere happenstance.ali was in the united states when he realiz ed that the barre regime was about to fall.decl.of ali,br.in supp.of def.renewed mot.to dismiss at,warfaa ali,d cv,ecf.he initially sought refugee status in canada.id.at.canada deported ali back to the united states for gross human rights abuses committed in somalia.id.at.when confronted with deportation proceedings upon entering the united states,he voluntarily departed,only to return two years later on a spousal visa.decl.of ali.in,ali was confronted with deportation proceedings yet again but prevailed at trial to have proceedings terminated.id.at.the government did not appeal.id.he has been living here as a lawful permanent resident,availing himself of the benefits and privileges of residency since.
lastly,when the alleged acts of torture took place,ali was serving as a commander in the somali national army.in that same capacity,he received extensive military training,on numerous occasions,in the united states.the details of these contacts,which took place prior to and following the alleged acts,are laid out by ali himself in a declaration to the district court in,ali received special military training with the officers advanced military course at fort benning,georgia.decl.of ali,br.in supp.of def.renewed mot.to dismiss at,warfaa ali,d cv,ecf.later that year,he returned to fort benning where he completed six months of intensive military training.id.at.in,he was invited by a representative of the defense intelligence agency to pursue further military training at fort leavenworth,where he spent a year,before returning to somalia in july of.id.finally,he received training in management studies with the air force at keesler air force base a mere two years after the acts alleged against him in this case.id.at.this is not to suggest that the government condoned or endorsed defendant conduct,but these contacts are clearly relevant to a test that requires us to consider whether a claim touch es and concern s the territory of the united states.kiobel.at.when pressed at oral argument,even counsel for ali did not deny that a prior relationship,such as the military training at issue here,would perhaps be something to consider as part of the touch and concern inquiry.oral argument at.
whatever the extent of the relationship between ali and the military,it can not be fairly said that t he only purported touch in this case is the happenstance of ali residence in t
