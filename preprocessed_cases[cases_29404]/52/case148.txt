stephen lee lee or defendant,an american citizen,appeals from a february,amended judgment of conviction entered by the united states district court for the eastern district of new york allyne ross,judge.in this appeal we consider whether the district court erred in denying lee motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to wiretap orders executed against him abroad by a jamaican law enforcement agency where that agency had a close and ongoing collaboration with its united states counterpart and whether the district court erred in denying lee motion to compel the application materials and other documentation underlying those foreign wiretap orders.we hold that ongoing,formalized collaboration between an american law enforcement agency and its foreign counterpart does not,by itself,give rise to an agency relationship between the two entities sufficient to implicate the fourth amendment abroad.we further conclude that the fourth amendment exclusionary rule does not impose a duty upon american law enforcement officials to review the legality,under foreign law,of applications for surveillance authority considered by foreign courts.lee was not,therefore,entitled to discovery of the wiretap application materials,submitted by jamaican law enforcement to courts in that nation,underlying the electronic surveillance abroad.
as a result,we hold that the district court correctly denied lee motion to suppress the fruits of the foreign wiretaps and his motion to compel the documentation underlying the foreign wiretap orders.we also hold that lee amended judgment of conviction was supported by sufficient evidence and that the district court properly admitted expert testimony at lee trial regarding the values and quantities of marijuana generally used by drug traffickers in the course of distribution.accordingly,we affirm the amended judgment of the district court.
background 
following a jury trial,lee was convicted of conspiring to distribute kilograms or more of marijuana knowing that it would be unlawfully imported into the united states,in violation of,c,and b g and conspiring to import kilograms or more of marijuana,in violation of,a.the jury acquitted lee on two other counts,relating to the importation and distribution of a single load of marijuana in october.
prior to his trial,lee was the subject of parallel investigations in the united states and jamaica.it is undisputed that significant,formalized law enforcement cooperation existed between the two countries in the pursuit of drug trafficking investigations.the two nations signed a memorandum of understanding mou in to establish a program in which jamaican law enforcement officers,inter alia,would monitor intercepted phone conversations authorized by jamaican court orders for purposes of both countries gathering evidence or leads to obtain evidence in narcotics investigations.to this end,the united states agreed to provide surveillance equipment and training to officers for a jamaica constabulary force narcotics division vetted unit vu.the mou likewise contemplated that the jamaican government would provide the fruits of wiretaps to the united states in a format,on a disc that the drug enforcement agency dea could use as evidence in american courts.
in may,the vu began investigating shipments by an international marijuana trafficking organization of which lee was a member,and eventually seized a large shipment of the drug bound for the united states in september.the vu notified the dea of this seizure,and the dea began investigating the same organization as well.in the months that followed,the vu and dea ran parallel investigations of this organized marijuana trafficking activity,which included shipments originating in jamaica and arriving at destinations in the new york area.lee arranged for the clearance of these shipments which generally attempted to cloak and intersperse thousands of pounds of marijuana among common items of jamaican produce through customs,and for their distribution within the united states 
during the course of a subsequent investigation,which took place from october to february,jamaican authorities,with authorization from that country supreme court,intercepted wire communications on several telephones in jamaica.lee was not a target of this surveillance,but he was captured speaking about drug shipments to individuals in jamaica who were targets.some conversations intercepted by jamaican authorities were used to obtain further electronic surveillance warrants in the united states directed at other members of the marijuana trafficking organization intercepted conversations were also presented to the grand jury in the proceedings that led to indictments against lee.lee sought to suppress the government recordings of the intercepted conversations at his trial in the eastern district of new york,claiming that jamaican authorities had acted as virtual agents of the dea.relying on our decision in united states maturo,cir,the district court denied lee suppression motion,reasoning that the mere fact that an mou existed,information was shared and the dea provided money,training and equipment does not warrant a finding of agency between the dea and jamaican law enforcement.
lee also moved to compel the government to disclose the application materials submitted by jamaican law enforcement to courts in that country requesting authority to conduct electronic surveillance.specifically,lee sought these materials for the purpose of demonstrating that an agency relationship existed between american law enforcement and its jamaican counterparts.the government averred that the materials were not in its possession and that,despite diligent efforts,it had been unable to obtain them.relying on our decision in united states paternina vergara,cir,the district court reasoned that,even if american and jamaican law enforcement officials had jointly investigated lee,american law enforcement officials would still only be required to make a good faith effort to obtain items in the possession of a foreign government and that,on the facts of this case,the government had fulfilled that obligation based on its finding of efforts,the district court denied lee motion to compel the documentation underlying the jamaican wiretap applications.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,lee asserts that the district court erred by failing to suppress the evidence obtained abroad through jamaican wiretap orders and,relatedly,that it erred in failing to compel the government to procure and provide the supporting documentation used by the jamaican law enforcement agents in seeking those orders.lee also argues that,even including the evidence obtained through the jamaican wiretap orders,the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction,and he claims that the district court erred in admitting certain expert testimony regarding the values and quantities of marijuana generally used by drug traffickers.
we first consider whether the district court erred by failing to suppress evidence obtained abroad by the vu and other jamaican law enforcement agencies.in addressing this claim,we review the district court factual findings for clear error,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,and review the district court legal conclusions de novo.see united states moreno,cir.
more than two decades ago,we held that w hen conducted in this country,wiretaps by federal officials are largely governed by title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of,see,but that this statute does not apply outside the united states.maturo,at.it is also that the fourth amendment exclusionary rule,which requires that evidence seized in violation of the fourth amendment must be suppressed,generally does not apply to evidence obtained by searches abroad conducted by foreign officials.see united states janis,d it is well established,of course,that the exclusionary rule,as a deterrent sanction,is not applicable where a private party or a foreign government commits the offending act.we held as long ago as that information furnished to american officials by foreign police need not be excl
