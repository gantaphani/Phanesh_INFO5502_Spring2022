ford motor company appeals from a decision of the united states court of international trade holding ford liable for negligent misrepresentation of the value of import entries and imposing a penalty of.united states ford motor,d.int l trade negligence decision.ford timely filed a notice of appeal on september.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
background 
ford is a major importer of automobiles and automobile parts from all over the world.this case deals with ford importation practices,and specifically with its methods for handling the declaration of value for imported goods the price of which is subject to change after importation.
assists and direct payments 
two concepts lie at the heart of the case.the first,assist,is defined by statute as materials,components,parts,and similar items incorporated in the imported merchandise that is provided free of charge or at a reduced cost,by the buyer of imported merchandise for use in connection with the production or sale for export to the united states of the imported merchandise.h.an assist might consist of,for example,design or engineering work provided overseas by the to the seller that is not factored into the invoice price.the value of the assists is subject to import duties pursuant to b c.
the trial court found,and ford does not dispute,that assists relating to a particular model year vehicle or component typically occur long before entry of the actual merchandise.negligence decision,d at.during the years at issue,ford maintained an internal program whereby it gathered information about assists at the time of importation and paid all duties related to such assists on the first entry of the related merchandise.id.despite this program,it appears that ford failed to report significant numbers of assists until years after the related merchandise entered the united states.in,ford disclosed to what was then the united states customs service customs the existence of previously undisclosed assists relating to numerous entries in the years.id.at.
the second concept is direct or payments,which are payments of money by the importer to the seller separate usually subsequent payment of the original price but that relate directly to the purchase price of the imported item.a typical payment might represent amounts owed to the seller under a clause,pursuant to which the final cost of the item varies with some extrinsic index or factor,and requires a payment after the fact.payments,like assists,are dutiable under the import laws as part of the the total payment for imported merchandise for purposes of b.
ford supply agreements with many of its overseas vendors contained price adjustments,which typically provided a per vehicle or vehicle component base price subject to possible modifications.id.at.ford knew that the prices of imported merchandise,although fairly firm upon importation,could change after importation pursuant to the supply agreements.during the years at issue,ford internal compliance procedures stated that upon entry t he invoice must be priced so that the true value can be ascertained.in the event that the value is not completely and correctly shown,a provisional disclaimer is stated on the invoice,thereby advising c ustoms of the possibility that the entry price was.id.at.the record indicates,however,that despite this policy ford invoices in the disputed period did not disclose the provisional nature of invoice prices.
in,ford and customs entered into an agreement that altered ford reporting obligations relating to direct payments the reconciliation agreement.the reconciliation agreement permitted ford to report all payments relating to a particular model year in a single disclosure filed at the end of the model year in question.the exact scope of the reconciliation agreement,and the timing of disclosures made pursuant to it,are the subject of dispute between the parties,and are discussed in detail below.
customs investigation and complaint 
customs initiated operation hat trick in the early to identify undeclared assists and indirect payments made by the big three automakers,to determine the level of culpability of parties responsible for the failure to declare the,and to refer cases for criminal and civil action as appropriate.negligence decision,d at.on may,customs notified ford by letter that a formal investigation was underway concerning the proper declaration of assists and indirect payments in imports of vehicles and vehicle component assemblies.id.at.on june,at ford request,the parties met to clarify the meaning of indirect payments as it was used in the notice of investigation.id.the substance of the discussions held at the meeting are the subject of dispute in this appeal.the trial court concluded that,following the meeting,ford knew or should have known that the term indirect payment included all payments that impacted the final price paid by ford for the merchandise in question,including payments made directly by ford to foreign suppliers.id.at.the trial court also found as fact that ford was advised by customs that the investigation would encompass entries made between through the model year,but would not include entries for model years or later.id.at.both of these findings are discussed in detail below.
the government filed its complaint in the court of international trade on january,charging ford with violation of,which provides that no person,by fraud,gross negligence,or negligence,may enter any merchandise into the commerce of the united states by means of any document,information,statement,act,or omission which is material and false.a.the government allegations center on alleged omissions from ford entry documents under,which requires importers to file with customs information about entered merchandise,including the declared value,classification and rate of duty applicable to the merchandise,and such other information as is necessary to enable the customs service to properly assess duties on the merchandise.a b.the government alleges that ford entry documents were materially false to the extent that they assigned to merchandise a concrete value that ford knew was likely to change pursuant to provisions in the sale contracts.the government further alleges that,regardless of whether ford had an affirmative duty to disclose the provisional nature of its pricing,it had an affirmative obligation to inform customs at once when it became aware that the declared values were incorrect,but failed to do so.a stating that every importer making an entry under shall make a declaration under oath,stating,inter alia,t hat the prices set forth in the invoice are true,that all other statements in the invoice or other documents filed with the entry,or in the entry itself,are true and correct,and that he will produce at once to the appropriate customs officer any invoice,paper,letter,document,or information received showing that any such prices or statements are not true or correct ford denied the allegations and counterclaimed for a refund of duties it allegedly overpaid.
the court of international trade conducted a bench trial,after which it found that ford was guilty of negligent but not grossly negligent violation of both and and assessed a penalty of more than maximum penalty permitted by statute in the circumstances.in reaching that decision,the trial court concluded that included an affirmative requirement that entry prices indicate the existence of any provisional pricing arrangements that might render the invoice price that ford violated that requirement and that because ford had knowledge of the requirement,it could be held liable for the violation consistent with due process.negligence decision,d at.the court of international trade further held that ford failed to satisfy the reconciliation agreement requirements for reporting direct payments,thereby violating that agreement and,by extension.id.at.it also dismissed ford counterclaim for a refund of overpaid duties.id.at.finally,the court assessed the maximum penalty permitted by the statute in a case involving negligence double the amount of revenue lost to the government,for a total of.id.at see also c setting forth the maximum civil penalty for negligent violation of.in so doing,the court considered various mitigating factors proposed by ford but concluded that because ford failed to make a good faith effort to meet its obligations,and inexplicably failed to follow its own compliance procedures,the penalty did not warrant mitigation.negligence decision,d at.
on appeal,ford challenges all of the trial court legal rulings.it argues that does not require importers to disclose the existence of provisional pricing,or,in the alternative,that such a requirement could not be imposed on ford consistently with due process of law.it argues that the reconciliation agreement modified its obligation to disclose modified price information at once and that ford complied with all the requirements in that agreement.it also claims that even if it violated and,the trial court erred in finding its conduct negligent for purposes of liability under.ford further asserts that several of its submissions detailing direct payments constituted prior disclosures under c,subjecting ford to less rigorous penalties.finally,ford argues that the trial court erred in its calculation of the final penalty of.ford timely appealed to this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

discussion 
section of title sets forth the procedures for the entry of imported merchandise.it requires,among other things,that importers file with the customs service the declared value,classification and rate of duty applicable to the merchandise,and such other information as is necessary to enable the customs service to properly assess duties on the merchandise.a b.the united states alleges,and the trial court found,that ford omission of information about assists and direct payments from its entry documents constituted materially false omissions of information required by.
on appeal,ford raises two primary arguments challenging the trial court decision.first,it argues that the court of international trade misread this court decision in hitachi ii to require disclosure of provisional pricing information.second,it asserts that even if such a requirement existed,the reconciliation agreement satisfied it.the government counters that the trial court correctly applied hitachi ii and that the reconciliation agreement is inadequate to satisfy the disclosure obligation,because the agreement did not identify specific entries,if any,to which it applied,and therefore could not put customs on notice of which entries were subject to change.
in the hitachi litigation,the court of international trade ruled that requires importers to disclose the existence of provisions that have a potential impact on the correct duty owed on an entry.united states hitachi.int l trade hitachi i.it also concluded,however,that it could not penalize hitachi for the violation because the duty to report escalation clauses on entry documents was rendered turbid by the publication of conflicting customs service guidance on the subject,which prevented importers from having notice of the requirement.id.in the absence of such notice,the trial court held,an importer could not be penalized consistently with due process of law.id.on appeal,this court affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.hitachi ii,at.
the parties disagree about the consequence of this court ruling for the court of international trade analysis of the government argues that our decision in hitachi ii expressly acknowledged that includes the duty to disclose price adjustment information that may be relevant to the final price.ford submits that hitachi ii upheld only the trial court due process ruling,while stressing that section itself contains no requirement to disclose that entered prices are subject to change.
we conclude that hitachi ii neither affirmed nor reversed the trial court conclusion that requires importers to disclose the existence of variable pricing provisions relating to entries.hitachi did not appeal that conclusion,and it was not before this court see corrected brief of appellant hitachi america,hitachi ii.ford position is based upon language in hitachi ii that,read in isolation,can be construed to question the viability of the trial court ruling 
i t is not clear under section whether an escalation clause,which represents payments that are not definitively known at the time of importation,must be referred to at that time in order to disclose the price accurately.after all,the statute never even mentions escalation clauses or what should be done about payments that can not be precisely known at the time of importation.
hitachi ii,at.that language,however,occurs in the court discussion of the due process the liability issue,which was not before was directed to the government argument that t he statute alone is sufficient to provide notice to an importer that it must declare millions of dollars of escalation payments,such that penalizing hitachi would not violate due process.brief of united states at,hitachi ii.this court view that a statute on its face does not provide notice of a legal obligation is not equivalent to a decision that the statute imposes no obligation.
it appears,then,that this court has never ruled on the question presented by ford here whether imposes upon importers an obligation to disclose the existence of variable pricing agreements relating to entries.we conclude that the statute requires that importers disclose not only the declared value of entered merchandise but also such other information as is necessary to enable the customs service to properly assess duties on the merchandise.a b.the duties owed on merchandise are in part a function of the value of that merchandise.the proper assessment of duties,therefore,depends on the proper assessment of merchandise final entry value.a declared value that is is one upon which customs can not properly assess duties.the existence of a contract provision rendering the declared value,therefore,constitutes information necessary to enable customs to assess such duties and thus must be disclosed by the importer under.
nevertheless,we also we did in hitachi the fifth amendment due process clause precludes penalizing ford for violating this requirement.at the time of the entries at issue here,ford was subject to the same statutory and regulatory scheme that faced hitachi the government admits that,as of,customs has not promulgated a regulation specifically addressing anticipated price changes,and although it asserts that customs has always required that such information be disclosed on entry records,it cites no evidence for that assertion.as was true in hitachi,the government introduced no evidence suggesting that the duty to disclose was well known in the trade or that actual customs practice required disclosure.hitachi i.at.the court of international trade,in ruling that the due process clause did not preclude penalizing ford,offered only the conclusory statement that ford has failed to establish that its duties were nebulous in the present case.negligence decision,d at.neither the court of international trade nor the government has offered any substantive basis for distinguishing ford circumstances notice from hitachi.to the extent that the trial court decision rested on the notion that ford internal compliance appears to have required disclosure of provisional pricing at evidence that ford had actual knowledge that provisional pricing must be disclosed,we disagree.to hold least in the absence of other evidence of actual effectively require the courts to punish companies for establishing internal procedures that are more robust than the law requires.if the existence of a particular internal procedure creates an inference that the defendant knew the procedure to be required by law,companies will have a strong disincentive to adopt internal compliance procedures.in the circumstances presented here,there is no basis for creating such a rule.
our decision in hitachi ii governs our decision here,and due process considerations preclude the imposition of penalties on ford for violation of the duty to disclose provisional pricing under.
the trial court ruled that customs established,by a preponderance of the evidence,that ford had made assists between through,which it failed to declare on its entry documents or at once thereafter,and that the failure was negligent.negligence decision,d at.it also ruled that ford failed to comply with the at once requirement with respect to direct payments,or,more precisely,with the filing requirements set forth in the reconciliation agreement that modified its obligations under.id.at.ford challenges both of these rulings,arguing that a the reconciliation agreement applies to both assists and direct payments,and b it complied with the terms of the reconciliation agreement,which,it claims,specified the filing period as a target,rather than a deadline.
the court of international trade found that ford violated because it failed to at once notify customs that the entry values relating to certain entries were inaccurate because of tooling assists provided for certain vehicles and vehicle components,and that its failure was negligent.id.at.the trial court made no express ruling that the reconciliation agreement did not apply to assists,but its discussion of the issue implies that conclusion.ford,in its initial brief,makes no argument relating directly to the question of reporting the assists under.in its reply brief,however,it argues that the reconciliation agreement did apply to assists,and that its claimed compliance with the reconciliation agreement therefore constituted compliance with for assists as well as for direct payments.
arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are not properly before this court.see,novosteel sa united states,a party waives arguments based on what does not appear in its brief see also united states nealy,cir stating the same proposition and citing numerous cases.ford therefore waived this argument by failing to raise it in its opening brief.ford opening brief contains no argument asserting that the reconciliation agreement is relevant to its compliance with.in fact,it is devoid of any argument relating to the application of to assists,except for its contention that there was a complete failure of proof on that issue.even its reply brief raises the issue in cursory fashion,limiting its discussion to a single footnote.it is unfair to consider an argument to which the government has been given no opportunity to respond.we therefore affirm the trial court conclusion that ford failure to report assists at once negligently violated.
direct payments 
ford argues,and the trial court agreed,that an importer is not in violation of if arrangements have been made with customs to report changes in declared entry values,and that the reconciliation agreement constituted such an arrangement.negligence decision,d at.the trial court further concluded,however,that ford failed to comply with the terms of the reconciliation agreement,thus effectively violating itself.id.on appeal,ford challenges that conclusion.
the reconciliation agreement consists of two documents a proposal letter sent to customs by ford on october,and a response letter from customs dated on or about august.the ford letter described a lump sum billing proposal modifying a previous agreement in which ford offered to track all lump sum billings throughout each model year and report the dutiable expenses associated with each import program.under the proposal,an annual reconciliation report will be prepared for each import program and filed with the detroit customs district within days after the close of each model year july to enable us to follow up and capture all relevant model year expenses.emphasis original.customs response letter stated that customs approved the proposal with two modifications,one of which stated that t his policy applies to withheld duties on entry summaries which have been liquidated.
the court of international trade concluded that u nder the plain language of the reconciliation agreement,ford was required to submit reports of lump sum payments within days after the close of each model year,and that ford did not rebut with credible evidence the specific language of the agreement which set the as a fixed deadline.negligence decision,d at.finding the testimony of ford witnesses on this point incredible based upon their demeanor,and further finding that with a single exception ford failed to submit its reconciliation reports to customs within the deadline,the court concluded that ford had violated.id.at.
on appeal,ford raises three arguments.it asserts,first,that customs response letter implicitly eliminated the deadline in favor of a simple reasonableness standard second,that n o one from ford or customs ever took the position that a strict deadline applied to ford reconciliation obligations and third,that the parties course of practice establishes that customs never treated the period as a firm deadline.
first,ford argues that customs modified the agreement to eliminate the requirement.it bases this argument on the fact that its initial proposal,which included the requirement,applied to both liquidated and unliquidated entries.customs modification of the proposal to apply only to liquidated entries,ford maintains,is incompatible with the existence of such a deadline,because regulations provided that customs had up to four years to liquidate entries,and customs at that time was running a liquidation cycle.in light of that evidence,ford reasons,a reporting deadline is nonsensical,because very few if any entries from the relevant model year will have been liquidated within the days.
we disagree.first,we note that there is no discussion of this argument in the trial court decision,and it is not clear that it was raised at trial.if it was not raised at trial,it is waived.in addition,it is not clear to ford original proposal was intended to apply to both liquidated and unliquidated entries.the letter makes no explicit statement to that effect,and customs response this policy applies to withheld duties on entry summaries which have been liquidated does not unambiguously demonstrate that ford proposal would have applied to unliquidated entries.if,in fact,ford initial proposal was itself intended to be limited to withheld duties on entry summaries which have been liquidated,ford argument about the consequence of customs modification loses force.
in any case,we find ford argument unpersuasive.customs letter makes no reference to the deadline,and ford argument of is,at best,strained.ford argument rests heavily on the implication that the parties knew that customs was then running a liquidation cycle,and that they therefore understood that customs modification necessarily eliminated the deadline.that implication,however,conflicts with the testimony of ford employee kruzich,who proposed the deadline,and who testified that it was just a target,but one that he thought was reasonable at the time.if,in fact,ford was aware that the liquidation cycle took days,and if ford intended its proposal to apply to both liquidated and unliquidated entries,it seems unlikely that it would have underlined for target for filing its reconciliations.
finally,ford primary evidence for its position is the testimony of former customs officer and later ford employee that the trial court found to be incredible for reasons,a credibility determination that this court will not.negligence decision,d at.
ford second and third arguments present a more difficult question.ford points to considerable evidence in the record suggesting that,although ford consistently failed to file its reconciliation reports within the,customs never complained that any of ford numerous reconciliation submissions filed after the supposed deadline were late.indeed,the trial court accepted this as fact.see id.at.nevertheless,the parties course of performance is insufficient either to read out the deadline from the reconciliation agreement or to estop the government from enforcing that deadline.course of performance evidence in most circumstances is relevant to interpretation of an instrument only if the terms of that instrument are ambiguous.see,barron bancshares,united states,noting that evidence of course of dealing is parol evidence,and therefore inadmissible in the absence of contractual ambiguity see also restatement second of contracts b stating that express terms are given greater weight than course of performance.the court of international trade held that the reconciliation agreement was not ambiguous on this issue,and we agree.we will not address whether they may be a circumstance in which course of performance may override an unambiguous term in the contract.see dep t of homeland.we are satisfied that no such circumstance exists here.
as for estoppel,the government correctly points out that estoppel is available against government actors only in cases involving affirmative misconduct.rumsfeld united techs,henry united states.ford has not alleged any affirmative misconduct here,and indeed has not pled the elements of an equitable estoppel case at all.therefore,there is no basis on which estoppel might prevent the government from enforcing against ford.
there remains the question of negligence.statutory negligence under,unlike negligence,shifts the burden of persuasion to the defendant to demonstrate lack of negligence.e.that is,customs has the burden merely to show that a materially false statement or omission occurred once it has done so,the defendant must affirmatively demonstrate that it exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.the trial court concluded that ford failed to rebut the prima facie case of negligence,although it did not explain in detail why.negligence decision,d at.ford argues that customs consistent acceptance of late filings suggests the reasonableness of ford conduct.it also points to customs new reconciliation prototype program,which allows importation up to months after entry to file reconciliations.ford reliance on customs pattern of accepting its late filings is simply a reiteration of its estoppel argument,rejected above.the fact that customs years after the events in dispute regard months to be a reasonable reconciliation period has little bearing on what constituted reasonable care for ford,which was subject to a requirement that it file its reconciliations within days.
we therefore affirm the trial court conclusion that ford negligently violated.
iii.prior disclosures 
section c of title provides a safe harbor for prior disclosures disclosing import law violations before,or without knowledge of,the commencement of a formal investigation of the violation.making such a prior disclosure limits the available penalty to interest on the amount of duties,taxes,and fees of which the government was deprived by the violation.c b.a formal investigation is considered to have commenced with regard to the disclosing party and the disclosed information on the date recorded in writing by the customs service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received which caused the customs service to believe that a possibility of a violation existed.c.the importer has the burden of proof in establishing lack of knowledge of commencement of the investigation.
ford claims that it made valid prior disclosures of all of ford direct payments to foreign vendors,because direct payments were not part of operation hat trick.it points out that the report of investigation roi commencing the operation stated that it was a special operation targeted at undeclared assists and indirect payments that internal customs correspondence announcing the start of the investigation described it as targeted at undeclared assists and indirect payments that customs initial notice of investigation to ford referred only to assists and indirect payments that four of the five attendees at a meeting scheduled to clarify the meaning of indirect payments testified that the parties left the meeting without a clearer understanding of how the investigation used the term and that the other witness contrary testimony is contradicted by the roi he wrote to memorialize the meeting.
the court of international trade,faced with these same arguments,concluded that ford knew or should have known that the term indirect payment,as used by customs in its notification to ford of the investigation,included all payments that impacted the final price paid for the merchandise in question,whether direct or indirect.negligence decision,d at.in so concluding the court relied primarily on testimony about a meeting that occurred on june,between representatives of both customs and ford to clarify the scope of the term indirect payments as used in the investigation.gibson,a ford witness,testified that at the meeting,when asked to clarify their understanding of what indirect payments meant,customs employees turner and neckel provided ford with a summons regarding entries relating to the mercury capri and said here,this is what it means.gibson also stated that the capri summons asked for records relating to all payments,and that this defined customs understanding of what indirect payments meant.neckel testified that at the meeting customs advised ford that the investigation included the entire full scope of their importations relative to certain vehicles and vehicle components.
based on this evidence,one could reasonably conclude that,at the meeting,ford representatives asked customs to define the scope of payments included in the category indirect payments,and that customs responded by indicating that the payments referred to in the capri,it is undisputed,sought information with respect to assists and payments,rather than to indirect payments were the kinds of payments at issue in the investigation.one could also reasonably conclude that ford representative gibson left the meeting with knowledge of customs interpretation.thus,the trial court conclusion that after that meeting ford knew or should have known that the investigation included all payments was not clearly erroneous.
the question,then,is whether the scope of an investigation which,by its terms,is limited to assists and indirect payments,may be broadened by such informal communications to include direct payments.ford argues that it may not,because under applicable regulations,if customs wished to expand the scope of its investigation beyond the topics identified in the may,letter to ford,it had to do so expressly.it points to applicable regulations that,it claims,require that in order to commence a formal investigation,the circumstances and facts about a possible violation had to be recorded in the investigatory record or the importer under investigation had to be informed about the specific type or circumstances of the suspected violation.the information provided to ford,the company argues,lacked the level of specificity required by the regulations to put ford on notice that customs investigation also encompassed direct payments.
there is no question that,under the regulations,a formal investigation relating to assists and indirect payments was commenced no later than may.see d.it also seems clear that,as of that date,ford must be presumed to have knowledge of that investigation.f.the question is thus whether the meeting of june,or other events served to expand the scope of the investigation to include direct payments under e,which in provided that 
a formal investigation is deemed to have commenced as to additional violations outside the scope of the original investigation but committed by the same party on the earliest of the following 
the date recorded in writing by the office of investigations in the investigatory record including contemporaneous notes as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received which caused an investigating agent to believe that the possibility of a violation of existed with respect to the additional violations 
the date on which an investigation agent,having property identified himself and the nature of his inquiry,had,either in person or in writing,made an inquiry of the person concerning the type of or circumstances of additional violations or 
the date on which an investigating agent,having properly identified himself and the nature of his inquiry,requested specific books and records of the person relating to the additional violations.
the trial court performed no analysis under e to determine whether an enlargement had taken place,concluding instead that ford had notice of the full scope of the investigation when it received customs only to assists and indirect payments on may.negligence decision,d at.this was error.the trial court own analysis states that ford did not understand,as of may,what indirect payments included,and came to that understanding only after the meeting of june.id.at.we agree with ford that the evidence does not support a conclusion that,as of may,the investigation applied to direct payments.
as we have discussed,however,the evidence does support the conclusion that the june,meeting served to expand the scope of the investigation under e,which states that the expanded investigation commences when an investigating agent makes an inquiry of the importer concerning the type of or circumstances of additional violations.the same meeting served to create a presumption of ford knowledge of the investigation under f and c.ford has presented no evidence sufficient to rebut that presumption.we conclude,therefore,that as of june,customs investigation had been broadened to include not only assists and indirect payments but also direct payments,and that ford had knowledge of the broadened investigative scope.any violations disclosed after that date can not constitute prior disclosures under c.we therefore affirm the court of international trade conclusion that none of the tenders cited by ford constituted prior disclosures.
iv.scope of investigation 
the trial court found as fact that i mportations related to the model year and thereafter were not within the scope of customs investigation.negligence decision,d at.it based that finding entirely on the testimony of customs own witness,inspector turner,who testified in his deposition that w e told ford we were looking five years backward,and that importations occurring in would be outside the scope of the investigation.id.he further testified at trial that the investigation had to be cut off at some point because the scope of the investigation would only extend that knew we could extend the investigation forever.
despite that finding,in calculating ford penalty,the trial court appears to have included tenders related to the and model years,including engines for the taurus sho payment of engines for the model year payment of and transmissions for the model year payment of.see id.at.these tenders were outside the scope of the investigation,ford argues,and therefore should not have been included in the penalty.
ford further alleges that the trial court included in its calculation of tenders for which it was unclear to which model year the tenders related.several tenders included within the calculations related to both model years and model years.see,id.at tender relating to undeclared engineering and tooling cost prior to model id.at tender relating to payments for the and model year festiva id.at tender relating to transmissions imported for the through model year id.at tender relating to taurus sho engines id.at tenders relating to tooling assists and payments for model years.ford asserts that customs failure to prove the extent to which the duties at issue under these disclosures related to matters within the scope of customs investigation means that these tenders must be excluded from any penalty calculations.
the government contends that the trial court finding states that entries relating to the model year were outside the scope of the taken out of context and pertained only to the scope of the investigation at its inception in.it offers no support for this assertion,however,save citation to the very pages of the transcript relied upon by the trial court in rendering its.
the government also asserts that various documents in the record demonstrate the customs agents understanding that the scope of the investigation included model year vehicles and parts even if the entries relating to the merchandise the june,meeting.we reject this attempt to overturn the trial court,which the government has not appealed.the trial court found,as fact,that importations related to the model year were not within the scope of customs investigation.negligence decision,d at.that finding appears in a section of the opinion titled findings of fact relevant to the commencement and scope of customs investigation.id.at.the statement context and plain meaning are both unmistakeable the scope of the investigation did not include entries relating to any model year after.the court of international trade therefore erred when it included tenders relating to model years and later in its penalty calculations.the tenders relating to model years in paragraphs,and of the trial court opinion should have been excluded from those calculations.
with respect to tenders involving multiple model years,the question is more complicated.ford asserts that customs had the burden of proving the extent to which those disclosures related to matters within the scope of the investigation the government argues that ford tenders failed to satisfy the specific requirements for prior disclosures set forth in e and,and therefore can not claim the prior disclosure safe harbor from violations of.
we agree that whether ford tenders relating to multiple model years qualified as prior disclosures is irrelevant to whether the trial court properly included those tenders in its penalty calculations.to the extent that those tenders included amounts relating to model years outside the scope of the investigation,no violation was ever alleged or proved with respect to them,and they have no need of the prior disclosure safe harbor.the appropriate remedy for this error is to remand the case to the court of international trade for additional as to which portion of the tenders related to model years within the scope of the investigation.
dutiability of shortfall payments 
in,ford entered into a contract with mazda motor corporation for the purchase by ford of festiva cars for importation into the united states.negligence decision,d at.that contract provided that ford was committed to purchasing cars each year the annual volume commitment.the contract also included a section,volume price adjustment,which stated that so long as the annual volume commitment remained unchanged,the purchase price for those cars would be determined by a formula based on the percentage of the commitment total for which ford actually placed orders in a given year.the volume price adjustment section provided for different pricing if ford ordered a more than,but less than,of the annual commitment b less than of the annual commitment and c more than of the annual commitment.the contract also included an entirely separate section,prices,which set forth t he initial purchase price for each model of ford vehicles and a method for making annual adjustments to that price for new model years.it appears that the formulas for volume price adjustments in section represent a function,in part,of the initial prices set in section.
ford reported several direct payments resulting from festiva orders of less than units for the,and model years.id.at.the court of international trade concluded that the lump sum payments made by ford pursuant to the festiva agreement are dutiable,reasoning that the payments did not constitute a penalty,but were related to the price actually paid or payable and
