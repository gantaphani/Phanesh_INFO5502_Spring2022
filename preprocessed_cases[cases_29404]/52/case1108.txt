does article a of the hague convention on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters the convention allow service of process by mail we conclude that it does.we therefore reverse the trial court order granting respondents motion to quash the service of summons and complaint of plaintiff and appellant paul denlinger.
facts and procedural background 
respondents peter hamilton,peter hak yung,and raymond ch ien are directors and officers of chinadotcom,a company incorporated in the cayman islands with offices in hong kong.respondents work and reside in hong kong.
appellant denlinger is a former employee of,an entity related to chinadotcom.although denlinger was based in silicon valley,he sometimes worked in china and hong kong.
after denlinger was fired,he filed suit in santa clara county against respondents,other individual defendants and the chinadotcom group of corporate entities.he alleged that he was wrongfully terminated.in january,denlinger first amended complaint and summons were served by registered mail on respondents in hong kong.
respondents moved to quash the service of summons received by registered post.they asserted that the service was invalid under the convention.granting the motion,the trial court decided that the convention does not allow for service of a summons and complaint on a foreign defendant by mail.the trial court reasoned that such service was invalid because article a of the hague service convention,which does apply to hong kong,does not allow for service of summons and complaint by mail.
this appeal ensued.
discussion 
the convention provides a mechanism for signatory nations to serve process abroad.it applies when the forum state internal law requires transmittal of documents abroad as a necessary part of service of process.volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft schlunk,d.it is undisputed that the convention applies in this case.see code civ,subd.c.
the convention describes several methods of effecting service of process.the primary method requires member states to designate a central authority to receive requests of service,arrange for service of documents,and return proofs of service.see,convention on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters,reprinted in fed.rules civ,foll.rule,alternative methods of service are detailed under articles,and see also volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft schlunk,supra,at.
as pertinent here,article a states provided the state of destination does not object,the present convention shall not interfere with a the freedom to send judicial documents,by postal channels,directly to persons abroad.
according to denlinger,article a authorizes service of process by mail.respondents,by contrast,claim article a does not apply to service of process they say it only applies to the mailing of nonservice of process judicial documents.
courts adopting respondents view distinguish the use of the word send under article a with the use of the word service under articles b,c and elsewhere under the convention.bankston toyota motor cir honda motor superior court th,d suzuki motor superior court d.golub isuzu motors.brand mazda motor of america.pennebaker kawasaki motors,gallagher mazda motor of america.mcclenon nissan motor in.hantover,omet,of volentieri.
for example,in bankston toyota motor corporation,supra,the court emphasized the principle of statutory construction that a legislative body acts intentionally and purposely by including language in one part of a statute but excluding it from another.id.at.since article a uses the word send as opposed to the word service,these courts reason that send does not mean service of process and that article a therefore authorizes the sending by postal channels of only nonservice of process judicial documents.bankston toyota motor corporation,supra,at.indeed,our own court has followed this view and decided article a does not allow service of process by mail upon a japanese defendant.honda motor superior court,supra,th,d see also suzuki motor superior court,supra,d.
at first blush respondents position has some appeal.however,closer examination of the issue in conjunction with application of the rules regarding the interpretation of treaties persuades us that denlinger contention represents the better,and more modern,view.see,research systems corporation ipsos publicite cir,schiffer mazda motor,randolph hendry d,eli lilly and roussel d,eoi medical marketing,griggs group filanto spa,patty toyota motor,meyers asics,hammond honda motor.
we start our analysis by reviewing the rules for interpreting treaties.to interpret a treaty,we begin with the treaty text and the context in which the words are used.for difficult or ambiguous passages,other rules of construction may be used.volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft schlunk,supra,at.treaties are to be construed more liberally than private agreements,and to ascertain their meaning we may look beyond the written words to the history of the treaty,the negotiations,and the practical construction adopted by the parties.citation.id.at,italics omitted 
both the text and context of the convention demonstrate that the convention is meant to apply only to service of process,and that fact undermines respondents claim that article a is meant to cover the mailing of nonservice of process judicial documents only.for example,article of the convention states the present convention shall apply,in all cases,in civil or commercial matters,where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.italics added.likewise,the convention preamble advises that the convention signatories desire to create appropriate means to ensure that judicial or extrajudicial documents to be served abroad shall be brought to the notice of the addressee in sufficient time,and desire to improve the organization of mutual judicial assistance for that purpose by simplifying and expediting the procedure,italics added.
the united states supreme court analysis also shows that the convention was meant to apply only to service of process.volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft schlunk,supra,at.in examining the convention negotiating history,volkswagenwerk decided that article refers to service of process in the technical sense.ibid.the court explained that hague convention delegates had criticized early drafts of the convention because they were concerned that its language could apply to transmissions that did not involve service of process.consequently,the final text of article was altered to make clear that the convention applies only to documents transmitted for service abroad.id.at.
given this scope and purpose of the convention as revealed by its text and the united states supreme court,the view that article a does not apply to service of process makes little sense.as one court observed,t he placement of one lone subprovision dealing with the mailing of nonservice documents in the midst of fifteen articles addressing service of process,would be inconsistent with the structure of the entire convention.griggs group,filanto spa,supra.at.in finding that article a applied to service of process,another court reasoned were that not the the contrary interpretation were the article a provisions would be terribly misplaced.it would be a provision that allows for the use of the mails,but would not provide any guidance on the issue of service of documents only issue that the hague convention was intended to address.randolph hendry,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
in addition,although it is correct that the word serve or service is used relatively consistently within the convention,article a is not the only provision within the convention that does not use those terms.specifically,article requires official notification by member states if they object to methods of transmission provided for under articles and.quite obviously,transmission is used under article as a synonym for service.see volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft schlunk,supra,at.t he only transmittal to which the convention applies is a transmittal abroad that is required as a necessary part of service griggs gro
