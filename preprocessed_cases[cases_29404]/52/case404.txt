appellant,globe nuclear services and supply,gnss,a delaware corporation headquartered in maryland,brought suit in the district court seeking an injunction against appellee,ao techsnabexport tenex,a russian company that is wholly owned by the russian federation.the catalyst for gnss lawsuit was tenex announcement that it would no longer perform under its contract to supply gnss with uranium hexafluoride that tenex received in exchange for uranium derived from dismantled russian nuclear warheads.the district court dismissed gnss lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,et,holding in particular that tenex conduct giving rise to gnss lawsuit did not constitute a commercial activity.we hold that the district court erred in this holding.because tenex conduct underlying gnss lawsuit did constitute a commercial activity,tenex can not claim immunity under the fsia.the case,accordingly,must be remanded to the district court for further proceedings.
in,the united states and the russian federation entered into an agreement concerning the disposition of highly enriched uranium heu extracted from nuclear weapons.the united states executive agent under this agreement is the united states enrichment corporation usec,and russia is the ministry of atomic energy minatom,which has appointed tenex to discharge its responsibilities.under the agreement,russia obligated itself to extract heu from dismantled nuclear warheads,dilute the heu by combining it with commercial uranium leu,and then deliver the resulting leu to usec.in exchange for this,usec then pays tenex partially in cash,and partially by transferring to tenex title to uranium hexafluoride,which can be used to create leu under the relevant and russian legal framework,tenex is then able not only to ship some of that uranium hexafluoride back to russia for use in further dilution of heu pursuant to the agreement between the united states and russia,but also to sell portions of that uranium hexafluoride for use in the united states.
accordingly,in january,tenex entered into a contract with gnss,by which tenex obligated itself to supply gnss with specified quantities of uranium hexafluoride from until the tenex contract.in reliance on the tenex contract,and with full knowledge and cooperation of tenex,gnss then entered into supply contracts with utility customers in the united states.
in november,tenex informed gnss that further sales of uranium hexafluoride to gnss are inimical to the interests of the russian federation,and that it was therefore unilaterally terminating delivery of uranium hexafluoride under the contract beginning in janary.gnss immediately commenced international arbitration proceedings,as provided for in the tenex contract,in stockholm,sweden.additionally,gnss brought suit in united states district court in maryland seeking an injunction requiring tenex to continue its delivery of uranium hexafluoride to gnss pending the outcome of the stockholm arbitration.after a hearing,the district court issued an order and memorandum opinion dismissing gnss suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia,holding in particular that tenex was an instrumentality of the russian federation that is generally immune from suit,and that tenex activity relevant to this lawsuit did not constitute a commercial activity.gnss appealed.
we review the district court factual findings with respect to jurisdiction for clear error and the legal conclusion that flows therefrom de novo.velasco v.the government of indonesia,cir.
because tenex is wholly owned by the russian federation,it is an instrumentality of the russian federation and is thus itself considered to be a foreign state for purposes of the fsia.see b velasco,at.accordingly,it is presumptively immune from gnss suit unless one of the specifically enumerated exceptions in the fsia applies to that suit.see saudi arabia nelson,d under the fsia,a foreign state is presumptively immune from the jurisdiction of the united states courts unless a specified exception applies,a federal court lacks jurisdiction over a claim against a foreign state.
the only exception relevant here is the commercial activity exception,which provides as follows 
a a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states or of the states in any case 
in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.
to determine whether the commercial activity exception of section a is applicable to gnss lawsuit against tenex,we must engage in a inquiry.first,we must precisely identify the conduct by tenex upon which gnss lawsuit is based.second,we must determine under section a whether that conduct constitutes a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and which causes a direct effect in the united states.
our first task is to identify precisely the conduct by tenex upon which gnss lawsuit is based.see nelson,at.we begin our analysis by identifying the particular conduct on which the plaintiffs action is based for purposes of the act.butters vance int l,cir commencing the analysis of the applicability of the commercial activity exception by defining the relevant act.in saudi arabia nelson,d,the supreme court provided the following guidance regarding the meaning of the words based upon,for the purposes of section a in denoting conduct that forms the basis,or foundation,for a claim,the phrase is read most naturally to mean those elements of a claim that,if proven,would entitle a plaintiff to relief under his theory of the case.nelson,at.
the district court,without discussing nelson,made the following statement regarding tenex relevant conduct 
the dispute here is where to focus on the chain of events.if,as plaintiff sees it,the only relevant activity occurs once the uranium hexafluoride is available in kentucky at usec,the activity looks more commercial.on the other hand,if one must consider the entire course of activity,from the blending down of the heu in the russian federation to the transport of leu to the united states and then release of the uranium hexafluoride and the return of any surplus to russia,the conclusion seems inescapable that the activity is not purely commercial and remains immune.
redacted mem.op.at.having framed these two arguable interpretations of tenex relevant conduct,one narrow and one broad,the district court then declared that it was bound to apply the broad view 
t he court must look to the reality of the situation in light of the agreements and the overall context of the contract.as part of the heu agreement,the united states authorized the russian federation,through its executive agent,to use usec,the american executive agent,as a conduit for the processing of the uranium.to encourage the dismantling of the nuclear warheads,the russian federation may distribute the uranium hexafluoride through usec.unused quantities must be returned to russia,however,and may not be sold by tenex on the open market.thus,the contract between tenex and gnss allowing gnss to broker a portion of that uranium hexafluoride is part of the sovereign activity of the russian federation and therefore immune.
redacted mem.op.at.in effect then,if not in explicit terms,the district court held that the conduct upon which gnss lawsuit is based,for the purposes of a,is not limited to tenex entrance into a contract to supply gnss with uranium hexafluoride and unilateral termination of this obligation,but includes the entire framework by which russia has agreed to dismantle its nuclear weapons and convert heu into leu.
the district court capacious view of the conduct upon which gnss lawsuit is based can not be reconciled with the supreme court decision in nelson.under that precedent,we must turn our attention not to the reality of the situation in light of the agreements and the overall context of the contract,as the district court did,redacted mem.op.at,but to the specific claim gnss has asserted against tenex,and the elements of that claim that,if proven,would entitle gnss to relief under its theory of the case.nelson,at.see also weltover republic of argentina,cir,aff,d noting that courts must isolate the specific conduct that underlies the suit,rather than focusing on the broad program or policy of which the individual transaction is a part and warning that under an overbroad definition of relevant conduct,the activity would almost inevitably be characterized as sovereign in nature.
in the district court,gnss seeks a status quo injunction requiring tenex to continue delivering uranium hexafluoride pending the outcome of arbitration proceedings in stockholm,sweden.in order to establish its entitlement to this relief,gnss must satisfy the high standard for a preliminary injunction.see doran salem inn,d the traditional standard for granting a preliminary injunction requires the plaintiff to show that in the absence of its issuance he will suffer irreparable injury and also that he is likely to prevail on the merits.see also,pinewood wyche,cir luttig,concurring the supreme court has consistently applied the test governing the decision on an injunction the plaintiff likelihood of success on the merits,the harm to the plaintiff in the absence of the injunction,the harm to the defendant upon grant of the injunction,and public interest without ever distinguishing among the four parts as to analytical order,priority,or weight.and it has collectively referred to these undifferentiated parts as the traditional standard for injunctions.in particular,to establish likelihood of success on the merits,gnss will need to prove that a valid contract exists between it and tenex,that tenex has unilaterally declared that it will no longer perform its obligations under the contract,and that this declaration by tenex constitutes a breach of the contract.as this analysis shows,the entrance into the tenex contract and the unilateral declaration of by tenex are the only conduct that constitute elements of gnss claim,and,if proven,would entitle gnss to relief.
we do not deny that gnss complaint includes background information regarding the signing of the agreement concerning the disposition of highly enriched uranium extracted from the nuclear weapons between the united states and the russian federation in.but this is background information which,while factually relevant to explaining how the tenex contract came into existence,is not at all necessary for gnss to prove in order to prevail in its suit for injunctive relief.put another way,even if the source for the uranium hexafluoride that tenex is obligated to deliver to gnss were other than it is an agreement between the united states and the russian federation in which the russian federation dismantles nuclear warheads,downblends heu into leu,delivers the resulting leu to usec,and then receives uranium hexafluoride in exchange therefor,gnss could still prevail.compare nelson,at.while background activities led to the conduct that eventually injured the plaintiffs,they are not the basis for the plaintiffs suit.even taking each of the plaintiffs allegations about background facts as true,those facts alone entitle plaintiffs to nothing under their theory of the case.
in sum,focus on the elements of gnss claim,as required by nelson,yields the conclusion that the district court erred by taking an overly broad view of tenex conduct relevant to gnss lawsuit.for purposes of section a,gnss action is based upon nothing more or less than tenex entrance into a contract to supply gnss with uranium hexafluoride and subsequent repudiation thereof.
having precisely identified the conduct by tenex upon which gnss lawsuit is based,we now consider whether this particular conduct qualifies under section a.in this case,our inquiry begins and ends with the first clause of that provision,because tenex conduct,we conclude,constitutes a commercial activity carried on in the united states,and on this basis alone we must reverse the district court holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the case.
our analysis of whether tenex conduct qualifies under a first clause proceeds in two stages.initially,we consider the harder question of whether this conduct meets the definition of commercial activity.we then proceed,albeit briefly,to consider the much easier question of whether this conduct is carried on in the united states.
the fsia provides that a commercial activity means either a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular transaction or act,and that t he commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act,rather than by reference to its purpose.id.d emphases added.
in republic of argentina weltover,d,the supreme court remarked that these provisions leave the critical term commercial largely undefined,but that because it was clear that the fsia and the commercial exception in particular largely codified the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity,t he meaning of commercial is the meaning generally attached to that term under the restrictive theory at the time the statute was enacted.id.at.see also republic of austria altmann,d noting that the fsia codifie d,as a matter of federal law,the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.after reviewing the description of the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity given by the plurality in alfred dunhill of london,republic of cuba,d,less than six months before the enactment of the fsia,the supreme court provided the following guidance regarding the meaning of commercial 
w hen a foreign government acts,not as regulator of a market,but in the manner of a private player within it,the foreign sovereign actions are commercial within the meaning of the fsia.moreover,because the act provides that the commercial character of an act is to be determined by reference to its nature rather than its purpose,d,the question is not whether the foreign government is acting with a profit motive or instead with the aim of fulfilling uniquely sovereign objectives.rather,the issue is whether the particular actions that the foreign state performs whatever the motive behind them are the type of actions by which a private party engages in trade and traffic or commerce.thus,a foreign government issuance of regulations limiting foreign currency exchange is a sovereign activity,because such authoritative control of commerce can not be exercised by a private party whereas a contract to buy army boots or even bullets is a commercial activity,because private companies can similarly use sales contracts to acquire goods.
weltover,at.internal citations omitted.weltover thus makes clear that whether conduct is commercial within the meaning of the fsia depends on whether that conduct is of the type by which a private party engages in trade and traffic or commerce,regardless of the motive that leads the foreign state to engage in the conduct.id.
the facts of weltover provide a helpful illustration of precisely what the supreme court meant.in weltover,argentina had issued bonds,known as bonods,designed to refinance debts it had incurred while establishing a foreign exchange insurance contract program to overcome the instability of the argentine currency.in holding that this bond issuance constituted commercial activity under the fsia and that argentina was not immune from suit for failure to make timely payments on the bonods,the supreme court stressed that there was nothing about the issuance of the bonods except perhaps its purpose that is not analogous to a private commercial transaction.id.at.
like argentina issuance of the bonds in weltover,tenex conduct upon which gnss lawsuit is based also constitu
