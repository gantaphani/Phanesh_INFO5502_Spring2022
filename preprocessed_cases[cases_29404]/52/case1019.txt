background 
syngenta seeds is an international agribusiness that produces,among other agricultural products,commercial crop seeds.at the heart of this litigation is a syngenta seeds product known as coker a soft red winter wheat variety sold by syngenta through a network of independent distributors throughout the united states.the coker variety is certified pursuant to,and subject to the protections of,the plant variety protection act pvpa,discussed in detail below.as a certified pvpa seed,coker is sold exclusively in approved packaging that sets forth the variety name and the required pvpa marking notice,which reads unauthorized propagation prohibited or unauthorized seed multiplication prohibited.syngenta is also the holder of the federally registered trademark coker.
delta cotton operates a grain elevator in greene county,arkansas.like most grain elevator operators,delta engages in at least three separate businesses.first,it acts as a broker or middleman for local farmers grain sales.farmers ship grain to the facility for testing,grading,and storage.the elevator then finds buyers for the grain and takes a sales commission on the highest available price.
second,the elevator also makes outright purchases of local farmers harvested crops,including wheat.purchased crops are stored in bins that are sorted by commodity,such that wheat is stored separately from corn,corn from soybeans,and so on.the facility receives and stores approximately bushels of wheat per year.although the facility receives wheat from many sources,all wheat received is placed in the same storage bin.as a sideline of its business,delta cotton sells bags of stored wheat as feed wheat,intended not to be propagated as crops but to be fed to farm animals.feed wheat is sold in bags that are generally labeled delta feed.
finally,delta cotton also operates as a retailer of protected variety seed,in which capacity it many other protected coker seed.
at issue in this case is the sale by delta cotton of three bags labeled feed wheat that allegedly contained protected coker seed.in,a man hired by syngenta seeds law firm entered delta cotton facility and asked whether delta had any wheat i can plant for deer plots.the store provided him with three bags for each.the bags were labeled delta cotton and feed wheat.order at at.the bags were then provided to brent turnipseed,an agronomist,for identification testing.turnipseed testified that analysis indicated that the specimen provided to him,and alleged to have been drawn from those bags,contained protected coker seed.
on september,syngenta seeds filed suit against delta cotton in the eastern district of arkansas for,inter alia,infringement of the pvpa and the lanham act,seeking permanent injunctive relief,treble damages,disgorgement of profits,and costs.a trial was held before a jury from april,after which the jury rendered a verdict for syngenta seeds.the court entered judgment against delta cotton of damages of on the pvpa claim,on the lanham act claim,plus interest.on july,following briefing,the court also granted syngenta seeds motions for a permanent injunction and costs,and denied delta cotton motions for new trial,judgment notwithstanding the verdict,and remittitur.order at.delta cotton filed its notice of appeal of the court order on july.we have exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to a.
on appeal,delta cotton raises a host of challenges to the trial court denial of its motions.first,it asserts that syngenta failed to present any credible evidence on the threshold element of infringement under the pvpa and the lanham act that the wheat bagged and sold by defendant was the coker protected variety.second,it asserts that because uncontested evidence showed that the identified sales were made for feed purposes and not for propagation,syngenta seeds could not have established the element of scienter,which delta cotton asserts is required for a finding of pvpa infringement.third,it alleges that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of delta cotton lack of knowledge of the source of the wheat,preventing delta cotton from establishing a defense to damages under of the pvpa.fourth,it alleges that syngenta failed to present evidence sufficient to state a cause of action under the lanham act.finally,it claims that the damages awarded to syngenta were duplicative and grossly exceeded the damages permitted for infringement under both the pvpa and the lanham act.
standard of review 
in reviewing a trial court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law in lanham act cases,this court applies the law of the relevant regional,the eighth.see,thompson haynes.in the patent which the pvpa claims raised here are have reviewed such denials using both regional circuit law and our own law.compare ntp,research in motion,cert.denied,d applying regional circuit law,with honeywell int l,hamilton sundstrand,en banc applying federal circuit law.this inconsistency is insignificant in this case,because the standards applied by this court and by the eighth circuit are essentially similar.both circuits review a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law following a jury verdict de novo,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party and assuming that the jury resolved all factual conflicts in that party favor.see,honeywell int l,at stating that this court reviews denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law without deference,viewing all evidence and drawing all inferences favorably to the party walsh comp,cir same.we must not set aside a jury verdict unless there is a complete absence of probative facts to support the verdict.walsh,at.federal rule of civil procedure a provides that a court may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law only where there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the.a.
discussion 
waiver and scope of appellate review 
at the close of syngenta case,delta cotton moved for a directed verdict on the grounds that syngenta had failed to carry its burden of proof on both pvpa infringement and lanham act infringement.the trial court denied that motion from the bench.following entry of the jury verdict,delta cotton filed motions for new trial,judgment notwithstanding the verdict,and order of remittitur,all of which the district court denied in its order of july.
under eighth circuit law,a motion for judgment as a matter of law may not raise issues not previously raised in a motion.walsh,at.here,delta cotton motion raised only sufficiency of the evidence as grounds,asserting that syngenta had failed to prove pvpa infringement and had failed to prove confusion or injury under the lanham act.the trial court therefore limited its consideration of delta cotton motions to those issues,with respect to delta cotton argument under of the pvpa,discussed are constrained to do the same.the sole issues before us on appeal,therefore,are whether the jury verdicts of infringement under the pvpa and confusion or injury under the lanham act were supported by evidence sufficient to sustain the verdicts,and whether the district court correctly applied of the pvpa.
