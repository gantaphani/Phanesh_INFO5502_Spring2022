discussion 
extradition principles 
extradition is an executive function derived from the president power to conduct foreign affairs,and the judiciary historically has played a limited role in extradition proceedings.martin warden,atlanta pen,cir see also terlinden ames.t he question whether power remains in a foreign state to carry out its treaty obligations is in its nature political and not judicial,and the courts ought not interfere with the conclusions of the political department in that regard.
the united states authority to extradite noriega comes from the united states extradition treaty with france.the federal extradition statute generally permits extradition when based on a treaty or convention.see.article of the extradition treaty between the united states and france,entitled obligation to extradite,states that t he contracting states agree to extradite to each other,pursuant to the provisions of this treaty,persons whom the competent authorities in the requesting state have charged with or found guilty of an extraditable offense.extradition treaty,treaty doc.the treaty further defines an extraditable offense as one punished under the laws in both states by deprivation of liberty for a maximum of at least one year or by a more severe penalty.id.at.the offense of which noriega has been convicted in absentia in france,which corresponds to money laundering in the united states,undoubtedly falls within the purview of the treaty 
there is no right to appeal extradition certification determinations,see kastnerova,at,and collateral review of an extradition determination by means of a petition for writ of habeas corpus is generally limited to determining whether the magistrate had jurisdiction,whether the offense charged is within the treaty and,whether there was any evidence warranting the finding that there was reasonable ground to believe the accused guilty.martin,at quoting fernandez phillips.the issue of whether the treaty of extradition has no force because another treaty or law prevents its operation is no less a fundamental one than is treaty coverage of the offense charged,and is within the class of reviewable challenges to extradition.see,valenzuela united states,cir noting that despite the court limited role in extradition proceedings,the judiciary must ensure that the constitutional rights of individuals subject to extradition are observed yapp reno,cir concluding that the court was still required to interpret a provision of the applicable extradition treaty regardless of the limited scope of habeas corpus review in extradition proceedings ahmad wigen,cir adherin
