the republic of albania seeks extradition of krenar hoxha for the murders of three albanian citizens that took place in albania in.following a finding by a magistrate judge that he was extraditable,hoxha filed a petition for habeas corpus that was denied by the district court.on appeal,hoxha argues that he is entitled to habeas relief because the magistrate judge should have allowed testimony at the extradition hearing by recanting witnesses,the extradition treaty between albania and the united states is invalid,and he should not be returned to albania because he will face torture and possible death there.we conclude that hoxha claims do not justify a grant of his habeas petition,and we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
krenar hoxha petitioner was born in albania in and became a naturalized united states citizen in january pursuant to an extradition treaty between albania and the united states,the albanian government seeks petitioner extradition for trial on the murders of ilmi and roza kasemi and their son eltion kasemi.
matilda kasemi,the kasemis ten daughter,described the murders in a statement to the police made shortly after the murders occurred.she stated that at about on september,a man wearing all black,whom matilda did not recognize,entered the room in which matilda,her brother,and her parents were sleeping.when roza kasemi asked the intruder name,he immediately shot her without responding.he then shot both ilmi and eltion kasemi,but left without noticing matilda.matilda stated that she would recognize the killer if she saw him again.
a.the case against petitioner 
the republic of albania alleges that in the,decedent ilmi kasemi was romantically involved with mimoza hoxha,petitioner sister,but the two were forbidden from marrying by petitioner parents.a declaration from ilmi kasemi brother,murat kasemi,supports this assertion both ilmi kasemi and mimoza hoxha married others and raised families but,according to the albanian government,the two renewed an extramarital relationship of which petitioner strongly disapproved.the albanian government alleges that petitioner anger at ilmi kasemi was the motive for the murders,but provided no documentary evidence of a continuing relationship between kasemi and mimoza hoxha the albanian government did,however,submit evidence of animosity between petitioner and ilmi kasemi.specifically,rahman sheqeri,a friend and former of kasemi,stated in a declaration that on the evening of september,fifteen days before the murders,he saw petitioner standing with another man about fifty meters from the kasemi house,holding a gun.petitioner looked very agitated and,when he saw sheqeri,told him to go away.sheqeri reported this incident to ilmi kasemi,and kasemi told sheqeri that he was sure that petitioner had been looking for kasemi that evening.kasemi also told sheqeri that petitioner had assaulted kasemi on an earlier occasion.
the albanian government submitted three daut hoxha,a cousin of petitioner,and from daut hoxha wife and testimony that both parties agree has now been recanted.in his recanted declaration,daut hoxha stated that on the night of the murders,petitioner came to daut hoxha house carrying an automatic weapon inside a plastic bag petitioner left the gun in the bag at daut hoxha house,and then returned for it at about,intending to throw it in the river.instead,daut hoxha and petitioner went to the home of fetah hoxha,a relative,where daut hoxha hid the gun in a sofa.based on this testimony from daut hoxha,the albanian police searched fetah hoxha home two days after the murders and found a gun in a blue bag hidden in a sofa.a ballistics examination demonstrated that the gun was the weapon used in the murders.
daut hoxha wife,bajame hoxha,stated in her recanted declaration that sometime after midnight on the night of the murders,petitioner knocked on the door of their home and daut hoxha let him in.bajame hoxha did not hear what was said,but noted that petitioner did not stay long.in the morning,at about,bajame hoxha saw petitioner in the house again,and she also saw a large empty black plastic bag in a corner of the house.at about,bajame hoxha woke up her husband,and he went to work.
daut hoxha sister,ardjana hoxha,who lived with her brother at the time of the murders,stated in her recanted declaration that at about on the morning after the murders,she heard her brother asking petitioner what did you do and heard petitioner answering nothing,nothing,you will learn later.
in a declaration that has not been recanted,fetah hoxha stated that daut hoxha generally comes in my house as in his house,and that he came to fetah hoxha house at on the morning after the murders fetah hoxha stated that he did not notice what daut hoxha did in the house that day,but that he did not stay long.
attached to his petition for habeas corpus,petitioner filed new declarations from daut,bajame,and ardjana hoxha,dated february,averring that their earlier statements were the false product of torture and threats by the albanian police.daut hoxha accounted for his knowledge of the gun location by stating that,on the night of the murders,a resident of the area,whose identity i can not reveal in public,known to me as a criminal of the area,asked him to hide an automatic weapon.daut hoxha agreed to do so out of fear petitioner asserts that daut hoxha was prepared to testify by telephone as to these points at the extradition hearing,and that the other recanting witnesses were willing to testify as well.
procedural history 
in february,petitioner was tried and convicted for the murders in absentia in albania.he was sentenced to life imprisonment,but the case was later remanded for retrial by an appellate court,based on a finding that petitioner did not receive notice of the aggravated circumstance in his charge.petitioner was again convicted of the murders,and,in november,he was resentenced to years and months in prison.several appeals followed,and in june the case was again remanded for retrial based on the finding that,because petitioner was tried in absentia without notice,he was denied the constitutional right to be called and to attend the proceedings.following that ruling,petitioner has not yet been retried.
in november,the united states filed a complaint for extradition on behalf of the albanian government,and petitioner was arrested in the eastern district of pennsylvania pursuant to an arrest warrant.in support of extradition,the albanian government submitted matilda kasemi statement and a series of court papers documenting the passage of petitioner case through the albanian legal system.an extradition hearing was initiated before a magistrate judge in january.the magistrate judge found that the extradition treaty between albania and the united states was valid,but expressed concern over the lack of sworn documents provided by the albanian government in support of probable cause.the magistrate judge offered the albanian government two weeks to gather additional documentation.when the extradition hearing reconvened in february,the magistrate judge reviewed albania additional submission,which contained an affidavit from an albanian prosecutor with attached photographs,reports,and declarations,including the declarations of daut hoxha,ardjana hoxha,bejame hoxha,rahman sheqeri,and fetah hoxha described above.
at the hearing,the united states argued that daut hoxha declaration was relevant to probable cause despite his later recantation because the declaration was corroborated by the gun found in fetah hoxha sofa and by fetah hoxha statement that daut hoxha came to his house on the morning after the murders although the magistrate judge initially stated that he would not consider daut hoxha declaration due to the recantation,he later appeared to adopt the government view,holding that he could consider the declaration to the extent that it was independently corroborated.without permitting petitioner to introduce telephonic testimony from the recanting witnesses,the magistrate judge concluded that the albanian government submission was sufficient to satisfy probable cause.the judge therefore issued a certificate of extraditability and order of commitment providing that petitioner be committed to the united states marshal pending final disposition of his case by the secretary of state.
in march,petitioner filed a habeas corpus petition in united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,arguing that the magistrate judge erroneously denied petitioner the opportunity to present telephonic testimony from the recanting witnesses in order to demonstrate a lack of probable cause that the extradition treaty between the united states and albania was invalid and that petitioner would face torture and possible death if extradited to albania.the district court denied the petition in may.the district court held that,although the case against petitioner was riddled with holes under a reasonable doubt analysis,the very low standard for probable cause was satisfied even without the recanted testimony and the telephonic testimony was therefore irrelevant.the district court also held that the extradition treaty between the united states and albania was in full force and effect and that petitioner humanitarian claims could be considered only by the secretary of state.petitioner now appeals.
ii.discussion 
extradition is an executive rather than a judicial function.sidali ins,cir.for this reason,a court may conduct only a limited inquiry following a complaint seeking extradition.id.in an extradition hearing,the court decides whether the defendant is subject to surrender to the requesting government,a determination that requires a finding as to whether probable cause supports the charges against the defendant.id.at see also stating that upon a complaint for extradition,a court may consider whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain the charge under the provisions of the proper treaty or convention.if probable cause is satisfied,the judge makes a finding of extraditability,and the case is certified to the secretary of state for further action.sidali,at.
an individual challenging a court extradition order may not appeal directly,because the order does not constitute a final decision under,but may petition for a writ of habeas corpus.sidali,at.on habeas,a reviewing court may consider only whether the magistrate judge had jurisdiction,whether the offense charged is within the treaty and,by a somewhat liberal extension,whether there was any evidence warranting the finding that there was reasonable ground to believe the accused guilty.id.quoting fernandez phillips.here,petitioner does not argue that the magistrate judge lacked jurisdiction,nor does he contest that murder is within the scope of the states extradition treaty petitioner does,however,challenge the magistrate finding of probable cause,and also contends that the extradition treaty is no longer in force 
probable cause determination 
petitioner argues that the magistrate judge erred in excluding telephonic testimony from the witnesses who recanted their statements,and that the judge probable cause finding must be reversed on this basis.we review a magistrate judge decision to admit or exclude evidence in an extradition proceeding for abuse of discretion.see in re extradition of kraiselburd,cir.in addition,we uphold the judge finding of probable cause if there is any competent evidence in the record to support it.sidali,at.
in considering whether the magistrate judge should have allowed introduction of the testimony of the recanting witnesses,we focus on whether this evidence could have affected the probable cause analysis.the probable cause standard applicable to an extradition hearing is the same as the standard used in federal preliminary hearings.id.thus,the magistrate role is to determine whether there is competent evidence to justify holding the accused to await trial,and not to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to justify a conviction.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a judge may rely on hearsay evidence in considering whether probable cause is satisfied.in re,cir.
the range of evidence that a defendant may introduce as to probable cause at an extradition hearing is limited.courts have traditionally distinguished between inadmissible contradictory evidence,which merely conflicts with the government evidence,and admissible explanatory evidence,which entirely eliminates probable cause.see,barapind enomoto,cir the general rule is that evidence that explains away or completely obliterates probable cause is admissible,while evidence that merely controverts the existence of probable cause is not.internal quotation marks omitted koskotas roche,cir although it is within the discretion of the district court to permit the relator to offer limited,explanatory evidence relating to the charges against him,contradictory evidence properly may be excluded.citations omitted.in practice,this line is not easily drawn,but the rule serves the useful purpose of allowing the defendant to present reasonably proof of limited scope that has some reasonable chance of negating a showing of probable cause,while preventing the extradition proceedings from becoming a dress rehearsal trial.koskotas,at internal quotation marks omitted.
one circuit court has suggested that a recantation of inculpatory evidence does not constitute admissible explanatory evidence in an extradition hearing.see eain wilkes,cir refusing to admit such evidence because it do es not explain the government evidence,rather it tend s to contradict or challenge the credibility of the facts implicating petitioner.several district courts have found recantation evidence to be admissible,however.see,in re extradition of contreras,i t is obvious to this court that if the only evidence of probable cause were the confessions,and if sufficiently recanted,then the existence of probable cause would be negated.republic of france moghadam,distinguishing eain and holding that recantation was admissible in an extradition hearing because recantation had more indicia of reliability than original testimony,and therefore negated probable cause.
we need not decide whether a recantation of inculpatory testimony may ever be admitted in an extradition proceeding,because we find that the magistrate judge here did not abuse his discretion in finding the recantations inadmissible.although the initial declarations of daut,bejame,and ardjana hoxha were important to the government showing of probable cause,we believe that the recantation of those declarations did not negate probable cause.daut hoxha original declaration was independently corroborated by the evidence that the weapon used in the murders was found in fetah hoxha sofa and that fetah hoxha saw daut hoxha in his house on the day of the murder.nor did daut hoxha later retelling of the night events obliterate probable cause instead,it provided an alternative and contradictory narrative that can properly be presented at trial.sheqeri statement that petitioner had been seen near the kosemi home with a gun two weeks before the murder provided additional evidence suggesting petitioner guilt.the magistrate judge therefore did not abuse his discretion in excluding the recantation evidence.there was competent evidence to support the magistrate judge finding of probable cause,and we therefore decline to grant habeas relief on this basis 
validity of the extradition treaty 
for an extradition to proceed,there must be a valid extradition treaty between the requesting country and the united states.see sidali,at.a petitioner facing extradition has standing to challenge the validity of the applicable extradition treaty.united states ex rel.saroop garcia,cir.petitioner here argues that the extradition treaty between albania and the united states is invalid because the kingdom of albania,which was the signatory to the treaty in,no longer exists,and in the successor government rejected all treaties entered into by the kingdom of albania.we review de novo the district court legal conclusion that the extradition treaty is currently in force.see id.at.
whether a treaty remains valid following a change in the status of one of the signatories is a political question,and we therefore defer to the vie
