the court concluded the american procedure of denying credit for time served on probation violated the italian constitution.the court stated,probation is,in effect,a criminal sentence albeit an alternative way of serving a sentence.it follows,then,undeniably,that any system or law that does not take into account,in case of revocation,the subjection to such limitations during the preceding period of custody,constitutes an open violation of the principles enunciated in of the italian constitution since the of the custody period in case of probation failure is the same as the application of an additional sanction.because of the application of this additional sanction,the court determined the prison term sought by the riverside county probation department clearly represents an excessive sentence entirely disproportionate to the crime charged,and therefore violative of yet another provision of the italian constitution,paragraph.
as for the orange county cases,the court based its decision to grant extradition for these crimes on the existence of parallel italian criminal statutes concerning the substantive crimes charged,as well as the serious evidence of guilt in the record.
