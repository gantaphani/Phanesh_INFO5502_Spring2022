factual and procedural background 
hector bardales and emilia duarte are the parents of four children born in san diego three daughters born in,and,and a son born in.in,duarte took the children to live in mexico.in,the two older children visited bardales in california and never returned to mexico.
in,bardales met duarte and the two younger children in tijuana.bardales returned to california with the children and immediately initiated state court proceedings to prevent duarte from taking the children back to mexico.
as part of the state court proceedings,in april,bardales filed a petition to establish a parental relationship with the children and for sole physical and legal custody of the children.in his petition,bardales alleged duarte boyfriend had sexually abused the two older children.in addition,he alleged duarte knew of the abuse yet continued to have a relationship with him.hector further alleged he brought the two younger children to california because he feared for their safety.
in june,duarte filed a petition for return of the children under the convention.duarte alleged bardales wrongfully retained the two older children and wrongfully removed the two younger children to the united states in violation of the convention.she denied the children were abused or mistreated in her care and requested the court order them returned to mexico forthwith.she also requested the court not make any custody or visitation orders pending the outcome of her convention petition 
the court scheduled a hearing on both parties petitions and,in the interim,ordered bardales not to remove the children from san diego without prior court approval and to keep the court informed of the children current address and telephone number.in addition,the court appointed counsel for the children and requested counsel investigate facts related to three key convention issues the location of the children habitual residence to mexico if mexico is their habitual residence the existence of exceptions to requiring return of the children and the children preferences regarding where and with whom they reside.
the children counsel submitted a report recommending the court find the united states is the children habitual residence because duarte initially consented to the children living with bardales and then changed her mind.alternatively,counsel recommended the court find by clear and convincing evidence that returning the children to their mother in mexico would subject them to a grave risk of physical and emotional abuse because the children reported that duarte,her boyfriend,and duarte mother regularly beat them.they also reported that while in mexico,they did not eat regularly,they were always hungry,and they had to fend for themselves by trying to get food from the adults and children in their neighborhood.counsel further informed the court that none of the children wanted to return with duarte to mexico however,the two older children,who suffered the most abuse and whose return duarte no longer sought,would voluntarily return to protect the younger children if the court ordered the younger children returned.
the court continued the hearing on the petitions several times due to duarte and her counsel inability to appear.however,when duarte and her counsel were unable to appear for a hearing on december,the court declined to continue the matter again instead,the court took duarte petition off calendar for lack of prosecution and indicated she would need to refile it for it to be heard again the court also took duarte companion matters off calendar,including her request to partition real property she and bardales owned in joint tenancy.in addition,the court expunged a lis pendens duarte filed against the property as she no longer had a pending matter to which the lis pendens related.
with no convention matter pending,the court proceeded to address bardales petition and found he was the children legal father,a fact which the parties do not dispute.the court then awarded him joint legal and sole physical custody of the children,with duarte being permitted reasonable visitation.after imputing to duarte a minimum wage income,the court ordered her to pay bardales monthly child support of and,after finding she had equity in the real property she owned with bardales,the court ordered her to pay sanctions of.
in january,duarte filed a complaint in federal district court for the return of her children under the convention federal convention petition in march,she filed this appeal one day after receiving the notice of appeal,we expedited the appeal on our own motion.we then learned of the federal convention petition and requested the parties submit briefing on the issue of whether we should stay the appeal pending the resolution of the federal convention petition.bardales opposed a stay however,at duarte request,we issued one.
in november the federal district court entered a judgment denying the federal convention petition after duarte failed to appear at a scheduled hearing.after unsuccessfully moving for reconsideration,duarte appealed the district court judgment.in may the ninth circuit court of appeals reversed,concluding the district court erred in denying reconsideration.duarte bardales cir.
in august,after the ninth circuit remanded the matter back to the district court and the district court issued an order to show cause why the matter should not proceed on an expedited basis,duarte moved to voluntarily dismiss the matter.she sought the dismissal because her counsel was taking a medical leave of absence and could no longer represent her,her counsel could not find anyone else to handle the case on a pro bono basis,and it would be unfair to both parties and to the children to prolong this case.duarte bardales.lexis.the district court granted the motion and dismissed duarte petition.id.at.
approximately three weeks later,duarte counsel filed a status report with this court stating she had been released by her physicians to return to work and was ready to proceed with this appeal after considering the parties briefing and arguments,we affirm the trial court order.
discussion 
iappeal not moot 
bardales contends that duarte voluntary dismissal of her federal convention petition renders this appeal moot.although duarte has not opposed this contention,we conclude it has no merit.an appeal becomes moot when,through no fault of the respondent,the occurrence of an event renders it impossible for the appellate court to grant the appellant effective relief.in re esperanza th.because the federal district court order did not specify otherwise,its dismissal of duarte federal convention petition was without prejudice.fed.rules civ,rule a b.by definition,a voluntary dismissal without prejudice is not a final judgment on the merits.syufy enterprises city of oakland th.consequently,duarte voluntary dismissal of her federal convention petition has no preclusive effect in this matter and does not prevent us from granting her effective relief if she were entitled to it.
trial court had the power to dismiss convention petition for delayed prosecution and proceed on child custody matters 
duarte contends that the trial court order is void and should be set aside because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to rule on child custody and related issues.more particularly,duarte contends that under the convention and federal law,including the supremacy clause of the federal constitution,the trial court could not decide these issues until it adjudicated the merits of her convention petition.essentially,she contends the trial court had no power to dismiss her convention petition for del
