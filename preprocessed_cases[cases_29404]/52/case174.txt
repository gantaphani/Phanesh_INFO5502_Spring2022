carlos garcia was born in the dominican republic on december.his family immigrated to the united states in,and shortly thereafter,he became a lawful permanent resident.when garcia family arrived in the united states,they resided on west street in manhattan.
in,while his family was vacationing in the dominican republic,his mother divorced his father in a dominican court.the divorce decree purported to grant garcia mother guarda personal personal guardianship following the vacation,garcia family returned to manhattan and his parents continued living together on west street.in,the entire family moved to west street,and in august six years after the divorce,garcia mother finally moved into her own apartment.
on april,when garcia was under the age of eighteen,his father naturalized.garcia alleges that at the time,he resided with his father and that his father had actual uncontested custody of him.
on january,the former immigration and naturalization service ins charged garcia as removable under immigration and nationality act ina a c conviction for a firearm offense.ins took garcia into custody until an immigration judge ultimately cancelled his removal.see garcia dep t of homeland,d.garcia,however,soon found himself back on the wrong side of the law.
as a result of several convictions in and,the government served garcia with a notice to appear and ultimately ordered him removed to the dominican republic.garcia applied for derivative citizenship based on his father naturalization,but united states citizenship and immigration services cis denied his application,finding that the dominican republic divorce decree granted garcia mother,and not his father,legal custody.id.at.after the cis administrative appeals office denied his appeal,garcia filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court 
the district court denied garcia petition.it found the dominican republic divorce decree highly probative of which parent had custody garcia mother and therefore concluded that garcia was unable to demonstrate that he was in his father sole legal custody when his father naturalized garcia,d at.
throughout the initial proceedings,garcia proceeded pro se.when the case came before us,we appointed garcia pro bono counsel and asked for supplemental briefing.

the parties agree that when garcia father naturalized on april,there was a legal separation of the parents and garcia was under the age of eighteen.the parties disagree as to whether garcia was in the legal custody of his father at the time.
legal custody is a matter of federal law.see fierro reno,cir.nevertheless,we often look to state law for a rule of decision w here there is no extant body of federal common law in the area of law implicated by the statute.brissett ashcroft,cir.for example,in brissett,we held that the term legal separation contained in the same subsection of the statute requires a formal act,as defined by state law,that alters the marital relationship.brissett,at.in new york,the qualifying formal act is either divorce termination of the marriage or a formal written or judicial separation,which recognizes the separate existence of the marital parties.see id.we believe a similar reference to state law is appropriate,at least initially,for determining legal custody,as l egal relationships between parents and children are typically governed by state law,there being no federal law of domestic relations.fierro,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the first step in deciding whether a naturalizing parent has legal custody of a child for purposes of derivative citizenship is to determine whether a judicial decree or statutory grant awards custody to the naturalizing parent.bagot ashcroft,cir rosenn nygaard,concurring.but,notwithstanding a formal termination of the marriage,what if there is no judicial or authorized determination of custody in brissett,we indicated that the absence of a formal judicial determination or written separation agreement was fatal to a derivative citizenship claim.brissett,at.is an immigrant child of a naturalizing alien denied citizenship because there is no court order or formalized custody agreement we think not we are not convinced that our reasoning in brissett equally applies to determinations of legal custody.
in matter of m,bia,a child was born in czechoslovakia to married parents the mother was german and the father jewish.in,the mother annulled the marriage and father and daughter immigrated to the united states.they were lawfully admitted,and the father naturalized in when the child was under the age of eighteen.id.at.the annulment,which the board of immigration appeals bia treated as a divorce,made no provision for custody,but the mother had surrendered custody to the father.id.at.
the bia held 
i n the absence of judicial determination or judicial or statutory grant of custody in the case of legal separation of the parent of a person claiming citizenship under section c ina a predecessor,the parent having actual uncontested custody is to be regarded as having legal custody of the person concerned for the purpose of determining that person status under section c.
id.at.we accord substantial deference to the bia interpretations of the statutes and regulations that it administers.brissett,at.moreover,matter of m has been the law for years without congressional intervention the bia interpretation,thus,has substantial persuasive weight.see zhang holder,cir citing commodity futures trading comm schor,d other citations omitted.
decisions about the marital relationship tend to be final custody decisions,in contrast,tend to be fluid and frequently change depending on the parents situations and.see bagot,at rosenn nygaard,concurring.parents agreement to transfer legal custody is within the purview of their authority and it is not necessary for parents to come into court to change or amend a de c ree of divorce every time they jointly make a major decision concerning the care and custody of their children.tabucbuc ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted unpublished memorandum.
requiring a formal act to change custody something more than mere agreement is counterintuitive to the attempts that parents make following a divorce to conduct their lives and those of their children with one goal the children best interest.moreover,in the absence of a judicial determination giving one parent sole custody of the child,each parent generally retains the rights and responsibilities that come with parenthood.dom.rel.law mckinney see also jur d dom.rel.
our holding today is consistent with our decision in brissett.divorce and judicial separation are inherently different from custody decisions.bagot,at see also morgan att y,cir recognizing after bagot that in contrast to legal custody,legal separation does require a formal governmental action.the bia itself has recognized as much.compare brissett,at recognizing that the bia interprets legal separation to require a formal act,with matter of m,at bia interpretation that actual uncontested custody can constitute legal custody.
in his supplemental brief,garcia argues that new york would not recognize the dominican republic custody award and that if the dominican custodial decree is unenforceable,the parent with actual uncontested custody is the parent with legal custody for the purpose of evaluating his derivative citizenship claim.we agree.
at the time that garcia mother secured the divorce,garcia and his family resided in new york and had resided there for four years new york was their home state.at that time,new york had enacted the uniform child custody jurisdiction act uccja pursuant to the uccja,new york would not even consider recognizi
