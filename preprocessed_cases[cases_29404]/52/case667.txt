wild salmon and steelhead,which are listed as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act,have been the subject of much litigation in the federal courts.as they swim back and forth from the pacific northwest to canada,the fish have no cognizance of an international boundary,or the pacific salmon treaty of treaty,an effort by canada and the united states to manage salmon populations originating in alaska and the pacific northwest.
this appeal concerns whether three conservation groups have standing to challenge the decision of federal agencies and officials to enter into,and remain a party to,that treaty.the groups alleged that take levels permitted under the treaty have allowed canadian fisheries to overharvest endangered and threatened salmon and steelhead.the district court dismissed all three of their claims for lack of standing.we reverse the district court in part because the groups have procedural standing to bring their third claim for relief.we affirm the dismissal of the first and second claims.
background 
at the heart of this case are chinook and coho salmon and steelhead trout populations from puget sound,lower columbia river,and snake river collectively,salmon.populations of these salmon are listed as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act,et.esa.during their lifetime,these fish swim northward toward waters off the coast of british columbia and alaska,and then journey back through alaskan and canadian waters to return to their rivers of origin,where they spawn and die.because of these unusual transboundary migration patterns,salmon that originate in united states waters are often caught by commercial and recreational fishers in canada before they can make it back to their rivers of origin.
in,canada and the united states entered into the pacific salmon treaty to manage salmon populations originating in alaska,canada,and the pacific northwest.that version of the treaty set harvest ceilings for fisheries in both countries.those ceilings remained constant from year to year.the ceilings initially proved successful at increasing salmon survival,but a drought in the early and poor survival conditions reversed that effect.in,the treaty expired.unable to work out another agreement,the united states and canada went back to managing their respective fisheries independently.
in,the two countries entered into another treaty,which is at the heart of this litigation.in contrast to the version,a portion of the treaty established annual chinook management regimes for fisheries off the coast of southeast alaska,canada,washington,and oregon.because canadian,or northern,fisheries harvest listed salmon in substantially greater numbers than the united states,or southern,fisheries,the treaty provisions focus mostly on the take levels of canadian fisheries.rather than setting absolute harvest ceilings that remain unchanged from year to year,the treaty sets annual chinook harvest limits based on pre and estimates of abundance.
the treaty is implemented through the pacific salmon commission commission.the commission collects data on harvest from the two countries,and then recommends fishery management regimes.the secretary of state of the united states,in consultation with the secretary of commerce and the secretary of the interior,approves or disapproves regimes that are recommended by the commission.a.only those fishery regimes that are approved by the secretary of state under subsection a are forwarded to the states and tribes for implementation.id.b.the treaty provisions will expire at the end of,unless the united states and canada agree to an extension or modification.
the united states implementation of the treaty provisions was conditioned on its compliance with the requirements of the esa.under a,a,federal agencies must consult with either the national marine fisheries service nmfs or the fish and wildlife service fws to insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species.formal consultation begins with a written request by the agency planning to take action action agency,and concludes with the issuance of a biological opinion biop by either nmfs or fws as the consulting agency.c,l.nmfs or fws opines in the biop whether the proposed action,taken together with its cumulative effects,is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species.id.g.
if an action is likely to jeopardize a species,the action agency must determine whether any reasonable and prudent alternatives rpa exist that will avoid jeopardizing threatened species.b a h.if the biop results in a no jeopardy finding,or an rpa is available,nmfs or fws will issue an incidental take statement with the biop that exempts the action agency,and those authorized by it,from the taking prohibition of esa,b.
the agency action triggering the esa consultation process in this case was the state department decision to enter into the treaty on behalf of the united states.in effect,nmfs,as the consulting agency,studied whether canadian take under the levels permitted by the treaty would jeopardize listed salmon.nmfs issued a biop in which it concluded that canadian take under the treaty was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of threatened or endangered salmon stocks.because nmfs made a no jeopardy determination,it had no obligation to identify any alternatives.b a.nmfs included an incidental take statement to exempt the agencies from liability under esa.
in november,three conservation spawning recovery alliance,native fish society,and flyfishers collectively salmon spawning filed this action.salmon spawning alleged that the department of commerce,nmfs,the state department,and the heads of those agencies in their official capacities,violated their obligations under esa,and,and and of the administrative procedure act apa,and.the conservation groups challenged the biop as flawed,alleged that the federal agencies and officials violated their substantive duties under the esa by continuing to implement the treaty provisions,and claimed that formal consultation needed to be reinitiated in light of new information about listed salmon.the groups noted that in,nmfs issued a biop in which it acknowledged that the canadian harvest of nooksack river chinook is above the rate necessary to rebuild the population.nmfs also noted in the biop that harvest rates by united states and canadian fisheries of pacific northwest chinook from populations other than those at issue were too high to allow these populations to recover.
the agencies and officials moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of standing under federal rule of civil procedure b,or,in the alternative,for failure to state a claim under rule b.the district court ultimately dismissed the complaint for lack of standing under article iii,concluding that salmon spawning failed to show causation and redressibility.according to the court,the cause of the excessive harvesting was canadian fishermen,and redress was speculative because the court could not direct the state department to renegotiate the treaty with canada.standing is a question of law that we review de novo.citizens for better forestry dep t of,cir.
the broad contours of article iii standing are well known.we must first decide whether a plaintiff has suffered sufficient injury to satisfy the case or controversy requirement of article iii.bennett spear,d cetacean cmty.bush,cir.the plaintiff has the burden of establishing the three elements of article iii standing he or she has suffered an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized,and actual or imminent the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable court decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
statutory standing is the second part of the inquiry.cetacean,at.if a plaintiff has shown sufficient injury to satisfy article iii,but has not been granted statutory standing,the suit must be dismissed under federal rule of civil procedure b,because the plaintiff can not state a claim upon which relief can be granted.canyon county syngenta seeds,cir citing cetacean,at.
alleged legal inadequacy of the biop 
in the first claim for relief,salmon spawning alleged that the biop authorizing the united states entry into the treaty was arbitrary and capricious in violation of of the apa,and also a violation of esa and.specifically,the groups claimed that the biop improperly compared only the treaty effect on harvest rates to harvest rates in the absence of the treaty,instead of aggregating the effects of take under the treaty,other harvest impacts,and impacts failed to evaluate the effects of take under the treaty on the recovery and survival of listed salmon evaluated only a fraction of the puget sound chinook populations did not develop or apply a biologically based target exploitation rate in its jeopardy evaluation of upper willamette chinook studied harvest impacts on the strongest components of the lower columbia chinook population,but not the weaker ones and failed to analyze or propose reasonable and prudent measures or alternatives that would force the fisheries to target more selectively salmon in short,the conservationists challenge the biological foundation for the treaty.
to satisfy the requirement of the article iii inquiry,a plaintiff asserting a procedural injury must show that the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.citizens for better forestry dep t of,cir quoting public citizen dep t of,cir,rev on other grounds,d quoting cantrell city of long beach,cir.the conservation groups alleged in their complaint that they have various scientific,educational,aesthetic,recreational,spiritual,conservation,economic,and business interests in the salmon.the consultation procedures in example,the requirements that the biop evaluate both the recovery and survival of listed species,and that rpa or reasonable and prudent measures are these concrete interests.see defining,for purposes of esa a,to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species b a requiring the proposal of rpa if jeopardy is found.these procedures are designed to advance the esa overall goal of species preservation,and thus the groups specific goals as to salmon preservation,by ensuring agency compliance with the esa substantive provisions.see bennett,at.
a showing of procedural injury lessens a plaintiff burden on the last two prongs of the article iii standing inquiry,causation and redressibility.see lujan,at.stating that the person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressibility and immediacy.plaintiffs alleging procedural injury must show only that they have a procedural right that,if exercised,could protect their concrete interests.defenders of wildlife epa,cir emphasis in original,overruled on other grounds by ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d.it is at this step of the standing analysis that the conservation groups stumble.
the biop considered two proposed agency actions,only one of which is at issue in this appeal the formal commitment of the to implement its fishery obligations consistent with,and for the duration of,the new pst a final approval of the agreement.the biop recognized that,once the united states entered into the treaty,fishing levels in canada will be set by the provisions of the agreement for its duration,and can not be except as may otherwise be agreed by both countries.emphasis added.
the relationship between the biop and the treaty sets up a dichotomy of interests that sinks the effort to establish article iii standing for the first two claims if the groups were successful in establishing that nmfs failed to comply with the procedural requirements of esa in deciding whether the united states entrance into the treaty would jeopardize listed species,the procedurally flawed consultation and defective biop could theoretically be set aside.see.but,a court could not set aside the next,and more significant,link in the united states entrance into the treaty.while the united states and canada can decide to withdraw from the treaty,that is a decision committed to the executive branch,and we may not order the state department to withdraw from it.see earth island inst.christopher,cir deciding not to enforce a statute that required the executive branch to negotiate with foreign nations,as that branch alone has the exclusive power to conduct foreign relations.so,while the groups correctly allege that they have a right to a procedurally sound consultation,they can not demonstrate that that right,if exercised,could protect their concrete interests.defenders of wildlife,at.
plaintiffs alleging procedural injury can often establish redressibility with little difficulty,because they need to show only that the relief the agency follow the correct influence the agency ultimate decision of whether to take or refrain from taking a certain action.see,pit river tribe forest,cir.this is not a high bar to meet.but,the redressibility requirement is not toothless in procedural injury cases.here,if a court were to give the groups the remedy that they nmfs and the state department follow the proper procedures during a new consultation ultimate agency decision of whether to enter into the treaty with canada,made nine years ago,could never be influenced.in effect,if we rule against the groups claim of procedural injury,they will continue to suffer injury and,if we rule in their favor,they will still suffer injury because we can not undo the treaty.id.that the biop authorized the united states to enter into a treaty with a foreign sovereign foreclose s our ability to provide effective relief.id.
perhaps recognizing their redressibility quandary,the conservation groups assert that the biop authorized agency actions broader than the state department entrance into the treaty but,this semantic attempt to turn the biop into a freestanding basis for relief fails.the agency action that the biop authorized was the united states entrance into the treaty.and,although we can set aside the biop,we can not remedy the harm asserted.we affirm the district court dismissal of the first claim for lack of standing.
ii.the agencies continued implementation of the treaty 
in its second claim for relief,salmon spawning asserted that the agencies and officials continued participation in the implementation of the treaty jeopardized listed salmon in violation of esa a,and that such participation was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the apa.section a confers upon agencies that are considering discretionary actions an affirmative obligation when their actions could cause harm to an endangered species.defenders of wildlife,at.this duty is separate from an agency responsibility to comply with the procedures required by.see id.at noting that a plaintiff may allege both procedural and substantive violations of the esa.in other words,even if an action agency has satisfied the esa consultation requirements,a court may conclude that the agency has not complied with its substantive duty to avoid jeopardy.id.so,in contrast to its first claim,which focused on alleged procedural flaws that occurred during the consultation process,salmon spawning second claim challenges the agencies decision to continue allowing excessive canadian harvesting now that the united states is a party to the treaty.
even assuming that salmon spawning meets the asserting that its scientific,educational,aesthetic,recreational,economic,and business interests in the listed species will continue to be harmed by the failure to correct overharvesting by the more difficult question is whether the groups have established causation and redressibility with respect to this claim.to show causation,the plaintiff must demonstrate a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.lujan,at.quoting simon eastern.welfare rights,d internal quotation marks omitted.
