these consolidated appeals arise from attempts by stephen flatow flatow and dariush elahi elahi to collect on default judgments they obtained against the islamic republic of iran iran in the united states district court for the district of columbia.that court found iran liable for the terrorist acts that resulted in the deaths of flatow daughter and elahi brother.in both cases,the district court assessed substantial compensatory and punitive damages against iran.
in the underlying case,iran ministry of defense mod successfully petitioned the district court for the southern district of california to confirm an arbitration award issued in its favor by the international chamber of commerce icc.the million award had been issued against a supplier of military equipment,cubic defense systems,cubic,and related to a claimed breach of contract by cubic in providing military hardware to mod.shortly after the district court confirmed the arbitration award,flatow moved to intervene in the case.the district court denied flatow motion,and that decision is the subject of the appeal in case.later,both flatow and elahi moved to attach mod judgment against cubic.in turn,mod moved the district court for a determination that its judgment against cubic was immune from attachment.the district court granted mod motion with respect to flatow,but denied it with respect to elahi.flatow and mod appeal those determinations in case and,respectively.
jurisdiction 
the denial of a motion to intervene as of right is an appealable final order.leisnoi,united states,cir.in addition,district court orders entered after the entry of judgment are generally reviewable by a separate appeal.see united states v.one ford pickup,cir.we therefore have jurisdiction over the consolidated appeals pursuant to.
background 
the flatow default judgment 
on april,alisa michelle flatow,an american college student living in israel,died of injuries she sustained as a result of a suicide bombing in the gaza strip.see flatow islamic republic of iran.her father,stephen flatow,later brought suit against iran,its ministry of information and security mois,and various iranian officials in the district court for the district of columbia the iranian government and its officials did not enter an appearance,and the district court entered a default judgment against them on march.id.at.prior to entering judgment,however,the court conducted an evidentiary hearing and set forth detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.the court found that flatow had established his claim to relief in that the iranian government and the other defendants had sponsored terrorist acts and performed acts which caused the death of flatow daughter id.at.the district court also held that it had jurisdiction over the action and personal jurisdiction over the defendants.id.at.the judgment against the iranian defendants was for in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.id.at.
the elahi default judgment 
on october,cyrus elahi was assassinated in paris,france.see elahi islamic republic of iran,d.elahi was a naturalized united states citizen and an important official in an iranian opposition group working from france.id.at.french authorities arrested a number of iranian nationals,and determined that the assassination had been orchestrated by the iranian government through mois.id.at.in,elahi brother,dariush elahi,filed suit against iran and mois in the district court for the district of columbia.as with the flatow case,the iranian government did not enter an appearance with that court,and the court therefore entered a default judgment in favor of elahi in december.id.at.before entering judgment,the district court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law.the judgment against iran was for compensatory damages in the amount of,and punitive damages of.id.at.
the case against cubic defense systems 
in october,mod predecessor entered into a pair of contracts with cubic,a defense firm,relating to the sale and servicing of an air combat maneuvering range acmr for use by the iranian air force.ministry of def.cubic def.systems,d.following the iranian revolution of,the delivery of the acmr did not take place for reasons that the two parties dispute.see id.in september,and pursuant to the terms of the contracts,mod filed a request for arbitration with the icc in zurich,switzerland.id.after submissions from both mod and cubic,the icc ruled in favor of mod and issued a final award requiring cubic to pay mod million.id.at.
in june,mod filed a petition in the district court for the southern district of california to confirm the award entered by the icc pursuant to the new york convention id.at.after reviewing cubic arguments in opposition,the district court granted mod petition and confirmed the icc award on december.id.at both cubic and mod took cross appeals of the district court decision,and those appeals remain pending.
on february,flatow filed a motion for leave to intervene in the district court.flatow pointed out that he had obtained a summons in garnishment directed at cubic from the district court for the eastern district of virginia,and that he expected to receive an order of condemnation from that court as to mod cause of action in the cubic case.the district court denied flatow motion on april,finding that,under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,the motion was untimely and flatow had failed to establish an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject matter of the litigation.on june,flatow filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court decision,but the district court denied the motion on august.flatow filed a notice of appeal from the denial of his motion for reconsideration on september.we heard oral arguments on this appeal on december,but vacated submission of the case pending the resolution of a motion by mod to dismiss the appeal.mod claimed that flatow acceptance of payments under the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of rendered him unable to collect against the cubic judgment.we directed that mod motion to dismiss be filed in the district court and stayed the intervention appeal pending that court decision.
at the same time that flatow motion to intervene was being rejected,flatow filed a notice of lien with the district court on april.the notice indicated that flatow had registered his default judgment against iran in the southern district of california,and claimed that any monies to be distributed as part of the cubic judgment should be directed to him.a similar notice of lien was filed by elahi on november.
on september,mod filed motions seeking a judicial determination that its judgment against cubic defense systems was immune from attachment by both flatow and elahi.the district court heard oral argument on the motion on october,and rendered its decision on november.the district court granted mod motion as to flatow and ordered the striking of flatow notice of lien,but it denied the motion as to elahi,finding that mod judgment was not immune from attachment by elahi.ministry of def.cubic def.systems,d,hereinafter district court order.both flatow and mod filed timely appeals.
discussion 
i.the denial of flatow motion to intervene 
we examine first the district court decision to deny flatow motion to intervene as of right under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure in the underlying litigation between mod and cubic.ordinarily,we review the denial of a motion to intervene de novo.see arakaki cayetano,cir.however,flatow appeal is not from the denial of the motion to intervene itself but from the denial of his motion for reconsideration of that decision.we therefore review for an abuse of discretion.smith pac.properties dev,cir.
we have previously explained that an applicant for intervention as of right under rule a must comply with the following four requirements 
the application for intervention must be timely 
the applicant must have a significantly protect able interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action the applicant must be so situated that the disposition of the action may,as a practical matter,impair or impede the applicant ability to protect that interest and the applicant interest must not be adequately represented by the existing parties in the lawsuit.
southwest ctr.for biological diversity berg,cir.in this case,the district court denied flatow motion for leave to intervene on the grounds that the motion was untimely and that flatow had failed to establish an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject matter of litigation.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reconsider its determination regarding flatow motion to intervene.flatow claimed to meet the significantly protectable interest prong of the rule a test because he is a judgment creditor of mod and therefore has an interest in ensuring he is able to collect on his judgment.our court has already rejected this line of argument,however,in a decision issued after the briefs were filed in these appeals.see united states alisal water,cir.in alisal water,we explained that the mere interest in the prospective collectability of a debt is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of rule a,unless that interest is related to the underlying subject matter of the action.in this case,flatow asserts no interest related to the underlying dispute between mod and cubic.therefore,under alisal water,the district court properly rejected flatow attempt to intervene as of right in the underlying litigation 
we affirm the district court denial of flatow motion for reconsideration.
ii.flatow waiver of claims against iran 
mod argues that flatow has waived any claim that he may have had on the cubic judgment through his acceptance of payments under section of the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of,stat.victims protection act.the district court agreed with mod and ordered the district court clerk to strike the lien that flatow had placed on the cubic judgment.district court order at.because the district court decision presents purely legal questions,we review it de novo.ballaris wacker siltronic,cir.
in enacting section of the victims protection act,congress created a mechanism through which individuals holding judgments against iran or cuba,based on those nations sponsorship of terrorist activity,could collect damages from a special fund established by the united states government.claimants had to choose between either a recovering percent of the compensatory damages awarded in the judgment in return for relinquishing any rights as to compensatory or punitive damages,or b recovering percent of the compensatory damages and relinquishing all rights as to compensatory damages but relinquishing only certain rights as to the punitive damages portion of their judgment.victims protection act sections a and a.claimants choosing option b would be required to relinquish all rights to execute against or attach property that is at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal,that is the subject of awards rendered by such tribunal,or that is subject to section f a of title,united states code.victims protection act section a d.
neither flatow nor mod disputes that flatow opted for option b under the victims protection act and that he therefore received a payment of percent of the compensatory damages he was awarded in the default judgment issued by the district court for the district of columbia.what the parties do dispute is the breadth of the relinquishment provision quoted above and whether it covers the judgment mod obtained against cubic.mod does not argue that the cubic judgment is either at issue in claims before an international tribunal or the subject of awards rendered by such a tribunal.instead,mod claims that the cubic judgment is property that is subject to f a.determining the viability of mod claim requires us to follow a labyrinthine path through several statutes and regulations.
title f a provides that 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,including but not limited to section f of the foreign missions act f,and except as provided in subparagraph b,any property with respect to which financial transactions are prohibited or regulated pursuant to section b of the trading with the enemy act.b,section a of the foreign assistance act of a,sections and of the international emergency economic powers act,or any other proclamation,order,regulation,or license issued pursuant thereto,shall be subject to execution or attachment in aid of execution of any judgment relating to a claim for which a foreign state including any agency or instrumentality or such state claiming such property is not immune under section a.
mod argues that the cubic judgment is subject to this provision because it is property with respect to which financial transactions are prohibited or regulated pursuant to sections and of the international emergency economic powers act ieepa or regulations issued pursuant to those sections.
we therefore turn to sections and of the ieepa,which generally provide authority for the president to regulate financial transactions and other transfers of property involving a foreign country when he declares a national emergency with respect to any unusual and extraordinary threat emanating from outside the united states.see ieepa section.as relevant here,section of the ieepa provides that the president may,under such regulations as he may prescribe regulate any transactions involving any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest by any person,or with respect to any property,subject to the jurisdiction of the united states.a the president has exercised this authority with respect to iran since,when president carter declared a national emergency with respect to that country in response to the taking of hostages in the united states embassy in tehran.see exec.order.pursuant to that and subsequent declarations the the department of the established two regulatory schemes relating to transactions involving iran the iranian assets control regulations iacr,pt,which regulate transactions involving iranian property subject to united states jurisdiction,and the iranian transactions regulations itr,pt,which regulate trade and financial transactions between united states entities and iran see flatow islamic republic of iran.only the iacr are relevant to our analysis of this aspect of the case.
title provides that 
no property subject to the jurisdiction of the united states or which is in the possession of or control of persons subject to the jurisdiction of the united states in which on or after november,iran has any interest of any nature whatsoever may be transferred,paid,exported,withdrawn or otherwise dealt in except as authorized.
section defines property for purposes of to include judgments.the combination of these regulations makes clear that the cubic judgment is property regulated by the iacr and that the iacr have been enacted pursuant to sections and of ieepa.this means,in turn,that the cubic judgment is subject to f a,as provided for in the victims protection act,and that flatow therefore relinquished all rights to execute against or attach that judgment when he received payments under the act.
flatow arguments against this conclusion are unavailing.flatow first claims that reading the relevant statutes and regulations to preclude attachment of the cubic judgment would create a conflict between the victims protection act and the duties embodied in the new york convention to enforce foreign arbitral awards.the new york convention,however,has been fully enforced in this case the district court has confirmed the icc award obtained by mod against cubic.see ministry of def.cubic def.systems,d.the award has,in essence,been transformed into a judgment of a federal court,and the new york convention is now irrelevant to whether that judgment can be attached by a victrix salen dry cargo,cir t he new york convention does not apply to the enforcement of judgments that confirm foreign arbitration awards.
flatow second argument is that the cubic judgment is not currently regulated by the ieepa.flatow points out that a provides that t ransactions involving property in which iran or an iranian entity has an interest are authorized where t he interest in the property of iran or an iranian entity arises after january.this provision is one of several general licenses which authorize particular categories of transactions involving iranian property.see see also a defining general licenses.flatow contends that a is applicable to the cubic judgment because it is property in which mod gained an interest after january.with this much we agree.see section iii,infra.flatow further contends,however,that deregulates the cubic judgment,so as to render it property not subject to regulation under ieepa.with this proposition we can not agree.as noted earlier,prohibits any dealings in iranian property subject to the jurisdiction of the united states except as authorized.section then authorize s transactions involving certain property,including the cubic judgment.the fact that a range of conduct is authorized or permitted does not mean that it is not regulated to the contrary,the fact that purports to authorize transactions related to the cubic judgment reinforces the notion that the judgment is property regulated by the iranian regulations and ieepa.see flatow,at the fact that a transaction is authorized by an ofac license confirms that it is regulated by ieepa and by regulations or licenses issued pursuant thereto.we note,for instance,that any transactions involving the cubic judgment remain subject to the requirements set out at moreover,our reading of the relevant statutes and regulations is the one adopted by ofac which is charged with administering the iranian regulations,and ofac interpretation is entitled to deference.see consarc united states treasury dep t,office of foreign assets control,holding that ofac is entitled to chevron deference in its interpretations of ieepa.for these reasons,we reject flatow contention that or any other general or specific licenses render the cubic judgment not regulated by ieepa.
flatow final argument is that our reading of the statutes and regulations would lead to an absurd result.united states,cir a statute must not be construed in a way that produces absurd results.because virtually all iranian property in the united states is regulated under ieepa,flatow argues that he may never be able to collect on the punitive portion of his default judgment.flatow would therefore have given up a payment of percent of his compensatory damages under the victims protection act for a nonexistent possibility.we recognize that flatow ability to collect the punitive damages portion of his judgment is severely restricted under the scheme set up by congress in the victims protection act.we do not believe,however,that our reading of the statutes would lead to an absurd result flatow may yet be able to collect against iranian property not subject to the iranian regulations moreover,at the time of flatow selection under the victims protection act,flatow was should have been his ability to collect the punitive damages portion of the default judgment would be quite limited.the notice implementing the payment scheme established by the act warned claimants in flatow position of the consequences of retaining a right to pursue punitive damages 
because of the comprehensive sanctions programs in place against iran pursuant to ieepa and against cuba pursuant to twea,see parts,and,virtually every transaction involving iranian or cuban property within the jurisdiction of the united states is either prohibited or regulated,permitted only by a general license in regulations promulgated by the office of foreign assets control ofac,department of the treasury,or by a specific license issued by ofac thus,virtually all iranian or cuban property within the jurisdiction of the united states is property with respect to which financial transactions are prohibited or regulated pursuant to ieepa or twea.section a d of the victims protection act therefore prohibits an applicant who elects the per cent option from seeking to execute his or her punitive damage award against,or from seeking to attach,virtually all iranian or cuban assets within the jurisdiction of the united states.
notice payments to persons who hold certain categories of judgments against cuba or iran,emphasis added.the plain meaning of the statute and regulations precludes relief for flatow.
we hold that flatow relinquished any claim as to the cubic judgment when he accepted payments under the victims protection act.
iii.elahi ability to attach the cubic judgment 
it is undisputed that elahi did not receive payments under the victims protection act,so that issue does not apply to his case.mod argues,however,that elahi may not attach the cubic judgment because he has not shown that any of the exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity from attachment set out in the foreign sovereign immunities act of fsia or the act,are applicable in this case.we review the existence of sovereign immunity de novo.see park shin,cir.
mod purported waiver of sovereign immunity 
the district court found that sovereign immunity did not prevent elahi from attaching the cubic judgment because mod had waived its immunity by both submitting to arbitration at the icc and then seeking to have the icc award confirmed in a federal court.as we explain below,the district court erred in this portion of its analysis by confounding two different aspects of foreign sovereign immunity.
the fsia is a comprehensive statute containing a set of legal standards governing claims of immunity in every civil action against a foreign state or its political subdivisions,agencies,or instrumentalities.republic of austria altmann,d quoting verlinden central bank of nigeria,d internal quotations omitted.the fsia codified the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity,which held that a foreign sovereign immunity is confined to suits involving the foreign sovereign public acts,and does not extend to cases arising out of a foreign state strictly commercial acts.verlinden,at.however,while the fsia represented a significant development in how claims of foreign sovereign immunity are to be adjudicated in the courts of this country,it did not repeal the conceptual framework of foreign sovereign immunity as it had developed prior to the fsia passage.in particular,the fsia preserved a distinction between two different aspects of foreign sovereign immunity jurisdictional is,a foreign sovereign immunity from actions brought in united states immunity from foreign sovereign immunity from having its property attached or executed upon.see.bank of commerce republic of congo,cir.the fsia structure demonstrates that it preserves the distinction between these two types of immunity.on the one hand,establishes a default rule that a foreign sovereign will be immune from the jurisdiction of united states courts unless one of the exceptions set out in applies on the other hand,provides that the property of foreign states and their instrumentalities will be immune from attachment and execution unless one of the exceptions set out in applies.a foreign sovereign waiver of immunity is one of the exceptions to both jurisdictional immunity and immunity from attachment.see a,a and b.
elahi contends that mod actions in seeking to confirm the icc award against cubic resulted in an implicit waiver of its foreign sovereign immunity we agree to the extent that elahi is referring to mod jurisdictional immunity from suit.in other words,we agree that mod implicitly waived its immunity from being subjected to the jurisdiction of united states courts when it sought to confirm the icc award in fact,mod concedes as much.mod brief in at.the question we must address,however,is whether mod waiver of jurisdictional immunity also constituted a waiver of its immunity from attachment of its property under a or b.
prior to the passage of the fsia,the courts that had addressed this question had held that a foreign state waiver of jurisdictional immunity did not constitute a waiver of its immunity from attachment of its property.see flota maritima browning de cuba,motor vessel ciudad de la habana,cir a distinction has been drawn between jurisdictional immunity and immunity from execution of the property of a sovereign,and waiver of the former is not necessarily a waiver of the latter.dexter carpenter kunglig jarnvagsstyrelsen,cir holding that waiver of jurisdictional immunity does not waive immunity from attachment rich naviera vacuba,same.the fsia narrowed the scope of immunity from attachment but as we explained above,the structure of the act makes clear that it preserved the traditional distinction between the two forms of immunity.the scant authority that speaks on the subject suggests that the statute did not change the earlier rule that waiver of jurisdictional immunity does not constitute a waiver of immunity from attachment.see restatement third of foreign relations law of the united states b noting that under inter national law,a waiver of immunity from suit does not imply a waiver of immunity from attachment of property,and a waiver of immunity from attachment of property does not imply a waiver of immunity from suit.deletelier republic of chile,cir noting that,in enacting fsia,congress did not intend to reverse completely the historical and international antipathy to executing against a foreign state property even in cases where a judgment could be had on the merits.for these reasons,and because we construe the waiver provisions in fsia narrowly,see joseph office of the consulate of nigeria,cir,we conclude that mod waiver of jurisdictional immunity did not also constitute a waiver of its immunity from having its property attached.
attachment under b of the fsia 
even though we reject the district court finding that mod had waived its sovereign immunity from attachment,we nonetheless affirm its determination that the cubic judgment is subject to attachment by elahi because we conclude that the judgment is subject to the exception in b of the fsia the relevant part of that section provides that 
a ny property in the united states of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state engaged in commercial activity in the united states shall not be immune from attachment in aid of execution,or from execution,upon a judgment entered by a court of the united states or of a state after the effective date of this act,if 
the judgment relates to a claim for which the agency or instrumentality is not immune by virtue of section a,or,or b of this chapter,regardless of whether the property is or was involved in the act upon which the claim is based.
b.this provision will apply to the cubic judgment if mod is engaged in commercial activity in the united states and elahi claim is one for which mod is not immune by virtue of a.
mod was engaged in commercial activity within the meaning of b.the phrase commercial activity is defined by fsia as meaning either a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act.d.the statutory definition further makes clear that t he commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act,rather than by reference to its purpose.see also saudi arabia nelson,d.mod dispute with cubic arose out of a contract between mod predecessor and cubic for the purchase of military equipment.we have twice recognized that a contract to purchase military supplies,although clearly undertaken for public use,is commercial in nature joseph office of the consulate of nigeria,cir see also park shin,cir quoting joseph.although perhaps not technically bound by these statements,we find them persuasive because they are consistent with the legislative history of the fsia,see fsia house report at a contract by a foreign government to buy provisions or equipment for its armed forces constitutes a commercial activity,and with the holdings of other courts which have considered the question.see mcdonnell douglas islamic republic of iran,cir holding that the intent of the purchasing sovereign to use the goods for military purposes does not take the transaction outside of the commercial exception to sovereign immunity virtual def.dev.int l,republic of moldova,d,holding that contract for sale of fighters was commercial activity for purposes of fsia.we therefore hold that mod is engaged in commercial activity in the united states within the meaning of the fsia because of its contractual relationship with cubic.
we also conclude that elahi claim is one for which mod is not immune by virtue of a.a explains that a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states in cases involving terrorist activity.the term foreign state in a is defined in a,which states that a foreign state as used in the statute includes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality.thus,under a,once a foreign state has engaged in terrorist activity,all of its agencies and instrumentalities are likewise not immune from jurisdiction.
in this case,elahi seeks to attach mod property to enforce a judgment brought under a against iran,and under a,iran was a foreign state that included all of the agencies and instrumentalities of iran.one of those agencies was mod.thus,the underlying removal of iran sovereign immunity under a also removed the sovereign immunity of mod,and for the purpose of determining whether mod lacks immunity from attachment under b,the underlying circuit judgment was one for which mod was not immune by virtue of a 
although a also discusses foreign state immunity from attachment,this reading of b is consistent with the structure of as a whole.in a,congress denied sovereign immunity from attachment to a foreign state property used for a commercial activity in the united states.in b,congress denied attachment immunity for property of foreign state agencies engaged in commercial activity.in both instances,the underlying purpose was to deny sovereign immunity from attachment to satisfy judgments against foreign states in circumstances where the foreign government is engaging in commercial activity in the united directly,through the use of particular property,or indirectly,through the commercial activities of an agency or instrumentality.
while we hold that a foreign state agency is not immune from attachment of its property to satisfy a judgment against a foreign state so long as the conditions of b are met,we do not hold that the property of any foreign state agency or instrumentality can be used to satisfy any judgment against a foreign state.rather,once it has been established that a foreign state agency or instrumentality has no immunity from attachment of its property under b,it is then necessary also to determine whether the agency or instrumentality is liable so that its property may be attached.we explained that attachment immunity and attachment liability are distinct issues in flatow islamic republic of iran,cir.while t he enumerated exceptions to the fsia provide the exclusive source of jurisdiction over civil actions brought against foreign states,the fsia does not resolve questions of attachment liability.questions of liability are addressed by bancec which examines the circumstances under which a foreign entity can be held substantively liable for the foreign government judgment debt.id.internal citation omitted.
in bancec,the supreme court held that foreign agencies and instrumentalities,even those wholly owned by a foreign government,are subject to a presumption of separate judicial status.at.thus,in the ordinary course of business,a foreign instrumentality will not have its property subject to attachment to satisfy a judgment against a foreign state,regardless of b.the court noted,however,that there are a number of situations in which that presumption of separate status can be overcome.id.at.most significantly for our purposes here,the presumption of separate status can be overcome when it can be shown that the corporate entity is so extensively controlled by its owner that a relationship of principal and agent is created.id.at.in walter fuller aircraft sales republic of the philippines,cir,for example,the fifth circuit discussed five bancec factors to determine when the presumption of separate judicial status should be overcome in determining attachment liability.see id.describing the level of economic control by the government whether the entity profits go to the government the degree to which government officials manage the entity or otherwise have a hand in its daily affairs whether the government is the real beneficiary of the entity conduct and whether adherence to separate identities would entitle the foreign state to benefits in united states courts while avoiding its obligations see also flatow i,at discussing walter fuller.here,an analysis of mod relationship to iran with respect to each of these factors makes clear that the bancec presumption of separate judicial status is overcome mod is a central organ of the iranian government under direct control of the government.as a result,mod not only lacks immunity from attachment but is also liable for attachment of its property to enforce the underlying judgment against iran.
in sum,to determine whether the property of a foreign state agency or instrumentality can be attached to enforce a judgment against a foreign state,we apply a analysis.first,we look at whether the judgment is one for which the agency is not immune from attachment under fsia and second,if so,we determine whether the foreign agency or instrumentality should be held liable for attachment under bancec.applying this analysis to this case,we find that a mod cubic judgment falls under the exception to foreign sovereign immunity from attachment set out in b and b mod is liable for attachment of its property to enforce a judgment against iran under bancec.
exemptions from attachment under of fsia 
mod argues that,even if the cubic judgment is subject to attachment under of fsia,elahi is still precluded from attaching the judgment because it falls under one of the exemptions from attachment set out in b.we examine each of the arguments advanced by mod in turn.
the cubic judgment as military property under b of the fsia 
mod argues that the cubic judgment is exempted from attachment because it is the type of military property described in b of the fsia.that section provides that 
notwithstanding the provisions of section of the fsia,the property of a foreign state shall be immune from attachment and from execution,if 
the property is,or is intended to be,used in connection with a military activity and 
a is of a military character,or 
b is under the control of a military authority or defense agency.
b.mod appears to concede that the cubic judgment is not property of a military character under subparagraph a instead stressing that the judgment falls under subparagraph b as property under the control of a military authority or defense agency.our inquiry focuses on whether the cubic judgment is property that is,or is intended to be,used in connection with a military activity.
we agree with the district court conclusion that the cubic judgment is not exempt from attachment under b.see district court order at.the plain language of b requires mod to establish that there is some present or future intended use for the property that is connected to military activity.in addition,the fsia legislative history emphasizes that property will be immune only if its present or future use is military,surplus military equipment withdrawn from military use would not be immune.fsia house report at.mod has made no showing that any proceeds from the cubic judgment are to be used in any way related to iran military activities in fact,mod only statements regarding the future of any monies stemming from the judgment is that they are to revert to iran central bank.see section iii,infra.we therefore hold that elahi is not barred from attaching the cubic judgment by virtue of the military property exemption set out in b 
the cubic judgment as property of a central bank under b of the fsia 
mod argues that if the cubic judgment is not to be treated as military property under b of the fsia,it should then be considered the property of iran central bank under b.the relevant portion of that section provides that 
notwithstanding the provisions of section of the fsia,the property of a foreign state shall be immune from attachment and from execution,if 
the property is that of a foreign central bank or monetary authority held for its own account 
b.during the district court proceedings,mod introduced the declaration of assadollah karimi,an alleged specialist in iranian banking law,who concluded that all sums relating to the ministries and governmental institutions of iran do belong to the bank markazi iran central bank and that they have to be settled to the treasury general account to be expended in due time according to the budget act.karimi declaration.mod claims that,because any proceeds of the cubic judgment would revert to iran central bank,it falls under the scope of b.
we agree with the district court conclusion that the cubic judgment is not exempted from attachment under b of the fsia.the plain language of the statute requires that the property at issue not only belong to a foreign state central bank,but also be held for the central bank own account b emphasis added.the fsia legislative history makes clear that the exemption was meant to apply to 
funds of a foreign central bank or monetary authority which are deposited in the united states and held for the bank or authority own account,funds used or held in connection with central banking activities,as distinguished from funds used solely to finance the commercial transactions of other entities or of foreign states.
fsia house report at.even if the statements in karimi declaration could be stretched to mean that the cubic judgment belonged to iran central bank,mod can not show that the judgment is used or held in connection with central banking activities.indeed,mod position in this case would mean that virtually any funds belonging to any iranian agency would be subject to the central bank exemption.we reject such a broad reading of b and hold that the cubic judgment is not exempted from attachment by that provision.
we conclude that the cubic judgment is not exempted from attachment under either prong of b of the fsia.
d.the impact of the iranian regulations on elahi attachment 
mod argues that the iranian regulations issued pursuant to the ieepa,pts.and,prohibit attachment of the cubic judgment by elahi.elahi points out,correctly,that mod did not raise this issue before the district court.although we could decline to reach the issue for that reason,we exercise our discretion to consider the merits of mod arguments.see abramson brownstein,cir we may consider an argument not raised in the district court if it is an issue of law not dependent on a factual record developed by the parties.
as we explained in section ii,supra,the cubic judgment is property regulated by the united states through the iacr,pt.in particular,provides that n o property subject to the jurisdiction of the united states in which on or after november,iran has any interest of any nature whatsoever may be transferred,paid,exported,withdrawn or otherwise dealt in except as authorized.if this were all that the regulations provided,mod would likely be correct that the regulations would prevent elahi from attaching the cubic judgment.however,the regulations also provide for general licenses which authorize broad classes of that would otherwise be prohibited by.see.one of these general licenses provides that t ransactions involving property in which iran or an iranian entity has an interest are authorized where t he interest in the property of iran or an iranian entity arises after january.a.mod interest in the cubic judgment arose on december,when the district court confirmed the icc award against cubic.mod cubic def.systems,d.therefore,because any transactions involving the cubic judgment are authorized under,elahi is not barred from attaching the judgment by the iacr 
mod collateral attacks on elahi default judgment 
in its reply brief and in supplemental filings,mod has raised new arguments attacking the original default judgment that elahi is seeking to enforce.mod contends that we can consider these arguments because they challenge the ju
