in this appeal we consider,as a matter of first impression,whether the bar on extraterritorial application of the united states securities laws,as set forth in morrison national australia bank,precludes claims arising out of securities purchased on foreign exchanges,but on a domestic exchange the listing theory.we also consider whether the alleged misstatements at issue here are actionable under the securities laws.
we conclude that the supreme court decision in morrison precludes claims brought pursuant to the securities exchange act of exchange act by purchasers of shares of a foreign issuer on a foreign exchange,even if those shares were on a united states exchange claims brought under the securities act of securities act based on disclosures made in connection with a ubs june,registered rights offering were properly dismissed because they are immaterial inactionable puffery,as that term is defined in our case law and exchange act claims arising out of defendants statements regarding positions in,and valuation of,assets were properly dismissed for failure to adequately plead a material misrepresentation or scienter.
accordingly,we affirm the september,and september,judgments of the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard sullivan,judge dismissing all claims with prejudice.
background 
plaintiffs,a group of foreign and domestic institutional investors bring this putative class action against ubs ag ubs and a number of ubs officers and directors together with ubs,ubs defendants alleging violations of b and a of the exchange in connection with the purchase of ubs ordinary shares between august,and february,the class period.these shares were listed on foreign exchanges and the new york stock exchange nyse.plaintiffs allege that the ubs defendants violated the exchange act by making,in conjunction with issuance of the ordinary shares,fraudulent statements regarding ubs assets portfolio the fraud and ubs purported compliance with united states tax and securities laws by ubs global private banking business the tax fraud 
plaintiff alaska laborers employers retirement fund alaska laborers also brings this action on behalf of a class that purchased ordinary shares of ubs in connection with the company june,rights offering the offering,alleging that the ubs defendants and a group of violated,a,and of the securities by making misleading statements regarding the alleged tax fraud in connection with the offering.
a.the fraud 
plaintiffs allege that ubs accumulated and overvalued billion in residential mortgage backed securities rmbs and collateralized debt obligations cdos and,together with rmbs,assets between february,and april,without disclosing this to shareholders and in contravention of its representations regarding its risk management policies.
the acquisition of the billion portfolio began with the launch of dillon read capital management drcm,an internal hedge run by john costas,the ceo of ubs investment bank ib.according to plaintiffs,drcm began acquiring billions of dollars worth of,which added pressure to grow ib fixed income.accordingly,the ib began acquiring the same types of assets on a larger scale.following significant on drcm subprime portfolio,ubs closed drcm and reintegrated its billion portfolio into the ib.
plaintiffs allege that ubs concealed the scope of the ib subprime portfolio disclosing billion rather than billion and,as the subprime market began to collapse in february,concealed the losses in that portfolio by failing to revalue the assets.plaintiffs allege that ubs belatedly announced its first of billion on october,and ultimately wrote down the portfolio by billion.
b.the tax fraud 
plaintiffs also allege that ubs made materially misleading statements regarding an alleged scheme in which ubs swiss bankers traveled in and out of the united states to illegally advise american clients on the purchase of investments specifically,in may,following the indictment of certain ubs employees in connection with the tax scheme,ubs made two disclosures,which revealed that the united states department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec were investigating ubs conduct with regard to the services it provided to american clients between and 
on february,ubs entered into a deferred prosecution with the doj and the internal revenue service irs,which revealed that ubs had violated united states tax laws,and disclosed that ubs had paid a million fine and admitted participation in a conspiracy to defraud the irs.
procedural history 
on september,the district court dismissed the claims of foreign and domestic plaintiffs who purchased the ubs shares on foreign exchanges on september,the district court dismissed all remaining claims against the ubs defendants under the exchange act for failure to adequately plead the elements of fraud,and dismissed alaska laborers claims under the securities act for failure to adequately allege a material misstatement and for lack of statutory standing under a of the securities act 
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court judgment granting a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.in making this determination,we may consider any written instrument attached to the complaint as an exhibit or any statements or documents incorporated in it by reference,as well as public disclosure documents required by law to be,and that have been,filed with the sec,and documents that the plaintiffs either possessed or knew about and upon which they relied in bringing the suit.
viability under morrison national australia bank of claims based on foreign shares purchased on a foreign exchange 
three foreign institutional investors plaintiffs union,ifm,and atp and one domestic investor plaintiff opeb purchased their ubs ordinary shares on a foreign exchange.the district court,relying on the supreme court decision in morrison national australia bank,dismissed these claims.we address the claims of the foreign and domestic plaintiffs separately.
foreign cubed 
morrison answered in the negative the question whether b provides a cause of action to foreign plaintiffs suing foreign defendants for misconduct in connection with securities traded on foreign exchanges.it held instead that b only provided a private cause of action arising out of transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges,and domestic transactions in other securities.
plaintiffs argue that,by its express terms,the morrison bar is limited to claims arising out of securities not listed on a domestic exchange.under plaintiffs listing theory,the fact that the relevant shares were on the nyse brings them within the purview of rule b,under the first prong of morrison transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges.we conclude that,while this language,which appears in morrison and its progeny,taken in isolation,supports plaintiffs view,the listing theory is irreconcilable with morrison read as a whole.
morrison emphasized that the focus of the exchange act is upon purchases and sales of securities in the united states.as the district court recognized,this evinces a concern with the location of the securities transaction and not the location of an exchange where the security may be dually listed.morrison emphasis on transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges,makes clear that the focus of both prongs was domestic transactions of any kind,with the domestic listing acting as a proxy for a domestic transaction.indeed,the supreme court explicitly rejected the notion that the national public interest pertains to transactions conducted upon foreign exchanges and markets.furthermore,in morrison,although the ordinary shares at issue were not traded on any domestic exchange,the court noted that t here are listed on the nyse,however,defendant american depositary receipts adrs,which represent the right to receive a specified number of its ordinary shares.this did not affect the court analysis of the shares that were purchased on foreign exchanges.
perhaps most tellingly,in rejecting this circuit conduct and effects test in favor of a rule,morrison rejected our prior holding that the exchange act applies to transactions regarding stocks traded in the united states which are effected outside the united states 
in sum,morrison does not support the application of b of the exchange act to claims by a foreign purchaser of shares on a foreign exchange simply because those shares are also listed on a domestic exchange.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court insofar as it dismissed the claims of union,ifm,and atp.
foreign squared claims 
plaintiff opeb is a entity that purchased some of its ubs shares on a foreign exchange by placing a buy order in the united states,which was later executed on a swiss exchange.in addition to advocating the listing theory,opeb argues that its purchase satisfies the second prong of morrison because it constitutes a purchase of a security in the united states.
in our decision in absolute activist value master fund ficeto absolute activist we explained that a securities transaction is domestic for purposes of morrison second prong when the parties incur irrevocable liability to carry out the transaction within the united states or when title is passed within the united states.we must now decide as an issue of first impression whether the mere placement of a buy order in the united states for the purchase of foreign securities on a foreign exchange is sufficient to allege that a purchaser incurred irrevocable liability in the united states,such that the securities laws govern the purchase of those securities.we conclude that it is not.
plaintiffs argue that w hen a purchaser is a entity,irrevocable liability is not incurred when the security is purchased on a foreign exchange rather it is incurred in the where the buy order is placed.as an initial matter,we have made clear that a purchaser citizenship or residency does not affect where a transaction occurs.accordingly,the fact that opeb was a entity,does not affect whether the transaction was foreign or domestic nor does the allegation that opeb placed a buy order in the united states that was then executed on a foreign exchange,standing alone,establish that opeb incurred irrevocable liability in the united states 
accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing the claims of opeb,a domestic purchaser,insofar as its claims were based on purchases of foreign shares on foreign exchanges 
securities act claims 
alaska laborers alleges that the offering distributed in connection with the june,offering were materially false inasmuch as they stated that ubs held its employees to the highest ethical standards and complied with all applicable laws,and that ubs wealth management division did not provide services to clients in the united states when,in fact,ubs was engaged in the tax scheme plaintiffs allege further that the offering materials were materially incomplete inasmuch as they disclosed the doj investigation but concealed that the activities under investigation were ongoing,and concealed the magnitude of ubs exposure to liability and reputational damage.
the district court dismissed alaska laborers claims under and a of the securities act for,among other reasons,failure to allege material misrepresentations section establishes liability on the part of issuers of registration statements if 
any part of the registration statement,when such part became effective,contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading 
plaintiffs need not allege scienter,reliance,or causation the standard is the same for claims pursuant to a,which covers prospectuses and oral communications 
in assessing claims,we conduct a preliminary inquiry into whether plaintiffs allegations are premised on fraud,or merely on negligence,to determine the appropriate pleading standard where,as here,the claims sound in fraud indeed,they are identical to plaintiffs tax fraud claims under b the heightened pleading standard of federal rule of civil procedure b applies,requiring that the circumstances of the alleged fraud be set forth in the complaint with particularity 
first,plaintiffs allege that ubs involvement in the tax fraud rendered ubs statements in the offering materials about compliance,reputation,and integrity materially misleading.it is that general statements about reputation,integrity,and compliance with ethical norms are inactionable puffery,meaning that they are too general to cause a reasonable investor to rely upon them.this is particularly true where,as here,the statements are explicitly aspirational,with qualifiers such as aims to,wants to,and should.plaintiffs claim that these statements were knowingly and verifiably false when made does not cure their generality,which is what prevents them from rising to the level of materiality required to form the basis for assessing a potential investment 
second,plaintiffs argue that defendants failure to disclose the tax scheme violated regulation s k,item c,which requires registrants to include in offering materials a discussion of the most significant factors that make the offering speculative or risky,and rendered materially incomplete those disclosures ubs made concerning the doj investigation.
the offering materials disclosed that the doj was investigating whether,from,ubs client advisors entered the united states to help clients evade their tax obligations,in violation of law.plaintiffs argue,in effect,that,in addition to disclosing the existence of an investigation,defendants were required to disclose that ubs was,in fact,engaged in an ongoing tax evasion scheme.
as we have explained,d isclosure is not a rite of confession,and companies do not have a duty to disclose uncharged,unadjudicated wrongdoing.by disclosing its involvement in multiple legal proceedings and government investigations and indicating that its involvement could expose ubs to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs,as well as injunctive relief,criminal and civil penalties,and the potential for regulatory restrictions,ubs complied with its disclosure obligations under our case law.
in sum,plaintiffs have not pleaded any misstatements in the offering that give rise to a cause of action under the securities act.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing the claims of alaska laborers under and a of the securities act.
claims under section b of the exchange act 
the district court dismissed plaintiffs b claims for failure to plead materiality or scienter with respect to the fraud,and failure to plead materiality as to the tax fraud.
a complaint alleging securities fraud under b of the exchange act must satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of rule b and the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra these standards require,in relevant part,that securities fraud complaints specify each misleading statement and state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.
scienter may be established by facts showing that the defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit the fraud or constituting strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.we have defined recklessness as a state of mind approximating actual intent,which can be established by conduct which is highly unreasonable and which represents an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.the requisite strong inference of scienter is one which is at least as likely as any plausible opposing inference.
fraud claims 
plaintiffs plead two categories of misstatements comprising the alleged fraud statements that ubs avoided asset concentrations as a key pillar of its risk management strategy and statements regarding ubs valuation of its assets.we address each in turn 
avoidance of undue concentrations of risk 
plaintiffs allege that the ubs defendants represented that ubs,inter alia avoided concentrated positions of assets implemented asset portfolio limits,and engaged in limited proprietary investing at a time when they knew of and had access to information concerning the billion portfolio and knew that ubs had no portfolio limits.plaintiffs aver that these facts support the inference that defendants knew,or recklessly disregarded,that their representations to investors were materially false and misleading.we disagree.
as a preliminary matter,plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that ubs representations regarding asset concentrations were materially misleading.plaintiffs contend that these statements are material b ecause ubs represented that the avoidance of asset concentrations was vital to its business and success.but while importance is undoubtedly a necessary element of materiality importance and materiality are not synonymous to be material within the meaning of b,the alleged misstatement must be sufficiently specific for an investor to reasonably rely on that statement as a guarantee of some concrete fact or outcome which,when it proves false or does not occur,forms the basis for a b fraud claim 
ubs representations that it prioritized adequate diversification of risk and avoidance of undue concentrations,are too and subjective to constitute a guarantee that ubs would not accumulate a billion rmbs portfolio,comprising of ubs overall portfolio,or of its trading portfolio plaintiffs do not allege that ubs represented that it had specific risk on its acquisition of securities,that the billion portfolio contravened 
moreover,ubs did disclose that it was seeking to expand its fixed income business further by pursuing opportunities in securities,and disclosed,for example,increases in the portfolio of as much as billion swiss francs chf in.as the district court recognized,these specific disclosures by ubs about its accumulation of securities undercut the inference that defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that their accumulation of the rmbs portfolio was inconsistent with their representations about risk management,much less that they intended to conceal or recklessly concealed that accumulation 
in sum,plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that ubs representations regarding asset concentrations and risk diversification were materially misleading or that defendants were consciously reckless in making such representations in light of their accumulation of securities.
valuation of and disclosures regarding ubs assets 
the second category of alleged misrepresentations relates to ubs statements regarding its valuation of its assets.ubs represented that it employed accounting,meaning that it valued its assets based on the price at which similar assets were trading in the market,observable market prices.
the crux of plaintiffs argument is that the sale by ubs of certain assets held by its internal hedge fund,drcm,reflected the need to reduce the stated market value of,or write down,that class of assets,and that this should have raised red flags that the ib similar securities might be at risk.instead,plaintiffs allege,ubs disregarded observable market inputs and red flags demonstrating that its asset portfolio was materially impaired.the district court found deficient plaintiffs allegations that the ubs defendants were reckless in ignoring these purported red flags.we agree.
as we have explained,to qualify as reckless conduct within the meaning of our securities laws,the decision not to write down the ib securities portfolio must have been highly unreasonable,representing an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care.in essence,plaintiffs allege that defendants should have predicted the impairment of the,assets held by the ib,which were collateralized by assets,based on their knowledge of the in certain,higher risk,assets held by drcm 
assuming arguendo that plaintiffs are correct about what defendants should have been doing,this does not create a strong inference that the ubs defendants were reckless in failing to write down the ib assets,in light of what it knew about drcm assets and the subprime market generally.the central premise of these securitized structures was that tranches would withstand the devaluation of tranches indeed,the assets held by the ib continued to trade at par value through mid.see op.at.
plaintiffs have alleged that there was uncertainty and disagreement within ubs and in the market at large,about the valuation and risk exposure of assets.see,joint app x an april ubs internal investigation concluded that valuation uncertainties in the ib were not sufficiently transparent and inherent risks not adequately analyzed.however,the complaint fails to create a strong inference that the ubs defendants recklessly disregarded known facts contradicting their public valuation of their assets,or that their behavior represented an extreme departure from the ordinary standards of care.
while the collapse in the entire subprime market revealed ubs failure to recognize the vulnerability of all its mortgagerelated assets to have been poor judgment,poor business judgment even if attributable to monetary incentives does not establish an inference of recklessness that is cogent and compelling and thus strong in light of other explanations.we do not recognize allegations of fraud by hindsight.
tax fraud claims 
we have held that the definition of materiality under of the securities act is the same as under b of the exchange act accordingly,we affirm dismissal of the b claims based on tax fraud for the reasons stated in discussion part b,ante.
denial of leave to amend 
plaintiffs contend,finally,that the district court erred in dismissing their amended complaint with prejudice because they have not yet amended directly in response to specifically identified pleading defects.we review a district court denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion,unless the denial was based on futility,in which case we review that legal conclusion de novo 
plaintiffs have already had one opportunity to amend their complaint.although that amendment was not in response to a motion to dismiss identifying particular deficiencies in the pleadings,it is unlikely that the deficiencies raised with respect to the amended complaint were unforeseen by plaintiffs when they amended.moreover,plaintiffs have identified no additional facts or legal theories either on appeal or to the district court they might assert if given leave to amend we conclude that,in the circumstances presented,the district court did not err in denying leave to amend.
conclusion 
to summarize,we hold that 
morrison precludes foreign plaintiffs claims under b of the securities exchange act of exchange act arising out of the purchase of securities on a foreign exchange,even where the securities are on a domestic exchange.
the fact that a entity places a buy order in the united states for the purchase of foreign securities on a foreign exchange is insufficient to incur irrevocable liability,as set forth in absolute activist,in the united states.
plaintiffs claims under and a of the securities act of were properly dismissed for failure to plead an actionable misstatement.
plaintiffs claims under b of the exchange act based on the alleged tax fraud were properly dismissed for failure to plead an actionable misstatement.
plaintiffs b claims based on the alleged fraud were properly dismissed for failure to plead materiality or a strong inference of scienter.
the district court did not err in denying plaintiffs leave to amend a second time.
accordingly,we affirm the september,and september,judgments of the district court.
