this interpleader litigation is part of an dispute between the philippine government and creditors of the estate of ferdinand marcos over assets marcos allegedly secreted from the government while he was president of the philippines.this litigation concerns the assets of arelma incorporated,a panamanian company marcos created.the assets were held in an account in new york by merrill lynch,the plaintiff in this action,until the assets were turned over to the district court in september.
the defendant creditors include human rights victims whose claims we upheld in hilao estate of marcos,cir.the republic of the philippines republic is also a defendant in this action as is the presidential commission on good government pcgg,an agent or instrumentality of the republic.
this is an appeal by the republic and the pcgg from the district court ruling on two motions to dismiss them as parties to the suit the republic and the pcgg own motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds and the creditors motion to dismiss the republic and the pcgg on the basis that they are not real parties in interest.the district court granted the creditors motion to dismiss and the republic and the pcgg appeal.we reverse because we hold that the district court should have dealt with immunity first and that the republic and the pcgg are immune from suit.
procedural background 
in,marcos transferred approximately million to arelma,placing the money in an account with merrill lynch in new york.after marcos was deposed in,president corazon aquino created the pcgg,an agency charged with recovering assets of the republic that were wrongfully acquired by marcos while he was in office.in july,the pcgg asked merrill lynch to turn over the arelma assets to the philippine national bank pnb.the pcgg proposed that the pnb act as an escrow agent and hold the assets pending a ruling in the sandiganbayan,a philippine court,on whether the assets belonged to the republic or the marcos estate.
merrill lynch denied the request,apparently because of the existence of other claimants,and instead filed this interpleader action in the district court for the district of hawaii on september,seeking to resolve conflicting claims to the arelma assets.the complaint named as defendants several possible claimants.they included the republic,the pcgg,arelma,the estate of roger roxas,the golden budha corporation,and mariano pimentel.the roxas estate and golden budha assert claims as judgment creditors of the marcos estate on the basis of judgments obtained in state courts.pimentel is a member of the plaintiff class of human rights victims that obtained a judgment against the estate on february.see hilao estate of marcos,cir.the district court granted pimentel motion to join the pnb in may.
the republic and the pcgg moved to dismiss the interpleader arguing,inter alia,that they were entitled to sovereign immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia.pimentel also moved to dismiss the republic and the pcgg claiming that they were not real parties in interest.the republic and the pcgg then asked the court to determine their immunity and dismiss the action because they claimed they were indispensable parties.b.the district court held a telephonic hearing on september.
at that hearing,the district court said that it was granting pimentel motion to dismiss the republic and the pcgg because the court found they were not real parties in interest.the court declined to decide any issue of sovereign immunity.the district court then entered a written order on december,that stated 
defendants pnb,with offices in honolulu,and arelma are the real parties in interest as to claims that may be proffered by the republic and pcgg,and the former are capable of asserting claims to the assets that had been held by merrill lynch in account in the name of arelma the assets and were deposited by merrill lynch with the court,including the claim that the source of the assets was stolen.the republic and pcgg have both sought to be dismissed from the lawsuit on various grounds and have averred under oath that pnb has exclusive authority to control the assets at issue.therefore,defendants pnb and arelma are the real parties in interest as to claims that the republic and pcgg may make in this interpleader proceeding.
the court denied as moot the republic and the pcgg motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity and ruled that neither the republic nor pcgg are necessary or indispensable parties in this litigation.the district court also continued its prior injunction that enjoined defendants named in the interpleader from bringing any further actions in the united states to pursue the arelma assets.the republic and pcgg appeal their dismissal on the merits and the denial of their motion for dismissal based on sovereign immunity.
because denial of a motion to dismiss on grounds of foreign sovereign immunity may result in the parties having to litigate claims over which the court lacks jurisdiction,we permit an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds.see schoenberg exportadora de sal,cir denial of motion to dismiss on grounds of foreign sovereign immunity is an appealable interlocutory order under collateral order doctrine.it is on that basis that we exercise jurisdiction over this appeal.we deny as moot appellants mandamus petition filed as an alternative route to jurisdiction.
immunity under the fsia 
the effect of the district court ruling was to adjudicate the merits of the republic claim to the assets and thus effectively deny its claim to sovereign immunity.the district court determined that the republic and the pcgg had no claim to the arelma assets,thus proceeding to the heart of the dispute,without first determining whether the republic and the pcgg had sovereign immunity.we agree with the republic that the district court should have addressed the merits of the immunity question first in order to preserve the immunity that may be determined to exist.see phaneuf republic of indonesia,cir noting that i mmunity under the fsia is not only immunity from liability,but immunity from suit siderman de blake republic of argentina,cir stating that before reaching the merits of a claim against a foreign state,court should determine whether it has jurisdiction under the fsia.
the fsia provides the sole basis for subject matter jurisdiction over foreign states and their agents or instrumentalities.see.the fsia provides that a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction of courts unless one of the statutory exceptions applies.the creditors do not dispute that the republic and the pcgg are,respectively,a foreign state and its instrumentality within the meaning of the fsia.the creditors,however,have the burden of establishing that one of the statutory exceptions applies.see siderman,at.the only two exceptions claimed to be applicable here are the successor exception,a,and the implied waiver exception,a 
the successor exception provides that a foreign state is not immune if rights in property in the united states acquired by succession or gift or rights in immovable property situated in the united states are in issue.a.the creditors argue that because some of them are judgment creditors of marcos family members that inherited the marcos estate,succession rights are in issue in the interpleader action within the meaning of the statute.the creditors do not contend that the republic has acquired any right by succession.they argue that the statute requires only that some rights acquired by succession be in issue in the case,not necessarily the rights of the foreign sovereign.the creditors interpretation of the statute is not supported by the statute,the legislative history,or principles of international law.for the reasons we now explain,we conclude the exception applies only when the sovereign claim is as a successor to a private party.
the fsia exceptions focus on actions taken by or against a foreign sovereign.for example,a provides that a foreign state is not entitled to immunity if the state either explicitly or implicitly waives immunity.another exception provides that a foreign state
