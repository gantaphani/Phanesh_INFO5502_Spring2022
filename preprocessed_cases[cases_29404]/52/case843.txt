krishna maharaj appeals from the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to claiming that the state prosecutor office improperly withheld brady material,that he received ineffective assistance of counsel,and that he was denied his rights under the vienna convention on consular relations.the florida supreme court denied maharaj application for relief in all respects.
after thorough review,we affirm.the florida supreme court disposition of maharaj claims was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law nor was its decision based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.
the basic facts and procedural history are straightforward.a jury in county,florida found maharaj guilty of two counts of first degree murder,two counts of kidnaping,and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm while engaged in a criminal offense,for the shooting deaths of duane and derrick moo young.maharaj was sentenced to die for one of the murder counts,to life imprisonment without the possibility for parole for years for the second murder count,to two life sentences for the kidnaping counts,and to fifteen years imprisonment for the firearm count.his convictions and sentences were upheld by the florida supreme court on direct appeal.maharaj state,so d maharaj i.his subsequent request for relief was denied by the state trial court,which was,in turn,reversed by the florida supreme court for failing to hold an evidentiary hearing and for failing to recuse in light of an ethical conflict.maharaj state,so d maharaj ii.on remand,the trial court denied maharaj application for relief as to his conviction,but granted his request to vacate the death sentence.maharaj state,so d maharaj iii.a new penalty trial was ordered,after which maharaj was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder count for which he had previously been sentenced to die.
the facts giving rise to maharaj convictions,taken from the three opinions of the florida supreme court and from the testimony presented at his trial,are these.krishna maharaj is a british national,born in trinidad,who was living in south florida in october of.he owned and operated a newspaper,the caribbean times,that catered to the west indian community.in the spring of,maharaj approached eslee carberry,the owner of another south florida community newspaper,the caribbean echo,and told carberry that derrick moo young had stolen money from him.he gave carberry documents that purported to corroborate his accusations about derrick moo young,and paid the caribbean echo a sponsorship fee to publish an article detailing the alleged theft.
after the article appeared in the caribbean echo,derrick moo young contacted carberry to provide his side of the story.carberry testified that he met with derrick moo young twice,and that moo young provided documents detailing a lawsuit he had filed against maharaj.subsequently,the caribbean echo published a series of articles describing maharaj alleged involvement in an illegal scam to take millions of dollars out of trinidad.
the state most important trial witness was neville butler,a reporter for the caribbean echo.butler testified that in the course of writing for the caribbean echo,he had occasion to meet derrick moo young and had assisted in writing some of the articles critical of maharaj.at some point in september of,butler contacted the caribbean times after hearing from a friend that maharaj might be interested in having butler write for his paper too.he met with both maharaj and maharaj wife,and although he was never officially hired,he wrote several articles for the caribbean times under various pen names.
butler testified that shortly after he became associated with maharaj and his periodical,maharaj told him that carberry and moo young were trying to extort money from maharaj relatives in trinidad in exchange for suppressing still other stories critical of maharaj and his family.maharaj also told him that carberry and moo young suggested to people in trinidad that butler was really behind the extortionate attempts.butler said that maharaj asked him to set up a meeting with derrick moo young,so that maharaj could extract a confession from moo young that he was actually behind the extortion and bribery require moo young to write two checks to repay him for the fraud and cause butler to go to a bank with the checks and certify them,at which time maharaj would permit moo young to leave.
maharaj made it clear to butler that moo young would not knowingly agree to a meeting with maharaj.accordingly,in order to trick moo young into meeting with maharaj,a plan was devised whereby butler would tell moo young,who was engaged in importing and exporting goods,that two individuals from the bahamas eddie dames and prince ellis would be in miami and that they were interested in purchasing goods for their catering business.butler arranged for the meeting to be held on october,in dames room at the dupont plaza hotel in miami.he never informed moo young that maharaj would be at the meeting.
maharaj and butler met at the dupont on the morning of october.butler gave dames the keys to his rental car and instructed dames that he would meet dames in the lobby at around noon or would allow sufficient time to use dames room for the meeting with moo young.when derrick moo young arrived at the dupont plaza hotel for the meeting,butler was surprised to see that moo young had unexpectedly brought along his son,duane moo young.
as the moo youngs entered dupont plaza hotel room,maharaj emerged from behind the door carrying a pillow in his left hand and a gun in his gloved right hand.soon thereafter,an argument ensued,and maharaj shot derrick moo young in the leg.maharaj then instructed butler to tie up duane and derrick moo young.before he could do so,derrick moo young lunged at maharaj,who again shot derrick moo young,hitting him three or four more times.maharaj then turned his attention to duane moo young,who butler had loosely tied to a chair with the cord from an immersion heater.while maharaj was talking to duane moo young,derrick moo young managed to open the door to the hallway and attempted to crawl outside.once he noticed the escape attempt,maharaj shot derrick moo young still again and dragged him back inside the room by his ankles.
butler testified that maharaj then went back to interrogating duane moo young,attempting to verify what the moo youngs had done with the money allegedly extorted from maharaj relatives in trinidad.soon thereafter,a person identifying himself as a hotel security guard shouted from outside the room that he noticed blood in the hall and inquired whether everyone was all right.according to butler,maharaj moved towards the door and responded that everything was all right.after several minutes of silence,maharaj opened the door,poked his head out into the hall and appeared to tell someone that everything was all right.after maharaj the room,duane moo young unsuccessfully lunged at maharaj in an attempt to gain control of the gun.maharaj continued to interrogate duane moo young,this time on the top floor of the hotel suite.
butler,who remained on the lower floor,testified that he then heard a single shot from above,after which maharaj came downstairs alone,and they both left the room.maharaj and butler took the elevator to the ground floor and retrieved maharaj car from the parking lot.they drove around the block.butler voiced his opinion that they needed to wait at the hotel for dames to return.maharaj agreed,and they parked in front of the hotel for approximately three hours until dames returned.
while parked in front of the hotel,maharaj told butler that he was just as guilty for what happened in the room as maharaj was,because butler had arranged the meeting and been present during the killings.maharaj promised butler that he would take care of him,stating that he would give butler a job with the caribbean times,provide a down payment for butler house,and give him a car.
when dames finally arrived at the dupont,butler exited the car,retrieved his car keys from dames,and left the scene.later that day,maharaj contacted butler and told him he wanted to meet at a denny restaurant near the miami airport so they could coordinate their stories.butler subsequently met up with dames and ellis,who had given statements to police investigators.dames and ellis convinced butler to contact the police.butler then called the lead investigator on the case,miami police detective john buhrmaster,and explained what had happened in the hotel room.butler brought buhrmaster to the denny,where maharaj was arrested.
the state presented other witnesses at trial who testified as to motive and prior acts by maharaj that were consistent with the murders at the dupont plaza hotel.for example,tino geddes,a journalist at the caribbean echo,testified that maharaj had purchased camouflage clothing and exotic weapons and had twice attempted to ambush eslee carberry.furthermore,geddes said that on one occasion,maharaj met him at the dupont plaza hotel,with a handgun,and asked geddes to call derrick moo young and eslee carberry and lure them to the hotel.although geddes called both,neither came.
the state also presented corroborating testimonial and physical evidence.loretta molaskey,a maid at the dupont plaza hotel,testified that she thoroughly cleaned the room where the murders occurred suite on the morning of october,and that it appeared as if nobody had slept in the room the night before.she said that at around,her boss summoned her to room where he saw blood on the hallway carpet outside the door.while there,she noticed that the room was from the inside,preventing her from opening it with the master key,and that there was no do not disturb sign on the exterior of the door.some five to ten minutes later,molaskey was contacted by hotel security and again asked to return to room.she did,discovering that the door was no longer and there was a do not disturb sign hanging on the exterior doorknob.at the request of the security guard,she opened the door with the master key and discovered the bodies of derrick and duane moo young.
other hotel employees testified similarly.miguel sueiras,molaskey boss,testified that when he summoned molaskey to open the door to room,there was blood on the outside carpet,the door was,and there was no do not disturb sign hanging on the doorknob.jorge aparicio,a security guard at the dupont,testified that he too noticed blood outside room,and when he asked whether everyone inside was all right,someone inside answered that everything was fine.he also noticed that there was no do not disturb sign on the door at that time.
the state also presented a fingerprint expert who testified that maharaj fingerprints were found in approximately twelve places in room,including on the do not disturb sign that was found on the exterior doorknob when the room was opened,on the exterior portion of the entrance door,on the interior bathroom door and doorframe,on the top of the bureau,on a soda can found on the bureau,on the telephone and television,on the bottom of a glass tabletop,on a piece of paper left in an ashtray,on two newspapers,and on the torn plastic packages for the immersion cords.
a firearms expert testified that,based on multiple projectiles and fragments recovered from the hotel room and derrick moo young body,eight bullets were fired from a smith wesson model,semiautomatic pistol with a serial number less than.richard bellrose,a city of miramar police officer,testified that he sold a smith wesson model pistol,serial number,to his supervising lieutenant in,who in turn sold the gun to krishna maharaj.gregory jansen,a city of plantation police officer,testified that krishna maharaj was stopped for a traffic infraction on july,some three months before the murders,and that he found a smith wesson model,handgun,bearing serial number,in the trunk of maharaj car.finally,sylvia ramos,a crime scene technician with the city of miami police department,testified that derrick moo young had black gunpowder on the shoulder area of his shirt,a finding consistent with having been shot at very close range.
as noted,the jury found petitioner guilty on all counts.after his convictions were affirmed and he was denied state relief on the guilt phase of his case,maharaj petitioned for federal habeas relief.the application was referred to a federal magistrate judge,who recommended denying relief on all counts.petitioner objected to the report and recommendation,and the district judge conducted a de novo review of the entire petition.in a lengthy and comprehensive order,the district judge denied relief as to each of petitioner claims.petitioner filed a timely appeal and the case is now properly before us.
maharaj commenced his federal habeas petition after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,pub,stat,and,therefore,the provisions of that act govern this appeal.wade battle,cir.under aedpa,petitioner was required to obtain a certificate of appealability coa before he could appeal the district court decision.see c a.a coa must be specific in detailing the issues appropriate for appeal,and appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the coa.murray united states,cir.
in the initial order denying habeas relief,the district court listed five issues as being worthy of appeal whether the state prejudicially suppressed discoverable brady material by not disclosing the report of neville butler polygraph examination whether the state prejudicially suppressed discoverable brady material by not allowing access to or disclosing the contents of the victims briefcase whether the state prejudicially suppressed discoverable brady material by not disclosing any knowledge of or information in its control regarding the victims life insurance policies whether petitioner trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for not investigating allegations of pending charges and outstanding warrants against petitioner in england before advising his client not to testify during the guilt phase of his trial and whether,in light of recent opinions of the international court of justice,a federal court has jurisdiction to determine,on the merits,whether the state violated petitioner right to consular notification despite the florida supreme court finding that maharaj had procedurally defaulted this claim by failing to raise it on direct appeal.the district court subsequently entered an amended coa,adding a sixth issue whether maharaj was prejudiced by the alleged brady violations,when considered individually or in concert.
maharaj moved for a coa,which we viewed as a request to expand the scope of the district court coa.we denied that request.he now claims that he should be permitted to present every argument contained in his original federal habeas petition we deny this request and limit our review to the six issues outlined in the district court coa.see murray,at.
after his appeal was filed in this court,indeed after briefing was complete and an oral argument date had been scheduled,petitioner asked us to stay consideration of the case pending resolution of a motion he filed in state court on september.the state court motion seeks relief on the ground that maharaj rights under the vienna convention were violated when the arresting officers failed to inform him that he could contact the british consulate.although the claim was previously presented in the state proceedings,it was never considered on the merits because maharaj failed to raise it on direct appeal.see maharaj iii,so d at holding that because maharaj did not raise the vienna convention claim on direct appeal,florida law procedurally barred him from doing so in proceedings.
rarely are we asked to stay appellate proceedings in deference to concurrent state litigation.however,in providing guidance to the district courts,where this situation arises more frequently,we have looked to the supreme court decision in colorado river water conservation dist.united states,d.see moorer demopolis waterworks sewer,cir noting that t he colorado river doctrine of exceptional circumstances authorizes a federal district court to dismiss or stay an action when there is ongoing parallel action in state court internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also currie group ins.comm n,cir analyzing the colorado river factors in deciding whether it should stay a case currently on appeal in deference to concurrent state litigation.in colorado river,the supreme court cautioned that federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation to exercise the jurisdiction given them and that a federal case should be dismissed in deference to a state proceeding in only the most exceptional of circumstances.at.at.
we have applied the following factors in considering whether to stay or dismiss a case because of concurrent state litigation 
the order in which the courts assumed jurisdiction over property the relative inconvenience of the fora the order in which jurisdiction was obtained and the relative progress of the two actions the desire to avoid piecemeal litigation whether federal law provides the rule of decision and whether the state court will adequately protect the rights of all parties.

maharaj relies on three points in explaining why a stay would be appropriate here the opinion in case concerning avena and other mexican nationals mexico united states,a memorandum from president bush to the attorney general on february,and the supreme court recent order in medellin dretke,d.petitioner suggests that he was never informed of his right to contact the british consulate after his arrest,in violation of the vienna convention,and that the state courts should have considered the merits of his claim,irrespective of the procedural bar.that is the argument he makes in his newly filed motion and the same one he now contends should cause us to stay these proceedings.application of the standards generally used in determining the wisdom of a stay yields the conclusion that we should go forward with maharaj appeal now.
to begin with,both the united states and the united kingdom are parties to the vienna convention on consular relations.article of the vienna convention provides that upon arrest,a foreign national has the right to contact the consular post of his home country,and that the arresting authorities must inform the detainee of that right.vienna convention on consular relations,b,once a detainee is informed of his right to contact the local consulate office,the arresting authorities must forward any desired communications to that foreign office.id.
the optional protocol to the vienna convention further provides that d isputes arising out of the interpretation or application of the convention shall lie within the compulsory jurisdiction of the international court of justice.optional protocol concerning the compulsory settlement of disputes,art.i,april,the optional protocol.in march of,the issued an opinion in a case brought by mexico against the united states on behalf of mexican nationals arrested in this country who alleged that their rights of notification and contact had been denied them by various domestic law enforcement authorities.see case concerning avena and other mexican nationals mexico united states.in avena,the held that an arresting authority must notify a foreign national of his rights regarding contact with the local consulate once the detaining officials realize the person is a foreign national,or once there are grounds to believe the person is probably a foreign national.avena,at.the found that those rights had been violated as to some of the named avena plaintiffs,and the court ordered the united states to permit review and reconsideration of the relevant cases by united states courts,with a view to ascertaining whether in each case the violation of article committed by the competent authorities caused actual prejudice to the defendant.id.at.the also determined that the application of state procedural default rules prevented full effect from being given to those rights accorded under article,and,therefore,that the application of procedural default rules violates article.id.at.
following the decision in avena,president bush issued a memorandum to the attorney general in which he ordered that the united states discharge its international obligations under the avena decision by having state courts give effect to the decision in accordance with general principles of comity in cases filed by the mexican nationals addressed in that decision.medellin.at citing the february,memorandum from president george bush to the attorney general emphasis added.shortly thereafter,however,the secretary of state transmitted a letter to the secretary general of the united nations withdrawing the united states from the optional protocol,see medellin.at,dissenting,thereby removing the united states from the provision of the vienna convention that provides jurisdiction to the 
thereafter,in the medellin case,the supreme court granted certiorari to consider whether a federal court is bound by the holding of the in avena,and whether a federal court should give effect,as a matter of judicial comity and uniform treaty interpretation,to the judgment.medellin.at.medellin,the petitioner in that case,was one of the named avena plaintiffs.the court noted that medellin had filed a successive state application for a writ of habeas corpus while his case was pending before the supreme court,and that this application may provide medellin with the review and reconsideration of his vienna convention claim that the icj required,and that medellin now seeks in the federal proceeding.id.at.additionally,the court observed that there were five basic procedural issues it would have to address before it could reach the merits,including whether a violation of the vienna convention was one of those nonconstitutional lapses cognizable in a federal proceeding whether the state court judgment could be considered contrary to,or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law whether or how the decision announced in avena bears on the normal requirement that a habeas petitioner can not enforce a new rule of law pursuant to teague lane,d whether a violation of the vienna convention could be considered a denial of a constitutional right for the purposes of a coa and whether the claims based on avena and the president memorandum were exhausted in state court.medellin.at internal quotation marks omitted.because of the possibility that the state of texas might provide medellin with the relief he was seeking,the court thought it unwise to reach and resolve the multiple hindrances to dispositive answers lurking in medellin case.id.at.accordingly,it dismissed certiorari as having been improvidently granted.id.
with this background we apply the colorado river factors to this case.neither of the first two considerations is particularly helpful here,because there is no real property at issue,and neither forum appears substantially more or less convenient than the other.the third factor,which looks to the order in which jurisdiction was obtained and the relative progress of the two actions,weighs in favor of denying the stay.maharaj waited until september,to file his motion in state court,well after briefing had been completed in this case and,indeed,less than six weeks before oral argument was scheduled in the appellate court.we can discern no apparent reason for the delay.avena was decided in early,the president memorandum issued in february of this year,and the supreme court dismissed certiorari in medellin on may.although under the facts of this dispute the relative timing of the two cases is a lesser consideration,this factor weighs in favor of denying the stay request.
the fourth factor,the desire to avoid piecemeal litigation,weighs far more heavily in favor of denying the request for a stay.quite simply,we are not convinced that there is even a reasonable probability that the state court action will be resolved in such a way as to moot any of the issues currently before us.see jefferson county acker,cir noting that the court had denied a stay of appellate proceedings because there did not appear to be a reasonable probability that any of the federal issues would be rendered moot by the state proceedings am.mfrs.mut.ins.edward stone,cir reversing the district court decision to enter a stay pending the resolution of state court litigation because the state action probably will not resolve the issues pending in the federal litigation see also currie,at.the only way the proceedings before us could be resolved or rendered moot would be if the state court found that maharaj is entitled to relief on the merits of his vienna convention claim and vacated his prior completely obviating the need for us to consider his current appeal.there is no reasonable probability that will happen.
first,florida state courts are bound just as we are by the supreme court decision in breard greene,d.in breard,the court unambiguously held that a habeas petitioner vienna convention claim was procedurally barred in federal court because it was not raised in the state court proceedings.id.at.at.the court noted the principle of international law that absent a clear and express statement to the contrary,the procedural rules of the forum state govern the implementation of a treaty in that state.id.the supreme court has not retreated from its position in breard,and none of the recent developments cited to us call the holding of breard into substantial question,let alone overrule breard.thus,there is no reasonable probability that florida state courts could find themselves free of the constraints of breard,regardless of the holding in avena.
second,even if florida courts somehow found a way to consider the vienna convention claim in spite of the procedural default,it seems to us that claim would likely fail on the merits anyway.the florida supreme court has already definitively held that an individual does not have standing to raise a claim under the vienna convention,which constitutes an agreement between countries,not citizens.gordon state,so d,maharaj iii,so d at.
although our case law is not binding upon a florida state court,our precedent similarly supports the idea that the vienna convention does not confer judicially enforceable individual rights.in united states,cir,we found that a criminal defendant could not seek to have an indictment dismissed based on an alleged violation of article of the vienna convention.id.at.as support,we cited to the preamble of the convention itself,which disclaims any intent to create individual rights,stating that its purpose is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of functions by consular posts.id.at quoting the preamble to the vienna convention.we also noted several sources,including the state department view that the only remedies for a violation of the vienna convention are diplomatic,political,or derived from international law,and the fact that no party to the vienna convention had ever dismissed an indictment based on a violation of article.id.at.although our holding in was limited to the remedy sought in that case,which was dismissal of the indictment,the sources we used to support that holding seemingly prohibit any individual remedy.the preamble is clear the convention is not intended to benefit individuals.the state department interpretation of the treaty,which is entitled to our respect,see el al israel airlines,tsui yuan tseng,d,is also unambiguous the only remedies for a violation of the vienna convention are diplomatic,political,or derived from international law.
because of the supreme court clear holding in breard that violations of the vienna convention are subject to procedural default rules and the decisions of the florida supreme court that article does not confer judicially enforceable individual rights,we remain unpersuaded that there is a reasonable probability maharaj will prevail in the parallel state litigation.we are keenly aware of the comity due state court proceedings and the resources wasted when two courts unnecessarily proceed along the same track and at the same time.those powerful considerations,however,are not apparent in this habeas petition,and the chances of conflicting results or wasted resources are improbably small.the fourth factor weighs heavily in favor of denying petitioner request for a stay.
we are also aware that the supreme court has recently granted certiorari in two cases that raise issues under the vienna convention.see oregon,d bustillo johnson,d.that the court has granted certiorari in cases that may provide the vehicle by which it could overrule breard does not change our conclusion.for even if breard were overruled,maharaj would still be a long way from the relief he seeks.before our case could be rendered moot,the florida courts would first have to determine that the supreme court potential ruling applied to cases on collateral review,then that the vienna convention provides an individual with a remedy the treaty mentions none,and finally that the specific remedy necessary to nullify our case a new trial is available and appropriate under these facts.there is no reasonable probability maharaj will successfully navigate around each of these substantial hurdles.
the fifth federal law provides the rule of not weigh heavily in either direction,since the questions presented involve both state and federal law.finally,the sixth factor,which asks whether the state court will adequately protect the rights of all parties,is similarly unavailing under the facts of this case.
accordingly,we decline the invitation to stay our hand in favor of the recently filed state proceeding.this case was originally tried some seventeen years ago in,making the time for finality long overdue.we proceed to the merits of this habeas petition.
when examining a district court denial of a habeas petition,we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact de novo,and findings of fact for clear error.lecroy sec y.dep t of,cir.however,in reviewing the decisions of the florida supreme court,we are governed by the terms of aedpa,which provides,among others,that we may grant a writ of habeas corpus only if the state decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or the state decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.the district court concluded that maharaj failed to meet this exacting standard.we agree.
the phrase clearly established federal law,as used in d,encompasses only the holdings of the supreme court of the united states.williams taylor,d holding that the language of d expressly restricts the source of clearly established law to the supreme court jurisprudence.as we have previously explained,
d provides a measuring stick for federal habeas courts reviewing state court decisions.that measuring stick is clearly established federal law.d.clearly established federal law is not the case law of the lower federal courts,including this court.instead,in the habeas context,clearly established federal law refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant state court decision.williams,at.at.
putman head,cir footnote omitted.
moreover,section d provides two separate bases for reviewing state court decisions the contrary to and unreasonable application clauses articulate independent considerations a federal court must consider.see williams,at.at henderson campbell,cir,cert.denied,d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if either the state court applied a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by supreme court case law,or when faced with materially indistinguishable facts,the state court arrived at a result different from that reached in a supreme court case.putman,at.an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law may occur if the state court identifies the correct legal rule from supreme court case law but unreasonably applies this rule to the facts of the petitioner case.id.an unreasonable application may also occur if a state court unreasonably extends,or unreasonably declines to extend,a legal principle from supreme court case law to a new context.id.
section d provides an additional basis upon which a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner when the state court decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.a state court determination of the facts,however,is entitled to substantial deference.e noting that a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct and that an applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.with these principles in mind,we review the merits of petitioner brady claims,his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,and his vienna convention claim.
first,maharaj suggests that state prosecutors violated brady by failing to disclose the results of neville butler polygraph examination the contents of the moo youngs briefcase and the moo youngs life insurance policies.
in brady maryland,d,the supreme court enunciated the now principle that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process when the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.the duty to disclose exculpatory evidence is applicable even in the absence of a request by the defendant,and it encompasses impeachment material as well as exculpatory evidence.see strickler greene,d.moreover,evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.kyles whitley,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the supreme court has condensed these basic principles into three components,each of which is necessary to establish a brady violation the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.strickler,at.at.
a constant theme found throughout maharaj appeal is that the district court erred in so far as it considered the various brady violations individually,and not acting in concert.in kyles,the supreme court made clear that a brady materiality determination must consider the aggregate effect of all the suppressed evidence.kyles,at.at.that does not mean,however,that an individual assessment of each piece of suppressed evidence is somehow inappropriate.indeed,the only way to evaluate the cumulative effect is to first examine each piece standing alone.see id.at.at noting that w e evaluate the tendency and force of the undisclosed evidence item by item there is no other way.we evaluate its cumulative effect for purposes of materiality separately and at the end of the discussion.we have followed this approach in our own cases.see,kelley sec y for the dep t of,cir,cert.denied,d zeigler crosby,cir.in this case the district court followed the appropriate methodology,considering each brady item individually,and only then making a determination about the cumulative impact.we do the same.
neville butler polygraph 
the first brady claim relates to a polygraph exam taken by the government principle witness,neville butler.maharaj contends that the state did not disclose the polygraph examiner written report that details his conclusions regarding butler truthfulness.the record reveals that after butler was initially deposed,the state asked him to sit for a polygraph examination.the polygrapher asked butler questions about the events leading up to the murders,what actually happened in the hotel room,and what occurred after butler and maharaj left the hotel room.all told,butler was asked eleven questions 
in his written report,the examiner concluded that butler was truthful in answering eight of the eleven questions.as for questions four and six,concerning whether butler knew derrick moo young was going to be shot before the incident occurred and whether butler told the complete truth about the shooting incident,the examiner opined that the results were ambiguous and inconclusive.finally,as to question maharaj remained in a car for two and a half hours following the examiner concluded that butler response was indicative of deception.in the opinion of the examiner,however,butler truthfully answered each question that related to the actual events that occurred in the hotel room during the confrontation between maharaj and the moo youngs and to the actual shootings.
the state did not produce the examiner opinion to maharaj.it did,however,send a letter to the defendant before trial that stated 
as you are aware,the state eyewitness to this homicide,neville butler,has been polygraphed with reference to his knowledge of what transpired in the dupont plaza hotel,room number,on october.as i indicated to you previously,he passed with regard to the questions asked of him as to your client being the shooter in this matter as well as he not being armed or participating in the shootings of the moo youngs.however,questioning of butler,prior to his polygraph examination and subsequent thereto,has resulted in my obligation under florida rules of criminal procedure,to inform you that butler had some material corrections and additions to make to the deposition testimony he has previously rendered to you.therefore,please consider this letter as compliance with my obligation for continuing discovery and an invitation to you to redepose butler at your convenience regarding events which occurred prior to the homicide as well as.
counsel for maharaj did redepose butler,at which time butler admitted that he lied to police when he gave an initial statement and lied in his first deposition.essentially,butler conceded that he lied to police about his role in setting up the murders and about events that happened after the murders in an attempt to lessen his own involvement.butler did not want to admit to police that he arranged for the meeting between maharaj and the moo youngs at the dupont plaza hotel,so he originally led the police to believe that maharaj unexpectedly arrived at the hotel room.in fact,counsel for maharaj butler extensively at trial on this point,and got him to admit on numerous occasions that he had repeatedly lied under oath in the course of this case.however,butler testimony describing the actual events that occurred in the hotel portion of the story beginning when maharaj walked into the room and ending when maharaj and butler exited to the consistent from his very first statement to the police through his testimony at trial.
petitioner contends,nevertheless,that he should have been given the examiner opinion.he asserted this claim on direct appeal and throughout the proceedings.maharaj does not argue that he was prevented at trial from introducing the examiner opinion indeed,florida law prohibits the introduction of polygraph results absent the consent of both parties,see walsh state,so d,and the trial judge in this case specifically prohibited the witness from making any mention of the polygraph in the course of his testimony.instead,maharaj suggests that if he had known about the results of the test,he could have impeached butler concerning why he decided to come clean and testify truthfully.butler says he did so because his conscience compelled him to tell the truth petitioner urges that it was because he was afraid of taking a polygraph test or because he knew he had failed the polygraph test.
on collateral review of the murder conviction,the florida supreme court correctly recited the three components of a brady violation as set forth by the supreme court in strickler.maharaj iii,so d at.it then found that there was no brady violation because the defense had knowledge of the polygraph results and because butler had not actually failed the test.
as for the finding that the defense had knowledge of the polygraph results,the district court noted that there was substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the defense was not aware of the fact that butler answer to one of the questions was indicative of deception.but,the district court observed that even if it were to disagree with the florida supreme court conclusion,the state high court finding was not an unreasonable one.
we agree.initially,we note that the florida supreme court did not apply a rule that contradicts governing supreme court case law.moreover,we can find no supreme court case whose facts could be considered materially indistinguishable.thus,the florida supreme court decision was not contrary to clearly established federal law.furthermore,the florida supreme court decision was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.although there is no evidence to indicate that the state actually provided petitioner with a copy of the examiner opinion,it did inform petitioner that the test occurred,that butler truthfully answered the questions concerning the events in the hotel room,including the circumstances surrounding the shooting,that butler had material corrections and additions to make to his previous deposition testimony,and that defense counsel might want to redepose butler regarding events that occurred before and after the homicide.defense counsel was free to ask butler why he changed his story and to vigorously him concerning the inconsistencies.the florida supreme court analysis under brady was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
maharaj suggests,however,that he did not want the polygraph results so that he could publish the results to the jury.rather,he claims the results support his theory that butler changed his story when he was summoned to face a lie detector test,and that he only changed his story when caught lying by the polygrapher.when viewed in this light,petitioner claim must also be analyzed as a potential giglio error,a type of brady violation that occurs when the undisclosed evidence demonstrates that the prosecution case includes perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew,or should have known,of the perjury.united states agurs,d.
in order to prevail on a giglio claim,a petitioner must establish that the prosecutor knowingly used perjured testimony,or failed to correct what he subsequently learned was false testimony,and that the falsehood was material.tompkins moore,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted emphasis added.the florida supreme court correctly noted this standard,maharaj iii,so d at,and went on to reject petitioner claim because the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the statement was false or that the statement was material.id.at.
in explaining why butler testimony was not false,the florida supreme court said 
while the statement concerning an act of conscience may not be entirely true,there has been no showing that it was entirely false.the prosecutors testified at the evidentiary hearing that butler voluntarily appeared at their office after being told that the state wanted to question him about some of his testimony.he was not given immunity and changes were made to the testimony prior to the polygraph.neither prosecutor indicated that butler changed any testimony as a result of the polygraph examination.the state opined butler may have considered his change of testimony voluntary because he voluntarily appeared for further questioning.based on this record,the state did not suborn perjury.
again,we can find no supreme court case with materially indistinguishable facts.see ventura attorney,cir noting that a giglio analysis is a highly inquiry.moreover,the florida supreme court did not apply a rule that contradicts supreme court case law.the state court decision was not contrary to clearly established federal law on this point either.as for the application of that law,we have little difficulty concluding that it was reasonable for the florida supreme court to find that maharaj failed to establish that butler trial testimony was false.at trial,butler testified in these terms 
q how is it that you decided to tell the truth about your own involvement in early march of 
a my consideration was the main factor is that i felt i was holding back when i should be and i remember that i called to come down to speak with your office and before i was able to start telling you,you started telling me that i had to ask for an appointment and then i came to tell you and as it happened,you started to question me and tell me that i had lied and i just told you the whole story,it was my consideration and you all persisted with your inquiry.
q on but it does bother you to lie after having been sworn under oath to tell the truth,that correct,right 
a i explained earlier last week the circumstances under which i felt i was protecting myself and the reasons for the things i said and i voluntarily agreed to correct the wrongs i i had made when i approached the district attorney,state attorney and told him about it.
there is nothing to indicate the reasons offered for butler decision to come clean were other than what he said at trial.petitioner belief that the decision to tell the truth was based on a fear of the lie detector test or perhaps fear of the results of that test is speculative.in the giglio context,the suggestion that a statement may have been false is simply insufficient the defendant must conclusively show that the statement was actually false.see moon head,cir brown head,cir.the florida supreme court determination that butler stated reason for changing his testimony was not false was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
moreover,the florida supreme court determined that the statement was not material,finding that the failure to clarify butler reason for the change of testimony would not have affected the jury verdict.see maharaj iii,so d at.the district court agreed,finding that 
i n this instance,there is no reasonable likelihood that the revelation that butler change in testimony may not have been based entirely on his own initiative would have affected the judgment of the jury.the important aspect of the change in story was that butler had shown that he was willing to lie under oath,that he had lied because of concern regarding how his involvement would be regarded by the prosecutors,and that he had told inconsistent stories at various times.that is,it was primarily butler change in testimony,rather than the impetus for the change,that would have been important to the jury,and this was all effectively brought out in and closing arguments.moreover,if he did in fact change his story only because of the polygraph examination,that jury never would have learned this,since the judge had specifically warned butler against mentioning the polygraph exam during his testimony.
we agree with the florida supreme court and the district court that,even if maharaj had established that butler testimony was false which he did not,the falsehood was not material.butler was thoroughly and vigorously about the inconsistencies in his accounts,and maharaj counsel elicited testimony from butler that he had lied under oath.moreover,maharaj trial counsel was not prevented from asking butler why he changed his story indeed,he asked him that very question in the second deposition.there is no reasonable likelihood that the revelation that butler change in testimony may not have been based entirely on his own initiative could have affected the judgment of the jury.see ventura,at noting that a statement is material under giglio if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.the florida supreme court resolution of maharaj claims concerning the polygraph report,under both brady and giglio,was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
b.the moo youngs briefcase 
maharaj next claims that the state prosecutors violated brady when they failed to turn over the contents of a briefcase,containing passports and various documents,that the moo youngs brought with them to the dupont plaza hotel.the briefcase was taken by the police as evidence and subsequently returned to the victims family.an investigator working for petitioner trial counsel subsequently asked the police to produce the briefcase and its contents.the police responded that they no longer had the briefcase and informed the investigator that it had been returned to the moo young family.petitioner contends that the items contained in the moo youngs briefcase should have been turned over as brady material.
the state trial court described the contents of the briefcase as passports for both duane and derrick moo young,showing travel to panama,jamaica,and other countries,international letters of credit,appointments,insurance policies on the victims,and other documents that might suggest the victims may have been involved in transactions involving very large sums of money,and,potentially fraudulent activities.petitioner contends that these passports and documents would have led to other evidence,which in turn may have shown that the moo youngs were killed by a colombian cartel for trying to siphon millions of dollars while laundering drug money around the caribbean.
the state trial court rejected this claim,finding that there was no brady violation for two independent reasons first,the briefcase and its documents were not suppressed by the state because petitioner knew of their existence and had the power to compel their return from the moo young family by subpoena,and,second,the information was not material.the florida supreme court affirmed on those same grounds.we agree.
again,the florida supreme court correctly articulated the brady standard.the trial court did likewise,citing the supreme court decision in kyles.in this case,the defense was plainly aware that the moo youngs left a briefcase at the crime scene an investigator working for petitioner counsel approached the police and asked them for it.the officer explained,however,that the briefcase had been returned to the victims family.at that time,petitioner knew of the briefcase and knew how he could obtain it.the police could not give it to him because they no longer had it.
our case law is clear that w here defendants,prior to trial,had within their knowledge the information by which they could have ascertained the alleged brady material,there is no suppression by the government.united states griggs,cir accord lecroy,at noting that there was no brady violation because the defendant could have obtained the information had he used reasonable diligence haliburton sec y for dep t of,cir united states valera,cir united states cortez,cir.the evidence was not suppressed by the state 
moreover,we agree with the state court that neither the briefcase nor its contents were material.in describing why the briefcase documents were not material,the state trial court observed that the documents would not have impeached the star witness,neville butler,nor refuted testimonial evidence taken from the hotel employees,the fingerprint evidence tying maharaj to the hotel room,or the ballistics evidence regarding maharaj gun.the state court not only found that there was no reasonable probability the proceedings would have been different if the evidence had been disclosed,but went so far as to say that disclosure would not have resulted in a markedly weaker case for the prosecution or a markedly stronger one for the defendant.
the florida courts application of the brady rule was reasonable here too.in deciding whether evidence was material for the purposes of a brady violation,the question is not whether the conviction was more likely because the evidence was introduced or even whether the evidence might have changed the outcome of the trial.strickler,at.at.rather,petitioner must convince us that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different if the suppressed documents had been disclosed to the defense.id.the word reasonable is important.the question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,but whether in its absence he received a fair trial,understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.kyles,at.at 
we agree with the state trial court that the briefcase documents neither impeached butler testimony nor called into question any of the physical evidence recovered from the crime scene.at most,they arguably cast the victims in a negative light and raise the bare possibility that the moo youngs may have been involved in some arguably unsavory activities with other individuals who may have had reason to do them harm.this highly speculative chain falls far short of even that quantum of evidence rejected as being insufficient by the strickler court,and,at all events,does not establish a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different if the documents had not been suppressed.see crawford head,cir rejecting an argument similar to the one petitioner makes here,finding that a police report detailing clothing found at a crime scene was not material,despite the fact that the report could theoretically give rise to the theory that other potential suspects should have been more thoroughly investigated.
the florida courts twin conclusions that the briefcase contents were not suppressed by the state and were not material under brady were reasonable,and were neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.maharaj is entitled to no relief on this claim.
c.the moo youngs life insurance policies 
finally,maharaj alleges that the state withheld evidence the moo youngs had recently purchased large life insurance policies.the florida supreme court found,however,that the policies,which were taken out several months before the murders,were not exculpatory because there has been no showing that this evidence tends to negate the conviction or the sentence,and m ore importantly,that the disclosure of the policies would not have put the case in so different a light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.maharaj iii,so d at.the district court agreed,concluding that the evidence was not exculpatory,that any arguments based on that evidence or other evidence that may have been discovered as a result of knowing about the policies was too speculative to have altered the outcome,and that it could not have been used to impeach the state primary witnesses.
our analysis concerning the life insurance policies is similar to the one that governed the contents of the moo youngs briefcase.maharaj argument,that the moo youngs were involved in shady dealings to the point that they were concerned about their own,and,therefore,executed substantial life insurance policies,is even more speculative than his argument concerning the other contents of the briefcase.the existence of the insurance policies in no way refutes any of the physical evidence and does not impeach any of the state witnesses.the florida supreme court resolution of this brady claim was altogether reasonable.
the state trial court also considered the cumulative effect of the evidence,and found that there was no reasonable probability that had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceedings would have been different.the district court agreed and so do we.
we have carefully reviewed the brady items and readily conclude that there is no reasonable probability,had all of the items been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceedings would have been any different.there was ample evidence of motive,and significant physical evidence tying petitioner to the room where the murders occurred.the state eyewitness,neville butler,never wavered as to the most important part of his testimony,describing maharaj brutal attacks on the moo youngs,and that testimony was corroborated by physical and ballistic evidence.none of the alleged brady items calls into question that portion of butler testimony,and none refutes any
