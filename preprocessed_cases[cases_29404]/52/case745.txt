this appeal involves a request by mexico for extradition of ramiro,a mexican citizen and lawful permanent resident of the united states,and the question whether the decision by the secretary of state to surrender him is subject to judicial review.
extradition is a process.first,a federal judicial officer determines whether the crime is extraditable and whether there is probable cause to sustain the charge.if so,the fugitive is certified as extraditable to the secretary of state.this decision is subject to limited judicial review through habeas corpus.see fernandez phillips.holding that habeas corpus is available only to inquire whether the magistrate had jurisdiction,whether the offense charged is within the extradition treaty,and whether there was any evidence warranting the finding that there was reasonable ground to believe the accused guilty.in this case a magistrate judge determined that was extraditable,the district court denied habeas relief,and we affirmed in seifert sic,cir i.next,the secretary of state determines in his discretion whether the fugitive will be surrendered.the secretary decided to extradite.
again sought habeas relief because we said in i that the administrative procedures act apa,allows an individual facing extradition who is making a torture claim to petition,under habeas corpus,for review of the secretary decision to surrender him.the district court ruled that it had jurisdiction under i,but found that the secretary acted in accordance with the law in deciding to extradite.
we conclude that our discussion of apa review in i was not necessary because the issue of whether would be entitled to judicial review of a final extradition decision was not then before us.the secretary had not yet decided to extradite and may never have decided to do so.for this reason the discussion is advisory and we are not bound by it.considering the issue afresh,we hold that the secretary of state decisions concerning extradition are not subject to judicial review.
accordingly,on different grounds,we affirm denial of the petition.
a warrant was issued by a judge in tijuana,mexico in august for arrest on charges of violent robbery,homicide,injuries,deliberate property damage,kidnaping,and firing a weapon upon a person.the crimes allegedly occurred may.was accused of robbing a jewelry store in tijuana using a submachine gun,shooting and killing a police officer while fleeing the robbery,and forcing a passerby to drive him after he crashed his own car into a police car and injured an officer.
was provisionally arrested in the united states in october at the request of the mexican government.a foreign state makes a request for extradition to the state department,which determines if the request is within the terms of the applicable treaty before forwarding it to the department of justice for a similar screening.see restatement third of foreign relations law i,at.if covered by the treaty,the request is forwarded to the united states attorney in the district where the fugitive is located.in this case,the united states attorney for the central district of california filed mexico formal request for extradition.
under,any justice or judge of the united states,including an authorized magistrate judge,has jurisdiction to conduct an extradition hearing according to the terms of the extradition treaty between a requesting nation and the united states.the hearing purpose is to determine whether the crime is extraditable and there is probable cause to sustain the charge.i,at footnote omitted.if both requirements are met,the judge or magistrate must certify the individual as extraditable to the secretary of state.in this case,hearings were held before a magistrate judge.argued that his extradition was barred by article of the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment torture convention,implemented by the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of,stat,codified as note to farr act.article prohibits a country from surrendering an individual who will face torture in the requesting country torture convention,entered into force june,res,gaor,supp.at,doc.signed by united states april.testified that he was tortured by mexican authorities following his arrest,that he was forced to sign confessions to the charged crimes,and that he feared further torture if he were returned to mexico.the magistrate judge held that evidence of future torture was inadmissible to show that certification should be denied,and certified for extradition in september,finding that even without the confessions,there was probable cause that he committed the offenses for which mexico sought his extradition.
while the certification decision may not be appealed directly,it may be reviewed collaterally.on habeas,the district court review has been limited to the following whether the extradition judge had jurisdiction to conduct the proceeding whether the extradition court had jurisdiction over the individual sought whether the extradition treaty was in force whether the crime fell within the treaty terms whether there was probable cause that the individual sought committed the crime and whether the crime was within the political offense exception.i,at citation omitted.
filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus which was denied by the district court on october.on appeal,argued that the torture convention was and was thus enforceable by individuals such as himself.the government countered that the farr act,which implemented the torture convention,and regulations that the state department adopted pursuant to it,prohibit judicial review of torture convention claims in the context of extradition.this court affirmed denial of the petition because torture claim was not ripe,but directed that it be without prejudice to the filing of a new petition should the secretary decide to surrender.in such event,we held that could state a claim cognizable under the apa that the secretary breached his duty to implement article.id.at.
i reasoned that article of the torture convention prohibits extradition of a fugitive if there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture and that a duty not to extradite in such circumstances was imposed by congress on the secretary of state through a of the farr act.section a states that it is the policy of the united states not to expel,extradite,or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.farr act,a.the act requires agencies such as the department of state to prescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the united states under article.id.b.regulations adopted by the state department provide that the department considers the question of whether a person facing extradition from the is more likely than not to be tortured in the state requesting extradition,b,and that b ased on the resulting analysis of relevant information,the secretary may decide to surrender the fugitive to the requesting state,to deny surrender of the fugitive,or to surrender the fugitive subject to conditions.id.b.the opinion states that the farr act imposes a clear and nondiscretionary duty to assure that those subject to the secretary actions are not to be returned if they are likely to face torture,therefore apa review is authorized.as neither the farr act nor the apa grants jurisdiction to the federal courts for claims arising under article of the torture convention,i concludes that a habeas petition is the most appropriate form of action for fugitives seeking review of the secretary extradition decisions.however,any such challenge would not be ripe until there is final agency action,that is,until the secretary has decided to surrender a fugitive.i,at.
judge kozinski concurred in the judgment,but declined to join the analysis of the applicability of the apa,noting that the question of whether petitioner would be entitled to judicial review of an extradition decision by the secretary of state is not before us.id.at kozinski,concurring.he would have held only that the district court does not have jurisdiction to review petitioner claim under the torture convention,because the farr act does not authorize judicial enforcement of the convention,and the convention is not.id.citation omitted.
once denial of habeas petition had been affirmed,the magistrate judge certification along with a copy of all the testimony was transmitted to the secretary of state for the secretary to exercise his discretion whether to extradite.see.in this case,also submitted various state department reports on human rights practices in mexico for the secretary consideration.in june,the secretary signed a warrant of extradition ordering that be returned to mexico.the government delayed extradition in light of the opinion in i to give an opportunity to seek judicial review of the secretary decision.
then filed a second petition,again raising the claim that his extradition would offend the torture convention.the government did not submit a full administrative record because of its intent to challenge jurisdiction and because of foreign policy confidentiality concerns.however,it did provide the declaration of samuel witten,assistant legal adviser for law enforcement and intelligence in the office of legal adviser of the state department,who is in charge of extraditions.the witten declaration describes the process through which the department goes in deciding whether to surrender a fugitive,or to condition extradition on the requesting state provision of assurances related to torture or other aspects of the requesting state criminal justice system.it indicates that the department ability to seek and obtain assurances from a requesting state depends in part on the ability to treat dealings with foreign governments with discretion,and that a judicial decision overturning a determination made by the secretary after negotiations with a requesting state could seriously undermine this country foreign relations and cause delays that would undermine expeditious surrendering of fugitives for trial in requesting states and in turn,in the united states.
the district court held that it had jurisdiction given on the merits,the court found that the witten declaration was uncontradicted,that failed to show that the secretary did not comply with article of the torture convention by reviewing all relevant considerations before signing the extradition warrant,and that the secretary did not fail to act in accordance with law under a.it denied the petition,but stayed the warrant pending appeal to this court.
to resolve appeal we must first decide whether i discussion of judicial review is binding.our colleagues have occasionally disagreed over how dicta should be defined.see,united states johnson,cir en banc miller gammie,cir en banc.some subscribe to the view that a court pronouncement is dicta when it is unnecessary to our disposition of the case,see johnson,at tashima,concurring export group reef,cir,others to the view that where a panel confronts an issue germane to the eventual resolution of the case,and resolves it after reasoned consideration in a published opinion,that ruling becomes the law of the circuit,see johnson,at kozinski,concurring miranda kitzhaber,cir per curiam brand x internet services fcc,cir.regardless of which view controls,the conclusion in i that the secretary extradition decisions are subject to judicial review under the apa can not be binding.
neither the issue of judicial review of the secretary determination,nor the applicability of the apa,was briefed or argued by the parties in i.the secretary had not yet had an opportunity to decide whether to extradite,so any discussion regarding possible future review,or the application of the apa,was hypothetical.by the same token,it was not necessary to resolve the issue in i because the only question before the court at that time was whether judicial review was available for a torture convention claim at the certification stage.once it was recognized that the likelihood of future torture is not part of the certification decision,the torture convention claim was necessarily unripe.even so,the certifying court either to consider a claim arising under the torture convention depending upon whether the torture convention is and the farr act authorizes judicial enforcement.this,too,would have been dispositive one way or the other on the claim in i,without the need to consider whether the secretary subsequent decision,if to extradite,would be subject to judicial review.either way,the discussion in i about judicial review of the secretary decision was an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.north carolina rice,d.as such,it is advisory and thus.
we realize that the i opinion states that the court would have been required to reach the merits if apa review of the secretary final decision were not available,and that it describes its discussion as a holding.at.however,this makes its discussion no more pertinent to the issues presented,nor any less premature.no final action had been taken,and none might ever be from which judicial review was sought.the panel affirmed denial of the petition because torture claim did not become ripe until the secretary of state determined that he was to be surrendered to mexico,and acknowledged that the merits of the claim could not be reached at that time.id.at.in these circumstances we can not but conclude that the discussion of what should and when the secretary decided to surrender not the law of the circuit by which this panel is bound.
points out that the court has since referred to i as holding that certain decisions by the secretary of state determining to extradite a fugitive are reviewable.see,barapind reno,cir see also blaxland commonwealth dir.of pub.prosecutions,cir citing barapind.however,the reference in both cases was in passing neither opinion turns on i and nothing in either opinion suggests that the parties focused attention on the binding effect of i,as they have here.also contends that the holding from i is binding under the law of the case doctrine.the law of the case doctrine provides that the decision of an appellate court on a legal issue must be followed in all subsequent proceedings in the same case.bernhardt los angeles county,cir quoting in re rainbow magazine,cir.as this is not the same action,i is not binding as the law of the case even though it would be binding as law of the circuit if it were not advisory.
because we conclude that i is advisory and thus not the law of the circuit,we turn to whether the secretary extradition decision is subject to judicial review.
the government position is that extradition decisions by the secretary of state are discretionary and are not subject to judicial review under the rule of.the principle is that the procedures or treatment that await a surrendered fugitive in the requesting country are determined solely by the executive branch.see,united states,cir.whereas the magistrate judge decision to certify a person for extradition is subject to limited judicial review through habeas corpus,the government argues that the secretary decision to surrender a fugitive is ultimately a foreign policy decision that is reposed entirely in the executive branch.this is because the decision to surrender,unlike the probable cause determination that a judicial officer makes,involves sensitive judgments about how the fugitive is likely to be treated if returned to the requesting country whether to seek assurances about the protections that will be afforded to him,at what level to obtain them,and how to evaluate such assurances as are given and the nature of diplomatic relations between the united states and the requesting foreign state at the time.the government submits that the passage of the farr act changed none of this,because nothing in the act indicates that congress intended to rewrite extradition law and make the secretary extradition determinations subject to judicial review.to the contrary,the act explicitly states that it shall not be construed as providing jurisdiction to consider or review claims raised under the torture convention or the act,or determinations made with respect to the policy against returning fugitives when there is a danger of torture,except for review of final orders in immigration cases.farr act d.
counters that the farr act supersedes the rule of and case law applying it.he contends that the text of the act imposes a mandatory duty on the secretary not to extradite a person who is likely to be tortured,and that to construe it as affording discretion to do so would undermine congressional intent and violate international law.further,he argues that the apa allows review because the farr act does not preclude judicial review of the secretary application of the act to a particular case,and the agency discretion exception in a does not apply if there is a meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion.see heckler chaney,d.there is such a standard here on account of the mandatory,duty not to extradite a person who is likely to be tortured.also maintains that we owe the secretary interpretation no deference as his interpretation is contrary to clear congressional intent.finally,in his view,habeas corpus is available because d of the farr act does not eliminate habeas jurisdiction for apa review.points out that in the context of immigration removal proceedings,we have held that federal courts have habeas jurisdiction pursuant to to consider claims by aliens that their removal to a foreign country violates the torture convention,see singh ashcroft,cir,and he urges us to extend this reasoning to extradition.
we have long adhered to the general rule of that it is the role of the secretary of state,not the courts,to determine whether extradition should be denied on humanitarian grounds or on account of the treatment that the fugitive is likely to receive upon his return to the requesting state.see barapind,at noting acceptance of the general rule.other courts have as well undergirding this principle is the notion that courts are as institutions and as a matter of separation of powers and foreign relations policy to make inquiries into and pronouncements about the workings of foreign countries justice systems.the state department is in a superior position to consider the consequences of a nonextradition decision upon foreign relations than the courts and it has diplomatic tools,not available to the judiciary,which it can use to insure that the requesting state provides a fair trial.united states smyth,cir quoting michael scharf,foreign courts on trial why courts should avoid applying the inquiry provision of the supplementary extradition treaty,stan.int l.
hood,cir,is the leading case applying the rule in our circuit.in that case,mexico sought extradition of for murder.the fugitive petitioned for habeas relief after the magistrate judge certified that he was extradictable,in part on the ground that he would be subject to corruption instead of due process upon his return.the magistrate judge excluded the evidence as irrelevant.in affirming,we recognized that e xtradition is a matter of foreign policy entirely within the discretion of the executive branch,except to the extent that the statute interposes a judicial function.id.at.section provides for a court to issue a certificate if extradition is permissible,and for the secretary of state to exercise his discretion whether to extradite.as we explained 
the secretary exercise of discretion need not be based upon considerations individual to the person facing extradition.it may be based on foreign policy considerations instead.the secretary of state may exercise executive discretion based on technical,humanitarian,or political grounds.we suppose there is nothing to stop lawyer from putting together a presentation showing why the secretary ought to exercise discretion not to extradite,and mailing it to the secretary of state.as for whether the secretary of state considers the material,and how the secretary balances the material against other considerations,that is a matter exclusively within the discretion of the executive branch and not subject to judicial review.
id.at citation omitted quoting c herif bassiouni,international extradition united states law and practice ed.we declined to retreat from the rule of in response to argument that procedures or punishment so antipathetic to a federal court sense of decency should cause us to,because courts in this country refrain from examining the penal systems of requesting nations,leaving to the secretary of state determinations of whether the defendant is likely to be treated humanely.id.at citing,at,and bassiouni,supra,at.
the rule of reflects both the bifurcated process in the statute,and the differentiation of function that the statute recognizes.as the first circuit described the structure 
thus,under,the judicial officer inquiry is limited to a narrow set of issues concerning the existence of a treaty,the offense charged,and the quantum of evidence offered.the larger assessment of extradition and its consequences is committed to the secretary of state.this bifurcated procedure reflects the fact that extradition proceedings contain legal issues peculiarly suited for judicial resolution,such as questions of the standard of proof,competence of evidence,and treaty construction,yet simultaneously implicate questions of foreign policy,which are better answered by the executive branch.both institutional competence rationales and our constitutional structure,which places primary responsibility for foreign affairs in the executive branch,see,united states export,support this division of labor.
united states,cir.it is also the case,as we have previously recognized,that only the state department,not the judiciary,has the power to attach conditions to an order of an extradition.see emami united states district court,cir.and,of course,only the secretary of state has diplomatic tools at his disposal for assuring that a fugitive is treated humanely upon being returned.
thus,the rule of is,rooted in the separation of powers,and consistent with the procedures that congress adopted for extradition.the question is whether it has been displaced by the torture convention or the farr act.we think it has not been.
the farr act on its face clearly states that it does not create jurisdiction for a court to review the secretary application of article of the torture convention.section d states 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,and except as provided in the regulations described in subsection b,no court shall have jurisdiction to review the regulations adopted to implement this section,and nothing in this section shall be construed as providing any court jurisdiction to consider or review claims raised under the convention or this section,or any other determination made with respect to the application of the policy set forth in subsection a,except as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to section of the immigration and nationality act.
farr act d emphasis added.the regulations authorized by the farr act likewise provide that nothing in section shall be construed as providing any court jurisdiction to consider or review claims raised under the convention or section,or any other determination made with respect to the application of the policy set forth in section a.while d plainly contemplates judicial review of final orders of removal for compliance with the torture convention and the farr act,it just as plainly does not contemplate judicial review for anything else.otherwise,the except clause would be superfluous.consequently,it is manifest that the farr act itself precludes jurisdiction to review determinations made with respect to the policy set out in subsection a of not returning fugitives who would be in danger of being subjected to torture.
nor does the torture convention itself enable review of such determinations because the treaty is not.see saint fort ashcroft,cir so holding wang ashcroft,cir same.the convention does not provide for private rights,and the conclusion that it is not is supported by the fact that the united states senate expressly declared that article was not when it consented to ratification.the declaration sta
