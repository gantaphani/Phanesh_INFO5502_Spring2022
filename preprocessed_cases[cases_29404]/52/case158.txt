plaintiff pierre konowaloff appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,shira scheindlin,judge,dismissing his action against defendant metropolitan museum of art the museum for its acquisition,possession,display,and retention of a painting that had been confiscated by the russian bolshevik regime from konowaloff in.the district court granted the museum motion to dismiss konowaloff amended complaint,ruling that the pleading reveals that his claims are barred by the act of state doctrine.on appeal,konowaloff contends principally that the district court erred in holding that the painting was taken pursuant to a valid act of state despite factual allegations in his amended complaint to the contrary.for the reasons that follow,we find konowaloff contentions to be without merit,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the allegations in konowaloff amended complaint are described in detail in the september,opinion and order of the district court,reported at wl,familiarity with which is assumed.the factual allegations material to konowaloff challenge to the court ruling,taken as true and with all reasonable inferences drawn in favor of konowaloff for purposes of our review of a dismissal based on the pleading,included the following.
a.the allegations of the amended complaint 
konowaloff is the sole heir to the estate of his ivan morozov,a russian national who prior to lived in moscow,and who prior to world war i had a modern art collection that ranked among the finest in europe amended complaint see id.in,morozov acquired,for value,a cézanne painting known as madame cézanne in the conservatory or portrait of madame cézanne the painting.see id.introductory paragraph and.
the march revolution in russia overthrew tsar nicholas ii and installed a provisional government,which was promptly recognized by the united states.see id.in november,the bolsheviks the bolshevik faction of the russian social democratic workers party seized power from the provisional government.id.the bolshevik or soviet regime,called the russian socialist federated soviet republic rsfsr see id,and its official successor,called the union of soviet socialist republics or see id,are referred to collectively as the soviet union or the soviet government.the united states did not recognize the soviet government until november.see id.
immediately after gaining power in,the bolsheviks set about issuing numerous decrees nationalizing property,f or example,abolish ing the private ownership of land on november,and making museums property of the state.id.the bolsheviks confiscated artworks,particularly of tsarist origins,for possible sale abroad.id.they also took steps to conceal or destroy evidence of the origins of the artwork.see id.
on december,the bolsheviks decreed that the art collection of morozov,including the painting,was state property amended complaint see id.the painting was confiscated by the rsfsr in,in an act of theft.morozov did not voluntarily relinquish the painting.as a result of that decree morozov was deprived of all his property rights and interests in the painting and did not receive any compensation for being deprived of his rights and interests in the painting.id.the december,order which was directed only at the art collections of morozov and one other family was tantamount to a bill of attainder,meting out punishment to particular individuals without legal process and on account of no sin.id.
the amended complaint alleged that in may,the painting was acquired by stephen clark in a transaction that may have violated russian law id,including decrees issued in september and october prohibiting the export of objects of particular and historical importance,including artworks id.see also id.it alleged that t he soviet state,including its institutions and laws,was distinct from the communist party of the soviet union id.that t he politburo was the executive arm of the communist party id.that t he politburo made the decisions on art sales id.and secretly approved the sale of the painting and other works to clark id.and that t he sale of the painting to clark in,like the confiscation of the painting in,was an act of party,not an act of state.party actions in selling the art abroad violated soviet laws.the politburo members who ordered the sale of the painting were acting independently of the soviet state and were engaged in illegal private trade with western capitalists id.
the amended complaint contained extensive descriptions of clark and the conduct of other persons konowaloff contends dealt in stolen art from the soviet government and transferr ed funds into soviet accounts id.see also id.and likely assisted in clark purchase of the painting see id.it alleged that clark may have known that the painting had been taken from morozov without compensation id.and that clark made no attempt to contact morozov heirs prior to,or at any time after,his purchase of the painting id.it alleged that clark employed a soviet laundering operation to acquire the painting id.and concealed the painting provenance id.
clark,who had been a trustee of the museum see amended complaint,died in and bequeathed the painting to the museum see id.the amended complaint alleged that the museum may have known that clark bequest involved looted art id.and may have known that soviet law prohibited the alienation of western art unless approved by the highest authorities id.yet the museum did nothing to inquire as to whether clark had good title locate the heirs of ivan morozov and ascertain whether the heirs to ivan morozov had received compensation for the painting or had voluntarily given up any claims of title to the painting.id.
konowaloff became the official heir to the morozov collection in,and in learned that morozov had owned the painting.see amended complaint.in may,he demanded that the museum return the painting to him.see id.after the museum refused,konowaloff commenced the present action,seeking injunctive,monetary,and declaratory relief.
b.the decision of the district court 
the museum moved for dismissal of the amended complaint on the grounds that konowaloff claims are barred by the act of state doctrine,the political question doctrine,the doctrine of international comity,and the statute of limitations or laches,or,in the alternative,on the ground that the amended complaint failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted.the district court concluded that the museum had met its burden of showing that the act of state doctrine applies to bar konowaloff claims.see wl,at.
noting the general principle that the act of state doctrine precludes the courts of this country from inquiring into the validity of the public acts of a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own territory,id.at quoting banco nacional de cuba sabbatino,sabbatino,the court also pointed out that c onfiscations by a state of the property of its own nationals,no matter how flagrant and regardless of whether compensation has been provided,do not constitute violations of international law,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted,and that the act of state doctrine applies even if international law has been violated,id.at quoting sabbatino,at.
the district court also noted a that when a revolutionary government is recognized as a de jure government,such recognition is retroactive in effect and validates all the actions and conduct of the government so recognized from the commencement of its existence,wl,at quoting united states pink,quoting oetjen central leather,emphasis ours b that the united states recognized the soviet government in see amended complaint,and thereby validated that government actions from the commencement of its existence,see wl,at and c that the supreme court and courts in this circuit have consistently held nationalization decrees to be official acts accepted as valid for the purpose of invoking the act of state doctrine,id.at.
in the instant case,there is no dispute that the painting was taken from morozov by virtue of the nationalization decree.it is only the legal validity of that decree that is at issue.thus,this court is indeed being asked to decide the legality of an official act of a sovereign precisely the sort of inquiry precluded by the act of state doctrine.
id.at emphasis added.
although the amended complaint sought to distinguish acts of the politburo characterizing them as the acts of a party,not of the soviet state the court pointed out that the alleged 
activities of the politburo pertain ed to the sale of the painting,not to its confiscation from morozov.the act of state that i decline to question here is the act of expropriating the painting from morozov.i accept that the soviet government took ownership of the painting in through an official act of state,and accordingly,the painting sale abroad in whether legal or illegal,an act of party or an act of state becomes irrelevant,as konowaloff lacks any ownership stake in the painting.
id.at emphasis in original footnote omitted.
the court rejected konowaloff contention that the act of state doctrine should not be applied on the ground that the painting was seized for no legitimate governmental purpose or operation,wl,at quoting memorandum of law in support of konowaloff opposition to defendant metropolitan museum of art motion to dismiss plaintiff amended complaint konowaloff opposition memorandum at,stating that whether the expropriation was an official act does not turn on the legitimacy or illegitimacy of governmental purposes.the act of state doctrine prohibits just such an inquiry into the purpose of an official act,wl,at.
the court also rejected the argument that the act of state doctrine should not foreclose konowaloff action on the ground that the soviet union collapsed in.the amended complaint alleged that the,which was established through the bolshevik revolution,is no longer an extant and recognized regime,and that the current russian federation has been investigating the sales of art abroad during to determine to what extent the soviet government sale of artworks from museum collections was legal according to existing laws at that time.amended complaint internal quotation marks omitted.the district court concluded that,even if a regime change were dispositive,and not simply one of several factors that may be taken into consideration in determining the applicability of the act of state doctrine,see wl,at citing sabbatino,at,nothing cited by konowaloff shows that the ubiquitous nationalization of property under the communist regime has been repudiated the cited investigation shows only the repudiation of sale s of art to foreign parties,and the disinclination of the russian government to adopt a current policy of nationalization,wl,at emphasis added.
the district court also rejected konowaloff contention that the act of state doctrine should not apply on the basis that 
adjudication of these claims will not impact,let alone harm,foreign relations,insofar as the united states,the russian federation,and the commonwealth of independent states have not indicated any interest in these proceedings.however,the question is not merely whether either the or the foreign government seeks to intervene in the specific action,but rather whether any decision this court renders could affect relations with the foreign government.
id.at footnote omitted quoting konowaloff opposition memorandum at.the court reasoned that 
j ettisoning precedent regarding soviet nationalization decrees would call into question decrees and titles to property resolved under these decrees,and would plainly risk upsetting the russian federation,which,plaintiff admits,itself owns much private property taken pursuant to many decrees.
wl,at internal quotation marks omitted.the possibility that this could affect relations with the foreign government one of the several factors that the sabbatino court advised taking into consideration favored application of the doctrine.id.at.
the district court having concluded that the act of state doctrine precluded inquiry into the validity of the decree that confiscated the painting from morozov and stripped him of ownership,concluded that konowaloff claims for declaratory,injunctive,and monetary relief are foreclosed.the court found it unnecessary to address the museum alternative grounds for its motion to dismiss.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,konowaloff contends principally that the district court erred a in concluding that the painting was taken pursuant to a valid act of state despite factual allegations in the amended complaint to the contrary,b in disregarding the amended complaint factual allegations as to events subsequent to the confiscation that call the museum title to the painting into question and in failing to consider konowaloff request for declaratory relief,and c in failing to find the act of state doctrine inapplicable on the basis that the soviet government that appropriated the painting is no longer extant.
in reviewing the dismissal on the basis of the pleading,we accept the factual allegations of the amended complaint as true,and draw all reasonable factual inferences that are available,in order to assess whether the pleading states a legal claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atlantic twombly,twombly.we are not,however,required to credit legal assertions or a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.twombly,at internal quotation marks omitted.within this framework,we conclude that konowaloff contentions are without merit,and we affirm the dismissal substantially for the reasons stated by the district court.
under the act of state doctrine,the courts of the united states,whether state or federal,
will not examine the validity of a taking of property within its own territory by a foreign sovereign government,extant and recognized by this country at the time of suit,in the absence of a treaty or other unambiguous agreement regarding controlling legal principles 
sabbatino,at emphasis added.the doctrine arises out of the basic relationships between branches of government in a system of separation of powers,and expresses the strong sense of the judicial branch that its engagement in the task of passing on the validity of foreign acts of state may hinder rather than further this country pursuit of goals in the international sphere.id.at.
under this doctrine,the validity of the foreign state act may not be examined even if the complaint alleges that the taking violates customary international law,id.at,or the foreign state own laws,see id.at the courts below properly declined to determine if issuance of cuba expropriation decree complied with the formal requisites of cuban law.w hen it is made to appear that the foreign government has acted in a given way the details of such action or the merit of the result can not be questioned but must be accepted by our courts as a rule for their decision.ricaud american metal co,see also kirkpatrick environmental tectonics,the act of state doctrine requires that,in the process of deciding a case or controversy,the acts of foreign sovereigns taken within their own jurisdictions shall be deemed valid.
after the executive branch recognition of a foreign state,the act of state doctrine applies retroactively to acts that were undertaken by the foreign state prior to official united states recognition 
w hen a government which originates in revolution or revolt is recognized by the political department of our government as the de jure government of the country in which it is established,such recognition is retroactive in effect and validates all the actions and conduct of the government so recognized from the commencement of its existence.
oetjen central leather,emphasis added.the supreme court has repeatedly applied this principle to cases involving nationalizations ordered during the russian revolution appropriating the property and assets of various russian corporations notwithstanding the fact that formal recognition of the soviet government by the united states occurred years after the decrees themselves.see united states pink,ruling that the decision by the executive branch to formally recognize the soviet government was conclusive in the courts,and that the act of state doctrine bar
