the chief question in this appeal is whether the foreign sovereign immunities act of,et,shields the united arab emirates from the wrongful termination and defamation suit of its former employee,mohamed salem,once an accountant in the embassy here in washington.the case turns on an application of the act commercial activity exception.id.a.since we conclude was not a civil servant under the act,and his work did not involve the exercise of distinctively governmental powers,we affirm the district court in applying the commercial activity exception and denying immunity.a relatively minor district court failure to discount future lost earnings to present us to reverse in part and remand the case solely for correction of that aspect of the damages award.
the facts below summarize the district court detailed findings after a bench trial,which we set aside only if clearly erroneous.see embassy of,wl.a.
is an egyptian citizen who earned a bachelor degree in accounting in and began a career marked for many years by one promotion and positive job review after another.from to,he worked as an auditor for the government of the united arab emirates in abu dhabi not an unusual arrangement for the,whose population between the ages of and numbers about.in,he formally resigned to begin work at the embassy in washington,where he was an auditor and supervising accountant in the cultural attaché where he soon discovered that the cultural attaché,his deputy,and others were involved in embezzling no less than million in state funds.exposed the embezzlement and helped with the subsequent investigation.in,he was promoted and commended for his work while the cultural attaché and his accomplices were sacked.
about a year and a half later,in,was accused of financial impropriety in connection with the very embezzlement he had exposed.why he was the record and the district court opinion make clear that the accusation was baseless to the a mystery,though a letter the minister of finance wrote on behalf gives a clue the existing disputes between the cultural attaché in washington and the ministry of higher education and scientific research have directly impacted the case of mohammed,wl,at quoting pl.ex.in fact,the ambassador to the united states,the minister of finance,and the new cultural attaché each sent multiple letters vouching for character and competence and refuting the allegations against him the district court seconded in its factual findings,concluding that the documents in the record demonstrate either that the alleged impropriety was not,in fact,improper or that if there was any fault,it lay elsewhere,such as with the embezzlers had detected and reported.id.nonetheless,the department named in the minister of finance letter,the ministry of higher education and scientific research,had final authority over employment in the cultural attaché office and,in,ordered penal dismissal along with fines for the money allegedly mishandled.
after he was fired,briefly found work as an auditor with the military attaché,but the ministry of higher education and scientific research viewed the job as a circumvention of the penal termination imposed,id.at,and,in late summer,had him fired again.at about the same time,a representative of the ministry held a meeting about dismissal with the fifteen or so employees of the cultural attaché office,announcing that was fired for not doing his job properly or honestly.and since then,in application after application both here and in egypt where he returned in,has been rejected from every accounting job for which he has applied,always after inquiries about the circumstances in which his prior employment ended.his efforts over the last decade to find work in other fields and to start his own business have failed as well.

the chief issue before us is the claim to immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act.before passage of the act,american courts had generally regarded foreign sovereigns as absolutely immune from suit with exceptions where the political branches made recommendations to suspend immunity.verlinden cent.bank of,d discussing the legacy of chief justice marshall opinion in the schooner exchange,cranch.but almost from the outset,courts recognized a distinction between the public and governmental acts of sovereign states on the one hand and their private and commercial acts on the other.alfred dunhill of london,republic of cuba,d see also united states planters bank of,wheat.marshall,w hen a government becomes a partner in any trading company,it devests itself,so far as concerns the transactions of that company,of its sovereign character,and takes that of a private citizen.that distinction became the basis for a restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity,a theory congress codified in the foreign sovereign immunities act of.verlinden,at.so while the act announces that foreign states shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states,the act principal effect is in the list of exceptions that follows,and the most significant exception,republic of argentina weltover,d,the one at the heart of the restrictive theory as a whole and at issue in this appeal,is the commercial activity exception of a a foreign state shall not be immune in any case in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state a state engages in commercial activity,the supreme court has explained since the act never defines the term,where it exercises only those powers that can also be exercised by private citizens,as distinct from those powers peculiar to sovereigns,saudi arabia nelson,d quoting republic of argentina,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
since action is based upon breach of his employment contract and defamation in connection with that breach,this case involves the commercial activity exception as applied in the employment context.see saudi arabia,at.holding that the term based upon in the act indicates those elements of a claim that,if proven,would entitle a plaintiff to relief under his theory of the case the act does speak directly to this context,but its legislative history does p ublic or governmental and not commercial in nature,would be the employment of diplomatic,civil service,or military personnel,while commercial and not public or governmental in nature would be the employment or engagement of laborers,clerical staff,or public relations or marketing agents,at,as reprinted in,see also,at identical language.thus,like many of our sister circuits,we have held that a foreign government civil servants and diplomats and soldiers do not qualify for the commercial activity exception.ii,at citing broadbent organization of american states,see also kato ishihara,cir holden canadian consulate,cir segni commercial office of spain,cir.we have not and do not affirm the converse a foreign government employee might not be a civil servant or diplomat or soldier and still be engaged in quintessentially governmental,for example,a judge.thus,if is a civil servant,our analysis stops for we have determined that the is immune from his suit.if is not a civil servant,we go on to scrutinize whether his work involves the exercise of powers that can also be exercised by private citizens,as distinct from those powers peculiar to sovereigns.saudi arabia,at.internal quotation marks omitted.as we framed it in ii t he operative question is whether was a member of the civil service and t he ultimate question is whether employment constituted commercial activity.at.of course,the first inquiry might well illuminate the second 
there is no definition of civil service in the foreign sovereign immunities act or its legislative history and associated case law,and there are dangers in borrowing or analogizing to get one.our country notion of a civil service has certain characteristic features like merit selection,personnel procedures,and benefits,but we ca rightly expect foreign governments to either mimic civil service protections now common to the united states or sacrific e the immunity conferred by fsia.kato,at.and in fact,our country notion of a civil service,conceived as an antidote to political patronage,tends to include clerical staff,or public relations or marketing agents and exclude many the opposite of the house and senate reports apparent aim.the notion of public service might be a closer proxy for that aim.on the other hand,some countries might lack the notion of a civil service altogether,and others might define the notion in a way far afield of fsia purpose.we therefore take a flexible and inclusive approach to determining whether a foreign government employee is a civil servant.ii lists five generally relevant considerations,while noting that the list is not exclusive,necessarily applicable in all cases,or,unfortunately but unavoidably,analytically precise 
first,how do the own laws define its civil service,and do job title and duties come within that definition 
second,what was the nature of employment relationship with the did he have a true contractual arrangement,or is his contract claim instead based,as the contends,solely upon the civil service laws of the 
third,what was the nature of employment relationship when he worked in the,and how did his subsequent employment at the embassy relate to that prior tenure the contends that was a longtime resident and member of its domestic civil service,who was merely transferred to washington to perform the same functions governmental audits he had been performing at home.contends,on the other hand,that he quit his position in the and began a new job in the united states,separate from his previous employment.
fourth,what was the nature of work as noted above,congress indicated that the employment or engagement of laborers,clerical staff or public relations or marketing agents would come within the definition of commercial activity.
fifth,what is the relevance of egyptian nationality on the facts of this case is the a country in which,as the house report assumed,are unlikely to be employed as governmental officers or does the often employ in governmental positions 
at internal citation omitted.the district court applied this list to the facts in iii and repeated the core of its analysis in iv.the task is easy.the evidence is meager,sometimes contradictory,and the question is exceedingly close.thus it is of great importance in this case that the foreign sovereign has the burden of proof.princz.
as to the first question,the district court found that the does not have a definition of civil service,that no such designation appear s to exist,and that the does not distinguish between employees paid by the government by categorizing them as civil service employees,governmental employees,or civilian employees.iii,slip op.at.yet confusingly enough,several official documents in the record,including some the district court itself found probative,use the term.perhaps these contradictory signals result from mistranslations of the documents original arabic.see id.at suggesting that the same arabic term or terms might be translated as civil service or public service.in any case,we find it of some help that a letter from the embassy cultural attaché states that does have the c ivil servant benefits.if this letter means what it appears in english to say,it is powerful evidence that was not a civil servant according to law.even if the letter is mistranslated,the fact that lacked benefits common to other governmental employees is sufficient for to prevail,if only slightly and in light of the burden of proof,on the first factor.
turning to the second question,was employed in all respects pursuant to the local employees regulations for the uae missions abroad.while not an individualized contract,these regulations provide the clearest evidence available to us that should not qualify as a civil servant.first,the regulations define local employees as being generally a dministrative employees,translators mailmen,drivers,security guards,cooks,waiters,farmers,and maintenance and state that local employees should almost always be nationals of the country in which the embassy is located with exceptions for highly exceptional cases,like,apparently.plainly,these regulations are not aimed at what we or the would normally call a civil service.on the contrary,these regulations seem to describe the very people congress intended the commercial activity exception for laborers,clerical staff,and other americans contracting to perform ordinary commercial services in the united states for a foreign government.second,the regulations actually refer to a civil service twice though we note again the possibility of mistranslation,both times in discussing the special case of citizens employed as local employees.while not easy to interpret,the references appear to contrast local employees and civil servants,making civil service a status available to local employees,if at all,only if they are also citizens of the now,it must be said that under the regulations,local employees like civil servants in this country may be terminated only for cause was,under the regulations as well as according to the district court and his own testimony,a permanent employee.nonetheless,we find the second factor tips decisively in favor.
the third question is easily answered while duties in abu dhabi were similar to his duties in washington,there can be no question that he formally and completely terminated his employment in the before beginning work in the united states.the district court goes farther,stating that t he evidence in the record suggests that employment at the uae embassy in the district of columbia was separate from and unrelated to his prior employment in the uae.iii,slip op.at.factor three favors.
the fourth question is more complicated.the district court reasoned in iii that,like laborers,clerical staff,and public relations or marketing agents,and unlike civil servants,had no role in the creation of uae government policy and was not privy to uae political deliberations.slip op.at.elaborating on the point in iv,the district court notes performed only the ordinary auditing duties of any commercial accountant and that his duties,although important and involving large sums of money,were ministerial,not discretionary.wl,at.we agree that,to the extent lacked authority to determine or articulate policy and lacked discretion in his duties,he is more like the employees for whom congress intended fsia commercial exception,and less like a civil servant.what gives us pause is supervisory authority over at least eight other accountants in the cultural attaché office.he was a part of the government,holden,at,in a way an administrative assistant,for example,would not be.on balance,we find his lack of discretion and exclusion from any role outweighs his supervisory role.thus factor four resolves in favor as by a very narrow margin indeed.
the fifth question concerns an issue of central importance in ii,though not here.the sentence in the house and senate reports classifying civil service work as governmental states in full also public or governmental and not commercial in nature,would be the employment of diplomatic,civil service,or military personnel,but not the employment of american citizens or third country nationals by the foreign state in the united states,at,as reprinted in,see also,at identical language.at one point,in dicta,we read this language to imply a per se rule that americans and third country nationals,even if employed by a foreign state as civil servants,count as commercial employees.broadbent,at.the district court decision on the immunity in i turned on this dictum.d at.but in ii,impressed with the situation of small countries like the that at times employ in high governmental positions,we rejected broadbent per se rule and held that a foreign state can engage in noncommercial,governmental activity through third country nationals.at.thus the relevance of a plaintiff nationality for the civil service inquiry becomes a matter of context.where a country rarely if ever hires for its civil service unlike the,strongly indicates that someone is not a civil servant.and in our view,citizenship makes someone more likely to qualify as a civil servant even if a country sometimes hires noncitizens as civil servants.accord segni,at a person hired by his own country government to work abroad should have a somewhat lesser expectation of suing his homeland in his host nation courts.thus,were a citizen,the might press its advantage,and were rarely if ever civil servants,might press his.as it is,nationality is all but irrelevant.
multifactor tests tend to be inconclusive,but the evidence here suggests is not a civil were the inquiry totally inconclusive,that very fact,together with the burden of proof,would decide the matter in favor.we therefore hold that is not a civil servant and move on to the ultimate question of whether his work involved the exercise of powers that can also be exercised by private citizens,as distinct from those powers peculiar to sovereigns.saudi arabia,at.internal quotation marks omitted.in so doing,we bear in mind a limiting principle from the statute the commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act,rather than by reference to its purpose.d.one could question whether it is possible to determine the nature of a human activity without reference to its purpose,de sanchez banco central de nicaragua,cir often,the essence of an act is defined by its,for example,but the supreme court has insisted that the statutory command be carried out,republic of argentina,at.the circuit argument is squarely foreclosed by the language of fsia,which in practice means rejecting any argument that rests on the foreign state reasons for undertaking the activity alleged to be commercial,id.i t is irrelevant why argentina participated in the bond market in the manner of a private actor it matters only that it did so.emphasis in original.we can not attend to whether a foreign government aims to make a profit or protect its borders,whether work aimed to carry out an international political program or to keep the cultural attaché office supplied with pens and pencils.we can look only to the resemblance between the outward form of his conduct and powers and those of private citizens.id.
one distinctive mark of governmental work is discretionary involvement with sovereign law or policy.according to the district court and we see no reason to disturb its conclusions,had no role in the creation of governmental policy,and to the extent he carried it out,his duties were ministerial,not discretionary.iv,wl,at.instead,did standard accounting work auditing expenditures,reviewing accounting methods,reconciling bank statements or employing auditors to conduct these activities,id.at a character easily found in commercial enterprise.we therefore affirm the district court conclusion that employment was commercial rather than governmental,and agree suit is authorized under the foreign sovereign immunity act commercial activity exception.
the raises six other challenges to the district court rulings,five of which obviously fail and one of which just as obviously succeeds.
at trial,testified over objection that prospective employers asked him why he left his job with the embassy and told him they could not hire him due to his penal termination.this was hearsay,the argues,and the district court findings of fact relied on it.but the testimony was hearsay only to the extent the district court used it for the truth of the matter asserted,and there is only one substantial respect in which the court might have done so to show the defamation caused professional injury.since the district court found defamation per se under law,id.at,that injury was presumed and any error was harmless.see.
the complains in two respects about the district court treatment of documentary evidence.first,the claims the district court admitted into evidence at trial documents undisclosed during discovery.but those documents,which concerned arcane intricacies of the embezzlement exposed,were apparently at issue in substance during discovery in any case,nothing in the district court opinion turned on their obscurities.second,the claims the district court opinion relies on a pair of documents never properly admitted into evidence at trial.both documents,however,concern whether qualifies as a civil servant and were properly submitted to and used by the court in iii the court referenced them again in iv only by way of reiterating its past work.we find no error or only harmless errors in these matters.see.
the claims testimony from egypt by internet video violated federal rule of civil procedure a,which requires good cause and appropriate safeguards before a witness is permitted to testify by contemporaneous transmission from a different location.but before permitting the testimony,the district court insisted that prove he had pursued and repeatedly been denied a visa to the united states as well as show careful preparations for translation and teleconferencing.the retreats to the argument that testimony was effectively unsworn because,with no extradition treaty between the united states and egypt,could not be prosecuted for perjury.but this argument only direct support comes from harrell state,so d,which concerns the very different issues at stake in applying the sixth amendment confrontation clause in the criminal context.in fact,rule permits video testimony,and its criminal equivalent federal rule of criminal procedure does,precisely because the supreme court found the criminal context too sensitive for the same rule.see order of the supreme court,scalia,united states yates,cir.
breach of contract claim required overcoming the district of columbia usual presumption of employment.sisco gsa capital fed.credit union.a properly distributed employee manual with specific termination provisions can do the job,see also byrne passenger.unpublished per curiam,and the district court found the local employees termination provisions provide for dismissal where,for example,an employee dereliction of duty destroys valuable embassy property or compromises official documents,qualify,iv,wl,at.the counters,primarily,that the evidence showing the regulations to have been distributed was too weak for the district court conclusion.the evidence is least it is himself testified to distribution,and several other witnesses supported the claim.that is enough under our clearly erroneous standard of review.a.
finally,the attacks defamation claim,arguing in the main that the common interest privilege protects all the written and spoken statements about dishonesty.but bad faith vitiates the privilege under law,moss stockard,and we have not the slightest difficulty affirming the district court findings of bad faith,iv,wl,at.
thus we come to the complaints about that the district court failed to discount future lost earnings to present value.we agree.the measure of damages in an employee action against his employer for breach of the employment contract is generally the compensation that would have been due to the employee during the unexpired period of employment with appropriate reduction to present worth.hodge evans fin,emphasis added internal quotation mark omitted quoting district of columbia jones.the district court here noted the requiremen
