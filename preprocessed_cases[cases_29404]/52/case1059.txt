juan jose pulido seeks review of an order in his habeas corpus proceedings,denying his motion to examine a material witness in mexico on a commission,pursuant to penal code section et we issued an order to show cause.having considered the parties petition,return,and reply,and having heard oral argument,we deny the petition.
background 
in february,a jury convicted pulido of torture,aggravated mayhem,kidnapping,subd.a and assault with a firearm,subd.a of victim emanuel cardenas,based on events occurring on march.the court sentenced pulido to a prison term of years and eight months plus life imprisonment.we affirmed the judgment in a nonpublished opinion people pulido,and the california supreme court denied pulido petition for review.
pulido filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus as to his actual innocence,which was denied by superior court judge lori ann fournier on november.on september,pulido filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in this court,contending that acquired declarations establish that he is actually innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted.on december,we issued an order to show cause,stating that the petition was denied on all other issues and good cause exists for an evidentiary hearing before the superior court on the issue of actual innocence only.pulido filed a code of civil procedure section peremptory challenge against judge fournier,and the matter was reassigned to judge rand rubin,who appointed counsel for pulido on november.
on or about april,pulido filed a motion in the trial court requesting that cardenas,the victim,be examined as a material witness in mexico on a commission.the motion stated that cardenas wished to recant his testimony at trial that pulido was the perpetrator.cardenas had recently been deported to mexico according to a declaration from counsel,within the past days and was living in rosarito beach.cardenas was therefore unavailable as a witness under evidence code section,and a commission was appropriate to examine cardenas in mexico and return his deposition to the court,under sections to.
cardenas declaration 
attached to the motion was a declaration by cardenas,signed before a notary in nevada on november.cardenas stated that he had lied in his preliminary hearing and trial testimony against pulido,who was not the man who kidnapped and shot him.cardenas had been trying to buy a gun to protect himself from some other men that he had argued with at a swap meet over their girlfriends.cardenas asked his sister if he could buy a gun from her friend pulido.pulido came over to his house and showed cardenas a gun on the morning of march,but cardenas did not have enough money,and pulido left after a few minutes.the men cardenas feared then arrived in a van and ordered him inside the van at gunpoint.they headed toward downey,asking about his friend javier who had been with cardenas at the swap meet.the men then said they were going to shoot him and leave him paralyzed for not telling where javier was,for trying to mess with their lady and most of all for kicking back with pulido,who was one of their worst enemies.they threatened his life if he said anything about them to the police.
after cardenas was released from the hospital,the police came to his house and said they were sure that pulido was responsible for what happened to cardenas,and if he did not testify against pulido,they would bring drug charges against cardenas.cardenas was intimidated into testifying against pulido at the preliminary hearing.at trial,he wanted to tell the truth about pulido innocence.one day before the trial he said that pulido was not responsible,but the judge,the prosecutor,and the defense attorney just looked at him.the prosecutor took cardenas to his office and told him that the police and the district attorney would give him jail time if he did not cooperate that night,the men who had kidnapped him called him and said that if he wanted to live,and for the safety of his family,he should testify against pulido and put pulido away for them.under all that pressure,he testified falsely.days later he sent his friend gustavo gallardo to the trial courtroom,to say that cardenas wanted to recant.while he was trying to hire an attorney to clear the case up,the court sent a warrant for his arrest,and cardenas was taken into custody.he was appointed an attorney,who told him not to change his testimony or else he would be charged with perjury or face jail time.cardenas invoked the fifth amendment so he would not incriminate himself.
in july cardenas was contacted by pulido attorney.cardenas told him he would cooperate with pulido defense,but the lawyer never contacted cardenas again,and cardenas decided to move out of state to avoid the real perpetrators and the threats from the police and the district attorney.cardenas apologized for lying.he was under pressure by two different sides and had no option but to testify falsely to save his life and the lives of his family.due to my lies,my conscience has been bothering me and i feel it necessary to acknowledge my old testimony sic in court sic were lies 
evidentiary hearing and denial of motion 
at the evidentiary hearing on april,before judge rubin,counsel for pulido stated that cardenas was critical to a presentation of the case.without him we stand very little chance,i believe,of persuading the court it was not pulido who committed this crime against the recanting witness.counsel argued that the statutes authorizing a commission to examine witnesses applied on collateral review as well as at trial.the court concluded that the statute should be narrowly construed,and denied the motion for a commission and a request for a continuance.
the attorney who had been the prosecutor at pulido trial in testified that he remembered gallardo as someone who was there to keep cardenas from testifying.he also remembered cardenas at some point indicating that he had identified the wrong person,and denied threatening anyone.when cardenas took the stand,he began to cry and seemed very frightened.nevertheless,cardenas told the truth.
gallardo testified that on the date cardenas had been kidnapped,he saw cardenas in front of his house talking to pulido after pulido left,gallardo saw a van drive by and slow down.cardenas later told gallardo that the people in the van kidnapped cardenas after pulido left,and that the kidnappers threatened to come back and harm cardenas family if he did not testify that pulido was the man who had kidnapped him.when gallardo was subpoenaed as a witness,he told cardenas to tell the truth,but the prosecutors threatened cardenas and gallardo they would go to jail for perjury.gallardo took the stand and lied,afraid to go to jail.he was not afraid of pulido.the district attorney asked gallardo if he remember ed telling the jury exactly what he just said here,that there was some mysterious van that was buzzing around your neighborhood and that pulido is totally innocent and cardenas told you that these mysterious people did it instead gallardo replied i do remember that.
the evidentiary hearing was set to resume on april,but pulido filed a petition for writ of mandate on april,and that same date this court issued a stay of the evidentiary hearing.on june,this court issued an order stating that pulido petition was premature,and denied the petition without prejudice to petitioner filing a new petition for writ of mandate,with a declaration from petitioner counsel to be filed in the trial court,indicating that counsel has information from cardenas,directly,of the time and location where cardenas will make himself available for the deposition upon the issuance of a commission.
on august,pulido filed a first amended petition for writ of mandate,with a declaration from counsel stating that counsel personally spoke by telephone with cardenas,and cardenas confirmed that he would appear on september,at at an address in rosarito,baja california.this court denied the first amended petition without prejudice as the matter is pending in the los angeles superior court.
at the resumption of the evidentiary hearing on august,the court acknowledged receipt of the declaration gi
