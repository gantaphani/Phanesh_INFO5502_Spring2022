we affirm,though for different reasons than those relied upon by the district court.regardless of whether the bethesda properties are subject to execution or attachment under tria,we hold that,by accepting a compensatory payment under section of the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of victims protection act,stat,the hegnas have relinquished their rights to effect the sale of the properties in satisfaction of their judgment.see victims protection act d as amended by tria c.accordingly,the writs of attachment in aid of execution levied on the bethesda properties must be quashed.

congress has devised two avenues by which individuals like the plaintiffs in suits brought under section a exception to sovereign satisfy their judgments against state sponsors of terrorism.first,congress has subjected an increasingly broad class of property owned by these nations in the united states to execution and attachment in aid of execution.congress latest effort in this regard is embodied in section a of the tria,note.section a states 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,and except as provided in subsection b,in every case in which a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party on a claim based upon an act of terrorism,or for which a terrorist party is not immune under section a of title,the blocked assets of that terrorist party shall be subject to execution or attachment in aid of execution in order to satisfy such judgment to the extent of any compensatory damages for which such terrorist party has been adjudged liable.
second,in the victims protection act,congress directed the secretary of the treasury to make direct payments to certain of iran and cuba from funds belonging to those nations but being held by the united states government.see victims protection act.as first enacted,the group of individuals eligible to receive these payments under the act was relatively small and,with five specific exceptions,did not include individuals,such as the hegnas,who obtained their judgments after july.see victims protection act,a a,stat,amended by tria c.payments under the act were not designed merely to supplement the plaintiffs recoveries on their judgments,but rather to replace them.the initial payments authorized by the vpa were equal to the amount of compensatory damages awarded in judgments,and the vpa required the recipients of those payments to relinquish both their rights and claims to compensatory damages and,depending on the size of the payment the recipient elected to receive,either their rights to punitive damages or their rights to execute against or attach certain properties owned by iran or cuba,respectively,in satisfaction of those damages.victims protection act a b d.
the victims protection act was amended substantially in november by section c of tria.see tria c,stat.first,section of tria expanded the group of judgment holders eligible for payments to include persons,like the hegnas,who filed suit against iran before october.see tria c amending victims protection act a a ii.second,in anticipation that the funds designated for payments under the victims protection act would not be sufficient to provide the judgment creditors with a payment in the full amount of their compensatory damages,the amendments directed the secretary to distribute the remaining funds to qualified judgment holders on a basis,based on the size of their respective compensatory damage awards.tria c amending victims protection act d.finally,because these payments were likely to be substantially smaller than the full amount of compensatory damages,the amendments no longer required recipients of payments under the act to relinquish their rights to pursue compensatory damages however,the act did require them to forego their rights and claims to punitive damages,as well as all rights to execute against or attach property that is at issue in claims against the united states before an international claims tribunal.tria c amending victims protection act d.
in this case,the hegna family attempted to satisfy their judgment against iran by pursuing both avenues of recovery.the hegnas first sought to recover on their judgment through the execution of iranian properties located in the united states.relying on the rights given them by section a of tria,the hegnas obtained writs of attachment upon judgment from the district court in the district of maryland on two bethesda,maryland properties owned by iran and in the possession of the united states district court order of december,issuing writs of attachment on both properties.pursuant to these writs of attachment,a united states marshal on the bethesda properties on may,and formally executed the writs by filing a return with the clerk office on june.butler tilghman.the district court quashed the writs at the motion of the united states on august,on the ground that the bethesda properties were not blocked assets under therefore not subject to attachment under the the properties were being used exclusively for diplomatic purposes,tria d b ii.hegna islamic republic of iran,d.
the hegnas were not willing to rest on the execution of the bethesda properties alone,however.in july the district court quashed the writs of attachment but after a marshal levied on the bethesda hegnas accepted a payment from the united states treasury represented by the government at argument to exceed under the victims protection act.see victims protection act d a as amended by tria c.as required by statute,by their receipt of the payment,the hegnas relinquished,all rights and claims to punitive damages awarded in connection with their judgment and,of critical relevance here,all rights to execute against or attach property that is at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal.see victims protection act d b as amended by tria c emphasis added hegna islamic republic of iran,d.
in this appeal,the hegnas challenge the district court order quashing the writs of attachment on the bethesda properties.w
