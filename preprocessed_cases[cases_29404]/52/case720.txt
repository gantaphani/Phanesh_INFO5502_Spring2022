van duc vo,a naturalized citizen fighting extradition to thailand,appeals an order of the district court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to.vo asserts that the crime with which he was charged was a political offense and thus not a valid basis for extradition under the terms of the extradition treaty between the united states and thailand.he also contends that the extradition court violated his due process rights by failing to make a finding whether he had been proceeded against under the terms of the treaty and by not denying his extradition on that ground.because we find that the crime with which vo was charged is not protected by the political offense exception and that vo arguments as to the proceeded against clause of the treaty do not present a claim that is cognizable on this appeal,we affirm the district court.
background 
a.the extradition process 
an extradition this case the magistrate very limited authority in the overall process of extradition.as we have explained,e xtradition is a matter of foreign policy entirely within the discretion of the executive branch,except to the extent that the statute interposes a judicial function.hood,cir citing in re metzger,how.extradition from the united states is initiated when the nation seeking extradition makes a request directly to the state department.blaxland commonwealth dir.of pub.prosecutions,cir.after the request has been evaluated by the state department to determine whether it is within the scope of the relevant extradition treaty,a united states attorney files a complaint in federal district court seeking an arrest warrant for the person sought to be extradited.id.upon the filing of a complaint,a judicial officer typically a magistrate judge issues a warrant for an individual sought for extradition,provided that an extradition treaty exists between the united states and the country seeking extradition and the crime charged is covered by the treaty.after the warrant issues,the judicial officer conducts a hearing to determine whether there is evidence sufficient to sustain the charge under the provisions of the proper treaty or convention,or,in other words,whether there is probable cause.
if the judicial officer determines that there is probable cause,he is required to certify the individual as extraditable to the secretary of state.blaxland,at emphasis added citing,at.after an extradition magistrate certifies that an individual can be extradited,it is the secretary of state,representing the executive branch,who ultimately decides whether to surrender the fugitive to the requesting country.see quinn robinson,cir the authority of a magistrate judge serving as an extradition judicial officer is thus limited to determining an individual eligibility to be extradited,which he does by ascertaining whether a crime is an extraditable offense under the relevant treaty and whether probable cause exists to sustain the charge.see prasoprat benov,cir blaxland,at quoting united states lui,cir.part of determining whether the offense is extraditable is examining whether it falls within the political offense exception.if it does,the individual is not eligible for extradition.quinn,at.
b.the extradition treaty 
the united states signed an extradition treaty with thailand in.three articles of the treaty are relevant to vo appeal.as is typical of many extradition treaties,the thai treaty contains a political offense exception.in article,the treaty provides that e xtradition shall not be granted when a the offense for which extradition is sought is a political offense or b it is established that extradition is requested for political purposes.treaty between the government of the united states of america and the government of the kingdom of thailand relating to extradition,lexis hereinafter treaty,at.two other articles in the treaty describe circumstances in which the requested state may choose to deny extradition.article states,t he requested state may refuse to extradite a person claimed for a crime which is requested by its laws provided it shall proceed against the person for that crime according to its laws.article states,e xtradition may be denied when the person sought is being or has been proceeded against in the requested state for the offense for which extradition is requested.
vo offense 
vo,a naturalized united states citizen who was born in vietnam,came to the united states in to escape the regime in his home country.vo belongs to the government of free vietnam gfvn,based in garden grove,california,which vo asserts is an organization deemed a terrorist entity by both vietnam and the united states.the stated purpose of the gfvn is to d ismantle the communist dictatorship of the socialist republic of vietnam by a peaceful,practical and persistent approach.although the gfvn insists that its activities are peaceful,its members have been linked to several incidents of terrorism in vietnam and elsewhere.
in,vo visited thailand.between june,and june,vo and an accomplice jointly devised a plan to plant explosives at the vietnamese embassy in bangkok.early in the morning of june,the anniversary of the formation of the south vietnamese army,vo and his accomplice met and,carrying two bags and one backpack,took a taxi to the embassy.on the way,vo took one bag and separated from the accomplice,but instructed the accomplice to take the remaining contained ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel,the explosive mixture known as anfo that was used in the oklahoma city implement their plan to bomb the embassy.at around,vo accomplice arrived at the vietnamese embassy in bangkok with the two packages.he placed one,a box containing approximately three kilograms of anfo,just outside the perimeter wall of the embassy,and threw the other,a backpack containing approximately five kilograms of the material,over the wall.the bombs included cell phones that were wired to function as triggers when called.subsequent investigation showed that vo accomplice called the cell phones connected to the bombs after he delivered them to the embassy,but that the bombs failed to detonate.vo flew to los angeles later that day.
shortly after the attempted bombing,thai police arrested vo accomplice,phan nguyen thanh si.in a statement to police investigators,si implicated vo as the organizer of the crime.si confession also associated the gfvn with the bombing attempt.further police investigation revealed that vo latent fingerprints were on some papers inside one of the packages,and that si and vo had been seen buying the cellular phones that were found connected to the bombs.although vo does not deny being involved in the bombing plot,there is some dispute over whether he intended the bombs to explode.vo claims that he decided at the last minute not to detonate the explosives,and,to that end,he had ensured that the detonators were removed and that the ignition match and the gunpowder were wet.he contends that he arranged for the planting of the bombs at the embassy only so that the repressive communist government of vietnam would be sent a message they would understand.however,si confession states that vo told him to ignite the bombs,and thai forensic examiners determined that the bombs were still capable of going off at the time they were found.it is undisputed that had the bombs exploded,they were powerful enough to kill or injure people within a meter approximately feet radius.
proceedings below 
vo was arrested in california in october,and he has been detained without bail ever since.initially,charges were brought against him in the central district of california for conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction outside the united states in violation of b.vo consented to an information instead of an indictment because he intended to plead guilty to the charge,but plea negotiations fell apart and a criminal trial was scheduled.however,in june,following the commencement of extradition proceedings,the attorney office,pursuant to a request from thailand,moved for dismissal of the criminal charge and the district court granted the motion.that month,the united states filed a complaint seeking an extradition arrest warrant for vo.the warrant was issued and vo,already in custody on the united states criminal charge,was arrested on that warrant.in august,the united states filed the formal complaint on behalf of the government of the kingdom of thailand seeking vo extradition pursuant to the extradition treaty between the two countries 
vo opposed his extradition on multiple grounds,including that the acts in question were not extraditable because they fell under the political offense exception to the treaty and he had been proceeded against by the united states and hence his extradition should have been denied under article of the treaty after an extradition hearing,the magistrate judge serving as the extradition court certified thailand request for extradition to the secretary of state.he found that vo had not met his burden of showing that the political offense doctrine applied to his crime.he also summarily rejected vo arguments that he was ineligible for extradition because he had been proceeded against in the united states.the magistrate judge concluded that he did not possess the authority to address that argument,as only the the deny extradition on the ground that vo had already been proceeded against.
vo then petitioned the district court for a stay of extradition and a writ of habeas corpus.in his claims relevant to this appeal,vo argued that the magistrate judge erred when he determined that the bomb plot was not protected by the political offense exception.he also reasserted his due process claim based on the magistrate judge failure to construe or apply article of the extradition treaty.the district court denied vo petition.the court ruled that the magistrate judge did not clearly err in finding that the uprising prong of the test for applying the political offense exception had not been met.as to the article claim,the court disagreed with the magistrate that the interpretation of that article rested solely with the executive branch.the district court held that interpretation of the phrase has been proceeded against in article is properly within the judiciary review.it concluded,however,that because the treaty gave the executive branch the ultimate discretion over whether or not to extradite someone who had met the requirements of that clause,the magistrate did not violate vo due process rights by not construing or applying article.the court made no ruling on whether vo had in fact been proceeded against.vo filed a timely appeal of the district court order.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the decision to certify an individual as extraditable can not be challenged on direct appeal.rather,a habeas petition is the only available avenue to challenge an extradition order.mainero gregg,cir.the district court habeas review of an extradition order is limited to whether the extradition magistrate had jurisdiction over the individual sought,the treaty was in force and the accused alleged offense fell within the treaty terms,and there is any competent evidence supporting the probable cause determination of the magistrate.id.at quinn,at.we have held that the political offense question is reviewable on habeas corpus as part of the question of whether the offense charged is within the treaty.id.at.this factor is a mixed question of law and fact.id.mixed questions are reviewed de novo,though we cautioned in quinn that if the determination is essentially factual it is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.id.citing united states mcconney,cir en banc.
iii.discussion 
vo appeal is limited to two issues.first,he claims that the bombing plot was a political offense,incidental to an uprising against the government of vietnam,and thus it is not a valid basis for extradition.second,he asserts that the magistrate judge denied him due process by failing to deny his extradition because he had been proceeded against in the united states or at the least by failing to make a determination whether he had been proceeded against.vo asserts that the magistrate judge was required to make the latter ruling in order to aid the secretary of state in the exercise of her discretionary authority.we reject these arguments and affirm the district court denial of vo petition.
a.the political offense doctrine 
the political offense doctrine covers two types of crimes.quinn,at.the first are relative political offenses,which are otherwise common crimes committed in connection with a political act,or common crimes committed for political motives or in a political context.id.at citations omitted alteration in original.for this type of crime,we use the incidence test to decide whether a crime falls under the political offense exception.id.the second are pure political offenses,such as treason,sedition,and espionage.id.at.because these crimes are by definition political,courts generally do not apply the incidence test to them.id.at.vo offense is of the first type,and thus the incidence test applies.
we explained the requirements of the incidence test in quinn,id.at,which this court,sitting en banc,recently reaffirmed in barapind enomoto,cir en banc per curiam.for a crime to qualify for the political offense exception under the incidence test,there must be the occurrence of an uprising or other violent political disturbance at the time of the charged offense,and a charged offense that is incidental to in the course of,or in furtherance of the uprising.quinn,at quoted in barapind,at internal citations omitted.
the uprising prong constitutes the critical part of the incidence test.see quinn,at i t is the uprising component that plays the key role in ensuring that the incidence test protects only those activities that the political offense doctrine was designed to protect.this prong has a number of facets that must be satisfied in order for an individual conduct to be protected by the political offense exception.first,a certain level of violence must exist for the uprising prong to be satisfied.id.at.second,the prong involves a geographic limitation.an uprising can occur only within the country or territory in which those rising up reside,and the charged offense must take place in that geographic area.id.at t he uprising component serves to exclude from coverage under the exception criminal conduct that occurs outside the country or territory in which the uprising is taking place.this limitation ensures that the political offense exception will not serve to protect international terrorism.id.at t he word uprising does not cover terrorism or other criminal conduct exported to other locations.third,the individual charged with the offense must be seeking to change the form of the government under which he live s.id.at.if the individual conduct does not meet these criteria,the individual does not qualify for the political offense exception because the level of violence in vietnam falls far short of that required to qualify as an uprising,we hold that vo offense is not protected by the political offense exception to the treaty.in the alternative,we hold that vo does not qualify for the exception because his conduct does not satisfy the geographic requirement of the uprising test.
a certain level of violence 
the degree of violence in vietnam at the time of vo conduct does not reach the level necessary to characterize it as an uprising.quinn described an uprising as synonymous with rebellion or revolution and involving a certain level of violence.at.the term does not apply to political acts that involve less fundamental efforts to accomplish change or that do not attract sufficient adherents to create the requisite amount of turmoil.id.rather,an uprising refers to a people rising up,in their own land,against the government of that land.id.at.
the application of this facet of the uprising prong in other cases clearly demonstrates that the degree of violence in vietnam at the time of the offense did not reach the level of an uprising.in quinn,we held that an uprising occurred in northern ireland because there had been a number of bombing campaigns during a very long and frequently violent period of conflict between irish nationalists and the united kingdom.id.at noting the provisional irish republican army,of which quinn was a member,advocated armed insurrection.more recently,we found that t ens of thousands of deaths and casualties as sikh nationalists clashed with government officers and sympathizers in punjab constituted s ubstantial violence sufficient to rise to the level of an uprising.barapind,at.similarly,a continuing clash between indigenous people and police in northern canada that was not just an isolated violent disturbance but part of a long history of struggle between native people and the government of canada was found to constitute an uprising.united states pitawanakwat,d,other courts analyzing the uprising prong have looked for endemic and widespread violence.ahmad wigen,aff,cir holding that violence against israeli settlers in the west bank,before the intifada of the,was not an uprising.the analysis in these cases shows that in order to constitute an uprising,a conflict must involve either some short period of intense bloodshed or an accumulation of violent incidents over a long period of time.barapind,at quinn,at.
the burden of proving the existence of a campaign against the vietnamese government that involves sufficient violence to rise to the level of an uprising is on vo,the party presenting an affirmative defense to extradition vo has not met this burden.in support of his claim that an uprising exists in vietnam,vo cites the thousands of signatures on a petition for his freedom as evidence of a war between the gfvn and vietnam.he claims that gfvn members have been murdered and imprisoned for their actions,and points to a handful of attacks against the vietnamese government that gfvn has attempted or carried out.he further notes that vietnam consider s vo a terrorist.the exhibits that vo has presented are not particularly convincing.furthermore,even if we construe all the evidence in his favor,vo still can not show a sustained and widespread degree of violence that rises to the level of an uprising.the sum of a few skirmishes with the police,coupled with a handful of explosions and bombing attempts around the pacific rim and a keen desire to see the downfall of the communist regime in his native land,does not amount to an uprising.because the events relied on by vo do not reach the necessary level of violence,he can not meet this critical component of the uprising prong.thus,his conduct is not protected by the political offense exception.
the territory of the uprising 
even were we to consider the level of violence in vietnam at the time of vo conduct sufficient to constitute an uprising,vo still would not qualify for the political offense exception because his crime did not occur within the country or territory in which those rising up reside,as required by the incidence test.quinn,at.
vo offers two different arguments in support of his contention that he satisfies the geographic requirement of the uprising prong.first,vo argues that under quinn,the territorial restriction of the incidence test need not be strictly applied.vo places great weight on language in quinn that he characterizes as a savings clause.the portion of quinn on which vo relies states that w hile determining the proper geographic boundaries of an uprising involves a legal issue that ordinarily will be fairly simple to resolve,there may be some circumstances under which it will be more difficult to do so.we need not formulate a general rule that will be applicable to all situations.at.vo argues that in light of this alleged savings clause,the symbolic nature of both the attack location the embassy and its timing the anniversary of the founding of the south vietnamese army make it unreasonable to consider the attack to be geographically barred.as his second argument,vo asserts that he can satisfy even the strictest construction of the geographic requirement because the vietnamese embassy was the target of his attack and thus the crime occurred in vietnam.we reject both of vo arguments.
vo essentially proposes that this court construe the incidence test uprising prong as containing an amorphous exception to the geographic requirement that permits extradition courts in their discretion to deem the requirement satisfied even though the criminal act alleged occurs outside the boundaries of the state against which the uprising is directed.such an expansive interpretation of the geographic requirement,however,is expressly precluded by the text of quinn.there,we explained that 
the term uprising refers to a revolt by indigenous people against their own government or an occupying power.that revolt can occur only within the country or territory in which those rising up reside.by definition acts occurring in other lands are not part of the uprising.
quinn,at emphasis added.as this explanation makes clear,offenses that occur outside the geographic boundaries of the country or territory in which those rising up reside can not be considered part of an uprising for the purpose of the political offense exception.
the savings clause that vo relies on is not to the contrary.the potential difficulty in determining the proper geographic boundaries of an uprising,refers to the challenge a court faces when an offense for which extradition is sought occurs in territory the legal status of which is unclear,including territory allegedly occupied by the requesting state as opposed to within its formal borders.in that circumstance,the boundaries of the occupation are not fixed and may shift frequently,requiring the court to make the sometimes difficult determination whether the territory in which the offense occurred is in fact occupied 
not only does vo interpretation of the geographic requirement of the uprising prong conflict with the text of quinn,it conflicts with the requirement underlying purpose as well.as we have previously noted,the territorial limitation on the uprising prong plays a critical role in the political offense ensures that the political offense exception is not used to allow international terrorists to escape prosecution or to encourage the spread of civil insurrections to neighboring states.id.at vo construction of the territorial restriction would extend the scope of the political offense exception to cover many acts of international terrorism.under vo understanding of the geographic requirement of the uprising prong,an offense that is sufficiently symbolic in terms of either its location or its not occur in the country or territory of an uprising to be protected by the political offense exception.as many acts of international terrorism are committed for their symbolism including the september,attacks on the world trade center and often meet the other requirements of the incidence test,vo interpretation would allow such acts to be covered by the political offense what the geographic limitation of the uprising prong is designed to prevent.similarly,the requirement is intended to prevent the use of the political offense exception by those seeking to spread internal conflicts to neighboring countries and thus to turn civil insurrections into regional conflicts.the essence of the exception is to protect against extradition those trying to change their own government by actions within their own territory accordingly,we reject vo effort to create a discretionary exception to the territorial component of the political offense exception.
we also reject vo claim that when an offense is committed in another nation against the embassy of the country in which an uprising is occurring,the uprising prong geographic requirement is met,even though the offense is committed outside of the borders of the country that is the object of the insurrection.we also reaffirm what we said in quinn in order to satisfy the geographic requirement of the incidence test uprising prong,an offense must occur within the geographic borders of the nation at which the uprising is directed or within its occupied territory.id.at.the geographic requirement is not satisfied when an offense occurs on property owned or controlled by that nation that is located within the geographic borders of another state.because vo committed the offense outside the territorial bou
