we address the reach of the convention for the unification of certain rules relating to international transportation by air,stat,reprinted in note following the warsaw convention or the convention,which applies to international,not domestic,air transportation.we hold that the warsaw convention does not apply to an airport security company rendering services to both international and domestic air passengers nor does it apply to airlines that did not provide international air carriage to the plaintiff.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.

dazo filed this action against globe and the airlines,asserting claims for negligence and breach of the implied contract of bailment.she also sought punitive damages based on defendants alleged wilful misconduct.
globe filed a motion to dismiss dazo complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.in its motion,which the airlines joined,globe argued that dazo state law claims were preempted by the warsaw convention.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss dazo complaint,holding that the theft occurred while dazo was in the course of embarking,and,therefore,that the warsaw convention preempted her claims.the court also held that dazo allegations of wilful misconduct were insufficient to escape the convention limitation on liability.the district court granted dazo leave to file an amended complaint in conformity with its ruling,but entered judgment in defendants favor after dazo informed the court that she did not wish to file an amended complaint.dazo then filed this timely appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

the warsaw convention is an international treaty governing the liability of air carriers engaged in the international transportation of passengers and cargo.the convention creates a presumption of air carrier liability but,in turn,substantially limits that liability.ins.of am.fed.express,cir.the convention purpose is to create a uniform body of law governing the rights and responsibilities of passengers and air carriers in international air transportation.maugnie compagnie nationale air france,cir.it was intended to protect the international air transportation industry,which was in its beginning stages at the time the convention was drafted.see also carey united airlines,cir describing the belief that limitations on liability would promote the development of the fledgling commercial air industry by allowing the airlines to predict their exposure to monetary damages quoting in re korean air lines disaster of,mccarthy northwest airlines,cir stating that the convention arose out of a perceived need to provide a fledgling industry with a uniform set of legal rules that would govern accidents occurring in international air travel.the convention caps the liability of carriers,but it does not define that term.see warsaw convention,art.as regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself,the liability of the carrier shall be limited to francs per passenger.see also id.carrier liability to passengers id.carrier liability for checked baggage and goods.
the warsaw convention applies to all international transportation of persons,baggage,or goods performed by aircraft for hire.id.it defines international transportation in part as any transportation in which,according to the contract made by the parties,the place of departure and the place of destination,whether or not there be a break in the transportation or a transshipment,are situated within the territories of two high contracting parties.id.therefore,dazo flight would be considered an internaional flight for purposes of the convention,even though she was traveling first to louis,and only then to toronto.
the district court held that dazo state law claims were preempted by the warsaw convention because dazo was in the course of embarking,relying on language found in article of the convention and on baker lansdell protective agency.the district court noted that the warsaw convention applies only to carriers,but concluded that it applied to globe because it has been extended to agents of carriers,citing kabbani int l total.the facts of this case,however,do not support a finding that globe is a carrier for warsaw convention purposes.
it is undisputed that globe was operating the security checkpoint on behalf of all three air carriers and therefore was acting as the common agent of all three airlines at the time of the theft it is also undisputed that only one of the three carriers actually provided the international carriage to toronto furthermore,both domestic and international passengers for all three airlines had to pass through the security checkpoint,as did who merely wanted to access the gates or retail establishments beyond the checkpoint.globe was conducting a security check that every airline must perform under federal law,regardless of whether the flight being boarded is a domestic or international flight,or whether the person being screened is boarding any flight at all.
from these facts,it does not follow that globe is a warsaw convention carrier.the services being rendered by globe were not in furtherance of the contract of carriage of an international flight,but were basic airport security services required at all airports by domestic federal law,regardless of the flights destination and regardless,in fact,of whether the person being screened was even a passenger.see.these security screenings are not required by the warsaw convention.thus,the warsaw convention does not apply to this case 
dazo case is distinguishable from those cases extending warsaw convention carrier status to agents of the airline providing the international carriage.none of those cases involves extending carrier status to a company that was a dual agent of more than one airline,including an airline with convention status.for example,reed wiser,cir simply involved the airline own employees.see id.at.in re air disaster at lockerbie,scotland,involved a security company that was a subsidiary of the airline involved.see id.at.kabbani and baker each involved,as far as the record shows,a security company that was the agent exclusively of the air carrier involved.see kabbani.at baker.at.thus,no case supports the proposition that a security company that is acting as the common agent of multiple airlines,domestic and international,and providing basic airport security services mandated by federal law,regardless of whether the flight involved is domestic or international,should be accorded carrier status under the warsaw convention simply because the perso
