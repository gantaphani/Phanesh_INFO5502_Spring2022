a core issue in an adversary proceeding in this chapter bankruptcy case was also an issue in an international arbitration to be conducted in england.the bankruptcy court denied a motion to compel arbitration,refused to stay the adversary proceeding,and enjoined participation in the arbitration,all because the arbitration would have seriously interfered with the debtor efforts to reorganize.we,like the district court,affirm.
white mountain mining company,white mountain,a limited liability company organized under the laws of florida,was engaged in the coal mining business in southern west virginia.as of december,white mountain was owned by joseph phillips,a west virginia coal operator,and arquebuse trust,a private trust wholly owned by phillips.in january phillips and arquebuse trust sold a fifty percent interest in white mountain to white trust,a foreign investment trust,for million.the parties executed three documents in connection with the sale a sale agreement between the two sellers and the buyer an operating agreement between white mountain,white trust,and arquebuse trust to govern white mountain operations and a letter dated january,the january letter,signed by white trust and white mountain to clarify certain matters prior to the closing.following the sale white trust assigned its interest in white mountain to congelton,a west virginia limited liability company phillips and arquebuse trust assigned their interest in white mountain to mowbray,a company wholly owned by phillips.
the operating agreement and the sale agreement contain arbitration clauses.the operating agreement requires that each claim,dispute or controversy of whatever nature,arising out of,in connection with,or in relation to the interpretation,performance or breach of this agreement or any other agreement contemplated by or related to this agreement shall be settled,at the request of any party to this agreement,by final and binding arbitration conducted in the city of london,united kingdom in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules then in effect of the international arbitration association.the sale agreement provides that disputes will be resolved in accordance with the arbitration provisions of the operating agreement as if set out herein.phillips is a party to the sale agreement,so he is bound by the arbitration provisions.
the agreements aside,white phillips in operations at an underground mine in may.unfavorable geological conditions,which led to major roof falls,made mining extremely difficult.the mine was forced to shut down in november.between january and june phillips advanced over million of his own money to white mountain,which was used to meet expenses.congelton was warned that without additional funds or outside financing the company would have no choice,but to pursue the protection of federal bankruptcy.
congelton took the position that phillips had misrepresented white mountain prospects and financial condition in order to induce white trust to buy of the company.in addition,congelton maintained that phillips was obligated under the sale agreement to ensure the adequacy of white mountain capitalization.thus,congelton claimed that phillips advances to white mountain were contributions to capital,and phillips claimed that the advances were loans pursuant to a provision in the january letter.the january letter provides if white mountain requires additional advances over the amount that was originally stated in the budgets and proforma sic,phillips will advance the company the money and will be repaid for these advances after the company begins operations.in november,as a result of this dispute,congelton and white trust served phillips,arquebuse trust,and mowbray with a demand for arbitration,to be conducted in london.in their august,statement of claim in the arbitration congelton and white trust sought,among other forms of relief,an award declaring that advances made by phillips to white mountain should be treated as contributions to capital rather than as loans.
in the meantime,on june,phillips filed an involuntary chapter bankruptcy petition against white mountain in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of west virginia.two weeks later phillips initiated an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court against white mountain,mowbray,and congelton.in the complaint phillips sought a determination that white mountain was indebted to him in the amount of for funds advanced by way of loans,and that he was not obligated to advance additional money to white mountain pursuant to the january letter.in response to the complaint,congelton moved the bankruptcy court to compel phillips to submit his claims to arbitration in london and to stay or dismiss the adversary proceeding.the bankruptcy court denied congelton motion and enjoined it from prosecuting the pending arbitration.the court reasoned that because phillips complaint sought a determination that he is owed money by the debtor,it entailed a core proceeding under b b.moreover,the proceeding presented issues that were critical to white mountain ability to formulate a plan of reorganization.the arbitration,the court said,clearly sought a determination of claims against white mountain as well as a determination of the extent of equity holders in the entity.thus,the core proceeding trumped the arbitration,according to the bankruptcy court.
congelton appealed the bankruptcy court order denying arbitration to the district court,and both courts denied motions for a stay pending appeal.the bankruptcy court held a trial in the adversary proceeding and determined that phillips advance of million to white mountain was a loan made pursuant to the january letter and that phillips was not obligated to make further advances.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court.congelton now appeals to this court,arguing that the bankruptcy and district courts erred in failing to enforce the arbitration agreement,the bankruptcy court was divested of jurisdiction to try the adversary proceeding once congelton appealed the denial of arbitration to the district court,and the injunction against the london arbitration was invalid because it was overly broad.we review de novo the conclusions of law reached by the district and bankruptcy courts,and we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error.tavenner smoot,cir.
congelton first argues that the bankruptcy and district courts erred in failing to enforce the international arbitration agreement against phillips.there is a strong federal policy in favor of arbitration,see moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d,and the arbitration act calls for the enforcement of valid arbitration agreements,see.this federal policy applies with special force in the field of international commerce,mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,d,because the united states has acceded to the convention on recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards the convention,december.the convention is implemented in this country through the arbitration act,et any order to arbitrate in this case would be based on the convention because white trust,one of the parties to the arbitration agreement,is a foreign investment trust with a swiss trustee.see id.
the convention provides that t he court of a contracting state shall,at the request of one of the parties to an arbitration agreement,refer the parties to arbitration,unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void,inoperative,or incapable of being performed.convention,art.ii,para.congelton argues that the convention plain language requires enforcement of the arbitration agreement in this case.the issue is much more complicated than congelton suggests because the convention contemplates exceptions to arbitrability grounded in domestic law.mitsubishi,at.thus,congress may reserve certain categories of claims for decision by our own courts without contravening this nation obligations under the convention.id.if congress did intend to limit or prohibit waiver of a judicial forum for a particular claim,such an intent will be deducible from the statute text or legislative history,or from an inherent conflict between arb
