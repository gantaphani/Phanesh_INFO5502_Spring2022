artur tchibassa,a former member of the angolan front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda flec,appeals his conviction stemming from his participation in the for ransom of brent swan,a united states citizen then working in cabinda,angola.tchibassa appeals his conviction on the grounds that the government violated his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial by waiting until,some eleven years after he was indicted,to arrest and prosecute him and that the court erred under federal rule of evidence b in admitting testimony of a similar flec in and excluding testimony of flec hostage negotiations that he participated in in and.in addition,tchibassa appeals his sentence on the ground that the district court treated the united states sentencing guidelines guidelines as mandatory in violation of united states booker,d.we reject tchibassa speedy trial claim because the government exercised reasonable diligence in seeking his arrest and because tchibassa,who was aware of the charges against him since at least,waited until after his arrest to assert his speedy trial right we reject the evidentiary challenges because,assuming the district court rulings were erroneous,the error was harmless.finally,we affirm tchibassa sentence because we conclude that the sentencing judge did not commit plain error.
in brent swan was working as an aircraft mechanic in cabinda,a province of angola,for petroleum helicopters,phi.phi was a contractor for cabinda gulf oil company,a subsidiary of chevron overseas petroleum,chevron,a united states corporation.on october,while traveling in a truck en route to the cabinda airport,swan was abducted by three men wearing camouflage uniforms.swan captors,who identified themselves as flec members,forced swan on a trek on foot to a flec base camp where he remained until moved to a second camp.
following extensive negotiations between flec and chevron,on december,swan was taken by his captors to zaire now the democratic republic of the congo droc,where he met a zairean government official who was accompanied by a number of flec officers,including tchibassa.from there he was driven to moanda,zaire and released to phi foreign supervisor gary weber and chevron executive scott taylor in exchange for a ransom.
substantial trial evidence implicated tchibassa as a member of flec and a willing participant in swan abduction,detention and ransoming.tchibassa was described by one of swan captors as a major member of flec,tr,and was pictured alongside swan,flec president tiburcio and major bento in a photograph taken around thanksgiving at the camp where he was being held.during the negotiations for swan release,according to chevron negotiators,tchibassa participated as the chief spokesman and did all the primary speaking as negotiator.tr.tr.in an order signed by tiburcio authorizing tchibassa to negotiate on behalf of flec,tchibassa was identified as major artur tchibassa and flec foreign affairs secretary.tr.finally,after the negotiators reached an agreement with chevron requiring chevron to deliver a ransom in specified goods in exchange for swan release,tchibassa was one of two men who signed receipts for the goods when they were delivered.
on september,tchibassa was indicted under seal on two counts conspiring to commit in violation of and and in violation of and.a bench warrant issued for his arrest the same day.on july,he was arrested in kinshasa,droc.his trial began on september,and the jury convicted him of both counts on september.on february,the district court sentenced tchibassa to concurrent sentences of months on the conspiracy count and months on the hostage taking count,followed by three and five years of supervised release,respectively.the court also ordered tchibassa to pay in restitution and a special assessment.tchibassa filed a timely notice of appeal.
we address separately tchibassa challenges to the district court speedy trial right determination,evidentiary rulings and guidelines sentence.
speedy trial right 
the sixth amendment to the united states constitution expressly guarantees that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy trial.excessive delay in prosecuting a defendant after he is indicted or arrested violates this sixth amendment right.see barker wingo,d arrest doggett united states,d indictment.tchibassa contends that the nearly years that elapsed between his september,indictment and his arrest on july,constitute an excessive delay and that the district court therefore erred in denying his motion to dismiss on that basis.we affirm the district court denial of the motion.
in deciding a speedy trial claim a court applies a balancing test,in which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are sic weighed.barker,at.the united states supreme court has identified four factors to be considered l ength of delay,the reason for the delay,the defendant assertion of his right,and prejudice to the defendant.see also doggett,at.our cases have qualified the literal sweep of the speedy trial provision by specifically recognizing the relevance of four separate enquiries whether delay before trial was uncommonly long,whether the government or the criminal defendant is more to blame for that delay,whether,in due course,the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial,and whether he suffered prejudice as the delay result.citing barker,at.the first factor entails a double enquiry first,s imply to trigger a speedy trial analysis,an accused must allege that the interval between accusation and trial has crossed the threshold dividing ordinary from presumptively prejudicial delay since,by definition,he can not complain that the government has denied him a speedy trial if it has,in fact,prosecuted his case with customary promptness.doggett,at.quoting barker,at.next,once the accused makes this threshold showing,the court must then consider,as one factor among several,the extent to which the delay stretches beyond the bare minimum needed to trigger judicial examination of the claim.id.at.citing barker,at.none of the four factors is either a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial r ather,they are related factors and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.barker,at.
in order to balance the speedy trial factors,on august,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing.the testimony from that hearing,supplemented by the parties written submissions,revealed the following facts.tchibassa testified that he resided in kinshasa,zaire from to and in brazzaville,congo,located across the congo river from kinshasa,from april until his arrest in.the government filed a sealed arrest warrant for tchibassa on september,and subsequently requested that interpol issue red notices seeking his arrest along with the arrest of other alleged participants in the swan,which interpol did in 
in tchibassa learned that interpol wished to speak with him and,accordingly,traveled to brazzaville,congo to meet with interpol representatives,who questioned him about swan abduction.according to a transcription of tchibassa statement to interpol at the meeting,he expressed surprise at learning that,in his own words,american judicial authorities issue sic an international arrest warrant for me for this case.interpol interview tr,appellant app.app.also in,according to tchibassa testimony,he visited the embassy in kinshasa,zaire more than times for diplomatic activities,tr,and continued to visit the embassy m ore than five times annually until,id.at.he also testified he visited the embassies in lisbon in and paris in.
in the united states department of state state department learned tchibassa had been in brazzaville and,at the instance of the united states department of justice,cabled the embassy there to request that the congolese government make provisional arrests for the purpose of extradition of tchibassa and others charged with swan kidnaping.app.
finally,on july,the fbi arrested tchibassa in the office of the droc intelligence bureau and he was flown to puerto rico where he was arraigned on july.on april,he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,asserting his sixth amendment speedy trial right.
at a november,hearing the district court denied tchibassa motion based on the parties submissions and the hearing testimony.initially,the court determined that the delay between indictment and arrest obviously was long so as to trigger the balancing of the barker factors.tr.with regard to the second factor,the court found that the delay resulted not only from the government not arresting him once they had indicted him originally back in but from the defendant own actions because at the time in the country where he was residing and was a citizen of,meaning,they did not have an extradition treaty.id.at.absent a treaty,the court concluded,the government was under no obligation to take any extraordinary measures to negotiate for tchibassa extradition.the court found the third factor also weighed against dismissal because,although tchibassa was aware of the charges against him since june,he did not assert his speedy trial right until nine months after he was arrested in.finally,as to the fourth factor,the court characterized tchibassa claim of prejudice as speculative because the court d id see any defense strategies or positions that would have been different except for the delay or any particular witnesses he did bring that he could have.id.at.in sum,the court concluded that the record strongly indicates that the defendant did not want a speedy trial and that the government had no either sic obligation or opportunity to make arrest or get tchibassa extradited to the united states because of the political situation and the statutory requirements that existed at that time.id.at.we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its application of the barker factors to the facts de novo.see united states parish,factual findings reviewed for clear error citing jackson united states,united states wallace,cir legal conclusions reviewed de novo burkett fulcomer,cir same see also united states frye,cir suggesting,without deciding,review is de novo because generally,a district court balancing of factors,resulting in a decision,are sic akin to,if not,conclusions of law,or at least rulings on mixed questions of fact and law,reviewed de novo.applying these standards,we uphold the district court ruling because its factual findings are not clearly erroneous and it correctly applied the law to the facts it found.
initially,the parties agree that the district court correctly concluded that the length of the delay between tchibassa indictment and eleven long enough to be considered presumptively prejudicial,beyond the point at which courts deem the delay unreasonable enough to trigger the barker enquiry.doggett,at.barker,at.undertaking inquiry where length of delay between arrest and over five extraordinary doggett,at.t he extraordinary year lag between doggett indictment and arrest clearly suffices to trigger the speedy trial enquiry.
we next address barker second factor whether the government or the criminal defendant is more to blame for that delay,doggett,at.initially,the government was decidedly slow to seek tchibassa arrest.it does not appear from the record that it made any attempt to apprehend tchibassa from the time he was indicted on september,until interpol issued the red notices sometime in.this gap of more than two years casts some doubt on the government diligence and might,under other circumstances,tip the balance against it.here,however,the district court found that tchibassa was more to blame than the government for the initial delay because he maintained his residence in zaire,beyond the government diplomatic reach,and this finding is not clearly erroneous subsequently,when the government learned in that tchibassa had been sighted outside brazzaville,congo in cabled its brazzaville embassy to request that the congolese government,with which the united states had an extradition treaty in force,effect his arrest.the congolese government,however,did not do so even after tchibassa moved to brazzaville in,notwithstanding the red notices were in effect until at least while the government might have undertaken more frequent and extensive efforts to secure tchibassa arrest,it is not clear that any such effort would have succeeded so long as tchibassa voluntarily remained beyond the united states legal or practical reach thus,the district court did not clearly err in finding that the government had no opportunity to make arrest sic or get tchibassa extradited to the united states.tr.we therefore agree with the district court that the second factor weighs against tchibassa because the fault for the delay in arrest lay primarily with tchibassa himself.in this respect,the delay between tchibassa indictment and arrest differs significantly from the situation in doggett,in which the supreme court found the defendant speedy trial right had been violated.
in doggett the defendant fled to colombia,south america shortly after he was indicted on federal drug charges.after a brief incarceration in panama,he was released to colombia and he returned to the united states about years after the indictment.he settled in the commonwealth of virginia where he lived openly under his own name for six years before the government discovered him through a credit check and then made the arrest.the supreme court,upholding the district court finding that the government was not diligent,concluded that the second barker factor weighed heavily in doggett favor because f or six years,the government investigators made no serious effort to test their progressively more questionable assumption that doggett was living abroad,and,had they done so,they could have found him within minutes.at.here,the record does not indicate authorities had any opportunity to readily apprehend tchibassa.the delay in arresting tchibassa was attributable primarily to his continued residence in an area over which the united states had no control and little influence.the second factor therefore favors the government.
for similar reasons,the third barker defendant invocation of the speedy trial the government as well.the district court found that,notwithstanding tchibassa knew of the charges against him at least since the time of his meeting with interpol,he made no effort to assert his speedy trial right until he filed a motion to dismiss on april,nine months after his arrest.tchibassa disputes that he was aware of the charges before his arrest but the district court contrary finding,based on the interpol transcription,is not clearly erroneous tchibassa may not have known that a formal indictment had even that one was if he was aware that charges were pending against him as the district court reasonably found he was,his failure to make any effort to secure a timely trial on them and his apparent desire to avoid one manifests a total disregard for his speedy trial right.thus,in this respect too,tchibassa situation differs from doggett,whose claim of ignorance of the charges against him was unrebutted and largely substantiated.at.the doggett court expressly noted that,if it were true,as the government suggested contrary to the record,that doggett knew of his indictment years before he was arrested,barker third factor,concerning invocation of the right to a speedy trial,would be weighed heavily against him.id.at.because the record supports the district court finding that tchibassa knew of all of the charges contained in the sealed indictment as early as,the third factor also weighs against his speedy trial claim.
finally,the fourth barker from nothing to advance tchibassa speedy trial claim.u nreasonable delay between formal accusation and trial threatens to produce more than one sort of harm,including oppressive pretrial incarceration,anxiety and concern of the accused,and the possibility that the accused defense will be impaired by dimming memories and loss of exculpatory evidence.doggett,at.quoting barker,at.the first two listed harms are of no significance here as tchibassa was not imprisoned until after his arrest and he displayed no concern over the years about the pending criminal charges,in fact denying he was
