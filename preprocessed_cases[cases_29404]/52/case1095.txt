korea water resources corporation korea water appeals from a summary judgment in favor of chong sung lee.korea water obtained a provisionally enforceable money judgment against lee from a trial court in korea,and then brought an action in california for recognition of the korean judgment and to obtain an attachment on lee assets in san diego county.the california superior court initially ordered issuance of the attachment and stayed the california recognition action pending the outcome of appellate proceedings in korea.after the korea supreme court rejected the tort theory of liability underlying the korean judgment and remanded the case to a lower appellate court for further proceedings,the california superior court granted lee motion for summary judgment and discharged the attachment.
code of civil procedure section et sets forth conditions for california recognition and enforcement of foreign money judgments.section states this chapter applies to any foreign judgment that is final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered even though an appeal therefrom is pending or it is subject to appeal.italics added.the issue presented in this appeal is the meaning of section requirement that a foreign judgment must be final and conclusive and enforceable in the foreign country to support a claim for recognition of the judgment in california.
preliminarily,given that section allows recognition actions notwithstanding pending appeals,we reject lee argument that the meaning of the phrase final and conclusive and enforceable should be determined by a provision in the korea code of civil procedure defining final and conclusive as meaning the appellate process is terminated.nevertheless,we hold that because the korea supreme court ruling removed the legal underpinning that supported the judgment and the judgment is no longer based on a calculated damages amount,the judgment is not conclusive in korea within the meaning of section.accordingly,summary judgment in lee favor was proper.
background 
california summary judgment in lee favor 
korea court system includes a district court that conducts the initial trial,an appellate court called a high court that provides appellate review and conducts trials de novo including the taking of evidence,and a supreme court that reviews questions of law.korea code civ,articles.
korea water filed a complaint against lee in korea based on lee conduct of burying industrial wastes in land subsequently sold to korea water without notifying korea water of the defect.korea water complaint alleged liability premised on four theories warranty due to defects breach of contract due to the delivery of defective property or failure to notify of defects tort based on the deceitful conduct of hiding and failing to notify the buyer of the defects and tort based on the duty to indemnify for the costs caused by the illegal act of dumping wastes.
in april,korea water obtained a judgment from a korea district court against lee.the korea district court ordered lee to pay korea water billion korean won the equivalent of approximately million dollars for the cost of disposing of the wastes.the korea district court judgment provided that the judgment may be provisionally executed.
on may,lee appealed the korea district court judgment to the high court.on february,after conducting a trial de novo,the high court entered a judgment affirming the district court judgment.
both the district and high court judgments were premised on the fourth theory of liability,tort based on the duty to indemnify for an illegal act the district and high courts did not rule on the other three theories of liability raised by korea water.
on february,after unsuccessful efforts to fully enforce the judgment in korea,korea water filed a recognition action in california,seeking a california judgment for the money owed under the korean judgment.thereafter,korea water successfully applied to the california superior court for a writ of attachment to secure its claim for money.on may,the california superior court ordered issuance of the requested writ of attachment on lee residence and bank accounts in san diego county.
in the meantime,lee had appealed the high court judgment to the korea supreme court.on december,lee moved for summary judgment in the california recognition action,arguing that because the judgment was currently on appeal before the korea supreme court,it was not final and conclusive and enforceable in korea so as to allow for recognition in california.the superior court denied lee summary judgment motion because of lee failure to provide sufficient information for the court to determine the applicable korean law.the court noted that the parties disputed what constituted a final and conclusive and enforceable judgment in korea,and stated it would ascertain the meaning of korean law at trial after hearing expert testimony.in april,the california court stayed the recognition proceeding but not the writ of attachment for purposes of awaiting the korea supreme court ruling.
in january,lee advised the california court that the korea supreme court had rejected the tort basis of liability relied upon in the high court and district court judgments.accordingly,the korea supreme court had canceled the high court judgment and remanded the case to the high court for retrial.based on the korea supreme court ruling,lee again moved for summary judgment.
in may,the superior court granted lee summary judgment motion,reasoning that because the korea supreme court had rejected the legal theory of liability on which the judgment was based,it was no longer clear there was a viable legal theory under korean law that could support the judgment.accordingly,the superior court concluded the korean judgment was not final and conclusive and enforceable for purposes of allowing recognition in california.after the grant of summary judgment in lee favor,the superior court ordered discharge of the attachment and release of the levied property.
b.the korea supreme court decision and high court reduction of the amount of the provisional execution order 
the korea supreme court reviewed both the high court factual findings and its legal conclusion that lee illegal dumping on the land constituted a tort requiring lee to compensate korea water for the damage incurred in removing the wastes.the korea supreme court ruled that,contrary to lee arguments,the high court factual findings were,that lee surreptitiously and illegally dumped industrial wastes into a huge pit and covered them with sand for concealment.however,the korea supreme court rejected the high court ruling that lee as a wrongdoer,who illegally dumped the wastes onto the land at issue,is liable for damage incurred to korea water in removing the wastes.
the korea supreme court stated that setting aside korea water assertion that dumping of the wastes onto the land constitutes a defect,lee act of dumping the wastes into the land which was his own property at that time does not constitute a tort because it was an act toward lee himself,not toward any other third party.the korea supreme court reasoned that the fact that lee dumped the wastes onto the land in which he then had ownership does not constitute an illegal act against korea water who gained ownership of the land afterwards.
the korea supreme court concluded that the high court misunderstood the applicable tort principles,and accordingly decided to cancel the judgment of the appellate court and to remand this case to the appellate court for retrial.although the korea supreme court noted that korea water had alleged other theories of liability,it rendered no opinion regarding these claims.
following remand,the high court issued an order providing that the execution pursuant to the provisional execution order shall be suspended to the amount exceeding billion korean won without the requirement of a bond deposit until the judgment by this court 
experts opinions 
both parties submitted expert declarations regarding their interpretation of korean law and the import of the korea supreme court ruling.to support a conclusion that the judgment was final and conclusive and enforceable,korea water experts emphasized that the korea supreme court had not rejected the high court factual findings,the judgment was still provisionally enforceable,and the judgment could be sustained on other legal theories.in contrast,lee experts opined the judgment was not final and conclusive and enforceable,focusing on the korea supreme court rejection of the tort theory of liability underlying the judgment,the reduction in the amount of the provisional execution order,and the uncertainty that a factual or legal basis for liability would be found by the high court.
more specifically,an expert for korea water stressed that the korea supreme court decision did not find any error in the lower courts factual findings,and opined that the decision did not in any way find that lee is not responsible to korea water for his apparent illegal activities it simply corrects the mistake of the high court in relying on a wrong legal theory to reach the result,and orders the high court to consider other legal theories at retrial.korea water experts also stated that the remand order did not affect korea water right to execute on lee assets up to billion korean won,and thus korea water judgment was still enforceable.according to korea water experts,enforceability was the most important test for determining whether a judgment was final and conclusive in korea.thus,the experts opined that because the judgment was still enforceable,korea water judgment was also final and conclusive.
to support a contrary position,lee experts underscored the fact that the district court and high court judgments were based solely on the rejected tort theory of liability.an expert opined that even though the judgment of the district court will remain technically intact during the pendency of the appellate retrial in the high court,the district court judgment could not be adopted by the high court because the tort basis of the district court judgment had been rejected by the korea supreme court.further,the expert explained that at retrial before the high court,the parties would be entitled to present additional or new facts and legal theories,and the high court was not precluded from rejecting the earlier factual finding against lee.

we review the granting of a summary judgment motion de novo to determine if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.zavala arce th,d.
california foreign recognition act 
california adoption of the uniform foreign recognition act allows california courts to recognize and enforce foreign money judgments.the chapter applies to any foreign judgment that is final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered even though an appeal therefrom is pending or it is subject to appeal.section provides that,with certain statutorily defined exceptions a foreign judgment meeting the requirements of section is conclusive between the parties to the extent that it grants or denies recovery of a sum of money.the foreign judgment is enforceable in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state which is entitled to full faith and credit,except that it may not be enforced pursuant to the provisions of chapter commencing with section of this title.
section,which is not applicable to foreign judgments,provides for the entry of a california judgment based on a sister state judgment.the law revision commission comment to section explains that a holder of a foreign judgment may not apply for immediate entry of the judgment in california,but instead must bring an action in california to obtain a domestic judgment.
although section allows a foreign judgment holder to bring an action for california recognition notwithstanding a pending foreign appeal of the judgment,section gives the california court the power to stay the recognition action pending the outcome of the foreign appeal 
in section,california has defined what type of foreign judgments it will recognize.that is,california has determined it will recognize foreign judgments that are final,conclusive,and enforceable,notwithstanding the fact they may still be subject to appellate review.the appellate caveat to section makes it clear that the fact that a foreign judgment is still vulnerable to change on appeal in the foreign country is not alone enough to preclude recognition of a foreign judgment which is otherwise final,conclusive,and enforceable in the foreign country.additionally,section reference to a final,conclusive and enforceable judgment where rendered makes it clear it is the status of the foreign judgment in the foreign country that determines whether the judgment is ripe for recognition in california.
there is no serious dispute that the korea district court judgment at issue here is still enforceable to the extent of the reduced provisional execution order even one of lee experts acknowledged that the district court judgment remain s technically intact notwithstanding the korea supreme court remand of the case to the high court.the fact that after the korea supreme court ruling the high court retained korea water execution rights up to billion korean won indicates the judgment to that extent is still enforceable.additionally,it is clear the judgment is final in the sense that it is not interlocutory but will be changed only via the appellate process thus,the controversy essentially turns on whether the judgment is conclusive in korea within the meaning of california section final and conclusive and enforceable provision.
before we consider the meaning of the term conclusive,we evaluate lee argument that the scope of section should be ascertained by reference to a section of the korea code of civil procedure providing that a judgment is not final and conclusive until the appellate process is terminated.as we shall explain,we find this argument unavailing because it would abrogate the provision in section which allows recognition of foreign judgments while a foreign appeal is pending.
korea code of civil procedure 
lee argument is premised on article,which states a judgment shall not become final and conclusive during the period in which an appeal may be filed or when a lawful appeal has been filed within the prescribed period.lee argues that because under article a judgment is not final and conclusive while the appellate process is still ongoing,this definition should simply be extrapolated onto section reference to a final and conclusive judgment.we are not persuaded.
article provides for compulsory execution in two situations,stating compulsory execution shall be effected by a final judgment which has become final and conclusive or which is accompanied by the declaration of the provisional execution.article defines final and conclusive as meaning appellate review is completed or no longer available.thus,article definition of final and conclusive merely sets forth a definition for one of the two types of enforceable judgments referred to in article.significantly,the korea code does not limit enforceability only to final and conclusive judgments for which the appellate process is over,but also allows enforcement of judgments that are still subject to appeal if they contain a provisional execution order.
if we were to apply article definition of final and conclusive to section,we would in effect be eviscerating the appellate caveat provision of section.in exercising its prerogative to decide what types of foreign judgments it will recognize,california has chosen not to preclude recognition merely because the judgment is subject to appellate review.because of section appellate caveat,the fact that the korea code for certain purposes defines the phrase final and conclusive as meaning the appellate process is terminated,can not be determinative on the issue of how to interpret the phrase in section.
the existence of section appellate caveat distinguishes the instant case from mayekawa manufacturing,sasaki,a washington case cited by lee in support of his argument.in mayekawa,the washington code provided for recognition of foreign judgments that are final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered,at.there is no mention of an appellate caveat in the washington code quoted in
