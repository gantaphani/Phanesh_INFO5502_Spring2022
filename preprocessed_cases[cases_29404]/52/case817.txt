european plaintiffs appeal the district court order dismissing their case against cessna aircraft company on the basis of forum non conveniens.we find no abuse of discretion and therefore affirm.
background 
this case arises out of a tragic plane crash that occurred at linate airport in milan,italy,on october.on that foggy morning,a private cessna jet operated by air evex,a german charter company,made a wrong turn and taxied toward an active runway,causing it to collide with scandinavian airlines flight,which was just taking flight.one hundred eighteen people died,including everyone on board both planes and four people on the ground,and others on the ground were injured.
in march,a complaint was filed against cessna aircraft company cessna in the southern district of florida by the king family,acting as personal representatives of the estate of jessica king king plaintiffs.thereafter,european plaintiffs european plaintiffs brought suits against cessna,which were consolidated with the king plaintiffs case for administrative purposes.on october,the district court granted in part cessna motion to dismiss the case as to the european plaintiffs on forum non conveniens grounds,denied in part the motion with regard to the king plaintiffs,and stayed the king plaintiffs case pending resolution of italian disputes relating to the european plaintiffs.king ex rel.estate of king cessna aircraft,d.after both groups of plaintiffs appealed,we vacated the district court stay and dismissal orders and remanded the case.king cessna aircraft,cir.without expressing any view on the correctness of the district court forum non conveniens analysis,we instructed the district court to consider whether,knowing it could not avoid dual proceedings by staying the king case,it might have dismissed all of the plaintiffs,including king,or allowed all of the plaintiffs to proceed here,or perhaps pursued some other avenue.id.
on remand,cessna renewed its motion to dismiss both the king plaintiffs and european plaintiffs complaints on the basis of forum non conveniens.the district court elect ed to pursue some other avenue and,for the reasons it previously gave,granted in part the motion to dismiss with regard to the european plaintiffs and denied it in part with regard to the king plaintiffs.king cessna aircraft,wl,at.on february,cessna filed a motion to amend the judgment,asking the district court to certify its decision to dismiss the european plaintiffs as a final judgment pursuant to.b and include a certificate for interlocutory review pursuant to b of the portion of the order denying the motion to dismiss the king plaintiffs.the district court issued a final judgment pursuant to rules and,but denied cessna motion for certification under b.the european plaintiffs appealed their dismissal,and cessna filed a of the order to the extent said order denied cessna motion to dismiss the claims of plaintiff jack king.
ii.jurisdiction 
dismissal of a suit on the basis of forum non conveniens is a final,appealable order.sigalas lido,cir.the district court did not consolidate the european plaintiffs case with the king plaintiffs case for all purposes,so the european plaintiffs can appeal the dismissal of their case without waiting for a final determination of the king plaintiffs case.see lewis charters,huckins yacht,cir.the district court order is final as to the european plaintiffs,so we have jurisdiction to review their appeal.
we do not,however,have jurisdiction to review cessna.unlike the main appeal,the denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens is not a final order.see van cauwenberghe biard,d.furthermore,we can not infer the district court intended to certify for immediate review the denial of the motion to dismiss the king plaintiffs.the motion for entry of a rule b certification filed by cessna asked for a rule b certification only with regard to the dismissal of the european plaintiffs,and the district court denied cessna request for certification of that denial under b.cessna argues this court has pendent appellate jurisdiction to review its.we disagree.
pendent appellate jurisdiction is present when a nonappealable decision is inextricably intertwined with the appealable decision or when review of the former decision is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the latter.swint chambers county comm n,d see also summit med,pryor,cir.under these guidelines,such jurisdiction can be present even when the pendent appeal involves a party not in the main appeal still,the supreme court has signaled that pendent appellate jurisdiction should be present only under rare circumstances.see johnson jones,d indicating pendent appellate jurisdiction is only appropriate sometimes swint,at.at expressing concern that a rule loosely allowing pendent appellate jurisdiction would encourage parties to parlay collateral orders into interlocutory appeal tickets.as noted in swint,a more expansive exercise of such jurisdiction would undermine the statutory scheme governing interlocutory appeals.swint,at.at see also b,e gilda marx,wildwood exercise,noting the many factors that weigh against exercising pendent appellate jurisdiction.our circuit has found pendent appellate jurisdiction in only limited factual scenarios.
in fox tyson foods,we found there was pendent jurisdiction to review those portions of an otherwise nonappealable collective action order the district court relied on when denying the motion to intervene that was appealed,cir see also chudasama mazda motor,cir exercising pendent jurisdiction to review an otherwise nonappealable compel order because the appealed sanctions order was issued in part for the defendant purported violation of the compel order.we expressly determined there was no jurisdiction,however,to review findings in the collective action order upon which the district court did not rely.fox,at.in united states,we exercised pendent appellate jurisdiction over an otherwise nonappealable order striking a paragraph of the indictment because the strike was closely related to the district court exclusion of the government evidence that was on review,cir.we reasoned that review of the evidentiary ruling necessarily implicate d review of the order striking the paragraph from the indictment because b oth orders resulted from the same determination.id.
importantly,we have found such jurisdiction did not exist when resolution of the nonappealable issue was not necessary to resolve the appealable one.see summit med,at w e may resolve the eleventh amendment immunity issue here without reaching the merits of standing,so t hese issues are neither inextricably intertwined nor necessary to ensure meaningful review of one another.moniz city of fort lauderdale,cir because we may resolve the qualified immunity issue in this case without reaching the merits of appellants challenge to standing,we conclude that the latter issue does not fall within our pendent appellate jurisdiction under swint.harris bd.of educ.of atlanta,cir declining pendent appellate jurisdiction because the qualified immunity issue could be resolved without reaching the merits of the remaining questions raised by the parties.
in the eleventh circuit,we have never exercised pendent appellate jurisdiction to review an issue like the one raised by the.the district court did not base its decision of whether to dismiss the european plaintiffs on its decision as to the king plaintiffs.see king ex rel.estate of king,d at cited by king,wl,at fox,at chudasama,at.the orders did not result from the same determination because,although some of the factors in the forum non conveniens analysis applied equally to both the european plaintiffs and the king plaintiffs,the district court order clearly shows the analysis was conducted separately for both groups.see king ex rel.estate of king,d at cited by king,wl,at,at.furthermore,a determination of the propriety of the district court refusal to dismiss the king plaintiffs is not necessary to resolve the propriety of its decision to dismiss the european plaintiffs for forum non conveniens.see summit med,at moniz,at harris,at.for these reasons,we will review the europe
