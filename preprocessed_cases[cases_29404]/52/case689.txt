we must decide whether restitution can be awarded to the overseas child victims of sexual exploitation crimes committed by an american citizen while he was traveling outside the united states.
between july and november,john doe,a citizen of the united states,traveled to his native country three times on november,doe was returning through los angeles international airport with his mother when inspectors discovered digital child pornography images stored on a memory stick taped to the inside of a fifth pocket on a pair of jeans.the roughly pictures displayed images of naked boys who appeared to be between and years old.one series of pictures portrayed doe performing sex acts upon a minor child.doe confessed that he had taken the pictures of the naked children and explained that they were part of a dance group of which he was a sponsor 
on the night that doe was arrested,he called his brother and instructed him to destroy evidence at defendant home.the brother removed a laptop computer along with cds and a brown envelope containing child pornography from his brother house.the cds contained over images of child pornography.these items were eventually turned over to the authorities by doe brother after he was served with a subpoena.
on november,a criminal complaint was filed against doe for the possession and transportation of child pornography,in violation of a b and a.a federal grand jury returned a indictment on november.on march,pursuant to a plea agreement with the government,doe plead guilty to counts one and two of the indictment the production of child pornography outside the united states,in violation of c and engaging in illicit sexual conduct with minor persons in foreign places,in violation of c.
as part of the defendant written plea agreement,he stipulated to the following facts 
on or about september,until on or about november,defendant,a citizen of the united states,traveled in foreign commerce,that is,from los angeles,california to his native country and engaged in illicit sexual conduct with minor persons who were under the age of sixteen.defendant,among other things,masturbated and intentionally touched the unclothed genitalia of at least four minor boys with the intent to arouse the sexual desires of himself,the minors,or other persons.moreover,defendant employed,used,coerced,or persuaded eight boys between the ages of and old to engage in masturbation of at least two minor boys and the lascivious exhibition of the genitals and anal areas of eight minor boys,for the purpose of producing visual depictions of such conduct.defendant then photographed the boys while engaged in such conduct using a digital camera,produced at least depictions of the boys sexually explicit conduct,and then stored those visual depictions on digital camera memory sticks.on november,defendant intended to transport and did transport his digital camera and the digital camera memory sticks containing the aforementioned visual depictions in foreign commerce by physically transporting them from abroad to los angeles,california.
in addition to agreeing to a sentencing recommendation of months imprisonment,doe agreed to make full restitution for the losses caused by his actions,and also agreed that the amount of loss was not restricted to the loss arising out of the charges to which he pled guilty.
the probation officer report psr calculated an adjusted offense level of for both counts of conviction.the recommended guidelines range was therefore to months.in addition,the psr contained statements from the victims about the crime and about the impact that doe actions had on their lives.before doe first sentencing hearing,he filed objections to these portions of the psr,claiming that the statements of the victims had been exaggerated and were not credible.he also objected that the victims were not fully identified.the government filed its response,concurring in the factual findings of the psr and in its sentencing calculations.in accordance with the plea agreement,the government requested a sentence.
the district court held the first sentencing hearing on june.there,the district court considered objections made by doe to the psr.one particular objection made by doe was to the victim impact statements contained in paragraphs of the psr.doe argued that because the statements were so similar and because the victims were not identified,he was unable to determine whether the statements were true.the district court responded that it was going to overrule the request to strike for this without prejudice to bring it up at the time of the restitution hearing as to whether or not proper discovery has been made so they can argue at the restitution hearing which is in august.
at the end of the first sentencing hearing,counsel for doe requested the opportunity to look at the conditions of supervised release that the court was considering imposing.the court denied the request,stating that i f you object to it the recommended conditions,post sentence you can do that.the district court then sentenced doe to imprisonment to be followed by a lifetime of supervised release and also read into the record the conditions of release.doe specifically objected at that time to conditions that he be required to take any prescribed psychiatric medication and that the probation office could provide the psr to doe treatment provider.the district court overruled both objections.the court deferred ruling on restitution pending a separate hearing.
at the restitution hearing,doe again objected to the victim impact statements contained in the psr.the government,relying upon the factual statements contained in the psr,sought total restitution in the amount of for eight of the defendant eighteen victims.the specific restitution sought by the government included 
psychological and medical treatment in the amount of per child sessions of trauma counseling and psychological care,case review by a social worker employed by the world vision foundation and quarterly medical 
vocational training,a program for a degree,and formal schooling,in the amount of per child 
a management fee of payable to the world vision foundation to coordinate services for the child victims.
per child in initial capital to aid in opening a cellular telephone repair shop 
the district court denied the request for in capital,but agreed with the government that the other costs were reasonable and proximately caused by defendant conduct.the district court therefore ordered defendant to pay total restitution in the amount of.
doe filed a timely notice of appeal.
doe first argument on appeal is that the district court violated fed.crim by failing to resolve a dispute over the credibility of the allegations made by defendant child victims in paragraphs to of the psr.in response,the government contends that the district court did not violate rule because it specifically resolved the credibility disputes in favor of the victims when it overruled defendant objections and when it relied upon these disputed paragraphs as the basis for its restitution award.
rule c requires that f or each matter controverted,the court must make either a finding on the allegation or a determination that no finding is necessary.we have mandated strict compliance with this rule.united states houston,cir citing united states garfield,cir and united states,cir en banc.we have recognized,however,that the rule is complied with where the district court expressly adopts the position of either party to the dispute.see united states karterman,cir finding rule satisfied where district court stated that he was persuaded that the correct amount of loss was that argued by the government.
at the first sentencing hearing,doe objected to paragraphs on the ground that the victims were not identified.the court explicitly resolved this dispute when it overruled doe objections.at the second sentencing hearing,doe again objected to paragraphs,though the record reflects that this time,the objection was over the credibility of the witnesses statements.the district court did not violate rule because it resolved the objection by expressly adopting the statements of the child victims.the district court stated we have statements of these victims such as victim,dropped out of school and is under constant supervision of his grandparents since the abuse occurred.obviously the whole person was affected,not just medical,psychological.after reciting another victim story,the district court stated,i t goes on and on with all these.their entire life has been changed because of the actions of the defendant.
the district court adoption of these statements reflects its resolution of the credibility dispute.although no specific factual finding was made,it is clear that the district court adopted the statements in the psr as credible and therefore sided with the government.such a resolution is sufficient under this circuit law.see united states rigby,cir t he district court clearly stated that it found the position as stated in the probation officer addendum to be the correct one.there was no inadequacy of findings.the record at the sentencing hearing reflects no confusion on anyone part as to what the district court decided.
doe also challenges the amount of the restitution order imposed by the district court.he contends that the government failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the restitution costs it sought to recover were the proximate result of his criminal actions.specifically,he argues that many of the expenses were for activities that the victims had been engaged in prior to being the victims of his sexual abuse,such as schooling and vocational training according to doe,restitution is therefore being used to advance them the victims beyond their prior station in life.doe also objects to costs related to schooling school supplies,travel allowances,uniforms,the costs of food and snacks and the costs of case review and processing.in response,the government argues that the award of restitution costs by the district court was not an abuse of discretion.it argues that the defendant sexual abuse of the children was the proximate cause of their psychological,physical and social trauma,and that all of the costs were proved with a reasonable degree of certainty.in particular,the government strenuously argues that the award of costs for occupational and vocational therapy was necessary because many of the victims had dropped out of school and this alternative education was necessary to make them whole.
although this presents the first case of which we are aware where there has been a restitution award based upon sexually exploitative conduct performed outside the united states,doe does not dispute that his extraterritorial conduct subjects him to two mandatory restitution statutes the mandatory victims restitution act,and,more particularly,the mandatory restitution for sexual exploitation of children act,section.indeed,as part of his plea agreement,doe agreed to make full restitution to the victims of his crimes.
section directs that an order of restitution under this section shall direct the defendant to pay the victim through the appropriate court mechanism the full amount of the victim losses as determined by the court.the full amount of losses includes,a medical services relating to physical,psychiatric,or psychological care b physical and occupational therapy or rehabilitation c necessary transportation,temporary housing,and child care expenses d lost income e attorneys fees,as well as other costs incurred and f any other losses suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offense.b a f.we have previously recognized that this section is phrased in generous terms,in order to compensate the victims of sexual abuse for the care required to address the long term effects of their abuse.united states laney,cir.
and although the breadth of the statutory language is circumscribed by the requirement of a causal connection between the offense of conviction and the victim harm,id.at,we and the other circuits addressing restitution orders under section have not imposed a requirement of causation approaching mathematical precision.in laney,our court first foray into section jurisprudence,we rejected the defendant narrow reading of the statute and held that future counseling expenses were included within the scope of the statute.id.we recognized that there might be cases where the amount of future counseling expenses would be too difficult to ascertain to justify an award,but we found the district court estimate of the amount the victim was likely to spend to be justified.id.at.
other circuits have adopted approaches similar to laney.in united states danser,cir,the seventh circuit agreed that mathematical precision is not required in the causal analysis upholding a restitution award of.id.at.the danser court noted that it was mindful of the inherent uncertainties attendant upon an award of prospective damages,id.at,but reasoned 
in the present case,the loss sustained by karen namely,her mental trauma has been incurred and will continue to manifest itself for years.this difference regarding the speculative nature of the respective awards and the strong congressional intent behind section,provide the crucial distinction between the instant case and united states fountain,cir expressing disapproval of an award of future earnings as a part of a criminal sentence.
id.thus,although the seventh circuit generally disallows future losses in most restitution awards,in contexts involving awards to child victims of sexual exploitation,it allows a district court significant discretion to make a reasonable estimate of an amount that reflects the full loss to the victim.see also united states julian,cir following laney and allowing a victim to be compensated for future counseling expenses.
finally,in united states crandon,cir,the third circuit upheld a restitution award of.in that case,the court agreed with the district court that proximate causation had been established based upon consideration of a treating psychiatrist report and a licensed social worker report on the degree of impact on the victim.id.the third circuit also considered the defendant conten tion that his actions can not be considered the proximate cause of the girl losses because the government mental health experts conceded that she may have suffered from,untreated psychological problems prior to their relationship.id.it emphatically rejected the argument that it must be shown that a defendant conduct was the sole and total cause of a victim loss,holding that it was entirely reasonable for the district court to conclude that the additional strain or trauma stemming from crandon actions was a substantial factor in causing the ultimate loss.id.at.
thus,in every circuit to consider the causation requirement of section,a rule of reasonableness is applied.we will uphold an award of restitution under section if the district court is able to estimate,based upon facts in the record,the amount of victim loss with some reasonable certainty.
applying this standard to the restitution order here,the district court did not abuse its discretion in crafting its restitution award.first,the court ordered restitution for psychological counseling for each child in the amount of.this figure provides for sessions of trauma counseling and care once a month for two years.such future counseling costs are compensable under laney and are supported by the record as reasonable estimates of the loss to the child victims.
all eight victims who could be located were interviewed on a number of occasions by government workers or by social services agencies.first,in january and february of,the children were interviewed by the department of child services in doe home country.these interviews were and summarized by the government in the psr.additional interviews were performed by local authorities and united states customs agents in april.the interviews focused on the impact that defendant criminal actions had on the victims and were also included in the psr as victim impact statements,which the district court found credible.finally,the government also contracted with the world vision foundation to conduct interviews with all eight victims that could be located.after meeting with the children on an individu
