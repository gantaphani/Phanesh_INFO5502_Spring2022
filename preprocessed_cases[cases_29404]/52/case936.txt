we affirm the judgment of the district court.section a of the fsia abrogates foreign sovereign immunity and provides jurisdiction in specified circumstances,but it does not create a private cause of action.by its clear terms,the flatow amendment provides a private right of action only against individual officials,employees,and agents of a foreign state,but not against a foreign state itself.plainly,neither section a nor the flatow amendment,separately or together,establishes a cause of action against foreign state sponsors of terrorism.therefore,the cicippios suit can not proceed on these grounds.however,because the cicippios suit was filed in the wake of judgments in favor of and cicippio and other hostage victims,they may have been misled in assuming that the flatow amendment afforded a cause of action against foreign state sponsors of terrorism.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court,but remand the case to allow plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint to state a cause of action under some other source of law.we reserve judgment,however,on whether the cicippios have any viable basis for an action against iran,leaving that issue to the district court in the first instance.
background 
on the morning of september,joseph.cicippio was kidnaped in beiruit,lebanon,by the terrorist group hizbollah,an agent of iran ministry of information and security mois.at the time of his abduction,cicippio was comptroller of the american university of beiruit.hizbollah held him hostage for days.during that time,he was randomly beaten,confined in rodent and cells,and bound by chains.he suffered from numerous medical problems emanating from the inhumane treatment that he experienced during his captivity.at some point after cicippio was taken hostage,he was forced to undergo major surgery for an unidentified abdominal condition that has left a scar on his abdomen.see cicippio,d at.
in,joseph cicippio filed suit against iran under the terrorism exception to the fsia,a,and the flatow amendment,note.his lawsuit was joined by his wife,elham cicippio,two other hostage victims,and the wife of one of the other victims.the iranian defendants did not respond to the complaint and were found in default.the case was tried ex parte and,on august,the district court rendered a judgment for joseph cicippio in the amount of million in damages for lost wages and opportunities and compensatory damages for pain and suffering and mental anguish,and million for cicippio in damages for loss of her husband society and companionship and mental anguish.see cicippio,d at.iran never entered an appearance in the case and no appeal was taken from the judgment of the district court.
the instant case arises from a lawsuit brought in by joseph cicippio seven adult children and seven siblings against iran and mois for the intentional infliction of emotional distress and loss of solatium they sustained as a result of cicippio ordeal.the suit was based on claims purporting to arise under section a and the flatow amendment.on january,after iran failed to respond to the complaint,the district court entered a default judgment for the cicippio children and siblings.on january,the cicippios filed a motion for summary judgment.they subsequently filed a motion to consolidate their case with and cicippio lawsuit against iran,which by then had been closed.the motion for summary judgment included affidavits from the children and siblings establishing that cicippio captivity caused them to suffer from emotional distress by virtue of the harm done to him.
b.the statutory framework 
the fsia provides that s ubject to existing international agreements to which the united states is a party at the time of enactment of this act a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states except as provided in sections to of this chapter.under the fsia,foreign states enjoy immunity from suit in courts unless congress waives immunity under an enumerated exception.in,as part of the comprehensive antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,congress enacted the terrorism exception to the fsia,waiving the immunity of foreign states and their agents in any case 
in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture,extrajudicial killing,aircraft sabotage,hostage taking,or the provision of material support or resources as defined in section of title for such an act if such act or provision of material support is engaged in by an official,employee,or agent of such foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office,employment,or agency 
a.this provision only waives the immunity of a foreign state defendant that has been specifically designated by the state department as a state sponsor of terrorism,a a,and does not apply if 
i the act occurred in the foreign state against which the claim has been brought and the claimant has not afforded the foreign state a reasonable opportunity to arbitrate the claim in accordance with accepted international rules of arbitration or 
ii neither the claimant nor the victim was a national of the united states as that term is defined in section a of the immigration and nationality act when the act upon which the claim is based occurred.
five months after the passage of aedpa,congress enacted a separate provision,titled civil liability for acts of state sponsored terrorism,which created a private right of action against officials,employees,and agents of foreign states for the conduct described in a.see omnibus consolidated appropriations act of,div.a,title i,c title v,stat.codified at note.this provision is known as the flatow amendment,in recognition of the family of alisa flatow,a woman who died as the result of a terrorist bombing in israel.see flatow islamic republic of iran.the flatow amendment provides 
a an official,employee,or agent of a foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism designated under section j of the export administration act of section j of the appendix to title,war and national defense while acting within the scope of his or her office,employment,or agency shall be liable to a united states national or the national legal representative for personal injury or death caused by acts of that official,employee,or agent for which the courts of the united states may maintain jurisdiction under section a of title,united states code subsec.a of this section for money damages which may include economic damages,solatium,pain,and suffering,and punitive damages if the acts were among those described in section a subsec.a of this section.
it is undisputed that the flatow amendment permits nationals to pursue a private right of action for terrorism against officials,employees,and agents of designated foreign states acting in their personal capacities.at issue here is whether section a and the flatow amendment similarly provide a cause of action against a foreign state.
c.the district court judgment 
the district court assumed that plaintiffs factual allegations were true,but denied both their motion to consolidate their case with and cicippio case and their motion for summary judgment.the court also sua sponte dismissed the cicippios complaint under federal rules of civil procedure b and h,concluding that the fsia,as amended,does not confer subject matter jurisdiction upon it to entertain claims for emotional distress and solatium brought by claimants situated as are these plaintiffs upon the allegations of their complaint,civ,slip op.at,app.noting that a foreign state is liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,the district court held that the plaintiffs could not recover under the prevailing common law rule governing third party claims for outrageous conduct causing severe emotional distress,civ,slip op.at,app.the district court cited the restatement second of torts for the proposition that a third party claimant must be present at the scene of the victim torment in order to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.id.citing restatement second of torts.the district court also held that solatium damages were unavailable to cicippio adult children and siblings,because another generally observed rule of american common law has refused to recognize a right to recover damages for loss of society and companionship by other than spouses for injury to a third party even a relative not resulting in third party death,civ,slip op.at,app.
as noted above,the district court based its dismissal of the complaint on two grounds rule b failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and rule h the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter.the second ground is inapposite,for it is clear that the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity under a.nonetheless,in their arguments to this court,the parties do not disagree that the principal basis for the district court dismissal was not a lack of jurisdiction,but,rather,plaintiffs failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted.in other words,the parties do not disagree that the district court disposition embraces the conclusion that the plaintiffs can not pursue their claims of emotional distress and loss of solatium against a foreign state under the flatow amendment.the cicippios now appeal the district court dismissal of their claims.
d.the appointment of amicus curiae and the issues on appeal 
because iran has never entered an appearance in this litigation,the court appointed the georgetown university law center appellate litigation program as amicus curiae to present arguments in support of the district court judgment.
the court also ordered the parties to brief and argue,inter alia,the following issues 
whether the fsia creates a federal cause of action for torture and hostage taking against foreign states,or only against their official s,employee s or agent s as specified in the flatow amendment,an issue raised but not decided in price socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya.
whether cicippio children and siblings may sue for intentional infliction of emotional distress and loss of solatium.
whether appellants who seek to recover for emotional distress based on conduct directed at a third party must have been present at the time of the offending conduct,and,if so,whether appellants satisfied this presence requirement.

e.the appearance of the united states as amicus curiae 
on november,the court issued the following order soliciting the views of the united states 
it is ordered,on the court own motion,and in accordance with,that the united states of america file,by december,a statement of its current position on the question whether the foreign sovereign immunities act,allows a cause of action for torture and hostage taking against foreign states,or only authorizes statutory claims against state officials,employees,or agents as specified in the flatow amendment,note.
when the united states appeared in roeder islamic republic of iran,the government submitted,inter alia,
the flatow amendment does not provide a cause of action against foreign nations or their governments quite unambiguously,the statute provides a cause of action against individual official s,employee s,or agent s of foreign states for the acts of terrorism in which they have taken part,but not against foreign states themselves.
the united states motion to vacate default judgment and dismiss plaintiffs claims at,roeder islamic republic of iran,d civ.egs.in a later submission in roeder,the government further submitted that,
as the united states observed previously,the plain language of the flatow amendment provides the victims of terrorist acts a cause of action against the official s,employee s or agent s of a foreign state who commit such acts,not against the foreign state itself.

the court hereby requests that the united states indicate whether the government position on the scope of the cause of action under the flatow amendment remains the same as indicated above,and,if not,explain how and why the position of the united states has changed.
islamic republic of iran,wl,order requesting statement of united states.
after receiving a extension of time in which to submit its position,the united states filed a brief as amicus curiae on december,stating the firm view that the flatow amendment does not provide a private right of action against a foreign state 
neither section a nor the flatow amendment,nor the two considered in tandem,offers any indication that congress intended to take the more provocative step of creating a private right of action against foreign governments themselves.such a move could have serious adverse consequences for the conduct of foreign relations by the executive branch,and therefore an intent to do so should not be inferred it should be recognized only if congress has acted clearly in that direction.
