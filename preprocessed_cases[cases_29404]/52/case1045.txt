the humane society of the united states,humane society international,and defenders of wildlife collectively humane society appeal from a decision of the court of international trade.the court of international trade denied their request to issue a writ of mandamus directing the president to impose sanctions on italy for violation of the driftnet fishing act,supp.iv,and denied their request for an order requiring the secretary of commerce to rescind his certification that italy had terminated driftnet fishing.the court of international trade did grant their petition regarding issuance of an order requiring the secretary of commerce,pursuant to b b,again to identify italy as a nation for which there is reason to believe its nationals or vessels are conducting driftnet fishing.because the court of international trade did not err in its judgment,the judgment is affirmed.
background 
driftnet fishing is defined in a as a method of fishing in which a gillnet composed of a panel or panels of webbing,or a series of such gillnets,with a total length of two and kilometers or more is placed in the water and allowed to drift with the currents and winds for the purpose of entangling fish in the webbing.a fishing boat deploys the driftnets by suspending them vertically beneath the surface of the water,between buoys at the ocean surface and a weighted lead line at the bottom of the nets.the driftnets are deployed at night when they are less visible to marine life.though intended to catch fish,the nets indiscriminately catch virtually all aquatic life including fish,whales,dolphins,sea turtles,and sea birds.the fish are captured when the mesh catches behind their gills,and the whales,dolphins,and other sea life are caught when they become entangled in the net.at dawn,fishermen collect the driftnets,remove the target fish,and discard any species,often drowned,that were caught in the nets.
in,the united nations general assembly passed numerous resolutions calling for a worldwide moratorium on high seas driftnets.the resolutions were aimed primarily at driftnet fishing in the area of the seas beyond what is known in international law as the exclusive economic zone the eez.the eez is the area of the seas that lies within nautical miles from the shore of a coastal nation the area beyond the eez is known as the high seas.
in implementing the resolutions,the united states passed the high seas driftnet fisheries enforcement act,stat.codified as amended at the driftnet act.the driftnet act establishes a process under which the united states may take various actions against a foreign nation whose fishing vessels on the high seas engage in driftnet fishing,as the act defines it we will examine the provisions of the act in detail below.for now,it will be enough to outline the way the act works.
whenever the secretary of commerce has reason to believe that the nationals or vessels of any nation are conducting driftnet fishing beyond the eez of any nation,the secretary is to identify that nation,and notify the president and the nation of the identification.b b.
thereafter,the president is to enter into consultations with the government of the identified nation for the purpose of obtaining an agreement that will effect the immediate termination of driftnet fishing by the nationals or vessels of that nation b.if those consultations are not satisfactorily concluded,the president is to order the secretary of the treasury to prohibit the importation into the united states of fish and fish products from that nation.b a ii.
in addition,the act provides that the secretary of commerce,after giving notice to the nations involved,is to publish periodically a list of nations whose nationals or vessels conduct driftnet fishing beyond the eez of any nation,and the secretary of the treasury shall thereafter deny entry of any such vessel to any place in the united states.a.denial of port privileges,as well as import sanctions if imposed,remain in effect until the secretary of commerce certifies to the president and the congress that such nation has terminated driftnet fishing by its nationals and vessels beyond the eez.
in,the humane society and other plaintiffs filed suit in the court of international trade.they alleged that,in the face of evidence to the contrary,the secretary of commerce had failed to identify italy as a nation whose nationals or vessels conduct driftnet fishing in violation of the driftnet act.humane society of the united states brown,cit.ultimately,the court of international trade agreed,and held that the secretary of commerce had reason to believe that italian nationals were conducting driftnet fishing on the high seas and that,therefore,the decision not to identify was an abuse of discretion.humane society of the united states brown,cit.the government did not appeal the decision.pursuant to the trial court decision,the secretary of commerce on march,identified italy as a nation for which there was reason to believe its nationals or vessels were conducting driftnet fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation,and notified the president of italy identification.
acting through the department of state,the president entered into consultations with italy.in july,the italian government sent documents formalizing its agreement with the united states to end proscribed driftnet fishing by its nationals and vessels.the united states informed italy that its proposals were sufficient to avoid the imposition of sanctions under the driftnet act.thereafter,on january,the secretary of commerce certified to the president and congress that italy had terminated illegal driftnet fishing.
this case arose when,in,pursuant to the authority of i,the humane society plaintiffs brought another suit in the court of international trade against the president and the secretary of commerce.the suit asked for injunctive and declaratory relief.the humane society alleged that,despite the earlier agreement,illegal driftnet fishing by italian nationals and vessels continued in the mediterranean sea in the and fishing seasons.the humane society requested the trial court to issue a writ of mandamus directing the president to impose sanctions on italy based on the identification,enjoin the secretary of commerce to rescind his january,certification of termination by italy,and,in the alternative,enjoin the secretary of commerce again to order that there is reason to believe that italy is a nation whose nationals or vessels are continuing to conduct driftnet fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone.
the humane society moved for summary judgment and the government defendants filed cross motions for summary judgment.the trial court held in favor of the government regarding the consequences attributable to the events.the court held that the president duty to decide if talks with italy had satisfactorily concluded was discretionary,and declined to issue a writ of mandamus requiring sanctions.further,the trial court found that the secretary of commerce january,certification of termination was not arbitrary,capricious or an abuse of discretion,since talks with italy had concluded in a formal agreement to end driftnet fishing.
with regard to the state of affairs at the time of trial,the trial court reviewed the evidence presented by the humane society,which included data provided by the italian government indicating administrative violations,administrative seizures,and kilometers of net seized for violations during.in addition,the united states navy had sighted several vessels,suspected of being italian,which were presumed to be engaging in illegal driftnet fishing.also,greenpeace reported twenty driftnet vessels in march of in,nine violations were confirmed.
on the basis of this evidence,the trial court held that the secretary of commerce refusal to identify italy a second time was arbitrary and capricious.the court ordered the secretary of commerce again to identify italy,pursuant to b b,as a nation for which there is reason to believe that its nationals or vessels are conducting driftnet fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation,and to notify the president of that identification.the humane society plaintiffs appeal those parts of the decision of the trial court not in their favor.
discussion 
under rule d of the united states court of international trade,summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.when reviewing such a decision by the court of international trade,we assess as a matter of law whether that standard was correctly applied.campbell soup united states,paul fire marine ins.united states.
furthermore,this court will apply the standard of review set forth in to an action instituted pursuant to i.miami free zone zones,shakeproof indus.products div.of.tool works united states.section of title,united states code,the administrative procedure act apa,provides that 
to the extent necessary to decision and when presented,the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law,interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.the reviewing court shall 
compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed and

in making the foregoing determinations,the court shall review the whole record or those parts of it cited by a party,and due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error.
applying this standard of review,an administrative action is to be upheld if the agency has considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.baltimore gas natural resources defense council,d.the court has recognized that this standard is highly deferential to the administrative agency factual findings.shakeproof,at.
it is important to understand that there are two separate actions by united states officials that are at issue,and two that are not.the two that are not are,first,the decision by the court of international trade that held arbitrary and capricious the failure of the secretary of commerce in to identify italy as a nation about which there was reason to believe that her nationals or vessels were conducting high seas driftnet fishing.that judgment was not appealed,and resulted in the secretary so identifying italy,with the attendant consequences as specified in the driftnet act.
the second action not at issue is the order by the court of international trade,this time as part of the current litigation,overturning the secretary new negative decision regarding identification of italy.the court of international trade concluded that there was again ample evidence of a reason to believe that italy was in violation of the act,and that the secretary refusal to identify italy anew pursuant to b b was arbitrary and capricious,and not in accordance with the driftnet act.the government has not that decision by the court of international trade.
the two decisions that are challenged on appeal by the humane society plaintiffs are the refusal by the trial court to order the president,after italy was identified by the secretary of commerce pursuant to the court order,to direct imposition of import restrictions and the conclusion by the trial court that the secretary later certification,that italy had terminated driftnet fishing,was not arbitrary and capricious.
the humane society argues that as a matter of law the president has a duty under the driftnet act to direct the imposition of import sanctions against nations whose nationals or vessels engage in driftnet fishing on the high seas,and this duty can be the basis for a writ of mandamus.the humane society also argues that the secretary of commerce,in certifying that italy had terminated driftnet fishing based solely on an agreement that had not yet been fully implemented and without any evidence that the driftnet fishing had,in fact,ceased,had acted arbitrarily and capriciously.
the government responds first that the court of international trade should not entertain a challenge to the government of trade sanctions against italy pursuant to the driftnet act because there has been no waiver of sovereign immunity by the united states.second,even if the court concludes there has been such a waiver of sovereign immunity,argues the government,the president of trade sanctions against italy is rational and in accordance with law.
with regard to the secretary of commerce certification that italy had terminated driftnet fishing by italian nationals and vessels,the government argues the issue is moot in light of the new court order finding that italy is again engaged in high seas driftnet fishing.finally,the government posits that,even if the certification has not been rendered moot,it was rational and in accordance with law.
we first address whether,as the government contends,in an action under to enforce the provisions of the driftnet act,the president and other executive officers are immune from suit under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.this is an issue of first impression.the trial court declined to address this issue on the grounds that,since the court was going to hold for the government on the merits of the question of whether the president acted within his authority,there was no need to decide the question of sovereign immunity.but sovereign immunity goes to the issue of the court power to hear the case,and therefore is antecedent to the merits of the case.see federal deposit ins.meyer,d sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature.thus,we must address this issue first.
the doctrine of sovereign immunity is an historic carryover from the days of the power of the english kings.essentially the doctrine prescribes that the federal government has long claimed status as be brought into court and held liable for its wrongs against its citizens unless it first consents to be sued.see louis jaffe,suits against governments and officers sovereign immunity,harv.
sovereign immunity and subject matter jurisdiction are related but different juridical concepts.federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction they have only such jurisdiction as is granted to them by law,either by the constitution or congressional legislation.a grant of subject matter jurisdiction to a particular court,even one that grants jurisdiction over suits against the federal government itself,is not necessarily the same as a waiver of sovereign immunity.the question is whether a statute that grants particular jurisdiction to a court also serves as such a waiver,or whether,as the government contends is the case here,a separate statutory waiver is needed.the answer depends on the particular statutory grant,and what can be ascertained about congress purpose and intent.
chapter,entitled court of international trade,provides the authority in for civil actions against the united states and agencies and officers thereof.subsection i of gives the court of international trade 
exclusive jurisdiction of any civil action commenced against the united states,its agencies,or its officers,that arises out of any law of the united states providing for 
embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the protection of the public health or safety or 
administration and enforcement 
this is the provision under which the present humane society suit is brought.
the government argues that i does not itself waive sovereign immunity.in support of its argument,the government points to part of the legislative history of the customs court act of which includes the statement that subsection i is intended only to confer subject matter jurisdiction upon the court,and not to create any new causes of action not founded on other provisions of law,at,reprinted in.the government also refers to statements indicating that the intent of congress in enacting i was to eliminate the confusion that existed between the jurisdiction of the district courts and that of the court of international trade.id.
the government then cites to the standing provision governing the commencement of civil actions in the court of international trade which provides,in part,a ny civil action of which the court of international trade has jurisdiction may be commenced in the court by any person adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of section of title.i.the government cites to the legislative history of i,which provides that t his subsection is intended to correlate with and complement the broad grant of residual jurisdiction found in proposed section i,at,at.the government concludes that a reading of these several provisions demonstrates that i was not intended to create any new causes of action,and thus the waiver of sovereign immunity must be found elsewhere and that waiver must be in the apa.
the humane society answers that united states boe,and other portions of the legislative history of the customs courts act of demonstrate that itself waives sovereign immunity.in boe,the court of customs and patent appeals construed,the jurisdictional statute that was the predecessor of.id.boe held that t he consent of the sovereign to be sued in the customs court is found in,which both establishes and limits the jurisdiction of that court.id.at.thus,according to boe that statute itself served as a waiver of sovereign immunity.
congress,in enacting the customs courts act of,which changed the name of the customs court to the court of international trade and clarified the new court jurisdiction,stated 
the purpose of this broad jurisdictional grant is to eliminate confusion which currently exists as to the demarcation between the jurisdiction of the district courts and the court of international trade.this provision makes it clear that all suits of the type specified are properly commenced only in the court of international trade.
at,at.therefore,argues the humane society,the change from to was merely intended to clarify those matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of international trade,and thus did not serve as a withdrawal of the waiver of sovereign immunity held by boe to be embodied in the grant of jurisdiction.additionally,notes the humane society,that conclusion is supported by the numerous cases in which the court of international trade has since considered challenges to the actions of the president pursuant to the grant of jurisdiction in i.see,florsheim shoe united states,united states sugar cane refiners ass block,kemet electronics barshefsky.cit luggage leather goods mfrs.of america,united states.cit.
we believe the humane society reading of is the correct one.in addition to crediting the points raised by them,it is informative to look at another court with complementary jurisdiction involving suits against the united states,the court of federal claims.pursuant to a,the tucker act,the court of federal claims has jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.as noted,the jurisdiction of the two courts is complementary b states that n othing herein shall be construed to give the united states court of federal claims jurisdiction of any civil action within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of international trade.
in united states mitchell,d,the supreme court acknowledged that terminology employed in some of its prior decisions had generated some confusion as to whether the tucker act,in addition to granting jurisdiction to the court of claims the predecessor to the court of federal claims over suits against the federal government,also constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity.id.at.the court reviewed the history of the act,the prior decisions regarding it,and its legislative history.the court quoted with approval the statement in the house judiciary committee report that the measure was designed to give the people of the united states what every civilized nation of the world has already right to go into the courts to seek redress against the government for their grievances.id.at.the conclusion the court reached was that the jurisdictional grant carried with it the unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity if a claim falls within the terms of the tucker act,the united states has presumptively consented to suit.id.at.
we can see no basis for treating the grant of jurisdiction to the court of international trade in a manner different from that by which the jurisdictional grant to the court of federal claims is treated.the same pattern specific grant of jurisdiction by the sovereign to a specific court for specific causes of action against the the same determination of liability because of conduct by the sovereign officials in the ordinary course of their assigned duties.unless the grant of jurisdiction carries with it a coextensive waiver of sovereign immunity,the congressional grant would be a hollow act,with no significant consequences to the sovereign,and no significant benefits to the sovereign subjects.
given the prior understanding of the predecessor act which both granted jurisdiction to the court of international trade and waived sovereign immunity,and the parallels to the tucker act,we follow the same approach taken by the supreme court and conclude that not only states the jurisdictional grant to the court of international trade,but also provides a waiver of sovereign immunity over the specified classes of cases.the court of international trade properly exercised jurisdiction over this case.
we note in passing that the government,having assumed that does not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity,looks instead in its brief to this court to of the apa for the requisite waiver.that leads the government into extensive consideration of standing under the apa.we need not go there neither party raises the standing issue independently of the apa issue,and since we do not rely on the apa for its waiver of sovereign immunity,questions of standing under the apa are not before us.
furthermore,courts have recognized the standing of organizations such as the humane society to bring suits against the government to implement environmental legislation.see japan whaling ass american cetacean society,d t hey undoubtedly have alleged a sufficient injury in fact in that the whale watching and studying of their members will be adversely affected by continued whale harvesting,and this type of interest is within the zone of interests protected by the pelly and packwood amendments.united states students challenging regulatory agency procedures,d holding that the trial court did not err in denying motion to dismiss based on lack of standing because appellees sufficiently alleged that their members used the forests,streams,mountains,and other resources in the washington metropolitan area for camping,hiking,fishing,and sightseeing,and that this use was disturbed by the adverse environmental impact caused by the nonuse of recyclable goods brought about by a rate increase on those commodities see also general standing provision for suits under.
we turn then to the first issue raised by the appellant humane society whether the issuance of sanctions by the president pursuant to b a ii is nondiscretionary,and thus the issuance of mandamus would be appropriate.as a general proposition,two requirements must be satisfied in order for a writ of mandamus to issue the plaintiff must have exhausted all avenues for relief and the defendant must owe the plai
