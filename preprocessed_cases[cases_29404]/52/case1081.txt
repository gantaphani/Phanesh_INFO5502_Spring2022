when a california plaintiff brings an action against a foreign defendant in california court,the trial court does not possess the authority to dismiss the action on the basis of forum non conveniens.instead,if the court determines california to be an inconvenient forum,the california court must stay the california action,in order to retain the ability to protect the california resident pending the resolution of the action in the foreign court.in this case,however,after the california court stayed the action on the basis of forum non conveniens,the california plaintiffs failed to file suit in the proper forum for over four years.the california court then granted the defendants motion to dismiss the california action for failure to diligently prosecute.the california plaintiffs appeal.we hold that a trial court does have the discretionary authority to dismiss for failure to diligently prosecute an action stayed on forum non conveniens grounds.we also conclude that,in this case,the trial court did not abuse its discretion by so doing.we therefore affirm.
factual and procedural background 
hendrick van keulen and damon appellants are former commercial airline pilots for cathay pacific airways.cathay appellants were members of a labor organization known as the hong kong aircrew officers association hkaoa,a registered trade union based in hong kong.in july,members of the hkaoa circulated a maximum safety strategy,which recommended that its members strictly comply with the provisions of cathay operations manual.while the pilots characterized this as a campaign of maximum safety adopted out of concerns that cathay safety standards would continue to erode,cathay saw it as a work slow down intended to disrupt cathay operations.in early july,cathay terminated the employment of of its pilots,including appellants,in response to the implementation of the maximum safety strategy.
the terminated pilots brought suit against cathay,with some pilots choosing to pursue action in hong kong,while others brought suit in california.in fact,two suits were filed in hong kong and ultimately consolidated the parties refer to those proceedings as the consolidated actions.the california action is the instant case,which was filed on october,by nine plaintiffs,three of whom were california residents including the two appellants and six of whom were not.
cathay moved to dismiss or stay the california action on the basis of forum non conveniens.in california,the action of a resident may be dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds,but,barring extraordinary circumstances,the action of a california resident may only be stayed.archibald cinerama hotels cal d.this is necessary so that the california court can protect the interests of the california resident pending the final decision of the foreign court.id.at.in this case,the trial court found hong kong to be a suitable alternative forum and further found that the balance of public and private interest factors compels the conclusion that california is an inconvenient forum for this action.therefore,on december,the trial court dismissed the action with respect to the plaintiffs and stayed it with respect to the three california plaintiffs.one of the california plaintiffs subsequently settled his dispute with cathay,and is no longer a party to this case.the two remaining plaintiffs,appellants here,assert that they immediately contacted haldanes solicitors,the attorneys in hong kong retained by hkaoa to pursue the consolidated actions,to ask that they be joined as plaintiffs.appellants would subsequently state that they were assured that haldanes solicitors were acting on their behalf to prosecute the action.
in the meantime,all nine of the plaintiffs in the california action appealed from the trial court order dismissing and staying the action.on november,we filed our opinion affirming the trial court order in its entirety van keulen cathay pacific,wl nonpub opn.the supreme court denied review on march.
time passed.in december,haldanes solicitors negotiated a settlement with cathay,without appellants input,and withdrew from representing appellants altogether on conflict of interest grounds when they refused to accept the settlement cathay offered.apparently,some of the plaintiffs in the consolidated actions also declined to accept the settlement,so the consolidated actions were not themselves dismissed.appellants,and the remaining consolidated action plaintiffs,did not obtain new representation in hong kong until july.
at a september,status conference in the instant action,the court was advised that the two remaining p laintiffs still have not joined in the pending hong kong case.that same day,appellants hong kong counsel wrote cathay hong kong counsel,asking if cathay would object if appellants applied to join the consolidated actions.the following day,hong kong counsel for cathay wrote hong kong counsel for appellants,stating that cathay will not oppose any such application.appellants,however,did not apply to join the consolidated actions.
on january,hong kong counsel for cathay wrote hong kong counsel for appellants inquiring as to appellants status.cathay counsel asked,are these individuals to join the proceedings in hong kong or not we feel you and they have had adequate time to make a decision on this and our clients are entitled to know where they stand.on january,appellants hong kong counsel responded,to deal with the matter expeditiously,we shall,subject to our clients final approval,commence fresh actions in the hong kong court for the same claims the new action will then be consolidated with the current ones.
on february,appellants filed a new action against cathay in hong kong the parties refer to this action as the hong kong action.appellants neither applied to be joined as plaintiffs in the consolidated actions,nor attempted to consolidate the hong kong action with the consolidated actions.
thereafter,cathay then moved to lift the stay and dismiss the instant action with prejudice.on november,the trial court denied the motion,but granted leave for cathay to file a motion for reconsideration of the december,order staying appellants action,based on new or different facts.
on december,cathay brought the motion for reconsideration.cathay argued appellants action should be dismissed,rather than stayed,on three grounds first,cathay noted that van keulen was no longer a california resident and,in fact,lived in hong kong,which cathay argued eliminated the need for the california action to remain stayed as to him second,cathay argued that since both appellants had now brought suit in hong kong,which had been determined to be a suitable forum,there was no need for the california action to remain and third,cathay argued that both appellants had not been diligent in pursuing their action in hong kong,rendering them undeserving of the california courts protection.cathay submitted the declaration of its hong kong counsel to the effect that discovery in the consolidated actions is complete,and an eventual consolidation of the hong kong action with the consolidated actions will inevitably delay the proceedings.he further stated that cathay,at all times,was willing to consent to appellants joinder in the consolidated actions.
in opposition,appellants argued that the appellant van keulen current residence was irrelevant as long as he was a california resident at the time his claim arose.as such,appellants argued,van keulen was entitled to have the california action stayed until the final resolution of the hong kong action.as to the issue of diligence,appellants argued that cathay had not offered any legal basis that a lack of diligence would justify dismissal of an action stayed on forum non conveniens grounds.further,they argued that they had been diligent in immediately requesting haldanes solicitors to join them as plaintiffs in the consolidated actions,and that once haldanes solicitors ceased representing them,they were diligent in obtaining new counsel and subsequently filing the hong kong action.in reply,cathay identified code of civil procedure section and the related discretionary dismissal statutes as providing a legal basis for a dismissal based on appellants lack of diligence in pursuing the hong kong action.
at the hearing on the motion,appellants argued that any lack of diligence was the result of their hong kong the haldanes not appellants themselves.appellants again argued that there is no legal authority to dismiss a case in the current procedural posture for lack of diligence in pursuing the foreign action.the trial court disagreed,stating that while the law generally requires the action of a california plaintiff to be stayed,rather than dismissed,for forum non conveniens,the court is not required to blindly keep a stayed action going indefinitely when the california plaintiff is not diligently pursuing its action in the proper forum.
the trial court granted the motion and dismissed the action with prejudice.as to the appellant van keulen,the court concluded that his current hong kong residency eliminates california interest in retaining jurisdiction in order to protect him as a california resident.as to both appellants,the court concluded that they had failed to establish they had acted with reasonable diligence in pursuing cathay in hong kong.the court concluded that e ven though california has a public policy interest in the matter,it is outweighed by the lack of diligence and the court dismisses on the grounds that appellants have not acted with reasonable diligence.appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.
issues on appeal 
on appeal,appellants initially argued only that,as a factual matter,they exercised reasonable diligence in pursuing the hong kong action we requested additional briefing on the issue of whether the trial court possessed discretion to dismiss the stayed california action for failure to diligently prosecute the hong kong action.the parties briefed the issue,and presented argument on it,and we now conclude the trial court did possesses that discretion.we further conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case,and therefore affirm.
discussion 
the trial court has the discretionary authority to dismiss for failure to diligently prosecute an action stayed on forum non conveniens grounds 
except in extraordinary cases,a trial court has no jurisdiction to dismiss an action brought by a california resident on the grounds of forum non conveniens.archibald cinerama hotels,supra,cal d at.this limitation of the forum non conveniens doctrine does not rest on any conclusion derived from a balancing of conveniences it reflects an overriding state policy of assuring california residents an adequate forum for the redress of grievances.id.at.when the trial court stays the action,rather than dismissing it,the court retains jurisdiction to compel the foreign party to cooperate in bringing about a fair and speedy hearing in the foreign forum it can resume proceedings if the foreign action is unreasonably delayed or fails to reach a resolution on the merits in short,the staying court can protect the interests of the california resident pending the final decision of the foreign court.id.at.in light of the policy of assuring an adequate forum for the california resident,the exceptional case which justifies the dismissal of a suit under the doctrine of forum non conveniens is one in which california can not provide an adequate forum or has no interest in doing so.id.at,fn.omitted.
the question raised by this case is whether california no longer has an interest in providing an adequate forum for a california resident,in an action stayed on forum non conveniens grounds,when that resident has not prosecuted the foreign action with reasonable diligence.code of civil procedure section provides,in pertinent part,it is the policy of the state that a plaintiff shall proceed with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of an action except as otherwise provided by statute or by rule of court adopted pursuant to statute,the policy favoring trial or other disposition of an action on the merits is generally to be preferred over the policy that requires dismissal for failure to proceed with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of an action in construing the provisions of this chapter.code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,provides,the court may in its discretion dismiss an action for delay in prosecution pursuant to this article on its own motion or motion of the defendant if to do so appears to the court appropriate under the circumstances of the case.
in other words,while california policy favors trial on the merits,there comes a time when that policy is overridden by california policy requiring dismissal for failure to prosecute with reasonable diligence.as this is true for any action prosecuted in california courts,it must be true for an action initially filed in california court but stayed on forum non conveniens grounds.in short,california interest in assuring an adequate forum for a california plaintiff is not absolute,and can be overcome when the plaintiff is unreasonably dilatory in prosecuting the action in the convenient forum.if,by a california plaintiff lack of reasonable diligence in prosecuting its action,california has lost its interest in providing an adequate forum,an action originally stayed on forum non conveniens grounds may therefore be dismissed.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the action in this case 
we next consider whether,under the facts of this case,the trial court erred in concluding that appellants were so unreasonably dilatory in prosecuting cathay in hong kong that california lost its interest in providing an adequate forum for them.the rules of court provide that in ruling on a motion for discretionary dismissal,the court must consider all matters relevant to a proper determination of the motion,including the court file in the case and the declarations and supporting data submitted by the parties and,where applicable,the availability of the moving party and other essential parties for service of process the diligence in seeking to effect service of process the extent to which the parties engaged in any settlement negotiations or discussion the diligence of the parties in pursuing discovery or other pretrial proceedings,including any extraordinary relief sought by either party the nature and complexity of the case the law applicable to the case,including the pendency of other litigation under a common set of facts or determinative of the legal or factual issues in the case the nature of any extensions of time or other delay attributable to either party the condition of the court calendar and the availability of an earlier trial date if the matter was ready for trial whether the interests of justice are best served by dismissal or trial of the case and any other fact or circumstance relevant to a fair determination of the issue.cal.rules of court,rule e.
the competing considerations to be evaluated are the policies of discouraging stale claims and compelling reasonable diligence balanced against the strong public policy which seeks to dispose of litigation on the merits rather than on procedural grounds.terzian county of ventura th,d.however,it is now well established that the policy of preferring to dispose litigation on the merits only comes into play when a plaintiff makes a showing of some excusable delay.ladd dart equipment d.
a reviewing court may not reverse a trial court order granting dismissal for dilatory prosecution unless the plaintiff meets the burden of establishing manifest abuse of discretion resulting in a miscarriage of justice.citations.an appellate court may not substitute its own discretion for that of the trial court and must uphold the dismissal order if the trial court has not abused its discretion.terzian county of ventura,supra,th at,d.
in this case,on december,the trial court concluded hong kong was the appropriate forum for this action,and stayed appellants suit.appellants did not join the consolidated actions already pending against cathay in hong kong,nor did they bring their own suit,until february,over four years later.
nearly all of the factors set forth in california rules of court,rule e weigh in favor of dismissal.the first factor is
