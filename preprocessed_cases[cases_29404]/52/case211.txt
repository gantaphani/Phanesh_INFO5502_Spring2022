the remainder of the bonds owned by cvi are denominated in united states dollars the bonds and were issued pursuant to a fiscal agency agreement faa.the faa provides that argentina will pay interest on the principal of the bonds until the principal is paid.it also sets forth periodic dates on which interest is due.the faa contains an acceleration provision,which does not specify whether or not interest is due on the periodic dates after any acceleration 
in december,argentina declared a moratorium on the payment of principal and interest on its foreign debt and stopped paying principal and interest on the bonds at issue here.in response to the default,on various dates in and,cvi accelerated the bonds it owned,making the principal immediately due.
the instant lawsuit was filed in the southern district on april.after various preliminary proceedings,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of cvi on the claims related to the bonds on may.subsequently,on february,the district court held an oral argument on various open issues,including argentina motion to dismiss the claims related to the german bonds for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and cvi request for statutory prejudgment interest on certain interest payments it claimed were due after acceleration of the bonds.
at the oral argument,the district court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims relating to cvi german bonds because argentina was entitled to sovereign immunity with respect to those claims the district court accordingly dismissed the german bond claims.construing section and of the offering circulars,the district court concluded that argentina had not explicitly waived its sovereign immunity in courts in section.instead,it held that subsection was a limited submission to the jurisdiction of courts in frankfurt and buenos aires.the district court reasoned that whatever subsection means it should not be read as reading out of this instrument the reference to frankfurt and the city of buenos aires.accordingly,while acknowledging that the language of subsection was very broad,the district court ultimately held that where there is an expressed grant of jurisdiction in specific places a general waiver of sovereign immunity such as in subsection does not mean that suit can be brought any place in the world.having found that argentina did not waive its sovereign immunity to suit in courts,the district court dismissed the german bond claims and concomitantly denied cvi motion for summary judgment on those claims.
as to cvi request for prejudgment interest,the district court found that the faa did not require the continued payment of interest after the principal was accelerated,because the act of accelerating the principal so that i t is due now is inconsistent with interest that continue s to accrue quarterly where the contract does not specifically provide that contractual interest continues to accrue.accordingly,the district court only awarded prejudgment interest,at the contractual rate,for the entire amount of the principal after the date of acceleration and for interest payments that were due but unpaid prior to acceleration.
