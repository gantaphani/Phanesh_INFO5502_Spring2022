when steven wertheimer was years old,he committed suicide by throwing himself in front of an oncoming caltrain after undergoing a course of drug prescribed for the treatment of cystic acne.in a products liability survivor action that followed,steven parents,barry and laurie marks wertheimer,alleged that side effects of accutane include depression,psychosis,and suicidality,and that these effects had caused steven death wertheimers named six roche group pharmaceutical companies as defendants in the action,including swiss defendants roche holding roche holding and roche,and two roche companies that are domiciled in new jersey.
in this statutory writ proceeding,the swiss defendants challenge the trial court exercise of in personam jurisdiction over them.they contend that because roche holding is simply a passive,parent holding company that invests in pharmaceutical companies,and because hoffman only sells the active ingredient in accutane in switzerland to the domestic roche affiliates that manufacture and sell the drug here,the trial court exercise of jurisdiction over them was error.wertheimers retort that the roche defendants are agents of the swiss defendants,and that jurisdiction over the swiss defendants is proper not through these companies own direct contacts with california,but by application of the representative services species of agency that permits a court to exercise general jurisdiction over a foreign defendant where that entity is the principal of a related domestic entity that functions merely as its instrumentality or agent.
on the factual record here,we hold that the trial court exercise of jurisdiction over either of the swiss defendants based solely on the global exchange and management of medical and scientific information relative to drug safety and regulatory compliance offends constitutional due process considerations.we accordingly let a writ of mandate issue directing the trial court to vacate its order of july,denying a motion to quash service of summons and enter a new order granting the motion as to each swiss defendant.
summary of proceedings below 
the operative complaint alleges that steven wertheimer was a popular,healthy,happy,old teenager with no prior history or symptoms of mental health problems when he spontaneously took his own life by thrusting himself in front of a speeding caltrain train in palo alto.some four months before that tragic act,steven had completed a prescribed course of accutane,the common name for the prescription acne drug,isotretinoin.the drug is alleged to be manufactured and sold by roche,roche laboratories,the roche defendants roche roche holding ag hoffman ag and roche holding,hereinafter la roche.
the causes of action pleaded against the four defendants subsumed by wertheimers within the group label la roche are breach of express warranty,breach of implied warranty,strict products liability failure to warn,negligence,fraud and deceit,and negligent misrepresentation,all relating to accutane.allegations common to each cause of action include that in june,the united states food and drug administration fda approved the use of accutane for cases of severe cystic acne,and that defendants knew even then that high doses of it cause sudden onslaughts of psychosis,depression,and suicidality.the roche defendants are alleged to have downplayed the risk of sudden incidents of suicide and to have repeatedly denied that the ingestion of accutane has any causal link to suicide.
all defendants are alleged to be the agents of one another,and roche holding is specifically alleged to be a company with its registered office in basel,switzerland,whose purpose is to hold shares in companies that manufacture pharmaceutical and other products.roche holding is further alleged to be the parent company of hoffman,which is likewise located in basel,as well as of the two roche defendants,both of which are alleged to be new jersey corporations and wholly owned subsidiaries.through these allegations,wertheimers themselves cast roche holding as a mere parent holding company.
on their motion to quash in the trial court,the swiss defendants proved up these holding company allegations by offering uncontroverted evidence that the two roche defendants are,ultimately,wholly owned subsidiaries of roche holding they also established without dispute that hoffman does not own any shares in either of the roche defendants and it,too,is a subsidiary of roche holding.the motion further left without dispute that the swiss defendants do not have their own direct minimum contacts of the usual variety with california,no continuous or systematic business in or with the state such as would give rise to the exercise of general jurisdiction here,and they engaged in no acts constituting purposeful availment such that it would be fair and reasonable for a california court to exercise specific jurisdiction over either of them.the motion likewise established that although all the roche entities are affiliated,each moving swiss defendant was a distinct and separate company,with its own board and assets,and that each company maintained its own separate corporate records,bank accounts,and other financial and accounting books and records.
in their opposition to the motion,wertheimers made no separation or distinction,evidentiary or otherwise,between or among any of the multiple roche corporate entities,treating them all under the single moniker,the roche group not a legal entity but a name used by the ultimate swiss parent,roche holding,in certain consolidated financial and marketing reports.nor did wertheimers present any evidence of management or control of the domestic corporations by either of the swiss defendants in terms of their core business functions of the manufacture,production,sales,or distribution of pharmaceuticals,or in terms of the financial or accounting operations of either of the two roche companies.
wertheimers did present abundant evidence of integrated corporate activity among the roche affiliated companies in one single safety.this was reflected in the worldwide cooperation and collaboration among roche pharmaceutical companies,regardless of domicile,in the gathering and study of drug adverse events reports,and in using these universally consolidated data for purposes of consistent drug labeling and reporting to various government drug regulatory agencies around the world,including the fda in the united states.
in most instances,the evidence in this regard did not identify actions as having been performed by a particular roche company.but it was established through the declaration of hoffman internal legal counsel that in the united states,it was roche,the new jersey corporation,that was the holder of the new drug application pursuant to which that entity sought and obtained approval for marketing accutane from the united states food and drug administration.according to fda regulations,then,it was this corporation,and not either of the swiss roche defendants,that was responsible and accountable for drug labeling and reporting issues in this country.cfr,see health human services,fda,guidance for industry guideline for postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences.though it was clear that there was collaboration and integrated corporate involvement among the various roche companies concerning regulatory and drug labeling issues and the collection of adverse event data,the swiss defendants expressly denied either having labeled,or having controlled the labeling of,accutane in the united states in the declarations filed in support of the motion.
on this record,the actual evidence concerning the degree of control over drug labeling and the entire adverse event data collection and reporting processes exercised by either of the swiss roche companies over the roche defendants is largely undisputed.the parties nevertheless maintain opposing contentions about the characterization of this evidence or conclusions that may be drawn from it wertheimers assert that the facts demonstrate control and domination over the roche defendants by the swiss defendants,who counter that the evidence shows only mutual collaboration in the isolated area of drug safety,and nothing more.the legal dispute that pivots on these facts is whether this single arena of roche integrated corporate activity is enough to establish the roche defendants as mere agents for purposes of jurisdiction,or to constitute them as just incorporated departments of the swiss roche conglomerate,or to show that either swiss defendant exercised pervasive and continuous control over either roche for purposes of applying the representative services doctrine as a species of agency.
what the evidence did establish is that since approximately,all the roche pharmaceutical companies worldwide have undertaken a collaborative effort to make uniform and global their processes for the collection,evaluation,and reporting of adverse drug side effects.this effort appears to have been designed to meet governmental drug regulatory and labeling requirements.it was directed and organized from outside the united states,though the roche companies were themselves in control of and responsible for direct dealing with the fda,including with respect to both drug labeling issues within the united states and the reporting of foreign adverse events as required by united states federal law.roche entities in basel,switzerland had input on these issues as well,and the various entities acted cooperatively and collaboratively,but no particular swiss roche entity appears to have unilaterally directed or controlled the roche companies on these discrete drug adverse event or labeling issues in a linear,sense,or beyond the establishment of general corporate policy.instead,cooperation and collaborative best characterize the interplay among the various roche companies concerning the global collection and reporting of adverse drug event data and related activities,even though the data were physically organized and analyzed in england and roche executive corporate policies on these subjects did indeed emanate from switzerland.
wertheimers contended below,as they do here,that the facts concerning the collection of adverse event data and drug labeling and regulatory issues compel both a finding of agency and application of the representative services doctrine,such that jurisdiction can and should be exercised over both swiss defendants on this basis.for this contention,they heavily rely on a florida federal district court unpublished orders in bishop roche,et,in which the court concluded that personal jurisdiction over the swiss entities could be exercised under florida law based on agency significant to that court were the roche consolidated financial reporting and the collaborative drug regulatory compliance activities.but,according to the swiss defendants,under swiss law,roche holding is required to establish a financial report for accounting purposes that consolidates the financial results of companies in which it owns a direct or indirect interest and such reporting does not affect the independence of the corporate entities that are included within the report.wertheimers did not rebut this evidence.
the trial court order denying the motion to quash here does not state its basis.the trial judge referenced the bishop orders at the hearing,however,and stated that he was focusing on issues of control and relying on four specific items of evidence in exercising jurisdiction,all of which relate to the issue of agency and,ultimately,application of the representative services doctrine.this cited evidence concerns just the one area of collaborative,corporate global collection,evaluation,and reporting of adverse event data and the generation of the core data sheet.this document is the roche medical and scientific policy,authority,and opinion that is formulated in switzerland about a particular drug,and it is the primary information about the drug that goes into the labeling and drug reporting processes worldwide,subject to local corporate determinations and regulatory requirements.

basic principles of jurisdiction 
california statute permits a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant to the full extent permitted by the due process clause of the united states constitution.code civ,pavlovich,supra,cal th at,d.jurisdiction may be exercised on any basis not inconsistent with the federal or state constitution.vons,supra,cal th at,d.in order to satisfy due process requirements,the defendant must have minimum contacts with the forum state such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.internat.shoe washington.burger king rudzewicz,d pavlovich,supra,cal th at,d,vons,supra,cal th at,d.minimum contacts exist where the defendant conduct in the forum state is such that he should reasonably anticipate being subject to suit there,and it is reasonable and fair to force him to do so.volkswagen woodson,d volkswagen kulko california superior court,d kulko pavlovich,supra,cal th at,d,vons,supra,cal th at,d.in contrast,contacts that are random,fortuitous,or attenuated do not rise to the minimum level,and general jurisdiction can not be exercised under these circumstances.burger king,supra,at.vons,supra,cal th at,d.
pertinent here,we apply jurisdictional principles with an abundance of caution where the defendant is a foreign corporation.in this setting,the question whether jurisdiction may be constitutionally exercised depends upon the circumstances of each individual case t he analysis is concerned with weighing the various relevant contacts by the foreign corporation within the state attempting to exercise jurisdiction.empire steel superior court cal d.sonora,supra,th at,d.but in every case of an international defendant,the procedural and substantive interests of other nations in a state court assertion of jurisdiction,as well as the federal interests in government foreign relations policies,will be best served by a careful inquiry into the reasonableness of the assertion of jurisdiction in the particular case,and an unwillingness to find the serious burdens on an alien defendant outweighed by minimal interests on the part of the plaintiff or the forum state.great care and reserve should be exercised when extending our notions of personal jurisdiction into the international field.united states first national city bank,d harlan,dissenting.asahi metal industry superior court,d asahi metal.
the nature and the quality of the defendant contacts determine whether jurisdiction,if exercised,is general or specific.general jurisdiction exists when a defendant is domiciled in the forum state or his activities there are substantial,continuous,and systematic.helicopteros nacionales de colombia hall,d helicopteros vons,supra,cal th at,d.factors leading to the conclusion that a defendant contacts in the forum are continuous and of which exist here with respect to the swiss maintenance of an office,presence of employees,use of bank accounts,and the marketing or selling of products in the forum state.helicopteros,supra,at.as the minimum contacts test is not susceptible of mechanical application kulko,supra,at,these listed factors are not exhaustive,but they provide guidance as to the type and degree of contacts the defendant must have in order to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction.
even if a nonresident defendant contacts with the forum state are not substantial,continuous,and systematic so as to support general jurisdiction,a court may still exercise specific or limited jurisdiction.this results where the defendant has purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities in california,thereby invoking the benefits and protections of its laws the claim arises out of the defendant activity and the exercise of jurisdiction would be fair and reasonable and would comport with notions of fair play and substantial justice.helicopteros,supra,at.vons,supra,cal th at,d,pavlovich,supra,cal th at,d,sonora,supra,th at,d.
encompassed within the purview of general jurisdiction are the theories of alter ego and agency,of which the representative services doctrine is a species.sonora,supra,th at,d.under these theories,the jurisdictional analysis bypasses the foreign defendant direct minimum contacts with california as the contacts of that company are imputed via the presence of the local agent,through whom the foreign principal acts.
to invoke alter ego,two conditions must be met there must be such a unity of interest and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the separate personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality exist and there must be an inequitable result if the acts in question are treated as those of the corporation alone.sonora,supra,th at,d associated vendors,oakland meat d.
the exercise of general jurisdiction through agency requires an analysis distinct from that of alter ego,though some of the factors are similar.sonora,supra,th at,d.in the case of alter ego,the court pierces the corporate veil.in the case of agency the corporate identity is preserved but the principal is held for the acts of the agent.northern natural gas of omaha,nebraska superior court d.an agency is proved by evidence that the entity for whom the work was performed had the right to control the activities of the alleged agent.kim sumitomo bank th,d.thus,the hallmark of agency is the exercise of control over the agent by the principal.
but for purposes of jurisdiction,the analysis begins with the firm proposition that neither ownership nor control of a subsidiary corporation by a foreign parent corporation,without more,subjects the parent to the jurisdiction of the state where the subsidiary does business.sonora,supra,th at,d.control in this context means the degree of direction and oversight normal and expected from the status of ownership it comprehends such common characteristics as interlocking directors and officers,consolidated reporting,and shared professional services.citations.the relationship of owner to owned contemplates a close financial connection between parent and subsidiary and a certain degree of direction and management exercised by the former over the latter.citations.sonora,supra,at,d.
thus,for purposes of acquiring jurisdiction over the foreign parent company based on agency,that company must exercise a degree of control over the local entity that is more pervasive than these common features signal.it must veer into management by the exercise of control over the internal affairs of the subsidiary and the determination of how the company will be operated on a basis.sammons enterprises,superior court d.williams canon.it is the rare occasion where a court is willing to treat a parent and subsidiary as one entity for jurisdictional purposes.calvert huckins.in the absence of a showing of fraud or injustice,courts will generally respect the presumption of corporate separateness in a jurisdictional analysis.sammons,supra,d at.
the law does identify one situation where the acts of the parent cross the line of legitimate ownership and control of the subsidiary,exposing the parent to the jurisdiction of the state in which the subsidiary does business.this circumstance is when the nature and extent of control exercised over the subsidiary is so pervasive and continual that the subsidiary is but the agent or instrumentality of the parent even though separate corporate formalities are maintained.sonora,supra,th at,d.the control exercised must be over and above that to be expected as an incident of the parent ownership of the subsidiary and must reflect the parent purposeful disregard of the subsidiary independent corporate existence.id.at,d dvi,superior court th,d.general executive control is insufficient.rather,there must be a strong showing beyond simply facts evidencing the broad oversight typically indicated by the common ownership and common directorship present in the normal relationship.citations.as a practical matter,the parent must be shown to have moved beyond the establishment of general policy and direction for the subsidiary and in effect taken over performance of the subsidiary operations in carrying out that policy.citations.sonora,supra,th at,d.mere ownership of a locally incorporated subsidiary does not warrant the exercise of jurisdiction over a foreign corporation unless the foreign parent manipulates the subsidiary to the detriment of creditors or the subsidiary is the alter ego of the parent.empire steel,supra,cal d at,citations omitted.westinghouse electric superior court cal d.sahlein music nippon gakki,d.
under the representative services doctrine,as a species of agency,general jurisdiction may be exercised over a related foreign defendant principal,where the local entity as agent essentially exists only to further the business of the foreign entity,and but for the domestic entity existence,the foreign entity would be performing those functions in the forum itself.sonora,supra,th at,d.the doctrine supports jurisdiction when the local subsidiary performs a function that is compatible with,and assists the parent in the pursuit of,the parent own business sonora,supra,th at,d.
in contrast,jurisdiction will not lie where the parent is a true holding company the business of which is not operations but passive investment.sonora,supra,th at,d.in this setting,application of the doctrine is limited to the circumstance in which the parent uses a subsidiary to do what it otherwise would do itself in the operational sense.ibid.the doctrine has been applied not only in the context,but also where the two companies are separately owned affiliates,and the local company nevertheless performs functions in furtherance of the foreign company,as opposed to its own,business.paneno centres for academic programmes abroad th,d.
the exercise of jurisdiction over either swiss defendant based on the forum contacts of the roche defendants was error 
as to neither swiss defendant,hoffman or roche holding,was there substantial,indeed any,evidence of its own direct minimum contacts or purposeful availment of the forum such that the exercise of jurisdiction,whether general or specific,by a california court was proper.
the only theory seriously posited by wertheimers for the exercise of jurisdiction over either swiss defendant was agency via application of the representative services doctrine they urge that the swiss entities have minimum contacts with the state of california through the acts of the roche defendants,who wertheimers assert,are their agents.but the record here does not establish agency with respect to either swiss defendant,as evidence of the requisite level of pervasive and continual control that defines the relationship for purposes of jurisdiction under california law is lacking as to each of them.sonora,supra,th at,d cislaw southland th,d.
in fact,with respect to the operations of the roche terms of management of the manufacture,sales,and distribution of pharmaceutical or chemical products,or the associated auditing or financial aspects of this was a void of evidence of control exerted by either swiss defendant.indeed,there was nothing to suggest that either swiss defendant was even involved in these managerial operations or that the roche defendants did not actually function as independent entities.the facts instead showed the opposite,with no more than a bilateral,collaborative involvement or corporate integration by the roche defendants with the swiss roche affiliates in the discrete area of drug safety.even here,the degree of control over the processes exercised by any swiss entity was not pervasive or continual,and it did not exceed that ordinary and necessary degree of control incident to ownership of a subsidiary or rise to the point of purposeful disregard of the subsidiary independent existence.sonora,supra,th at,d.
pharmaceutical companies worldwide operate within governmental regulatory schemes for the benefit and protection of the public health and welfare.in the united states,drug companies are required by fda regulations to report spontaneous adverse events occurring within the united states and to report on f oreign,literature,and study reports involving s erious,unlabeled events and i ncreased frequency of serious,labeled events.health human services,fda,guidance for industry guideline for postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences.reports of serious,unlabeled events must be reported to the fda as soon as possible,but in any case within working days of the time of initial receipt of the information by the applicant.id.at these reporting obligations that govern the roche defendants thus extend beyond the united states and require these companies to establish effective mechanisms to ensure rapid information transfer from their foreign affiliates.id.at.in fact,according to fda regulations,the roche the sponsors of accutane in the united themselves required to be responsible to,and to deal directly with,the fda concerning these reporting issues relating to accutane in this country.cfr,
in order to meet these requirements,the roche defendants,in cooperation with other entities worldwide,established a global and centralized drug safety reporting system to ensure optimal compliance with a strong ethical commitment and today regulatory requirements.bess,a successful global drug safety system the roche experience,drug information.the roche activities related to the system of drug labeling and regulatory processes were indeed organized in switzerland.the generation of the roche core data sheet for a particular drug,including accutane,was also directed out of basel,and the roche affiliates were not authorized to generate an independent medical opinion that was inconsistent with that contained in this document.but it was undisputed that the united states roche affiliates collaborated in the development of the core data sheet,which was just the minimum scientific information to be published about a particular drug.it was also undisputed that each roche affiliate had the ability to modify this information to comply with local drug labeling and reporting requirements,and that the united states roche entities had some authoritative say if there was disagreement over these issues,subject only to deference to general,executive policy over these matters that originated from outside the united states.
apart from the collection of adverse event drug data and related labeling and regulatory issues,there was evidence of consolidated financial reports of all the roche entities,which,according to hoffman and holding,are required of parent companies under swiss law.but the roche entities still maintained their own separate financial and accounting books and records.there was also evidence of some consolidated media releases that addressed activities of various roche entities without distinction or separation between or among them.but under california law,consolidated reporting,joint employment of professional services,and the use of we or the company are typical and actually expected of affiliated or wholly owned companies,and such facts do not establish agency for purposes of jurisdiction.sonora,supra,th at,d dvi,supra,th at,d consolidated sec reporting insufficient for jurisdiction.the evidence here of joint reporting or collective media releases did not go beyond this normal incidence of ownership that is contemplated within the context.accordingly,this evidence does not subject the swiss defendants to the exercise of jurisdiction.ibid.
fundamentally,then,wertheimers presented no evidence of control over the roche companies by either swiss defendant in terms of management of their core,manufacture,distribution,and sales of the financial or accounting aspects of these drug operations.and,in terms of the exercise of control by any swiss roche entity over the roche entities in any respect,there was only the evidence of cooperation and collaborated implementation by the roche entities of roche global company policies and procedures concerning drug safety that emanated from roche switzerland.
thus,the question presented distills down to this was the degree to which either of the swiss roche defendants managed the global collecting,study,or reporting of adverse drug events and corresponding labeling and regulatory only aspect of any modicum of control to establish the roche defendants as agents or instrumentalities of either swiss company such that the exercise of general jurisdiction over either hoffman or roche holding by a california court is proper this question must be addressed separately as to each of these defendants.on this record,as to each,we answer this question in the negative.this conclusion is compelled by the record here and in that sense,it is a product of the respective burdens of proof that the parties bore in the trial court on the motion to quash.
with respect to roche holding,there was no evidence that this entity is,or conducts itself as,anything other than a true passive holding company that globally invests in pharmaceutical subsidiaries,including the two roche defendants here,with no exercise of operational control whatsoever over these subsidiaries.ownership or control of a subsidiary by a parent corporation,without more,is insufficient to subject the parent to jurisdiction in the state where the subsidiary does business.cannon cudahy.sonora,supra,th at,d.where,as here,the evidence establishes that the business of the foreign holding company is mere passive investment,the exercise of jurisdiction based on a theory of agency is wholly improper.sonora,supra,th at,d.thus,the trial court erred with respect to its exercise of jurisdiction over roche holding because wertheimers did not meet their burden of proving that this entity is other than a passive parent holding company,which merely invests in pharmaceutical subsidiaries and exercises the normal and expected incidents of ownership such as the setting of general and executive corporate policy.
the trial court likewise erred by the exercise of jurisdiction over hoffman.while this entity is not a holding company and thus can not defeat jurisdiction on the same basis as its parent,roche holding,the record does not contain substantial evidence to justify the exercise of jurisdiction over it by a california court as a matter of law.this conclusion holds true under general principles of agency,as well as under the representative services doctrine.
in other words,the record does not establish either that hoffman exercised pervasive and continuous control over the business of either of the roche defendants so as to establish a general agency relationship,or that the united states entities acted as mere instrumentalities of hoffman in the furtherance of its business to invoke jurisdiction under the representative services doctrine.sonora,supra,th at,d paneno,supra,th at,d dvi,supra,th at,d.agency was not established for the simple reason that there was no evidence of pervasive and continuous operational control of either of the roche defendants by hoffman.and,although the collaborative fun
