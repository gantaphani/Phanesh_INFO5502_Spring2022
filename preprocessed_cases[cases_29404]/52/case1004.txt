ron steen,a commercial fisherman,seeks review of a ruling by the court of international trade upholding the decision of the department of agriculture denying his application for a trade adjustment assistance cash benefit.we affirm.
the trade act of,stat,provides for various forms of trade adjustment assistance for workers harmed by competition from imported goods.see.in,congress amended the statute to extend trade adjustment assistance to agricultural commodity producers similarly harmed by competition from imports,trade act of,stat,codified at 
in somewhat simplified summary,the pertinent statutory scheme operates as follows a group of producers of a particular agricultural commodity who feel they have been adversely affected by imports of agricultural products are entitled to file a petition with the secretary of agriculture seeking certification of eligibility for adjustment assistance.the secretary is required to certify the commodity producers for adjustment assistance if the secretary determines that the national average price for the particular commodity in the most recent marketing year is less than percent of the national average price for that commodity for the five previous years and that increases in imports of that commodity or of goods directly competitive with it have contributed importantly to the price decline.c.
in the event a producer group is certified,any individual producer covered by that group certification is eligible for certain benefits,such as free information regarding the feasibility of substituting other commodities for those adversely affected and technical assistance to improve production and marketing of the adversely affected commodities.see e a d.each producer covered by a certification may also apply for a trade adjustment allowance,a cash benefit.to be eligible for that benefit,the producer must submit information establishing,among other requirements,that the producer net farm income as determined by the secretary for the most recent year is less than the producer net farm income for the latest year in which no adjustment assistance was received by the producer.id.a.the amount of the cash benefit paid to the producer is based on the amount of the commodity produced by the applicant in the most recent marketing year and the amount by which the market price of the commodity has fallen during that year,relative to the average price during the previous five years.id.e b.the maximum yearly cash benefit for any producer under the program is.id.c.benefits will not be paid to producers having an adjusted gross income above a certain level.id.e a.
following the enactment of the act,the secretary of agriculture promulgated formal regulations implementing the statute.see trade assistance for farmers.in doing so,the secretary specified that the act applies not only to farmers but also to certain fishermen.in particular,the regulations make statutory benefits available to domestic fishermen whose catch competes directly with imported aquaculture products and who are adversely affected by those imports.the regulations define aquaculture as farm fishing,or the rearing of marine animals in a controlled environment for human consumption.at.
paralleling the statute,the regulations state that any producer of a certified commodity is entitled to free information and technical assistance in adjusting to import competition and may also be eligible for adjustment assistance in the form of cash payments.e.again paralleling the statute,the regulations require a producer applying for monetary benefits to certify,among other things,that his net farm or fishing income for the most recent tax year was less than that during the producer year.id.e.in their original form,the regulations defined net fishing income for individuals as net profit or loss reported on internal revenue service schedule c or form during the tax year that most closely corresponds with the marketing year under consideration.id.that definition was subsequently amended to omit the reference to schedule c.in its current form,the pertinent regulation defines net fishing income to mean net profit or loss reported to the internal revenue service for the tax year that most closely corresponds with the marketing year under consideration.id.because steen application for benefits and the secretary action on that application were both completed before the regulations were revised in november,steen argues that the original version of the definitional regulation,not the amended version,applies to his claim.the government does not expressly dispute that contention,and for purposes of this appeal we assume the earlier version of the regulation applies to steen application.
in,a group of pacific salmon fishermen from washington state successfully petitioned for trade assistance eligibility under the trade act.as a member of that group,steen subsequently filed an individual application for monetary benefits.the secretary denied his application on the ground that he had failed to show that his net fishing income in was lower than his net fishing income in.
steen then filed a complaint in the court of international trade challenging the secretary denial.he noted that although his income from all commercial fishing ventures increased between and,his fishing income from the imported commodity in during the same period.that is,while his net income from all fishing activities increased from to,his earnings from pacific salmon fell from to.he argued that under the statute his net fishing income should be calculated with respect to the imported commodity only and should not be calculated by taking into account his income from other commercial fishing activity.
in a thorough opinion,the court of international trade rejected steen argument and upheld the agriculture department decision denying his application.we sustain the trial court ruling and its analysis in all respects.
while he divides his argument into multiple parts,steen legal position boils down to a single proposition that congress reference to net farm income,as applied to the fishing industry,should be understood to mean net income from the particular commodity for which an adjustment assistance certification has been granted,rather than net income from all fishing activity.as the trial court correctly concluded,that argument is flawed in several respects it is at odds with the plain meaning of the term net farm income and its regulatory extension,net fishing income as well as with other portions of the statute it is unsupported by the goals congress intended the statute to promote and it is contrary to the secretary reasonable definition of the statutory term,to which we are obligated to defer.
first,the terms net farm income and net fishing income are not easily read to mean net income from a single commodity as applied to a farmer or fisherman whose income derives from multiple commodities.the natural way for congress to express that narrower concept would have been to refer to net farm income from the certified commodity.had congress done so,there would have been a compelling case for interpreting the parallel regulatory term net fishing income in the same narrow fashion.however,congress chose the broader terminology.moreover,it did so in the context of a statute that contains several other provisions that are expressly limited to the particular certified import commodity.for example,the statute refers to the price of the certified commodity,c,increases of imports of articles like,or directly competitive with,the certified commodity,id.a c,the amount of the certified commodity covered by the producer application for benefits and produced in the marketing year,id.e a a,e b b,and the information and technical assistance given to the producer in adjusting to import competition with respect to the adversely affected agricultural commodity,id.e a d.in this setting,where congress expressly referred to the market for the particular commodities when it was appropriate to do so,the nearly inescapable inference is that when congress used the broader term net farm income,it meant to encompass income from all farm products,not
