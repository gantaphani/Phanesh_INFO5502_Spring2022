in december,in the midst of a severe financial crisis,the republic of argentina argentina or the republic declared a moratorium on principal and interest payments for more than billion in sovereign debt,including bonds that were issued under a fiscal agency agreement faa.pursuant to two exchange offers in and,argentina restructured over of the faa bonds 
em em and nml capital,nml jointly,plaintiffs own faa bonds that were not restructured.since,argentina has refused to make any scheduled payments on these defaulted bonds.in,plaintiffs filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,seeking to recover their unpaid principal and interest.plaintiffs eventually obtained judgments against argentina,which now total approximately billion.
this appeal concerns plaintiffs ongoing efforts to satisfy their judgments against argentina by attaching funds held by argentina central banking authority,the banco central de la república argentina bcra.in their third amended complaint tac,plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that bcra is argentina alter ego and that,therefore,bcra is liable for argentina debts.if successful,plaintiffs stated intent is to use the declaratory judgment to attach unspecified funds that bcra holds in unnamed foreign jurisdictions.
as an instrumentality of a sovereign state,bcra is ordinarily immune from lawsuits in american courts under the foreign sovereign immunities act,et fsia accordingly,bcra moved to dismiss the tac for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on grounds,as well as for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.on september,the united states district court for the southern district of new york thomas griesa,judge issued an order denying bcra motion.
relevant to this appeal,the district court concluded that bcra had waived its sovereign immunity under two statutory exceptions.first,the district court held that the faa express waiver of sovereign immunity also waived bcra immunity under a because bcra is argentina alter ego.second,the district court held that bcra use of its account with the federal reserve bank of new york frbny constituted commercial activity in the united states,which waived bcra sovereign immunity under a 
because neither of these statutory exceptions applies to this case,the district court erred in denying bcra motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.accordingly,we reverse the district court order of september,and we remand the cause with instructions to dismiss the tac with prejudice.
background 
i.the underlying debt 
in,argentina began issuing debt securities pursuant to a fiscal agency agreement faa bonds.in light of argentina history of defaulting on,or requiring restructuring of,its sovereign obligations,investors demanded that the faa include a waiver of argentina foreign sovereign immunity as to any suit,action,or proceeding against it or its properties,assets or revenues with respect to the faa bonds,and any suit brought for the purpose of enforcing or executing a judgment obtained in a related proceeding argentina agreed to include this waiver of sovereign immunity in the faa 
in december,argentina declared a moratorium on principal and interest payments on more than billion of foreign debt,including the faa bonds since then,argentina has not made principal or interest payments on these bonds.in and,argentina successfully restructured over of its debt by launching global exchange offers,pursuant to which creditors holding the defaulted bonds could exchange them for new securities with modified terms that substantially reduced their value plaintiffs em and nml own faa bonds that were not restructured.
beginning in,plaintiffs filed multiple actions against argentina in the southern district of new york in an effort to recover the full amounts due on their defaulted bonds.argentina did not dispute that its sovereign immunity had been waived in the faa.plaintiffs eventually obtained numerous final judgments against argentina,which now total approximately billion these judgments remain unpaid.
ii.litigation against bcra 
on december,argentina president,néstor kirchner,issued two emergency executive decrees decree and decree jointly,the decrees both of which involved funds held by bcra the first decree provided that reserves held by bcra in excess of the amount needed to support argentina monetary could be used for payment of obligations undertaken with international monetary authorities.the decree labeled these excess reserves unrestricted reserves.the second decree directed the ministry of economy and production to take the necessary steps to repay argentina debt to the international monetary fund imf out of the unrestricted reserves.as we previously noted 
at the time of the decrees,bcra had approximately billion in reserves and needed billion to cover the monetary base thus,approximately billion in reserves became unrestricted reserves pursuant to the decrees.on december,the ministry issued resolution,directing bcra to repay argentina debt to the imf and providing that,in exchange,argentina would give bcra a note 
soon after these decrees were issued,plaintiffs made their first attempt to satisfy their judgments against argentina by attaching funds held by bcra.on december,plaintiffs moved in the southern district of new york for an ex parte order to restrain funds held by bcra.plaintiffs asserted that the decrees had the effect of transferring ownership of certain bcra assets including funds held in bcra account with the frbny from bcra to argentina.the district court entered temporary restraining orders with respect to,inter alia,the property held by bcra in eight garnishee banking institutions,including the frbny 
on january,the district court vacated the temporary restraining orders plaintiffs appealed the district court decision,maintaining that the decrees amounted to an expropriation by argentina of bcra assets in order to pay argentina debt to the imf,and that,consequently,the funds in bcra frbny account had become argentina property.
on january,we rejected plaintiffs argument and affirmed the district court order,holding that the decrees did not alter property rights with respect to the frbny funds because they did not create an attachable interest on the part of argentina in the frbny funds.although we thus rejected plaintiffs argument,we noted the difference between two theories of attachment that the decrees transferred to the republic ownership or control over the assets of bcra and that argentina controlled bcra itself,that bcra was argentina alter ego we concluded that plaintiffs had not established that bcra funds were transferred to argentina,but we noted that plaintiffs allegations regarding argentina misdeeds might have lent some credence to the theory that is,we suggested that plaintiffs could potentially argue that bcra was so extensively controlled by argentina that a relationship of principal and agent is created,or that recognizing bcra separate juridical status would work fraud or injustice and that,if successful,this claim would subject all of bcra assets to potential attachment by argentina judgment creditors.
in september,while bcra i was pending,plaintiffs commenced a new action seeking a declaratory judgment that,pursuant to first national city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,d bancec,bcra was liable for argentina debts.specifically,plaintiffs argued that argentina consistent disregard for bcra independence had vitiated any presumption of separateness to which bcra was entitled,transforming bcra into argentina alter ego.
in this new action,plaintiffs also pursued attachment orders against bcra frbny funds based on this theory.on april,the district court granted plaintiffs attachment motions and ruled that,at the time of bcra repayment of argentina debt to the imf december,bcra was argentina alter ego the district court also concluded that the attachment of bcra frbny funds did not violate b,which immunizes property of a foreign central bank held for its own account.accordingly,the district court authorized the attachment of the million deposited in bcra frbny account.
this order was appealed and in,in bcra ii,we vacated the attachment on the sole ground that the funds held in bcra frbny account were immune from execution under b we declined to reach the district court determination and instead concluded that these funds were immune from attachment without regard to whether the bcra is independent from its parent state pursuant to bancec.we thus intimated no view as to whether the district court correctly determined that argentina control of bcra was sufficient to disregard the presumption of juridical separateness under bancec.accordingly,we vacated the district court attachment orders with respect to the frbny funds and remanded the cause to the district court for further proceedings.
iii.this case upon remand 
on remand,plaintiffs filed the tac the operative complaint for purposes of this appeal pursuant to our ruling in bcra ii,funds held in bcra accounts with the frbny are immune from attachment.accordingly,the tac is framed more broadly the declaratory judgment it seeks would establish that bcra is the alter ego of argentina and that bcra is thus liable for any and all of argentina debts plaintiffs stated purpose for seeking this judgment is to enable them to attach any asset held by bcra anywhere in the world in satisfaction of their judgments against argentina this option was arguably left open by bcra ii,which foreclosed the possibility of attaching assets deposited in bcra own accounts in the united states,but did not otherwise address plaintiffs ability to reach bcra assets elsewhere.
in november,argentina and bcra moved to dismiss the tac for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,lack of personal jurisdiction,and failure to state a claim.oral argument on this motion was held at a conference of the district court on september.plaintiffs argued that bcra had waived its sovereign immunity on two grounds.first,plaintiffs asserted a theory of implied waiver that is,because bcra is the alter ego of argentina,argentina express waiver of immunity in the faa should be imputed to bcra second,plaintiffs asserted that bcra waived its immunity by engaging in commercial activity in new york through its frbny account 
in denying the motion to dismiss,the district court explicitly adopted plaintiffs arguments for jurisdiction.in its bench order,the district court stated 
what i going to do this afternoon is to deny the motions to dismiss the tac.i believe there is jurisdiction in the way plaintiffs counsel cohen describes jurisdiction which makes it appropriate to entertain the action and considering the provisions of the foreign sovereign immunities act,i believe that there is an implied waiver here and i believe there commercial activity so that the provisions of a and a are applicable.
this really is,denying a motion to dismiss,exactly what would emerge from a litigation that has problems.the plaintiffs position has problems,as i indicated.but i think those problems do not require the dismissal of the action.
and i want to repeat something which i sure i said maybe more than once this afternoon and that is,we do have a republic which is acting in a normal way as far as its debts.we do have a situation where there is a completely regular dealing between the r epublic and bcra the way that i sure would exist with the bank of england or the central bank of germany or france or certainly with the federal reserve bank.we do have that.we have irregularities.
the reason that i believe the action should be held open is i think there is a very legitimate claim by the plaintiffs here that for certain purposes bcra is the alter ego of the r epublic.
in the papers before me,the plaintiffs have made a very powerful case of that,and i so held in my earlier decision,and that holding was not what was disturbed by the court of appeals.so,there a very good case of alter ego.
i believe that the court should entertain the idea that it would be desirable to have this court with its experience in this case and its background in this case make some kind of formal ruling of alter ego which could be legitimately used in a proceeding in another state or a foreign country so that the plaintiffs do not have to go to the other state or the foreign country and start in again,once again,and maybe more than once again with this presentation about alter ego.
the motion to dismiss the action is denied 
this appeal followed 
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
in general,our appellate jurisdiction is limited to final decisions of district courts the district court order here is interlocutory.bcra asserts,however,that we have jurisdiction under the collateral order exception to review bcra claim of sovereign immunity as a defense to subject matter jurisdiction 
under this exception,an interlocutory appeal is available for a small class of collateral rulings that do not terminate the litigation in the court below but are nonetheless sufficiently final and distinct from the merits to be appealable without waiting for a final judgment to be entered.to fit within the exception,the interlocutory order must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.
a denial of foreign sovereign immunity generally satisfies the conditions necessary to invoke the collateral order doctrine for instance,in rein socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya we held that all three prongs of the above test were satisfied because the district court ruling on sovereign immunity conclusively determined the issue of subject matter jurisdiction the issue of jurisdiction is separate from the merits and an appeal from final judgment can not repair the damage caused to a sovereign that is improperly required to litigate a case 
notwithstanding the doctrine,plaintiffs assert that we lack appellate jurisdiction here because the immunity question can not be decided without addressing plaintiffs underlying claims on the merits.according to plaintiffs,bcra status is a predicate to holding that the faa waiver binds bcra and,therefore,resolving the immunity issue now would require an unnecessary and burdensome inquiry into the extent of argentina control over bcra.accordingly,plaintiffs urge us to defer review until the district court issues a final judgment 
these arguments are unpersuasive.we have consistently held that the threshold determination is immediately reviewable under the doctrine in fact,this case is similar to fidelity guaranty braspetro oil services in which we also reviewed the denial of a motion to dismiss brought by a purported alter ego,and in which we held that a court reviewing a district court decision must assess whether plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing of alter ego at this point in the litigation.as the supreme court has held,a question of immunity is separate from the merits of the underlying action even though a reviewing court must consider the plaintiff factual allegations in resolving the immunity issue.
at this stage in the case,we must assume the truth of the tac factual allegations,and then assess whether these allegations are sufficient to establish that bcra waived its sovereign immunity.if we are able to determine conclusively that the pleadings do not establish,as a matter of law,that bcra waived its sovereign immunity,it would be inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the doctrine to subject bcra to further burdensome litigation 
accordingly,we conclude that we have jurisdiction under the doctrine to review the district court threshold determination that bcra waived its sovereign immunity pursuant to a the express waiver exception and a the commercial activity exception 
ii.sovereign immunity 
moving to the merits of this appeal,the sole issue we consider is whether the district court erred in its conclusion that bcra waived its sovereign immunity.we review this conclusion de novo 
there is no dispute that bcra is an instrumentality of argentina and that,unless one of the fsia exceptions applies,bcra is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity as a defense to this lawsuit here,the district court concluded that two exceptions applied.first,it held that the faa express waiver of sovereign immunity under a is imputable to bcra as argentina alter ego.second,it held that bcra use of its account at the frbny constituted commercial activity in the united states within the meaning of a.
we address each exception in turn.
legal standards 
the controlling case for when an instrumentality of a sovereign state becomes the alter ego of that state is first national city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,d known as bancec.in bancec,the supreme court created a presumption that government instrumentalities established as juridical entities distinct and independent from their sovereign should normally be treated as such.according to the court,
f reely ignoring the separate status of government instrumentalities would result in substantial uncertainty over whether an instrumentality assets would be diverted to satisfy a claim against the sovereign,and might thereby cause third parties to hesitate before extending credit to a government instrumentality without the government guarantee.as a result,the efforts of sovereign nations to structure their governmental activities in a manner deemed necessary to promote economic development and efficient administration would surely be frustrated 
the supreme court drew support for this proposition in the legislative history of b the provision of the fsia addressing the circumstances in which a judgment creditor may execute upon the assets of a foreign government instrumentality 
section b of the fsia will not permit execution against the property of one agency or instrumentality to satisfy a judgment against another,unrelated agency or instrumentality.there are compelling reasons for this.if law did not respect the separate juridical identities of different agencies or instrumentalities,it might encourage foreign jurisdictions to disregard the juridical divisions between different public corporations or between a public corporation and its independent subsidiary.however,a court might find that property held by one agency is really the property of another 
therefore,bancec recognizes a statutory presumption that a foreign government determination that its instrumentality is to be accorded separate legal status will be honored but this presumption of separateness may be rebutted by evidence establishing an relationship between the instrumentality and the sovereign state that created it.specifically,the presumption may be overcome and an relationship established if the instrumentality is so extensively controlled by its owner that a relationship of principal and agent is created or the recognition of an instrumentality separate legal status would work a fraud or injustice.as we previously noted,both bancec and the fsia legislative history caution against too easily overcoming the presumption of separateness.
under bancec,we are thus required to presume that bcra is legally separate and distinct from argentina.this presumption is overcome only if the tac alleges facts sufficient to establish that either argentina so extensively controlled bcra that a relationship of principal and agent was created or recognizing bcra as a separate entity would work a fraud or injustice 
for the reasons that follow,neither prong of this test has been satisfied.therefore,the presumption that bcra is separate from argentina has not been rebutted.because argentina express waiver of sovereign immunity in the faa does not apply to bcra,plaintiffs reliance on the a exception necessarily fails.
extensive control 
we address first bancec extensive control prong.while measuring the level of control exercised over an instrumentality by a foreign sovereign is,courts have articulated several indicia to guide the inquiry among the factors that have been deemed relevant are whether the sovereign nation uses the instrumentality property as its own ignores the instrumentality separate status or ordinary corporate formalities deprives the instrumentality of the independence from close political control that is generally enjoyed by government agencies requires the instrumentality to obtain approvals for ordinary business decisions from a political actor and issues policies or directives that cause the instrumentality to act directly on behalf of the sovereign state these factors are relevant to answering the touchstone inquiry for extensive control namely,whether the sovereign state exercises significant and repeated control over the instrumentality operations 
bcra was founded in as argentina central bank by statute,it is a institution,which is charged with acting as argentina agent and depository before international monetary,banking,and financial entities,as well as with regulating the argentine banking system and financial sector bcra primary responsibility is to maintain the value of legal tender in argentina accordingly,it shall exclusively issue banknotes and coins in the argentine nation,and invest a portion of its external assets in deposits or other transactions with foreign banking institutions.moreover,bcra is managed by an independent board of directors appointed by the national executive power with the consent of the national senate bcra has the authority to purchase and sell property,hold accounts,and sue and be sued in courts under its own name 
thus far,on paper,bcra appears to be a typical government instrumentality entitled to separate legal status.
however,plaintiffs argue,and the district court presumably accepted,that bcra formal independence is belied by argentina extensive control over bcra operations.plaintiffs attempt to buttress this conclusion with three categories of factual allegations.nonetheless,even if we assume the truth of all of them,these facts do not support a claim of extensive control,because whatever control argentina exerted was not tied to bcra operations.
first,the tac alleges that argentina systematically eliminated bcra legal independence by permitting the president to appoint bcra officers for an unspecified period without senate approval and removing bcra governors who supported the central bank independence from the executive branch but courts have consistently rejected the argument that the appointment or removal of an instrumentality officers or directors,standing alone,overcomes the bancec presumption the hiring and firing of board members or officers is an exercise of power incidental to ownership,and ownership of an instrumentality by the parent state is not synonymous with control over the instrumentality operations.governments commonly exercise some measure of control over their instrumentalities,much like parent corporations commonly control certain aspects of otherwise independent subsidiaries.missing from plaintiffs allegations are any claims that argentina appointment of board members then caused it to interfere in and dictate bcra daily business decisions.ensuring that a board of directors of an instrumentality shares the sovereign goals and policies for the instrumentality is not,by itself,extensive control.the sovereign must instead use its influence over these directors in order to interfere with the instrumentality ordinary business affairs.
second,the tac alleges that argentina issued executive decrees and legislative amendments to make it easier for the government to borrow from bcra,and that argentina subsequently borrowed tens of billions of dollars from bcra in order to pay argentina debts to the imf and other private creditors but not to these plaintiffs however,as the united states argued before us as amicus in bcra ii the repayment by bcra of argentina other debts does not establish the existence of an relationship,because central banks commonly perform payment functions for their governments,including central banks that are relatively independent from their governments.although the united states also argued that the imf status as a preferred creditor justified the payments that question goes to whether argentina choice to pay one set of creditors over another was legitimate an inquiry that is unrelated to whether argentina controlled bcra in order to accomplish those payments.
here,the republic plan to borrow money from bcra was not executed by the argentine government alone.instead,the proposals received the necessary review and approval by bcra legal advisers and bcra board of directors and one bcra governor testified before argentina congress that it made policy sense to permit the government to borrow funds from bcra while its reserves earned relatively low interest therefore,the republic decision to use bcra to repay its debt to the imf and other creditors is not indicative of the extensive control that concerned the supreme court in bancec 
finally,the tac alleges that argentina and bcra coordinated their activities in implementing an inflationary monetary policy however,governments and central banks including the government and the federal reserve often consult and coordinate their actions with respect to monetary policy whether the resulting policy is considered by some commentators as too inflationary or deflationary is irrelevant to the question of whether argentina exercised control over bcra.it is not our role to monetary policy decisions made by foreign governments.we thus agree with the position of the united states in bcra ii central banks ordinarily have a high degree of interaction with their parent foreign governments,and as such,courts should give significant deference to a foreign government conduct its central bank.the alleged coordination of actions between argentina and bcra is simply not sufficient to establish extensive control.
considered cumulatively,these allegations certainly establish that the republic sought the assistance of bcra in responding to an extremely severe debt crisis,and that argentina took steps to ensure that bcra shared its policies and goals during this time.they do not establish,however,that the republic so extensively controlled bcra operations as to transform bcra into the republic alter ego.most of the actions allegedly taken by bcra are governmental functions performed by most central banks i,paying a nation creditors,controlling currency flows,and keeping foreign exchange deposits.plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that these actions,or any others,were the result of argentina substantial control over the business decisions or daily functions of bcra thus,these actions,standing alone,are not the type of activities that illustrate a complete takeover of bcra operations by the republic 
because the facts alleged do not establish that the republic exercised extensive control over bcra operations,the first prong of the bancec test has not been met.
fraud or injustice 
the second prong of the bancec test asks whether the recognition of bcra as a separate entity would work a fraud or injustice.the purpose of this prong is to prevent foreign states from avoid ing their obligations by engaging in abuses of corporate form.
for instance,in bancec itself the presumption that cuba instrumentality bancec was a separate juridical entity was rebutted,because cuba had dissolved bancec and taken complete control of its assets in.because cuba effectively absorbed bancec,the supreme court granted citibank recourse against cuba as the controlling principal and real beneficiary of the lawsuit that bancec had filed against citibank.similarly,in bridas.the fifth circuit found fraud or injustice where turkmenistan dissolved a oil company that was in breach of a joint venture with plaintiff,and replaced it with an oil company endowed with immunity protection.and in an unpublished district court case relied on by plaintiffs,kensington international republic of congo the republic of congo structured its relationship to its purportedly independent oil company by,inter alia designing the company corporate structure to allow congo to engage in unnecessarily complex transactions and charades for the purpose of confounding its creditors passing all proceeds from oil sales on to the government,rather than permitting the company to exercise its right to collect a percentage on transactions and commingling state and company assets.
the common thread in these cases is that the sovereign states at issue abused the corporate form.in bancec,cuba sought relief in a court of the united states while simultaneously trying to shield itself from liability by asserting its claim through its dissolved instrumentality.in bridas,turkmenistan transferred assets from one instrumentality to another in order to escape liability and in kensington,congo created a sham entity with purported sovereign immunity in order to shield its own assets from judgment creditors.
plaintiffs allegations here fall far short of the flagrant frauds and injustices exhibited in these other cases.at bottom,plaintiffs claim is that it would be a fraud or injustice to allow argentina to use funds from bcra to pay certain preferred creditors while at the same time stiffing plaintiffs.as noted above,at least in the case of the imf,there is nothing irregular or fraudulent about argentina recognizing a preference for repaying one set of creditors over another.
moreover,plaintiffs do not allege that bcra separate juridical status has been actively used by argentina to block plaintiffs enforcement attempts against argentina itself,or that argentina has transferred its funds to bcra in order to shield them from plaintiffs.although plaintiffs do allege that bcra transferred some of the funds deposited in its frbny account to the bank of international settlements in switzerland,this action did nothing to frustrate plaintiffs ability to collect on their judgments against argentina.as we held in bcra ii,funds deposited in bcra own account were in any event immune from attachment therefore,as a practical matter,bcra was only guilty of moving funds from one account to another.
plaintiffs factual allegations simply do not show that argentina has used bcra to frustrate the collection efforts of its creditors,or that argentina treated bcra as a sham entity to hide its own assets.these allegations simply do not establish that the recognition of bcra separate status would work a fraud or injustice within the meaning of bancec.
because the tac fails to counter,much less overcome,the presumption that bcra and argentina are legally separate entities,bcra does not constitute argentina alter ego for the purposes of this suit.argentina express waiver of its own sovereign immunity in the faa,therefore,may not be imputed to bcra.accordingly,we conclude that the express waiver exception a does not apply to this case 
commercial activity 
the second exception to sovereign immunity relied upon by the district court is the commercial activity exception codified at a,which,in relevant part,provides that a foreign state is not immune in an action based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states.this exception applies only when there exists a degree of closeness between the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint and the commercial activities engaged in by the foreign state or instrumentality 
here,the gravamen of the tac is that bcra,as argentina purported alter ego,is liable for the judgments resulting from argentina default on its faa bonds as noted above,bcra was not a party to the faa and was not involved in argentina decision to cease making principal and interest payments on faa bonds.therefore,the gravamen of plaintiffs claim on the merits is based on a series of actions taken by bcra after.
however,none of these actions after loans made by bcra to argentina,coordination of monetary policy,the appointment and removal of bcra governors are commercial activities that occurred in the united states in fact,bcra only alleged commercial activity in the united states was its use of its frbny account to purchase dollars.plaintiffs assert that these dollars allowed bcra to make loans to argentina,which argentina then used to repay debts to creditors other than plaintiffs 
the fact that these dollars were delivered to bcra account with the frbny,however,is entirely incidental to plaintiffs claim on the merits that claim would be no different had bcra deposited those dollars in any other bank abroad.in this way,plaintiffs claims are similar to those asserted in kensington international itoua there,a creditor of the republic of congo alleged that a oil company had entered into prepayment agreements in exchange for oil rights,which caused congo oil revenues to be diverted away from the creditor.the creditor attempted to invoke the fsia commercial activity exception on the grounds that the oil at issue was shipped to the united states and the premium payments were made in the united states.we rejected the creditor argument,however,reasoning that the requisite nexus did not exist between the commercial activity in the united states the shipment of oil and the premium payments,and the gravamen of the complaint the prepayment agreements executed in france.because the alleged activity in the united states was entirely incidental to the improper conduct,we declined to apply the exception to waive sovereign immunity 
as in kensington,the claim here also lacks any nexus between bcra commercial activity in the united states the purchase of dollars through the frbny account and the gravamen of the complaint the claim,which turns on loans made by bcra to argentina in argentina.it is similarly incidental that bcra purchased these dollars using an account in the united states.whatever adverse consequences plaintiffs allegedly suffered from the bcra loans to argentina,they would have suffered the same consequences had bcra used any other bank account in the united states or abroad.
accordingly,adopting plaintiffs theory for jurisdiction here would dramatically expand the scope of the exception to sovereign immunity.any allegation of the wrongful use of dollars outside the united states would conceivably lead to a sovereign immunity waiver,so long as the plaintiff could show that these dollars were acquired in transactions.given new york role as a financial center,every country and every central bank would be at risk of losing their sovereign immunity on this basis.as the united states argued as amicus in bcra ii,weakening the immunity from suit or attachment traditionally enjoyed by the instrumentalities of foreign states could lead foreign central banks,in particular,to withdraw their reserves from the united states and place them in other countries.any significant withdrawal of these reserves could have an immediate and adverse impact on the economy and the global financial system.
because such a capacious understanding of the exception is inconsistent with the fsia presumption that foreign states and instrumentalities enjoy sovereign immunity,we decline to adopt plaintiffs proposed rule.accordingly,we hold that the exception to sovereign immunity a does not apply to this case.
conclusion 
we do not condone or excuse argentina continuing failure to pay the judgments duly entered against it by the district court.our decision that bcra may invoke its own sovereign immunity in this lawsuit is not intended to allow the republic to avoid its obligations,or to continue shirking the debts it has the ability to pay,although we suspect that this will be a predictable and unfortunate outcome of our decision.
nonetheless,bcra is entitled to invoke its own sovereign immunity as a defense to this lawsuit,unless one of the exceptions codified in the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia applies.because both of the exceptions relied upon by plaintiffs fail as a matter of law,the district court erred in denying bcra motion to dismiss under the fsia.
in summary,we hold the following 
we have jurisdiction under the doctrine to review the district court threshold determination that bcra waived its sovereign immunity pursuant to a the express waiver exception and a the commercial activity exception.
first national city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,d bancec sets a high bar for when an instrumentality will be deemed an alter ego of its sovereign state.on these facts,neither prong of the bancec test is satisfied argentina does not exercise sufficiently extensive control over bcra operations,and recognizing bcra separate status would not constitute a fraud or injustice within the meaning of bancec.accordingly,argentina waiver in the faa may not be imputed to also waive bcra independent sovereign immunity.
bcra use of its frbny account is too incidental to the gravamen of plaintiffs claim to serve as the basis for waiving bcra sovereign immunity under the exception to the fsia.
accordingly,we reverse the district court order of september,and we remand the cause with instructions to dismiss the third amended complaint with prejudice.
debt restructuring is a process that allows corporations and sovereign nations facing financial distress to reduce and renegotiate their debts.see david scott,wall street words an a to z guide to investment terms for today investor ed.creditors having difficulty making interest principal payments often restructure their debt to reduce the size of the interest payments and to extend debt maturity.we previously described argentina restructuring as follows in,argentina initiated an exchange offer in which it allowed faa bondholders to exchange their defaulted bonds for new unsecured and unsubordinated external debt at a rate of to cents on the dollar.in exchange for the new debt,participants agreed to forgo various rights and remedies previously available under the faa.in,argentina initiated a second exchange offer with a payment scheme substantially identical to the capital,republic of argentina,cir.

because we conclude that the tac fails to establish that bcra waived its sovereign immunity,see post section ii,we need not and do not reach the issue of whether we have appellate jurisdiction or pendent appellate jurisdiction over bcra other asserted grounds for dismissal,which the district court also rejected.these grounds include that plaintiffs lack article iii standing,because it is speculative whether the declaratory judgment sought by plaintiffs would redress their injury,permit them to recover funds in other jurisdictions and that the tac fails to state a plausible claim that bcra is argentina alter ego.as to the first ground,we take no position on whether a declaratory judgment of the type sought here would satisfy the requirements of article iii.as to the second ground,plaintiffs rule b argument overlaps substantially with our discussion of sovereign immunity,but we decline to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction to review the district court denial of plaintiffs b motion.rather,as we explain in detail below,the tac is to be dismissed solely on grounds.

the district court did not clearly indicate which of these two theories it relied upon in making its determination.it did,however,observe that a general declaration of alter ego could have effects or implications beyond what the court would intend,and that the idea that bcra is in a general way liable for the debts of the republic goes way too far.spa at tr.while the district court ultimately concluded that plaintiffs have a legitimate claim that bcra is the alter ego of argentina for certain purposes,id.at tr,it did not specify what those purposes precedent supports the view,however,that once an instrumentality of a sovereign state has been deemed to be the alter ego of that state under bancec,the instrumentality and the state are to be treated as one and the same for all purposes.see letelier,at the bancec court held that a foreign state instrumentality is answerable just as its sovereign parent would be if the foreign state has abused the corporate form,or where recognizing the instrumentality separate status works a fraud or an injustice.emphasis supplied.because we conclude that the tac fails to plead facts that would establish that bcra has become argentina alter ego for any purpose,we need not address the district court novel conclusion that an instrumentality may become an alter ego for just some,but not all,purposes.
