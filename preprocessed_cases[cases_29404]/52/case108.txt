these appeals and,heard in tandem,challenge an opinion and order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york stanton,and a judgment of the united states tax court kroupa,applying the economic substance doctrine to transactions involving foreign tax credits.in both cases,the taxpayers claim they are entitled to tax credits associated with foreign transactions that the government disallowed because it contends the transactions lacked economic substance.
in american international,united states,in which american international group aig seeks a tax refund of million,the district court held that the economic substance doctrine applies to the foreign tax credit regime and the benefit that aig gained from its transactions is to be calculated by taking into account foreign taxes.accordingly,the district court denied aig motion for partial summary judgment.it certified the matter for interlocutory appeal.
in bank of new york mellon commissioner,which involves alleged tax deficiencies of some million,the tax court held a bench trial on the economic substance of the structured trust advantaged repackaged securities loan product stars purchased by bank of new york mellon bny.the tax court held the effect of foreign taxes is to be considered in the analysis of economic substance and stars lacked economic substance,and thus bny could not claim foreign tax credits associated with stars.the tax court further held that certain income from stars was includible in bny taxable income and bny was not entitled to deduct interest expenses associated with stars,but reversed both rulings on reconsideration.
we hold that the economic substance doctrine applies to the foreign tax credit regime generally,and that both the district court and tax court properly determined the tax implications of the and stars transactions.accordingly,we affirm.
statement of the case 
a.the foreign tax credit regime 
various provisions of the internal revenue code the code seek to mitigate the evil of double taxation.burnet chi.portrait.the code taxes all income of u.taxpayers earned worldwide.a.because this can result in double taxation of a taxpayer income earned abroad by the country in which it was earned as well as the united states congress crafted the foreign tax credit regime.
first established by the revenue act of,the foreign tax credit regime was intended to facilitate business abroad and foreign trade.see cong.rec.app.statement of kitchin we would discourage men from going out after commerce and business in different countries if we maintained this double taxation.under the regime,when a taxpayer pays income tax to another country due to its business activities in that country,the taxpayer can claim a credit against its tax liability for the foreign taxes paid.this foreign tax credit then mitigates double taxation by offsetting the taxpayer taxable income and reducing its overall tax bill.the foreign tax credit regime does not,however,require a taxpayer to alter its form of doing business,its business conduct,or the form of any business transaction in order to reduce its liability under foreign law for tax.e i.
as relevant to the instant cases,the code deems taxes paid by foreign subsidiaries to be paid by their parent companies.thus,in a given tax year,a corporation can claim a foreign tax credit in the same amount as the foreign taxes paid by its foreign subsidiary,reducing its total taxable income.
entitlement to foreign tax credits,however,is predicated on a valid transaction.mertens law of federal income taxation.to be valid and not just a sham,a transaction must involve more than just tax benefits it must have independent economic substance.see demartino comm r,cir a transaction is a sham if it is fictitious or if it has no business purpose or economic effect other than the creation of tax deductions.accordingly,as we discuss below,a court can hold that a taxpayer is not entitled to certain deductions or other tax benefits where it finds that the underlying transaction lacks economic substance beyond its tax benefits.
american international group,united states 
as aig acknowledges,the facts relevant to this appeal are largely undisputed to the extent that there is dispute,we construe the facts in the light most favorable to the party,the government 
between and,aig entered into six transactions with foreign financial institutions through its subsidiary,aig financial products aig fp through these transactions,aig fp borrowed funds at economically favorable rates below libor and invested the funds at rates above libor,ostensibly to make a profit 
each transaction operated as follows.first,aig fp created and funded a foreign affiliate a special purpose vehicle spv to hold and invest funds in a foreign country.next,aig fp sold the spv preferred shares to a foreign lender bank and committed to repurchase the preferred shares on a specific future date at the original sale price.the spv capital was thus primarily comprised of the funds the foreign bank paid for the preferred stock,as well as a smaller contribution from aig.the spv then used this capital to purchase investments,earning income for which the spv paid taxes to the relevant foreign authority.the spv then paid most of the net proceeds of this investment income to the foreign bank as dividends.
for tax purposes,aig claimed that it owned all of the shares of the spv and thus treated the foreign bank funds for the purchase of the preferred shares as a loan.aig then deducted the dividends paid by the spv to the foreign banks as interest expense.aig also claimed foreign tax credits for the full amount of the foreign taxes paid by each spv on the investment income.accordingly,on its tax return,aig reported total gross income from the transactions of million from which it deducted million in interest expenses,for a net taxable income of million.based on the corporate tax rate of,aig owed million in taxes on the transactions.but aig also claimed million in foreign tax credits for the foreign taxes paid by the spvs on total income,which it then used to offset tax not only on its million tax obligation for the transaction,but also on some million in unrelated income.
at the same time,each foreign bank reported to the relevant foreign revenue authority that it owned the preferred stock as an equity investment in the spv.as a result,for foreign tax purposes,the spv was treated as the foreign bank corporate subsidiary.accordingly,instead of treating the spv distribution to the foreign bank as taxable interest on a loan to aig,the foreign bank claimed the payments as dividends on which it paid little,if any,tax.instead,the spv paid tax on the spv income to the relevant foreign authorities.the foreign bank then shared these tax benefits with aig fp by accepting a lower dividend rate than it would have otherwise demanded if its investment income were taxable.
this arrangement effectively reduced aig total tax bill.it also allowed the foreign banks to limit their tax liability,inducing them to accept lower return rates from aig.thus,aig effectively converted certain interest expenses it otherwise would have paid to the foreign banks into foreign tax payments for which it claimed foreign tax credits that it could use in turn to offset unrelated income and reduce its total tax bill.
aig claims that the transactions had economic substance because they were expected to generate a profit of at least million for aig over the life of the transactions.to reach this number,aig calculated profit by taking the spv investment income and subtracting only aig operating expenses and obligations to the foreign banks.thus,in calculating profit,aig ignored the foreign tax paid by the spv the tax paid by aig on the spv investment income and the value of the foreign tax credits claimed by aig.
proceedings below 
on march,the internal revenue service the irs sent aig a statutory notice of deficiency for its taxes.for the taxable year,the notice claimed an additional income tax of million,and interest,penalties,or additions to tax of million.among other penalties and assessments,the irs disallowed the million in foreign tax credits aig claimed in.on july,the irs assessed the additional amounts,which aig paid on august.on august,aig filed a claim for refund for the amounts paid,claiming they were erroneously assessed by the irs.on february,because the irs had not rendered a decision on its refund claim,aig filed a complaint in the district court seeking a refund of million in federal income taxes assessed by the irs and paid by aig for its taxable year.
on july,aig moved for partial summary judgment,arguing that it was entitled,as a matter of law,to foreign tax credits for the income taxes paid to other countries by its subsidiaries.aig argued that the economic substance doctrine does not apply to the foreign tax credit regime and even if the doctrine does apply,the relevant transactions had economic substance because they resulted in million in profit.on march,the district court denied aig motion without prejudice,concluding that the government had demonstrated the need for more discovery.after the close of fact discovery but before the start of expert discovery,aig renewed its motion for partial summary judgment on august,limited to the six transactions.
on march,the district court issued an opinion and order denying aig renewed motion for partial summary judgment.the district court held that the economic substance doctrine applies to the foreign tax credit regime because congress intended foreign tax credits to facilitate only purposive business transactions and foreign taxes are to be included as a cost in the calculation of benefit from the transactions.accordingly,the district court denied aig motion for partial summary judgment.am.int l,united states,civ.lls,wl.
on november,the district court certified its march,opinion and order for interlocutory appeal under b.on november,aig timely filed a petition in this court for permission to appeal under federal rule of appellate procedure a.on march,we granted the petition,and this appeal followed.
bank of new york mellon commissioner 
we accept the facts as found by the tax court at trial unless clearly erroneous.see banker nighswander,martin mitchell,cir.
in,barclays bank,plc a global financial services company headquartered in london,united kingdom and kpmg an audit,tax,and advisory firm started promoting a loan product they called structured trust advantaged repackaged securities or stars to banks.in marketing stars to banks,kpmg explained that a counterparty here barclays would offer a below market loan,the low cost of which would be achieved through the sharing of certain and tax benefits generated by the creation of a trust subject to taxation.bny entered into stars transactions with barclays in november,and the transactions continued until.
we assume familiarity with the tax court opinion below,which describes the structure of stars in detail.the basic operation of the stars transactions can be summarized as follows.first,bny created a delaware trust to which it contributed billion in assets.in exchange for this contribution,bny received nominal shares in the trust class a and b units.bny agreed to install a resident as the trustee,so the trust income would be subject to taxation.bny then paid tax on the trust to the united kingdom,and,in exchange,barclays agreed to pay bny a monthly amount equal to half of the taxes bny expected to pay on the trust.
next,barclays purchased shares in the trust class c and d units for billion,effectively making a loan in that amount to bny for the duration of stars through the trust structure.bny agreed to repay the loan by purchasing barclay trust units for approximately billion at the end of five years.the monthly interest rate on the loan was equal to libor plus basis points,minus the aforementioned monthly.under this structure,barclays made total net monthly payments to bny of million over the life of stars.
throughout the duration of the stars transactions,the trust made monthly distributions of income via a circular,process.first,bny distributed funds from its assets to the trust,and the trust set aside of its income to pay taxes.with most of the remaining income the trust made monthly class c unit distributions to a barclays account that was blocked,meaning barclays could not access the funds or control the account.barclays immediately returned these distributions to the trust each month,and the trust then distributed the funds to bny,beginning the cycle again.
the resulting tax benefits to both bny and barclays from stars can be illustrated by tracing a hypothetical of trust income through the distribution cycle ignoring fees and the smaller class a,b,and d distributions.see bny appellant br.at salem,united states,employing similar hypothetical in reviewing stars transaction.under tax law,barclays as owner of the class c units was deemed the owner of almost all of the trust income and taxed at the corporate tax rate,obligating it to pay in tax for every of trust income x.barclays would reduce this tax bill,however,by claiming a credit for the tax on the trust,which was paid by bny.barclays tax liability for the trust income was thus only.bny,in turn,would claim a foreign tax credit in the united states for the full it had paid in taxes on the trust income.
the income distribution scheme compounded the tax benefits to both parties.each month,for every of trust income,the trust would set aside to pay taxes,with remaining for distribution.because the was first transferred to barclays blocked account and then back to the trust,barclays could treat the as a trading loss and claim a trading loss deduction under tax law.at the corporate tax rate,the deduction translated to a reduction in barclays taxes x.the deduction more than offset barclay tax bill from the trust,resulting in a net tax benefit to barclays of.finally,barclays would pay the to bny half the trust tax bill of.because barclays would deduct the cost of the from its corporate taxes,it gained an additional in tax benefit x.in the end,this left barclays with in total tax benefit for each of trust income minus the payment of,plus the deduction of.
bny also enjoyed a net tax benefit.while it paid in taxes,it was effectively reimbursed half this amount upon receipt of the from barclays.neverthless,it claimed the full as a foreign tax credit in the united states,for a total net gain of.
meanwhile the united kingdom and united states collected little to no tax revenue on stars.for each of trust income,the united kingdom only collected in net taxes in tax paid by bny minus in tax benefits to barclays.the united states collected no taxes from stars.yet,for the tax years and,bny claimed foreign tax credits of million and interest expense deductions of million that offset its unrelated income and reduced its overall tax bill for these years.
proceedings below 
on august,the irs issued a statutory notice of deficiency to bny of million for its taxes and million for its taxes,disallowing foreign tax credits and interest expense deductions it had claimed for those years.on november,bny petitioned the tax court for a of deficiencies.bny did not contest that the economic substance doctrine applied to stars but argued that stars had economic substance,and that therefore it was entitled to the claimed credits and deductions.
the tax court held a bench trial,and on february,issued an opinion holding that the stars transactions were to be disregarded for tax purposes.bank of mellon.comm r.the court bifurcated its analysis of the stars trust structure and the billion loan and found,in relevant part foreign taxes but neither loan proceeds nor the should be considered in the analysis of economic substance the stars trust transaction lacked economic substance,as bny had no purpose in entering the transaction except tax avoidance the should be included in bny taxable income rather than considered a component of loan interest,as it served as a device to monetize anticipated foreign tax credits and all expenses incurred from the stars transactions,including interest expenses from the billion loan,were not deductible.
on march,bny moved for reconsideration of the tax court rulings with respect to the as taxable income and interest expense deductions.on september,the tax court issued a supplemental opinion granting bny petition on these issues and held that the was not includible in bny income because it was part of the trust transaction that was disregarded for tax purposes for lacking economic substance and bny was entitled to interest expense deductions because the billion loan,bifurcated from the stars trust transaction,had independent economic substance.
the tax court entered judgment on february.bny appealed,and the irs the tax court interest expense deduction ruling on the billion loan.
discussion 
the general characterization of a transaction for tax purposes is a question of law subject to review.frank lyon united states.we thus review the lower court characterization of a transaction de novo,and where the lower court has made underlying factual findings,we review those findings for clear error.see jacobson comm r,cir newman comm r,cir.
we review a district court denial of a motion or partial motion for summary judgment de novo.doninger niehoff,cir.summary judgment is proper only when,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the,there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
we address a the applicability of the economic substance doctrine to the foreign tax credit regime generally b the economic substance of the transactions at issue in the instant cases and c the deductibility of the interest expenses bny paid on the billion loan from barclays.
applicability of the economic substance doctrine to the foreign tax credit regime 
the economic substance doctrine is a common law rule that allows courts to question the validity of a transaction and deny taxpayers benefits to which they are technically entitled under the code if the transaction at issue lacks economic substance.see gregory helvering.the doctrine applies to sham transactions that can not with reason be said to have purpose,substance,or utility apart from their anticipated tax consequences.goldstein comm r,cir.
aig argues that the economic substance doctrine can not be applied to disallow foreign tax credits that comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements aig contends that because the congressional purpose of foreign tax credits to prevent double taxation is clear,a court should never be able to question a taxpayer use of the credits under the economic substance doctrine.see aig appellant br.at estelle morris trs.comm r,emphasizing need to limit doctrines like economic substance to situations which they were intended to cover.
we disagree.first,the supreme court has long held that substance rather than form determines tax consequences.raymond united states,cir quoting cottage sav.ass comm r,blackmun,dissenting internal quotation marks omitted see comm r court holding.as we have recognized,the economic substance doctrine stems from the concern that even if a transaction form matches the dictionary definitions of each term used in the statutory definition of the tax provision,it does not follow that congress meant to cover such a transaction and allow it a tax benefit.altria,united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
second,aig misconstrues the purpose behind the economic substance doctrine.the economic substance doctrine exists to provide courts a second look to ensure that particular uses of tax benefits comply with congress purpose in creating that benefit.see gregory,at observing that,to assess economic substance,a court must look to the purpose of the statute to determine whether what was done was the thing which the statute intended.it is entirely appropriate for a court to ask,therefore,whether a taxpayer claim to foreign tax credits is tied to true business abroad resulting in actual tax payments,or whether its claim to a tax credit derives from sham transactions devoid of a business purpose beyond exploiting differences among foreign tax codes.we have repeatedly acknowledged the applicability of the economic substance doctrine to various sham transactions.see,jacobson,at demartino comm r,cir diggs comm r,cir.further,under gregory,a taxpayer carr ies an unusually heavy burden in seeking to show that doctrines like economic substance do not apply to the situation at hand.diggs,at.
third,we find no support for the contention that foreign tax credits,by their nature,are not reviewable for economic substance.congress intent in creating foreign tax credits was to prevent double taxation of taxpayers conducting business in the united states and abroad,at the provision was originally designed to produce uniformity of tax burden among united states taxpayers,irrespective of whether they were engaged in business in the united states or engaged in business abroad.the legislative history thus focuses on taxpayers engaged in foreign business.nothing in the history suggests that foreign tax credits are entitled to special immunity from scrutiny under the general economic substance doctrine,which allows a court to ask if a transaction really is business within the meaning of the code.as we have emphasized,the foreign tax credit is designed only for the taxpayer who desires to engage in purposive activity,not sham transactions built solely around tax arbitrage.see goldstein,at emphasis added.
fourth,recent amendments to the code and its not applicable to the instant cases,which predate these our interpretation of congress intent regarding economic substance.in,congress codified the economic substance doctrine into the code,recognizing that a strictly tax system can not efficiently prescribe the appropriate outcome of every conceivable transaction that might be devised and is,as a result,incapable of preventing all unintended consequences,pt,at.this provision codified the economic substance test used in many circuits,including ours,and affirmed decades of law from around the country on economic substance.it did not create categorical exceptions to the doctrine,for foreign tax credits or otherwise.
further,the treasury department issued new regulations proposed in,finalized in disallowing foreign tax credits associated with stars and other similarly convoluted transactions designed to take advantage of foreign tax credits.because the regulations are not retroactive,their preamble addressed the problem of already existing stars for periods prior to the effective date of final regulations,the irs will continue to utilize all available tools under current law to challenge the tax results claimed in connection with such arrangements,including the economic substance doctrine determining the amount of taxes paid for purposes of section.these amendments reflect both congress recognition of the economic substance doctrine generally and its concern for potential abuse of foreign tax credits.
we thus hold that the economic substance doctrine can,as a general matter,be applied to disallow foreign tax credits.
economic substance analysis 
we turn to the transactions at issue in aig and bny and evaluate them under our circuit test for economic substance.
applicable law 
in determining whether a transaction lacks economic substance,we consider whether the taxpayer had an objectively reasonable expectation of profit,apart from tax benefits,from the transaction and whether the taxpayer had a subjective business purpose in entering the transaction.see gilman comm r,cir.in our circuit the test is not a rigid process with discrete prongs rather,we employ a flexible analysis where both prongs are factors to consider in the overall inquiry into a transaction practical economic effects.see id.at altria,united states,d,aff,f d long term capital holdings united states,d,aff,app x cir summary order a finding of either a lack of a business purpose other than tax avoidance or an absence of economic substance beyond the creation of tax benefits can be but is not necessarily sufficient to conclude the transaction a sham.long term capital holdings,d at 
the preliminary step of the economic substance inquiry is to identify the transaction to be analyzed.even if the transaction at issue is part of a larger series of steps,t he relevant inquiry is whether the transaction that generated the claimed deductions had economic substance.nicole rose comm r,cir see long term capital holdings,d at holding that a taxpayer can not avoid the requirements of economic substance simply by coupling a routine economic transaction generating substantial profits and with no inherent tax benefits to a unique transaction that otherwise has no hope of turning a profit.
after isolating the relevant transaction,we begin our analysis of economic substance by determining the objective economic substance of the transaction at issue.we then look to the taxpayer subjective business purpose in entering the transaction.finally,we consider both the objective and subjective analysis to make a final determination of economic substance.see gilman,at.
objective economic substance 
the focus of the objective inquiry is whether the transaction offers a reasonable opportunity for economic profit,that is,profit exclusive of tax benefits.gilman,at internal quotation marks omitted.as relevant here,our circuit has yet to determine how profit should be calculated when a transaction involves foreign tax credits.the question is whether,for purposes of the economic substance doctrine,foreign taxes should be treated as costs when calculating profit.if the answer is yes,then a transaction will be less likely to appear profitable under the objective prong of the economic substance test.
other circuits have taken disparate approaches.in salem financial,united states,a case involving the same stars transactions at issue in bny,the federal circuit concluded that foreign taxes are economic costs that are properly deducted in assessing profitability for the purposes of economic substance.there,as with bny here,the court determined that for every of trust income,the bank incurred of foreign tax expense and only in income from the,for an net loss.at.the court also excluded foreign tax credits from the profit calculation,observing that o ur precedent,like that of several other courts,supports the government approach,to assess a transaction economic reality,and in particular its profit potential,independent of the expected tax benefits.id.at.because the federal circuit included foreign tax costs but excluded any foreign tax benefits in its calculation of profit,the court concluded that the trust transaction in stars was profitless.id.at.
the federal circuit held,however,that this lack of profit did not conclusively establish that a transaction lacks objective economic substance.id.at.the court ultimately held that stars lacked objective economic substance,based on both the lack of profit and on the circular cash flows through the trust whose only purpose was generating tax benefits.id.at indeed,the court recognized that,as a result,the taxpayer was reimbursed for half the tax it had paid by a stars counterparty who could claim foreign tax benefits that significantly reduced the net revenues realized by the from stars.see id.thus,the scheme was not objectively profitable and there was no real risk of double taxation,the purpose for which law afforded a foreign tax credit.
in factually different contexts,the fifth and eighth circuits have taken a different approach to assessing objective economic substance,holding that foreign taxes are not economic costs and should not be deducted from pretax profit.compaq comput.subsidiaries comm r,cir,rev g,ies,united states,cir,rev g,no,wl.in both cases,taxpayers purchased publicly traded foreign securities known as american depository receipts adrs at market prices immediately before the securities were to pay out dividends.because the securities dividends were subject to a foreign tax,they were priced at the market price plus of the expected dividend.the received of the dividend and quickly resold the securities for market price back to the seller,sustaining a loss because the market price of the securities was lower than the original purchase price.the taxpayer then claimed capital loss deductions in the united states,as well as foreign tax credits for the foreign tax paid on the dividend.see compaq,at ies,at.
in analyzing the profitability of these transactions,both the compaq and ies courts declined to consider the foreign taxes paid and foreign tax credits claimed in their economic substance analysis.rather,the courts calculated profitability based on the gross dividend,before foreign taxes were paid.compaq,at ies,at.accordingly,the eighth circuit awarded ies summary judgment on its tax refund claim because the adr transactions did not lack economic substance or a business purpose as a matter of law.at.the fifth circuit in compaq reversed the tax court below,holding that it erred in ignoring compaq profit on the adrs.at.
the court in compaq also faulted the tax court below for including foreign taxes paid but not foreign tax credits claimed in its calculation of profit.to be consistent,the analysis should either count all tax law effects or not count any of them.to count them only when they subtract from cash flow is to stack the deck against finding the transaction profitable.compaq,at see also ies,at.
the tax court in bny acknowledged that its holding was inconsistent with compaq and ies but noted that it was not bound by either decision.emphasizing that neither the supreme court nor our circuit had yet addressed the issue,the tax court considered the effect of foreign taxes in its objective economic substance analysis 
economically,foreign taxes are the same as any other transaction cost.and we can not find any conclusive reason for treating them differently here,especially because substantially all of the foreign taxes giving rise to the foreign tax credits stemmed from economically meaningless activity,the prearranged circular cashflows engaged in by the trust.
additionally,excluding the economic effect of foreign taxes from the analysis would fundamentally undermine the point of the economic substance inquiry.that point is to remove the challenged tax benefit and evaluate whether the relevant transaction makes economic sense.
at.similarly,the federal circuit in salem,decided after the tax court decision in bny,disagreed with the reasoning in compaq and ies.the court in salem concluded that the tax court method of calculation reflects the core principles of the economic substance doctrine 
the critical question is not whether the transaction would produce a net gain after all tax effects are taken into consideration instead,the pertinent questions are whether the transaction has real economic effects apart from its tax effects,whether the transaction was motivated only by tax considerations,and whether the transaction is the sort that congress intended to be the beneficiary of the foreign tax credit provision.
at.the court also emphasized that profit for purposes of economic substance must be analyzed within the context of the tax implications even if there is some prospect of profit,that is not enough to give a transaction economic substance if the prospect of a return is grossly disproportionate to the tax benefits that are expected to flow from the transaction.id.at.
we agree with the tax court in bny and the federal circuit in salem.the purpose of calculating profit in this context is not to perform mere financial accounting,subtracting costs from revenue on a spreadsheet it is to discern,as a matter of law,whether a transaction meaningfully alters a taxpayer economic position other than with respect to tax consequences.the motivation behind the economic substance inquiry is to ensure that tax benefits are available only if there is a genuine transaction with economic substance which is compelled or encouraged by business or regulatory realities,is imbued with considerations,and is not shaped solely by taxavoidance features that have meaningless labels attached.id.quoting frank lyon,at.the doctrine was born out of necessity,as e ven the smartest drafters of legislation and regulation can not be expected to anticipate every tax avoidance device.asa investerings comm r.it is therefore appropriate for a court,when assessing the objective economic substance of a transaction,to include the foreign taxes paid but to exclude the foreign tax credits claimed in calculating profit.
we are mindful,as was the district court in certifying the aig case for interlocutory appeal,am.int l,united states,civ.lls,wl,at,that some commentators have criticized this approach,accusing courts of blindly buying into the government smoke and mirrors argument or contorting the economic substance doctrine beyond any recognizable bounds.including foreign taxes in calculating profit is inappropriate,they argue,because the transactions are motivated by foreign tax benefits to foreign lenders,not by tax benefits for borrowers.further,they contend,this method of calculation fictionalizes the transactions,including the costs of the transactions but not the corresponding income.
we find these arguments unpersuasive.the purpose of the foreign tax credit is to facilitate global commerce by making the irs indifferent as to whether a business transaction occurs in this country or in another,not to facilitate international tax arbitrage.the transactions in both aig and bny were structured to benefit foreign lenders but they were also structured to benefit borrowers.indeed,in bny,barclays paid the to bny to share the tax benefits of stars between the parties at the same time that bny sought a foreign tax credit in an amount greater than that which after payment of the it was actually out of pocket.in both cases,funds were treated as a loan for tax purposes but as equity for foreign tax purposes solely to minimize tax in both countries.hence,the transactions themselves fictionalize the concept of international trade.in bny,for example,funds contributed to a trust that never left the united states were nonetheless subjected to taxation because bny installed a nominal trustee.further,the trust distributions were briefly transferred to a barclays blocked account,then immediately transferred back to the trust simply to trigger certain tax consequences.similarly,in aig,the spvs had no real employees or business purpose of their own beyond creating tax benefits for the both the lender and borrower.
while the transactions are certainly real insofar as real money changed hands,they are most appropriately characterized as shams under the economic substance doctrine,taken to avoid taxes.as discussed in more detail below,the trust transaction in bny had little to no potential for economic return apart from the tax benefits.and when the record in aig is viewed most favorably to the government,a reasonable factfinder could reach the same conclusion as to the transactions.accordingly,we hold that foreign taxes are economic costs for purposes of the economic substance doctrine and thus should be deducted from profit before calculating profit.
the objective economic substance inquiry,however,does not end at profit,as a legitimate transaction could conceivably lack economic profit.see salem,at transactions involving nascent technologies,for instance,often do not turn a profit in the early years unless tax benefits are accounted for.to brand such transactions as a sham simply because they are unprofitable before tax benefits are taken into account would be contrary to the clear intent of congress.citing sacks comm r,cir.the supreme court has indeed cautioned there is no simple device available to peel away the form of a transaction and to reveal its substance.frank lyon,at.a court should also look to the overall economic effect of the transaction in determining objective economic substance.in conducting this inquiry,we agree with the tax court that e conomic benefits that would result independent of a transaction do not constitute a benefit for purposes of testing its economic substance.bank of mellon,at.determining whether a given transaction has economic substance under the objective prong therefore requires both a calculation of profit and a consideration of the transaction overall economic effect.accordingly,the overall determination of objective economic substance is a question of fact.
subjective economic substance 
apart from the objective inquiry,a court must also look to the subjective business purpose of a transaction to determine whether it has economic substance.under the subjective inquiry,a court asks whether the taxpayer has a legitimate,business purpose for entering into the transaction.see id.at long term capital holdings,d at.the business purpose inquiry concerns the motives of the taxpayer in entering the transaction it asks whether the taxpayer sole motivation for entering a transaction was to realize tax benefits.altria,d at quoting rice toyota world,comm r,cir.the focus is the reasonableness of the transaction and can be articulated as would a prudent investor,absent tax benefits,have made the deal see long term capital holdings,d at.this inquiry is,by nature,factual.
application 
aig argues that,as a matter of law,even if the economic substance doctrine applies generally to foreign tax credits,the transactions had economic substance.to support this argument,aig points to its calculated million in profit,a calculation that ignores the foreign taxes paid by the spv,the tax paid by aig on the spv investment income,and the foreign tax credits claimed by aig.the district court acknowledged that i f the computation of that figure proves correct,aig would be entitled to judgment,but ultimately rejected aig method and accordingly found that aig was not entitled to partial summary judgment.am.int l,wl,at.
we agree that there are disputed issues of material fact as to both the objective and subjective economic substance of the transactions.the district court therefore properly denied aig motion for partial summary judgment.there is sufficient evidence in the record from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude,as the government contends,that the transactions lacked economic substance.
under the objective prong,there are unresolved material questions of fact regarding the overall economic effect of the transactions and the reasonableness of aig expectation of,expert discovery has not yet commenced in this case.the government economist,michael cragg,has done preliminary analysis of the transactions,and for the purposes of its summary judgment motion,aig did not contest his calculations.id.at.according to cragg,a side from the tax benefits,the transactions involved little,if any,potential for economic return,as absent the claimed tax benefits,the transactions neither generated material economic returns for aig,nor offered the potential for such returns,after accounting for dividend payments,operating expenses,and foreign taxes.aig app.at.cragg thus concluded that the transaction structure inflated the foreign tax liabilities of the spvs and generated income from tax benefits for aig at the direct expense of the united states.id.at.further,the spvs had no substantive business activities of their own and absent capital contributions from aig,they would not have had sufficient cash flow to cover their expenses or pay out dividends.overall,the value of the foreign tax credits produced far exceeded any independent potential for economic return from the transactions.insofar as aig contends that,in considering the transaction profitability,the district court inappropriately deducted the foreign taxes paid by the spv,we reject that argument in light of our holding that,as a matter of law,foreign taxes are properly deducted in assessing a transaction profitability.accordingly,a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the transactions lacked objective economic substance.
under the subjective prong,there are also material questions of fact regarding aig business purpose for entering the transactions.as the government highlights,aig own internal documents described the transactions as tax driven and tax based deal s.id.at.similarly,a foreign purchaser of a transaction acknowledged t he benefit to aig comes from tax laws whereby they can obtain a credit for the tax paid in the foreign country and a deduction for the dividend paid.the tax credit effectively reduces their cost of borrowing id.at.further,aig fp retained the right to terminate the transactions due to changes in tax law or if aig could not soak up the excess foreign tax credits.id.at.accordingly,a reasonable factfinder could conclude that aig lacked a legitimate,business purpose in entering the transactions.
thus,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,as the party,we hold that the government offered sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to find in its favor.hence,the district court did not err in denying partial summary judgment.see,black decker united states,cir reversing summary judgment to taxpayer where irs presented evidence from experts showing transaction at issue lacked economic substance.
like aig,bny argues that as a matter of law,stars had economic substance.bny points to the billion loan from barclays as proof of economic substance,and maintains that although tax benefits were part of its motivation for entering stars,this does not negate the transaction economic substance.bny contends that the tax court erred in calculating profit by bifurcating its analysis of the trust transaction and the billion loan and,as a result,excluding the amount bny expected to earn by investing the loan proceeds counting the foreign taxes paid as a cost and disregarding the.
we conclude that the tax court committed no error.first,the tax court appropriately bifurcated its analysis of the stars trust transaction from the billion loan.as we have held,t he relevant inquiry is whether the transaction that generated the claimed deductions had economic substance.nicole rose,at.we agree with the tax court that the requirements of the economic substance doctrine are not avoided simply by coupling a routine transaction with a transaction lacking economic substance.bank of mellon,at see long term capital holdings,d at quoting nicole rose in bny case,the disputed tax benefits for the trust transaction and the loan are distinct foreign tax credits versus interest expense deductions.we thus can not say that the tax court erred in analyzing the transactions separately.
second,the tax court did not err in its calculation of the trust transaction objective economic substance.because it considered the trust transaction separately from the loan,the tax court properly excluded the loan proceeds bny expected to earn by investing the loan proceeds from its calculation of the trust transaction profit.further,in light of our holding that,as a matter of law,foreign taxes should be deducted when calculating profit,the tax court did not err in considering foreign taxes paid by bny on behalf of the trust and in concluding that the trust did not offer a reasonable opportunity for economic profit because,as demonstrated in the hypothetical above,for every in trust income,bny incurred a loss by paying foreign taxes.
finally,in considering the overall economic effect of the transaction,the district court did not err in excluding the that barclays paid bny from calculated profit.the tax court found that the was a tax effect serv ing as a device for monetizing and transferring the value of anticipated foreign tax credits generated from routing income through the stars structure.bank of mellon,at.bny itself referred to the as a rebate from barclays which barclays paid to share the tax benefits of stars with bny.bny app.at.moreover,as bny concedes,the parties agreed that the would be half of the value of barclays expected tax benefits,which amounted to for every of trust income.thus,even offsetting bny foreign tax payment of with the,bny still lost for every of trust income.the tax court therefore reasonably concluded that regardless of how the spread is characterized,the benefit of the spread was more than offset by the additional transaction costs that bny incurred to obtain the spread.bank of mellon,at.
as noted above,the objective economic substance analysis does not end at profit,and the tax court here appropriately considered other aspects of the trust transaction to assess economic substance.notably,the tax court found that the transaction circular cash flow strongly indicated that its main purpose was to generate tax benefits for bny and barclays.see altria,at see also salem,at affirming trial court conclusion that stars transaction lacked economic reality in part because the transaction consisted of three principal circular cash flows,which,apart from their intended tax consequences,had no real economic effect.
indeed,this circular cash flow demonstrates that bny,far from risking double taxation,used an extremely convoluted transaction structure to take maximum advantage of and tax benefits.bny was reimbursed for half of its tax payments and simultaneously claimed a foreign tax credit in the united states for the full payment amounts.toward this end,bny created a trust in the united states whose funds never left the united states yet bny installed a nominal trustee precisely so the trust would be subject to taxation.the trust distribution structure makes little sense except in light of the tax implications each month funds were briefly sent to a blocked barclays account then immediately returned to the trust.the purpose of this process was to allow barclays to claim a tax loss while bny could claim a foreign tax credit.because this structure allowed barclays to recover the cost of taxes paid by bny,barclays shared the tax benefits with bny by paying bny the.
third,the tax court did not err in finding that stars lacked a subjective business purpose beyond tax avoidance.the tax court found that the stars structure lacked a reasonable relationship to bny claimed business purposes and bny interest in stars was entirely predicated on the tax benefits it involved.bank of mellon,at.bny asserted that the business purpose for entering into the stars transaction was to obtain a loan from barclays.id.at.the loan,however,was only if the was considered a component of the loan interest.the tax court reasonably concluded that the should not be so considered because,although the was netted against the interest bny owed on the loan,there was no real relationship between the two.id.at.rather,the was a way for barclays to share half of the value of its expected tax benefits with bny,and thus allow bny to obtain of foreign tax credit for each of expenditure.bank of mellon,at.absent this sharing of tax benefits,bny loan with a monthly interest of libor plus basis points was not low cost because bny could otherwise have borrowed money at or below libor.further support for the tax court determination that bny singular motivation was the tax benefit is evident in bny global tax director acknowledgment that kpmg knew that if i was comfortable with our overall tax position and our ability to use those foreign tax credits,then the transaction would get off the ground.bny app.at.
accordingly,considering the objective and subjective prongs of our circuit flexible economic substance test together,we hold that the tax court correctly concluded that the stars trust transaction lacked economic substance.
deductibility of interest expenses 
applicable law 
the code permits the deduction of all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness.a.thus,a taxpayer is ordinarily entitled to deduct interest paid on indebtedness,reducing its taxable income for a given year.see lee comm r,cir.interest payments are not deductible,however,if they arise from transactions that can not with reason be said to have purpose,substance,or utility apart from their anticipated tax consequences.such transactions are said to lack economic substance.id.citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.we have repeatedly held that an interest deduction is not allowed if the interest payment arises from a transaction that is economically empty,a loan whose sole purpose is to generate interest deductions.see goldstein,at.
the federal circuit in salem again analyzing a stars transaction under a bifurcated analysis held that,unlike lee and goldstein,there is no evidence that the taxpayer bank designed the loan solely to claim the interest deductions.at.while it may be true that the loan operated partly to camouflage the payment,it also resu
