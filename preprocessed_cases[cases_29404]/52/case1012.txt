fujian,pacific coast incorporated under the laws of the state of washington,and eight other interested parties initiated a civil action to contest commerce antidumping decision in final results.the united states assesses antidumping duties on the basis of the dumping margin.the term dumping margin means the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price or constructed export price of the subject merchandise.a.commerce assesses the normal value by using the exporting home market price,an appropriate market price,or the constructed value.commerce assesses the united states price,depending upon the relationships and the location of the sales,according to two alternative statutory methodologies.the export price method considers 
the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold or agreed to be sold before the date of importation by the producer or exporter of the subject merchandise outside of the united states to an unaffiliated purchaser in the united states or to an unaffiliated purchaser for exportation to the united states.
a emphases added.the constructed export price method considers 
the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold or agreed to be sold in the united states before or after the date of importation by or for the account of the producer or exporter of such merchandise or by a seller affiliated with the producer or exporter,to a purchaser not affiliated with the producer or exporter.
b emphases added.in choosing between these methods,commerce must consider any affiliation between the parties.the determination of affiliation is the central issue of this appeal.
commerce determined that fujian and pacific coast were not affiliated.the record shows that fujian owned and exercised more than of pacific coast public shares during the period of review,an amount sufficient to establish affiliation.remand order at.pacific coast issued the public shares to fujian under the laws of the state of washington.nonetheless,commerce discounted the evidence of ownership because the record showed no evidence of fujian making a transfer of cash or merchandise into pacific coast.in response to commerce request for documentation,fujian submitted a promissory note committing it to pay the stock price in merchandise and documents showing satisfaction of approximately half of that price in a single transaction with a seafood broker,misb.according to commerce,fujian documentation did not show that the merchandise,which was to serve as fujian investment in pacific coast,originated from fujian.the documentation also did not indicate when the merchandise at issue entered into the united states.alternatively,commerce also determined that if fujian did acquire a portion of pacific coast equity during the review period,it was less than.
without a finding of affiliation,fujian received an antidumping margin of on sales to pacific coast.this antidumping margin reflected a price from fujian to pacific coast at a rate below the market rate per pound.fujian and pacific coast assert that if pacific coast sales price to united states buyers had been considered the first unaffiliated sale and not the sales price from fujian to pacific coast,that the starting point transfer price would have been more in line with market rates.thus,fujian and pacific coast initiated a civil action in the court of international trade to challenge commerce affiliation determination.
the court of international trade affirmed commerce decision that fujian and pacific coast were not affiliated.remand order at.in its remand order,the court of international trade held that commerce properly determined that fujian and pacific coast are not affiliated parties under the relevant statutes because fujian had not made an investment,whether in cash or in the form of a promissory note,in pacific coast and because fujian did not exercise control over pacific coast.id.at.the court of international trade agreed with commerce that fujian submissions do not sufficiently demonstrate that the merchandise sold by pacific coast originated from fujian.id.at.
however,the court of international trade did not enter a final order at that time,but remanded the case for further consideration on issues not appealed to this court.again,in september of,the court of international trade affirmed commerce first remand results,but remanded a second time.crawfish processors alliance united states,d.int l trade.on december,the court of international trade affirmed commerce second remand results.dismissal order,wl,at.fujian and pacific coast filed a timely appeal to this court.
the standard for affiliation involves a question of statutory interpretation.in interpreting the statute,this court seeks first the unambiguous meaning of the language.int l bus.mach.united states,citing robinson shell oil,d our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.quoting united states ron pair,d.to detect any ambiguity,this court looks at the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson,at.the statute defines affiliated 
the following persons shall be considered to be affiliated or affiliated persons 
e any person directly or indirectly owning,controlling,or holding with power to vote,percent or more of the outstanding voting stock or shares of any organization and such organization.

b emphasis added.while aspects of this regulation do not speak directly to subparagraph e of section,this court views its language as instructive on the meaning of control and affiliated parties under the statute.in fact,the government has argued the applicability of b to this court.
the statute clarifies,in quite broad terms,that owning,controlling,or holding,directly or indirectly,over of an entity stock constitutes affiliation.this court detects no ambiguity in that standard.the regulation stipulates that the affiliation determination considers,among other factors,debt financing,family groupings,and close supplier relationships.
