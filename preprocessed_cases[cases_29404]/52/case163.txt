this appeal arises from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york thomas griesa,judge,granting and confirming attachment and restraining orders against a bank account owned by the agencia nacional de promoción científica y tecnológica anpct,an instrumentality of the republic,pursuant to the commercial use exception to the fsia.
background 
nml capital,nml and em em jointly,the plaintiffs have acquired on the secondary market hundreds of millions of dollars of bonds issued by the republic in due course,the plaintiffs began to bring suit in united states courts to collect the debt.in these eleven consolidated appeals,they moved to attach a new york bank account owned by anpct,a of argentina ministry of science,technology,and productive innovation.anpct asserts that it employs this account the anpct account or the account for the sole purpose of purchasing scientific equipment for use by grant beneficiaries.beneficiaries contract with equipment sellers directly,and receive the purchased goods directly from the sellers anpct only involvement is to remit the prearranged payment to the sellers.
on september,the plaintiffs,moving on an ex parte basis,sought and obtained from the district court restraining orders for the actions that had reached final judgment and attachment orders for the actions in the phase seizing the anpct account.on that date,the account contained more than million.on september,the district court confirmed the restraining orders but not the attachment orders to the extent they related to the anpct account,holding that the account was attachable under of the fsia.nml capital republic of argentina,civ,docket,at,wl,see note,ante.the district court reasoned that under the most rudimentary definition,the account is used for commercial activity because anpct funds have been used to purchase scientific equipment.id.the district court further explained that by using the account to buy equipment,the republic was acting as a private player in the marketplace,in the same way as any private party engaging in commerce.id.
the plaintiffs subsequently moved for reconsideration with respect to the attachment orders as they related to the anpct account.on september,the district court acknowledged its mistake and confirmed the attachments of the anpct account.
the republic now appeals the underlying restraining and attachment orders,as well as the orders confirming the restraint and attachment of the anpct account,claiming that the district court should have granted it immunity from execution pursuant to the fsia.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo legal conclusions denying fsia immunity to a foreign sovereign or its property.see aurelius capital partners,lp republic of argentina,cir robinson government of malaysia,cir.a district court ruling on a request for an order of attachment is reviewed for abuse of discretion.aurelius capital partners,at see em,at.a district court is said to have abused its discretion if it has based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law,made a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.sims blot,cir citations and quotation marks omitted.
ii.the anpct account was used for commercial activity 
the fsia provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this country.argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d.as a general matter,the property of a foreign state present in the united states is immune from execution in satisfaction of a debt.such property may be attached and executed upon only when one of the fsia exceptions applies.see letelier republic of chile,cir u nder foreign states are immune from execution upon judgments obtained against them,unless an exception set forth in or of the fsia applies.
subsections a and d,the applicable exceptions in this case,provide that when the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment and execution,a court may attach or execute upon property that the sovereign used for commercial activity in the united states.a id.d.the republic has waived its immunity,see em,at,and does not dispute that anpct is responsible for the republic debts.the only question on appeal is whether the republic used the anpct account for a commercial activity in the united states under.stated another way,we must decide whether the republic remittance to a seller of goods of a prearranged purchase price for those goods,which are then conveyed directly from the seller to a third party returning no tangible benefit to the republic constitutes activity in the market.we hold that it does.
commercial activity 
the fsia defines commercial activity as a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act.d.the commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act,rather than by reference to its purpose.id.the legislative history of the fsia explicitly asserts the congressional intention to leave to the courts a great deal of latitude in determining what is a commercial activity for purposes of the fsia.kato ishihara,cir quoting,at,ellipses and alteration in original.
to determine the nature of a sovereign act,we ask whether the particular actions that the foreign state performs whatever the motive behind them are the type of actions by which a private party engages in trade and traffic or commerce.anglo iberia underwriting mgmt.jamsostek,cir quoting republic of argentina weltover,d internal quotation marks omitted.we begin by examining the act of the foreign sovereign that serves as the basis for the plaintiff claim.id.
in this case,the allegedly commercial act of the foreign sovereign is the purchase of scientific equipment.in weltover,the supreme court concluded that when a sovereign purchases goods in the market,it has engaged in a commercial activity because such a purchase is the type of action by which a private party engages in trade and traffic or commerce.weltover,at.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the supreme court noted that a contract to buy army boots or even bullets is a commercial activity,because private companies can similarly use sales contracts to acquire goods.id.at.
we reached a similar conclusion in texas trading mill.federal republic of nigeria,cir,in which we considered whether nigeria purchase of cement qualified as a commercial activity,overruled on other grounds by frontera res.azerbaijan state oil of azerbaijan republic,cir.because nigeria activity was in the nature of a private contract for the purchase of goods,we held that i ts purpose to build roads,army barracks,whatever,is irrelevant.id.at.accordingly,we concluded that nigeria cement purchase program constituted commercial activity.id.
b.the governmental purpose of the commercial activity is irrelevant 
relying on letelier republic of chile the republic argues that the essential nature of the republic payments to equipment sellers is sovereign because the equipment is purchased in order to implement a national program of scientific research and development as noted above,anpct does not negotiate contracts with the sellers,nor does it take delivery of the equipment all such logistical matters are handled by the research facilities for whom the republic purchases the equipment.according to the republic,anpct merely performs functions by conveying the purchase price to the sellers.
the republic argument is unavailing.the essential nature argument rests on the governmental purpose of the purchases and the absence of a profit motive in the program.but neit
