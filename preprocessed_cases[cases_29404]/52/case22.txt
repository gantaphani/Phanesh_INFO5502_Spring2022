this is an appeal from a denial of a habeas corpus petition asking the court to block extradition.
upon receiving an official request from the united kingdom,the united states sought extradition of alexander hilton,a united states citizen,to face an attempted murder charge in scotland.hilton argued that,because of his mental health problems,he may not be extradited because extradition would cause him an increased risk of suicide,and so violate his fifth amendment right to due process under the united states constitution.in addition,hilton argued that he may not be extradited because trial under the scottish jury system requires only a simple majority for conviction and that would violate his constitutional rights after a hearing,a magistrate judge found hilton extraditable and issued a certificate of extraditability.see.
hilton then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,seeking to block extradition.see see also in re extradition of howard,cir explaining that neither party to an extradition proceeding may challenge a decision rendered therein by direct appeal.the district court denied the petition.see hilton kerry,tsh,wl.we affirm the district court.
allegations 
hilton attended the university of andrews in scotland from september through march.united kingdom authorities allege that on or about march,hilton attempted to murder a fellow student,robert forbes,by spiking a bottle of wine with methanol,giving the bottle to forbes,and encouraging him to drink the contents.because of hilton continuous encouragement,the allegations continue,forbes drank most of the contents of the bottle.forbes was later hospitalized.according to the request for extradition,a treating neurologist is of the opinion that if forbes had not received medical treatment then he may have sustained kidney failure or other neurological deficit.due to the high levels of acid in his blood this would have resulted in his death.forbes is alleged to have lost initially his eyesight as a result of the incident,though it has since improved.forbes continues to require and receive medical treatment.
following the incident,police recovered evidence that hilton had purchased a plastic funnel and glass measuring jug from a local store.in addition,police recovered hilton laptop,analysis of which showed that a user had on march,two days after the poisoning but two days before forbes condition was diagnosed accessed web pages containing information regarding methanol poisoning and the long term effects thereof.in addition,analysis showed that,on an unknown date,a user had conducted google search for methanol mixed with ethanol.
scottish authorities interrogated hilton for five hours on march,but did not charge him at that time.on march,hilton sought and received a leave of absence from andrews,citing,among other things,his personal and medical circumstances see infra.hilton left scotland and returned to his home in massachusetts on march.on october,the british embassy submitted a diplomatic note formally requesting that hilton be extradited.hilton was charged with attempted murder in scotland,and a warrant for his arrest was issued on december.on february,the united states filed a complaint seeking an arrest warrant and the extradition of hilton.hilton was arrested on february.
hilton mental health problems 
hilton,now age,has a long history of mental illness including suicidal thoughts and ideation.according to judith edersheim,a psychiatrist retained by hilton counsel to evaluate hilton,hilton suffers from a primary psychotic disorder,a primary disorder of thought,with diagnostic considerations pointing to schizophrenia,delusional disorder,or generalized psychotic disorder.
after his arrest,hilton was transferred to wyatt detention facility.immediately,hilton began to engage in suicidal behaviors.officials placed hilton on suicide watch.his attorneys report that hilton became increasingly despondent,refusing nutrition.while detained,hilton also expressed overt psychotic thoughts,including auditory,visual,and tactile hallucinations.
in edersheim opinion,hilton suicidal thoughts and ideations worsen whenever he is away from his home and the set of supports his family has put in place.she opines further that extradition to scotland would greatly increase hilton risk of suicide.
extradition proceedings and bail 
ten days after his arrest,hilton filed a motion to permit visits from his treating psychologists.the government assented,and,based upon a showing of medical necessity,the magistrate judge granted the motion the same day.around the same time,hilton filed a motion for release from custody on bail pending extradition proceedings,arguing,among other things,that his psychiatric illness was severely exacerbated as soon as he was placed in custody.after a hearing,the magistrate judge found that special circumstances existed overriding the presumption against granting bail in extradition proceedings and that hilton did not pose a serious risk of flight or danger to the community.she ordered him released on conditions on march,
the magistrate judge held an extradition hearing on march.on may,she issued a decision finding hilton extraditable to scotland and,soon after,a certificate of extraditability.the decision found that hilton conceded that a valid treaty exists between the united states and the united kingdom,that the charged crime of attempted murder is covered by the treaty,and that probable cause exists for the charged crime.relying upon the rule of,the decision rejected hilton argument that,by subjecting him to scottish criminal procedure,extradition would violate his constitutional rights and,as a consequence,certain provisions of the extradition treaty.the decision also rejected hilton argument that extradition should be barred on humanitarian grounds,reasoning that,under the federal extradition statute,such considerations were properly addressed to the secretary of state.the magistrate judge ordered a stay of the certificate of extraditability so that hilton could diligently pursue a habeas petition.
habeas proceedings 
hilton filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on july,again seeking to prevent his extradition.see.in his petition,hilton claimed first that extradition should be blocked because of certain features of scotland criminal procedure,and second that extradition would violate his constitutional rights because of the risk he would commit suicide if extradited.hilton,wl,at.the district court denied hilton petition on october.id.at.the court rejected hilton claim for relief based upon scotland jury system,reasoning that the rule of prevented it from looking into the fairness of the procedures that await hilton if he is extradited.id.at.the district court also rejected hilton claim based upon his mental health issues,observing that humanitarian concerns,such as the one hilton raises,surrounding extradition are exclusively within the purview of the secretary of state.id.at.hilton had argued that his mental health claim was predicated on an alleged violation of his due process rights,as opposed to humanitarian concerns,citing plaster united states,cir and in re burt,cir.the district court reasoned,however,that,u nlike in plaster and burt,in hilton case there is no action by the united states beyond the extradition proceeding that might violate hilton due process rights.hilton,wl,at.the district court ordered a stay of its decision denying habeas relief pending appeal.
the united states judiciary has a limited role in extradition proceedings.extradition is an executive,not a judicial,function.martin warden,atlanta pen,cir.because extradition is a creature of treaty,the power to extradite derives from the president power to conduct foreign affairs.ordinola hackman,cir quoting sidali,cir see const.art.ii,cl.see generally united states curtiss wright export.

federal extradition statute 
extradition proceedings in the united states are governed by statute.see.the statute establishes a procedure which divides responsibility for extradition between a judicial officer and the secretary of state.united states kin hong,cir footnote omitted.once a formal complaint is filed,the judicial must determine whether there is an extradition treaty between the united states and the relevant foreign government and whether the crime charged is covered by that treaty.assuming both questions are answered in the affirmative,the judicial officer issues a warrant for the arrest of the individual sought for extradition commonly referred to as the relator.id.if a warrant issues,the judicial officer then conducts a hearing to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain the charge under the provisions of the treaty.id.if it is,the judicial officer shall certify to the secretary of state that a warrant for the surrender of the named individual may issue.id.emphases added.the judicial officer must also provide to the secretary of state a copy of all testimony and evidence from the extradition hearing.id.
the statute commits to the sole discretion of the secretary of state the ultimate decision of whether to extradite.see id.the secretary of state may order the person committed under section to be delivered to any authorized agent of such foreign government,to be tried for the offense charged.emphasis added.the secretary may decline to surrender the relator on any number of discretionary grounds,including but not limited to,humanitarian and foreign policy considerations.kin hong,at.in addition,the secretary may attach conditions to the relator release.see jimenez dist.court for dist.of,miami,d goldberg,chambers opinion denying stay of extradition and describing commitments made by venezuelan government to united states department of state as a condition of surrender of fugitive.
rule of non inquiry 
judicial involvement in the extradition process is also constrained by the rule of.t his doctrine bars courts from evaluating the fairness and humaneness of another country criminal justice system,requiring deference to the executive branch on such matters.khouzam att y of,cir see also munaf geren,d such allegations are of course a matter of serious concern,but in the present context that concern is to be addressed by the political branches,not the judiciary.glucksman henkel.we are bound by the existence of an extradition treaty to assume that the trial will be fair.neely henkel.in the judgment of congress these treaty provisions were deemed adequate to the ends of justice in cases of persons committing crimes in a foreign country and subsequently fleeing to this country.we can not adjudge that congress in this matter has abused its discretion,nor decline to enforce obedience to its will as expressed.the rule of serves interests of international comity by relegating to political actors the sensitive foreign policy judgments that are often involved in the question of whether to refuse an extradition request.hoxha levi,cir see also koskotas roche,cir observing that extradition proceedings necessarily implicate the foreign policy interests of the united states quoting escobedo united states,cir as this court explained in kin hong,at,i t is not that questions about what awaits the relator in the requesting country are irrelevant to extradition it is that there is another branch of government,which has both final say and greater discretion in these proceedings,to whom these questions are more properly addressed.see also ahmad wigen,cir it is the function of the secretary of state to determine whether extradition should be denied on humanitarian grounds.escobedo,at t he degree of risk to the relator s life from extradition is an issue that properly falls within the exclusive purview of the executive branch.quoting sindona grant,cir.
on appeal,hilton argues first that,in light of his severe psychological impairments and high risk of suicide,his extradition to scotland would violate his fifth amendment right to due process.as presented here,this claim amounts to a challenge to the conditions awaiting him in scotland,and is barred by the rule of.next,on appeal hilton presses an argument not fully developed below regarding whether his medical condition precludes placing him in in the united states or in scotland.this claim,however,is simply too speculative at this stage finally,hilton claims that his extradition would violate his constitutional rights because scotland allows simple majority jury verdicts,and that because the senate was never apprised of the scottish jury system it did not give its knowing advice and consent to the united states united kingdom extradition treaty as required by article ii,cl.the former claim fails under the rule of,as this court may not pass judgment on the merits of the scottish jury system.the latter claim fails because it is not for this court to consider whether the senate advice and consent was substantively adequate.the secretary may choose to assess and credit hilton claims that his mental health status should bar extradition on humanitarian grounds,and that he will not receive an adequate jury trial.we will not bar extradition on either basis.
standard of review 
on appeal from an order denying a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,this court reviews the district court legal conclusions de novo,in re extradition of howard,at,and any factual findings for clear error,gomes brady,cir.ordinarily,habeas corpus is available only to inquire whether the magistrate had jurisdiction,whether the offense charged is within the treaty,and whether there was any evidence warranting the finding that there was reasonable ground to believe the accused guilty.koskotas,at alteration in original quoting fernandez phillips.internal quotation marks omitted.however,as this court has observed,serious due process concerns may merit review beyond the narrow scope of inquiry in extradition proceedings.in re extradition of manzi,cir see also valenzuela united states,cir despite our limited role in extradition proceedings,the judiciary must ensure that the constitutional rights of individuals subject to extradition are observed.
mental illness 
hilton argues that his extradition to scotland would result in an increased risk of suicide and would thereby involve deliberate indifference on the part of the united states officials authorizing the extradition.hilton argument fails under the rule of.
hilton emphasizes that doubts about the ability of the united states authorities to keep him from committing suicide during the period leading up to the secretary decision whether to extradite substantiates his claim that he should not be extradited at all.such doubts,however,rest on speculation.
hilton core argument is that his extradition to scotland would result in his suffering from an increased risk of suicide and,for that reason,that united states officials would infringe upon his due process rights by authorizing the extradition.it rests upon on a state created danger theory of due process.see rivera rhode island,cir.the argument is squarely foreclosed by the rule of.whether the conditions hilton would face would have deleterious effects on his mental health so as to constitute a bar to extradition or require conditions on extradition is a question for the secretary of state and not for this court.
hilton contends that the rule of has no application here because his allegations are directed at united states officials as opposed to officials from the requesting state.on hilton theory,any challenge to the conditions awaiting an individual upon extradition could be recast as a challenge to the conduct of united states officials on the basis of causation.the rule of is not so easily circumvented.
hilton points to plaster and burt as extradition cases in which the rule of d
