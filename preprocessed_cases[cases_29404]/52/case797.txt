this appeal arises under two rarely invoked statutes.the alien tort statute ats,grants federal district courts jurisdiction to hear civil suits by aliens alleging torts committed in violation of the law of nations.section a of title creates a civil cause of action for victims of certain sexual offenses under federal law.plaintiff carmen cisneros,a native and citizen of mexico,relied on both statutes in suing defendant michael aragon for alleged sexual offenses committed in this country while she was under.the district court granted aragon summary judgment on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction over either claim.it held that it did not have jurisdiction over the ats claims because the particular sex offenses asserted by cisneros do not qualify as torts in violation of the law of nations.at and it did not have jurisdiction over the a claims because cisneros had failed to offer sufficient evidence to prove that the alleged sex acts occur red within the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the united states,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we affirm the dismissal of the claims for lack of jurisdiction.we also affirm the dismissal of the a claims but for failure to establish an element of the cause of action rather than for lack of jurisdiction.

ii.analysis 
we have jurisdiction under.we review the district court summary judgment de novo,apply ing the same legal standard to be used by the district court under.c.carpenter boeing,cir.under rule c summary judgment shall be granted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
claims under the alien tort statute 
the ats provides that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.cisneros is not alleging that aragon conduct violated a treaty of the united states.our inquiry thus focuses exclusively on whether cisneros has sufficiently alleged a violation of the law of nations,as that term is used in.for guidance we turn to the supreme court recent decision in sosa,d.
the plaintiff in sosa was a mexican national who had been unlawfully abducted in mexico,held overnight,and then transported to the united states where he was arrested by federal officers on charges of the murder and torture of an agent of the federal drug enforcement administration.see id.at.defendant sosa was a mexican national who had participated in the abduction.after being acquitted on the charges against him,the plaintiff brought an action against sosa in a united states district court under the ats.see id.at.the issue before the supreme court was whether the law of nations included a general prohibition of arbitrary detention defined as officially sanctioned action exceeding positive authorization to detain under the domestic law of some government,regardless of the circumstances.id.at.the court concluded that it did not,holding that the plaintiff had no claim under the ats.see id.at.although the court did not articulate the ultimate criteria for accepting a cause of action subject to jurisdiction under,id.at,it did delineate the principal considerations.
the court first concluded that the ats,which was originally enacted as part of the judiciary act of,is only jurisdictional,id.at,and does not create a statutory cause of action,see id.at.but it rejected the notion that the ats was stillborn because there could be no claim for relief without a further statute expressly authorizing adoption of causes of action.id.at.instead,according to the court,the statute expressed congress intent that federal courts could entertain claims once the jurisdictional grant was on the books,because torts in violation of the law of nations would have been recognized within the common law of the time.id.one component of this law was a body of law regulating the conduct of individuals situated outside domestic boundaries and consequently carrying an international savor.id.at.within this law was 
a sphere in which these rules binding individuals for the benefit of other individuals overlapped with the norms of state relationships.blackstone referred to it when he mentioned three specific offenses against the law of nations addressed by the criminal law of england violation of safe conducts,infringement of the rights of ambassadors,and piracy.an assault against an ambassador,for example,impinged upon the sovereignty of the foreign nation and if not adequately redressed could rise to an issue of war.it was this narrow set of violations of the law of nations,admitting of a judicial remedy and at the same time threatening serious consequences in international affairs,that was probably on minds of the men who drafted the ats with its reference to tort.
id.emphasis added citation omitted.the court concluded 
a lthough the ats is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action,the reasonable inference from the historical materials is that the statute was intended to have practical effect the moment it became law.the jurisdictional grant is best read as having been enacted on the understanding that the common law would provide a cause of action for the modest number of international law violations with a potential for personal liability at the time.
the court next addressed whether empowered the federal courts to recognize under the law of nations new claims,in addition to the traditional causes of action for violation of safe conducts,infringement of the rights of ambassadors,and piracy.id.although the court accepted the possibility of new causes of action,it cautioned that there are good reasons for a restrained conception of the discretion a federal court should exercise in considering a new cause of action of this kind.id.at.it continued w e think courts should require any claim based on the law of nations to rest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the paradigms we have recognized.id.applying this standard,the court held that a single illegal detention of less than a day,followed by the transfer of custody to lawful authorities and a prompt arraignment,violates no norm of customary international law so well defined as to support the creation of a federal remedy under.id.at.
cisneros asserts two types of sexual abuse.first,she alleges that aragon violated the federal statute,a,because he had sexual relations with her when she was only years old and he was.second,she alleges that he violated a and b because he had sexual relations with her at a time when she was incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct and physically incapable of refusing to participate in the conduct.according to cisneros,these statutory provisions are a law of nation sic providing this court with enough to find jurisdiction under the ats.aplt.br.at.in the alternative,she contends that there is plenty of common everyday evidence subject to judicial notice to show the law of nations requirement is met.id.at.
we reject both contentions.to begin with,criminalization of conduct by the united states does not mean that the conduct violates the law of nations.such criminalization may be relevant evidence,but the controlling consideration is whether the claimed wrongdoing rest s on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable
