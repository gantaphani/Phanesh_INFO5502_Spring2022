charles hegna died at the hands of terrorists who received partial support from the islamic republic of iran.members of the hegna family have attempted to collect a default judgment against property previously owned by iran and currently held by the united states.based on domestic statutes and international treaties,the two district courts a quo quashed writs of attachment and execution issued respectively against two parcels of real property.finding no error,we affirm both judgments.
the federal sovereign immunities act fsia articulates the general rule that a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states.as part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,congress created an exception for terrorist actions.a to be subject to a,a nation must be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.a a 
the victims of trafficking and violence protection act of vtvpa,stat,created a regime whereby a party who secured a judgment under a could receive payment from the secretary of the treasury.in exchange for that payment,the recipient would relinquish certain rights to collect against the terrorist state 
the terrorism risk insurance act tria,a,stat,provided additional rights to parties possessing judgments under a.tria states that a successful plaintiff may attach and execute against the blocked assets of terrorist parties 
additionally,tria c amends the vtvpa by inserting a section describing the procedures the government must follow in the event available funds can not satisfy all the outstanding requests for payment for a claims.although those receiving partial payments do not have to relinquish as many rights as they would have forfeited had they received full payment via the vtvpa,the recipients must give up some recovery rights.vtvpa a c requires the relinquishment of punitive damages against a terrorist entity,and a d prevents parties from executing or attaching property that is,inter alia,at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal.
thus,in response to a family member death,a party may seek a judgment against a state sponsor of terrorism.the party may satisfy such a judgment by seeking and receiving payment under the vtvpa and by attaching and enforcing against blocked assets pursuant to the tria.
in,hezbollah terrorists hijacked a kuwaiti airliner and diverted it to tehran,fatally shooting charles hegna in the process.in,the hegna family sought and obtained,pursuant to a a default judgment for in compensatory damages and in punitive damages against the islamic republic of iran and the iranian ministry of information and security 
relying upon tria a,the hegnas have attempted to attach and execute against numerous properties that iran owned at the time of the hostage crisis specifically,they have pursued properties in new york illinois maryland and texas.additionally,they filed for a payment pursuant to the vtvpa 
although the two countries promised,as part of the algiers accords to exchange seized consular property,each has retained property.consequently,the united states acts as a custodian of the property that the hegnas have attempted to attach,and,in every case,has moved to invalidate the family actions.
in the instant matter,the family attached two pieces of iranian property located in texas.one,located in lubbock,served as a home from which the prince of iran could receive fighter pilot training the property located in houston previously served as the residence of the general consul of iran 
with respect to the lubbock property,the district court granted a writ of attachment and a motion for expedited levy of a writ of execution and scheduled the sale of the property for august.the united states provided an initial vtvpa payment to the hegnas on july,and filed an emergency motion to void the sale on august.without providing a written analysis,the district court granted the motion to void the levy and the sale on august.
with respect to the houston property,the district court issued a writ of execution on november.after the united states moved to quash the writ,the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge,who,on august,concluded that the property fell within an exclusion to the blocked asset definition in tria d b ii and recommended that the district court quash the writ.the district court adopted the recommendations without amendment.the hegnas appeal the district courts failure to enforce the original writs of attachment and execution.
in each case,the district court granted a dispositive motion by terminating the relevant writ.the respective cases,however,present distinct questions of law.with respect to the houston property,we must determine whether the property fits within the blocked asset exclusion in tria d b ii.with respect to the lubbock property,we must decide exactly how a partial payment pursuant to vtvpa and tria affects a party ability to collect against property.we review the district court legal analyses de novo.kennedy tangipahoa parish library bd.of control,cir.
by requesting and receiving partial payment according to the terms of the vtvpa,the hegnas relinquished the ability to enforce against the lubbock property.the parties do not disagree that the hegnas applied for payment from the secretary of the treasury,pursuant to vtvpa a and that they received a partial payment before the sale of the lubbock property.
the hegnas challenge the order to quash on three grounds.first,they maintain that the partial payment received on july does not trigger the relinquishment provisions of the amended vtvpa.second,they assert that any relinquishment may occur only prospectively and can not apply to property already attached and set for sale.third,they claim that any possible relinquishment does not apply to the lubbock property,because such property is not at issue before an international tribunal to affirm the quashing of the writ of execution,we must agree with the district court on all three matters 
the hegnas acceptance of a partial payment triggered the relinquishment provisions of the vtvpa.amended vtvpa d states that 
a ny person receiving less than the full amount of compensatory damages awarded to that party in a judgment shall not be required to make the relinquishment set forth in previous sections,except that such person shall be required to relinquish rights set forth a in subsection a c and b in subsection a d with respect to enforcement against property that is at issue in claims against the united states before an international tribunal or that is the subject of awards by such tribunal.
the phrase such person refers to the individual receiving less than the full amount of compensatory damages.no other person is referred to in that subsection.thus,a party receiving partial payment does not have to relinquish his rights to compensatory damages but must give up those rights listed in the two subsections.subsection a c concerns punitive damages,and subsection a d addresses recovery against the at issue properties.
the hegnas would have us draw a line between a that falls below the portion that the government must a partial payment.in essence,the hegnas contend that they should have received more than the government paid them and that the insufficiency of the amount allowed them to pursue the sale of the lubbock property.
that theory fails for two reasons.first,the statute does not draw a distinction among types of partial payments,but merely states that a ny person receiving less than the full amount will relinquish punitive and at issue rights.the receipt of any partial limit the hegnas recovery options.
secondly,the government eventually paid the hegnas their full share of their proportional payment.the second payment occurred in november.thus,whatever relinquishment provisions are contained within the partial payment regime apply to the hegnas.
although receiving the vtvpa payment causes them to relinquish all rights to execute against designated property,the hegnas advance a creative but questionable argument that they still may sell the lubbock property.because payment did not arrive until after the district court attached the property and scheduled a sale,the hegnas maintain that the sale should proceed under this theory,texas law places the court levy against the lubbock property in custodia legis and ties all sales proceedings to the date of,july,
the hegnas support this interesting rift in the by citing a fifth circuit case that concerned bankruptcy and an supreme court opinion that addressed competing judgment liens from tennessee.these cases do not remotely apply to a situation resembling the instant case 
the family interesting theory would require the sale to proceed regardless of the correctness of the attachment or the validity of the sale.courts would not have the ability to alter their rulings in the event of a change in circumstances.the situation,however,did change once the united states made a partial vtvpa payment to the hegnas.
because the family members already applied for a payment from the government,they should not argue with the government attempts to hold them to the terms of the payment.receipt of the partial payment forced them to relinquish all rights to execute against or attach property that is at issue in claims before an international tribunal.vtvpa a d emphasis added.
assuming,arguendo,that the hegnas argument has some validity and that the right to execute now lies strictly with the district court,the court certainly possesses the ability to revisit its ruling.a court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for a variety of reasons,including the any reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.b.see also.e describing the period of time in which a party must file a motion to alter or amend a judgment 
the hegnas theory places form above common sense and above the district court ability to its ruling before the property is sold.thus,we turn to whether the lubbock property fits within the at issue language of a d.
because the lubbock property was at issue in a claim before an international tribunal,amended vtvpa d b prevents the hegnas from executing on the property.the united states asserts that the lubbock property is at issue in the states claims tribunal claims tribunal.in support,the government offers a declaration from mark clodfelter,who lists himself as the assistant legal adviser for,and director of the office of,international claims and investment disputes in the office of the legal adviser of the department of state.
the hegnas respond by contending that the property can not be at issue until after a court determines its jurisdiction over the property and that the claims tribunal does not have proper jurisdiction over the property in support of their argument,the hegnas offer a definition from a edition of black law dictionary and citations to two florida state court opinions.at issue,however,includes a broader swath of conflict than the hegnas assert.the most recent black law dictionary ed defines at issue as t aking opposite sides under dispute in question.although the united states has contested the jurisdiction of the states claims tribunal over the properties,both matters currently pend before that very body.even if the government ultimately prevails,the lubbock property will have remained at issue before the tribunal during the instant appeal 
the only question with respect to the at issue analysis concerns the evidence that the government has offered.the aforementioned declaration from clodfelter vaguely but coherently states his familiarity with the claims tribunal and that the lubbock property falls within a list of properties specifically identified as the subject of the tribunal case.
though clodfelter declaration could have included more specific information or documentary support the hegnas did not deny the substance of the declaration in their response,so they are foreclosed from requesting a hearing to offer additional evidence.
consequently,the hegna family acceptance of partial payment triggered the relinquishing provisions of the vtvpa.because the acceptance required the family to relinquish all rights to attach and execute the judgment,the hegnas,through the court,can not sell the property.finally,because the lubbock property currently stands at issue before an international tribunal,vtvpa a d and c b prevent the hegnas from attaching or executing any further judgments against that property.
the government argues that the vtvpa payment bars the attachment and sale of the houston property in the same manner as for the lubbock property.in considering the houston property,however,the magistrate judge expressly avoided the issues discussed in the analysis of the lubbock property 
before we may consider whether the vtvpa blocks collection against the houston property,we must determine whether the tria would allow the hegnas to attach or execute against the property in the first place.in essence,we must make the same inquiry as did the magistrate judge.although we may affirm for any reason the record supports we choose to follow the magistrate judge analysis.
tria a empowers an individual who secures a judgment pursuant to a to attach and execute against blocked assets to satisfy such judgment to the extent of any compensatory damages.section d defines blocked asset in such a way that it includes the houston property section d b ii,however,exempts property from the blocked asset category.to fall within the exemption,the property must satisfy two criteria.
first,the property must be subject to the vienna convention on consular relations.tria d b ii.secondly,the property must be used exclusively for diplomatic or consular purposes.id.because we answer both queries in the affirmative,the houston property does not qualify as a blocked asset for purposes of tria a.
as to the first matter,a consul residence falls within the sweep of the vienna convention on consular relations vccr,april.the signatories to the vccr pledge that,if one country severs consular relations with another,the severing countries will respect and protect the consular premises,together with the property of the consular post and the consular archives of one another.vccr,a.
the definition of consular post includes any,consulate,or consular agency.vccr,a.a consulate typically includes a consul residence,and no language in the treaty deviates from this norm.black law dictionary ed defining consulate as the location of a consul office or residence.
additionally,the united states has interpreted the vccr so as to include the houston property.not surprisingly,this court has not heretofore considered the vccr 
we note that the federal courts have long been loathe sic to involve themselves in matters of foreign policy,preferring to leave such issues to the executive branch.therefore,we have always given substantial weight to the interpretation of a treaty by the government agency charged with interpreting it.
more intelcom support,cir.
the united states,in its brief,interprets the reference to property of the consular post in article a to include real property such as the consul general residence at issue here.although the government certainly could craft a or opportunistic interpretation,the hegnas have offered no evidence to suggest such a motivation and have not given a citation to a case or to a compelling opposing argument.
consequently,the language of the vccr and the government reasonable interpretation of that language lead us to conclude that,under the vccr,the united states has an obligation to respect and protect property that served as the residence of the iranian general consul.the houston property is within the ambit of the vccr 
although the government has rented the houston property to private parties and has used some of those rental proceeds to satisfy obligations,it has used the consular residence exclusively for diplomatic or consular purposes.the hegnas emphasize the fact of the rental and argue that the government has used the proceeds for a nondiplomatic purpose.the magistrate judge described the two uses of the proceeds generated from renting the former consulate home 
the funds received from the rentals have been deposit
