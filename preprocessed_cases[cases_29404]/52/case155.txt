elena michelle asuncion rivera is the daughter of plaintiff appellee angelica asuncion mota and defendant appellant jose luis rivera castillo.like her parents,elena is a citizen of mexico,the country of her birth.in,when elena was six months old,her father traveled from mexico to new york to find work,and elena remained in mexico in her mother sole care.three years later,in april,her parents arranged for elena to be smuggled into the united states and taken to new york,where she began to live in her father household.during the following months,her mother tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to cross the border and join elena and rivera castillo in the united states.
having failed in those attempts,on november,asuncion mota filed a petition in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,seeking elena return to mexico under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,reprinted in,the hague convention or convention,as implemented by the international child abduction remedies act,et icara.the district court jack weinstein,judge concluded that rivera castillo wrongfully retained elena in the united states and that the convention required the court to order that elena be returned to mexico for custody proceedings there.a,d.rivera castillo appeals.
we affirm the district court findings of fact and its application of the convention and icara to those facts,and we remand this matter with instructions that the district court enter such orders as may be necessary to effect elena prompt and safe return to mexico.
background 
factual history 
the district court found that the following facts were established by a preponderance of the evidence.
asuncion mota and rivera castillo married in puebla,mexico in march.later that year,in september,asuncion mota gave birth to their daughter,elena.for the first six months of her life,elena lived in puebla with both of her parents.then,in march,when elena was six months old,rivera castillo left puebla and entered the united states illegally.he traveled to queens,new york,where he obtained employment,and began sending financial support to his wife and daughter.meanwhile,in mexico,asuncion mota assumed sole responsibility for elena care,and she and rivera castillo maintained regular communication via telephone.
in the spring of,asuncion mota and rivera castillo decided to reunite their family mother and child would move to new york,where the three would again live together.toward that end,mother and father agreed to the following arrangements.asuncion mota,her uncle,and elena would travel from puebla to nogales,a mexican city close to the arizona border.there,using funds provided by rivera castillo,mota would hire a person or persons to smuggle elena across the border.after elena had entered the united states,asuncion mota and her uncle would cross the border themselves,and travel with elena to new york.
the plan was successful only in part.asuncion mota was able to arrange for smugglers to take elena across the border,but the repeated attempts of asuncion mota and her uncle to follow elena into the united states were blocked by american border guards,and the two were returned in each instance to mexico.meanwhile,the smugglers had transported elena on her own to new york,where she began living with her father.
after living for some months more in a house in nogales,asuncion mota procured for herself and her uncle certain false identification,which they used in a renewed attempt to cross the border.this attempt,too,failed,but with more disastrous consequences the pair were arrested and prosecuted for use of false identification.each pleaded guilty and served a prison term in the united states before being deported to mexico.
by the time asuncion mota was deported after her release from prison,it had become apparent as the district court described that the plan for the mother to enter the united states and travel to new york had been,and would continue to be,frustrated,d at.further attempts by asuncion mota to enter the united states would expose her to the risk of progressively longer prison sentences.rivera castillo,moreover,had begun living with another woman it became evident that rivera castillo would no longer send financial support to asuncion mota.and,in response to asuncion mota repeated demands that elena be returned to her in mexico,rivera castillo declared that he would keep elena with him in new york.
procedural history 
in october,asuncion mota contacted the mexican government to request legal assistance in her effort to secure elena return to mexico.mexican authorities soon thereafter applied to the united states government for the child return.the united states department of state forwarded the application to rivera castillo in april,and asked that he consider returning the child to mexico voluntarily to avoid the initiation of proceedings under the convention.within two weeks of being contacted by the state department,rivera castillo instituted custody proceedings in new york family court,seeking sole custody of elena.those proceedings are now being held in abeyance,pending resolution of this suit.
having obtained no relief through official diplomatic channels,in november asuncion mota filed a petition in federal district court seeking an order requiring rivera castillo to return elena to her in mexico.see,d.rivera castillo opposed the petition.the court permitted the parties limited discovery,and then held a bench trial in which asuncion mota,her parents,and her uncle testified via telephone with the aid of interpreters,and rivera castillo testified in person.after conducting these proceedings and receiving briefing from the parties,the court promptly issued a thoughtful decision concluding that elena country of habitual residence under the convention was mexico that rivera castillo had wrongfully retained elena in contravention of asuncion mota custody rights under mexican law and that the hague convention and icara therefore required that elena be returned to mexico forthwith.id.at.the court then entered judgment and a detailed order designed to effect elena return.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
in cases arising under the hague convention and icara,we review a district court factual determinations for clear error.gitter gitter,cir.we review de novo a district court interpretation of the convention and its application of the convention to the facts.id.
applicable law 
as we discussed in depth in our decision in gitter,the hague convention was enacted to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the state of their habitual residence,as well as to secure protection for rights of access.id.quoting hague convention,preamble.the convention drafters were particularly concerned by the practice in which a family member would remove a child to jurisdictions more favorable to his or her custody claims in order to obtain a right of custody from the authorities of the country to which the child ha d been taken.id.internal quotation marks omitted.to deprive such disfavored conduct of any practical or juridical consequences,the convention places at the head of its objectives the restoration of the status quo,by means of the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state.id.at quotation marks omitted see also hague convention,the objects of the convention are a to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state and b to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one contracting state are effectively respected in the other contracting states.
the convention does not establish substantive standards for resolving the merits of any underlying custody dispute.hague convention.rather,the convention focus is simply upon whether a child should be returned to her country of habitual residence for custody proceedings.in re del,cir.to that end,icara provides that a ny person seeking to initiate judicial proceedings under the convention for the return of a child or for arrangements for securing the effective exercise of rights of access to a child may do so by commencing a civil action in a state or federal court in the place where the child is located at the time the petition is filed.b.
the convention places two substantive provisions at the core of any petition seeking relief.a petitioner must demonstrate a the child in question was habitually resident in a contracting state before the child removal to or retention in a different state,and b removal or retention of the child was wrongful.see e a hague convention,gitter,at.a preponderance of the evidence must support a petitioner showing.e.
in the absence of any guidance from the convention or icara regarding the crucial determination of a child state of habitual residence,our court in gitter adopted the following approach 
first,the court should inquire into the shared intent of those entitled to fix the child residence usually the parents at the latest time that their intent was shared.in making this determination the court should look,as always in determining intent,at actions as well as declarations.normally the shared intent of the parents should control the habitual residence of the child.second,the court should inquire whether the evidence unequivocally points to the conclusion that the child has acclimatized to the new location and thus has acquired a new habitual residence,notwithstanding any conflict with the parents latest shared intent.
as to the wrongfulness of the removal or retention,the convention itself sets forth the applicable rule 
the removal or the retention of a child is wrongful where 
a it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person,an institution or any other body,either jointly or alone,under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention and 
b at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised,either jointly or alone,or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
hague convention.
if the court determines that a petitioner has satisfied this burden as to the two core elements habitual residence and wrongful retention the court must ordinarily order the return of the child forthwith.hague convention,see also d.a court is not bound to order the child return if the respondent can successfully establish that any of four statutory exceptions applies,see hague convention,enumerating exceptions see also e,but the exceptions are to be narrowly read,blondin dubois,cir citing a.
for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that mexico was the country of elena habitual residence at the time relevant for this analysis that rivera castillo has wrongfully retained elena in the united states and that no statutory exception applies.elena must therefore be returned to mexico,where her parents respective custody rights may be fully adjudicated.
habitual residence 
we first consider whether asuncion mota proved by a preponderance of the evidence that elena was removed to or retained in a state other than the state of her habitual residence.see gitter,at.although the circumstances of her initial removal are subject to dispute as we will discuss,it is clear that rivera castillo has retained elena within the united states.therefore,if asuncion mota has proved that elena was a habitual resident of mexico at the time of the retention,asuncion mota has satisfied the first prong of gitter,and we proceed to the second prong,where we ask whether that retention is wrongful.id.if asuncion mota has not carried this burden,however,her petition fails at the threshold the child must have been removed to or retained in a contracting state other than her state of habitual residence for the convention to apply.id.at.
shared intentions of the parents 
as previously noted,our primary consideration in determining a child place of habitual residence is the shared intention of the child parents at the latest time that their intent was shared.id.at.t his is a question of fact in which the findings of the district court are entitled to deference,and we consequently review those findings for clear error.id.at.under the deferential clear error standard,w e will not upset a factual finding unless we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.bessemer trust branin,cir quoting white white rose food,cir.we have no such definite and firm conviction here.
for the first three and years of her life,elena habitual residence was in mexico until she was brought to the united states in,elena had lived only in mexico,apparently with the intention of both parents that their daughter would live in mexico indefinitely.no argument has been made to the contrary.
according to rivera castillo,however,as of april it was the parties settled intention that elena move to the united states.appellant br.at.this new intention,he argues,negates the conclusion that mexico continued to be her habitual residence.id.rivera castillo calls clear error the district court finding that the parents agreement that elena would move to new york was conditioned upon elena joining a household that included both her father and her mother.see a,d at.in support,rivera castillo emphasizes that only he testified as to the specifics of the agreement to move the family to the united states,and that his testimony did not suggest that elena habitual residence in america was contingent upon asuncion mota success in entering the country.thus,when asked on whether asuncion mota had consented to rivera castillo keeping elena in the united states,even if asuncion mota did not join them,rivera castillo answered,we never talked about there being any kind of condition.trial tr.in response to the district court query whether rivera castillo had ever discuss ed with asuncion mota what would happen if the child came over and she did not,rivera castillo answered,we never talked about that.id.at.
rivera castillo also posits that asuncion mota offered no evidence that her consent to elena move to the united states was conditioned on her own ability to achieve entry into the united states.reply br.at internal quotation marks omitted.he points out that the district court rejected as incredible asuncion mota account of the planned border crossing,and argues that there was no basis on which the district court could reasonably find that a condition attached to the plan for elena to be brought to new york.
we are not persuaded.notwithstanding rivera castillo assertions and the district court rejection of the particulars of asuncion mota account of elena border crossing,the record evidence sustains the district court factual finding as to the parties latest shared intention.see krizek cigna grp,cir c lear error review does not entitle us to second guess a district court inferences provided the inference drawn has some evidentiary basis in the record.
asuncion mota was elena primary caretaker for the first three and years of her daughter life,and,as the district court found,elena was raised in a loving,supportive home in mexico,d at.asuncion mota proved herself a devoted mother and was persistent in her efforts to retrieve elena after the plan fell through.after her multiple failed attempts to enter the united states,and having served a term of incarceration,asuncion mota demanded that rivera castillo return elena to mexico.she contacted mexican authorities to obtain help in recovering her child.she instituted this lawsuit,and has continued to prosecute it from mexico in hopes of reuniting with elena.during the bench trial,elena was put on the phone so that she could listen to and speak with her mother.as the district court observed,elena was obviously delighted to hear her mother voice,and i t was clear that a warm relationship continued to exist between the two.id.at.
the impression of asuncion mota that emerges from the record is that of a committed parent who has sought to keep her child close to her.the record is devoid of any suggestion that asuncion mota intended permanently to abandon elena.and,in fact,asuncion mota testified that she neve
