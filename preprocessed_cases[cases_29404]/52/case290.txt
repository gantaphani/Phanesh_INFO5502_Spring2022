in november,plaintiff justin robinson,an employee of john shields detective agency shields agency,was assigned as a security guard at a building on the east side of manhattan,in new york city.the building had then recently been purchased by the defendant,the government of malaysia.while on duty,robinson was injured when he slipped and fell on a white substance apparently left on the floor by construction workers.
invoking federal subject matter jurisdiction under and,robinson filed a complaint against the malaysian government in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that it had caused his injuries by its recklessness,carelessness and negligence in the ownership,operation,maintenance and control of the building pl.compl.in its amended answer,the malaysian government asserted immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,and concurrently moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court constance baker motley,judge granted the motion.
we affirm on the grounds that i robinson failed either to allege facts,or to meet his burden of coming forward with evidence,sufficient to deprive the malaysian government of immunity under the torts exception of the fsia,a and ii robinson may not,for the first time on appeal,raise the commercial activities exception to sovereign immunity,a,as an alternative basis for jurisdiction,because he has failed to demonstrate that our refusal to hear that assertion in the first instance would work a manifest injustice.
background 
with one exception,discussed below in footnote,the parties do not dispute the material facts insofar as they are relevant to this appeal.from july to november,robinson worked as a private security guard for shields agency.in,the agency assigned robinson to act as a guard at a building at east street,new york,new york the premises,then occupied by a organization,the american field service.robinson continued to work at the premises until november,the date of the accident that is the subject of this litigation.
in,the american field service vacated the premises.the malaysian government purchased them on a date unspecified in the record but before the time of robinson accident.it had not yet occupied them when robinson was hurt although robinson was himself uncertain who owned the premises at the time of the accident,he was under the impression that the malaysian government did because f rom time to time people,representatives maybe from the malaysian government would visit to see what was happening.
the record suggests that the malaysian government in effect inherited and retained the services of shields agency from the american field service.robinson confirmed that he continued to work at the premises throughout the ownership transition,until the time of the accident.his duties included periodic security inspections of each floor of the building,registration of visitors,and maintenance of a logbook in which he recorded,inter alia,the results of his inspections and the arrival and departure of visitors.
to render the premises suitable for use as a mission to the united states the malaysian government hired a general contractor,howell,howell,to perform renovations.howell,in turn,enlisted at least one subcontractor,walsh floors,general assurance company walsh.howell and walsh are third party defendants in this action.the claims against them are not before us on appeal,and the record on appeal provides scant information about their activities.the record strongly suggests,however,that both were independent contractors,and we assume that to be the case for the purposes of this opinion.one walsh,presumably a principal of walsh,testified that the malaysian government never instructed walsh employees in the means or methods by which they should work or furnished them with construction materials or equipment.the record does not show what control,if any,the malaysian government exercised over the means or methods by which howell performed its general contract.but the malaysian government brief on appeal states,appellee br.at,and robinson does not dispute,that howell,too,was a contractor.
on the morning of november,robinson slipped and fell at the premises,then still undergoing construction work.he can not recall the accident and can not say for certain what caused it.but he did testify that prior to the accident,construction workers were putting up drywall,preparing to lay carpet,and installing electrical wiring.both parties ascribe robinson accident to a white substance on the floor,which they assume one of the contractors left there during construction.robinson accident injured him,he contends severely,and he asserts that he continues to suffer from serious orthopedic and neurological conditions.appellant br.at.
on november,robinson brought suit against the malaysian government by filing a verified complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.he invoked federal jurisdiction under and and alleged that he was caused to sustain severe and permanent injuries when,due to the negligence of the defendant,he was caused to slip and fall due to a dangerous and defective condition.pl.compl.he also alleged that his injuries were caused by the recklessness,carelessness and negligence of the defendant in the ownership,operation,maintenance and control of the premises id.apart from these generic allegations of negligence,the complaint did not specify how the malaysian government caused robinson injuries except insofar as it asserted that,as owner of the premises,the government had a duty to maintain them in a reasonably safe condition,id,and owed and breached some duty of care to all persons lawfully at its premises,including robinson,id.
the malaysian government answer,filed on september,denied the allegations generally.the defendant then filed a complaint against howell,which,in turn,filed a second complaint against walsh.
on april,the malaysian government moved to amend its answer nunc pro tunc to assert sovereign immunity and to dismiss the complaint under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.robinson failed timely to file opposition papers,and the district court granted the motion by default.
on may,however,the district court vacated its order so as to permit robinson to respond to the malaysian government motion.robinson then filed answering papers in which he argued that the torts exception of the fsia deprives the malaysian government of sovereign immunity under the allegations set forth in his complaint.the malaysian government responded,inter alia,that even assuming the truth of these allegations,it retained immunity because its only a building and hiring contractors to renovate it for use as a foreign discretionary and that to defeat sovereign immunity under the torts exception,the plaintiff must,as robinson did not,allege conduct.
on may,the district court again granted the malaysian government motion on sovereign immunity grounds and dismissed robinson complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.on may,judgment dismissing the complaint for the reasons stated in the court order dated may,was entered.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
the standard of review applicable to district court decisions regarding subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia is clear error for factual findings and de novo for legal conclusions.titan,guangzhou zhen hua shipping,cir citing filetech france telecom,cir.
the district court terse order makes it difficult to determine the precise grounds,legal or factual,on which it dismissed robinson complaint.we have held,however,that w e review de novo a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where the trial court dismissed on the basis of the complaint alone or the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts from the record.mackensworth am.merchant,cir.the summary nature of the court order makes it difficult to determine whether the court resolved any factual disputes in its order dismissing this action.but we need not inquire into any potentially disputed issues of fact to resolve this appeal.our review is therefore de novo.
ii.jurisdiction under the fsia 
the district court jurisdiction over this litigation,if jurisdiction it had,arose under entitled actions against foreign states.section provides in pertinent part 
the district courts shall have original jurisdiction without regard to amount in controversy of any nonjury civil action against a foreign state as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either under sections of this title or under any applicable international agreement.
a.title and,the latter referred to in a,are,like itself,a part of the fsia.section provides that,generally,a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states except as provided in sections to section sets forth,inter alia,various exceptions to that immunity the circumstances in which a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states or of the states.id.a.the fsia provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this country.saudi arabia nelson,d quoting argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d see also reiss societe centrale du groupe des assurances nationales,cir quoting amerada hess,at.
congress enacted the fsia to define the jurisdiction of the united states courts in suits against foreign states and to codify when and how parties can maintain a lawsuit against a foreign state,at,reprinted in.congress intended the fsia to transfer the determination of sovereign immunity from the executive branch,id.at,at,to which united states courts had theretofore traditionally deferred,see verlinden cent.bank of nigeria,d,to the judicial branch in order to conform the procedure in this country to the practice in virtually every other sovereign immunity decisions are made exclusively by the courts and not by a foreign affairs agency,at,at.
in verlinden,the supreme court held that the fsia permissibly vests the federal courts with jurisdiction under the arising under clause of article iii of the united states constitution see at.for this reason,every suit against a foreign sovereign necessarily raises questions of substantive law at the very outset,id.at,namely,whether the court possesses federal jurisdiction under one of the fsia exclusive statutory bases.see id.the statute must be applied by the district courts in every action against a foreign sovereign,since subject matter jurisdiction depends on the existence of one of the specified exceptions to sovereign immunity citation omitted see also cargill int l pavel dybenko,cir quoting verlinden.under the fsia,federal courts therefore inquire at the threshold of every action against a foreign state whether the exception to sovereign immunity that the plaintiff alleges permits the exercise of federal jurisdiction.verlinden,at.
before the district court,robinson relied solely on the torts exception set forth in a.that section reads in pertinent part 
a a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states or of the states in any case 
in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death,or damage to or loss of property,occurring in the united states and caused by the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment except this paragraph shall not apply to 
a any claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused 
federal jurisdiction under this fsia exception to immunity exists,then,only if i the plaintiff claims some injury caused by the tortious act or omission of a foreign state and ii this act or omission was.
we conclude that robinson claim fails in the first respect and therefore need not determine whether it succeeds in the second.
iii.principles of analysis 
issues of fact in rule b motions to dismiss 
in a motion to dismiss pursuant to.b,the defendant may challenge either the legal or factual sufficiency of the plaintiff assertion of jurisdiction,or both.see phoenix consulting,republic of angola,see also gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,d scalia,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment it is well ingrained in the law that jurisdiction can be called into question either by challenging the sufficiency of the allegation or by challenging the accuracy of the jurisdictional facts alleged.citations omitted.h ow the district court proceeds to resolve the motion to dismiss depends upon whether the motion presents a factual challenge.phoenix consulting,at.if the defendant challenges only the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff jurisdictional allegations,the court must take all facts alleged in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff,sweet sheahan,cir citation omitted.but where evidence relevant to the jurisdictional question is before the court,the district court may refer to that evidence.makarova united states,cir.
rule b motions in fsia cases 
generally.in the context of a rule b challenge to jurisdiction under the fsia,then,we have said that the district court must look at the substance of the allegations to determine whether one of the exceptions to the fsia general exclusion of jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns applies.cargill int l,at see also verlinden,at.in doing so,the court must review the pleadings and any evidence before it.cargill int l,at in filetech,we held that the district court erred by failing to look beyond the pleadings to factual submissions,including affidavits,submitted to the court in order to resolve a factual dispute as to whether there was sufficient commercial activity to permit the court to exercise jurisdiction under the commercial activities exception to sovereign immunity.see a.we remarked 
i n view of the factual disputes in the district court,it was error for it to accept the mere allegations of the complaint as a basis for finding subject matter jurisdiction.the district court look ed only to the complaint in making its determination.it did so despite the factual issues regarding jurisdiction that were presented to it.in these circumstances,the court should have looked outside the pleadings to the submissions,which both contradicted and supported the bare allegations of jurisdiction pleaded in the complaint.
filetech,at see also phoenix consulting,at when the defendant has challenged the factual basis of the court jurisdiction the court must go beyond the pleadings and resolve any disputed issues of fact the resolution of which is necessary to a ruling upon the motion to dismiss.
if the defendant challenges the factual basis of the plaintiff claim the plaintiff has the burden of going forward with evidence showing that,under exceptions set forth in the fsia,immunity should not be granted,although the ultimate burden of persuasion remains with the alleged foreign sovereign.cargill int l,at internal citation omitted in other words,in assessing whether a plaintiff has sufficiently alleged or proffered evidence to support jurisdiction under the fsia,a district court must review the allegations in the complaint,the undisputed facts,if any,placed before it by the parties,the plaintiff comes forward with sufficient evidence to carry its burden of production on this disputed issues of fact,with the defendant foreign sovereign shouldering the burden of persuasion.see id.
the district court review of the evidence before it on a motion to dismiss based on an assertion of sovereign immunity has particular significance because of the necessity of resolving that issue early on if possible.s overeign immunity under the fsia is immunity from suit,not just from liability.moran kingdom of saudi arabia,cir citing gould,pechiney ugine kuhlmann,cir.such immunity is effectively lost if a case is permitted to go to trial.id.citation omitted.
a district court does not,of course,decide a case on the merits in order to decide if it has jurisdiction.j urisdiction is not defeated by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action.bell hood.but under the fsia,the district court may examine the defendant activities to determine whether they confer subject matter jurisdiction on the federal courts.see verlinden,at.
inevitably,the jurisdiction and merits inquiries overlap to the extent that each requires examination of the applicable substantive law.but we do not think,as judge sotomayor suggests in her concurrence,that this makes these inquiries coterminous or empt ies of meaning the concept of immunity from suit post at.to the contrary,by permitting the district court to go beyond the bare allegations of the complaint,it preserves the effectiveness of the immunity doctrine by avoiding put ting the foreign government defendant to the expense of defending what may be a protracted lawsuit without an opportunity to obtain an authoritative determination of its amenability to suit at the earliest possible opportunity.segni commercial office of spain,cir 
the tortious act or omission exception to sovereign immunity.section a deprives a foreign state of sovereign immunity in legal actions in which money damages are sought against it for personal injury caused by the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment provided that the claim is not based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused.a.in assessing whether there is a sufficient allegation or proffer of evidence to support the conclusion that the malaysian government committed a tortious act or omission in this case,the district court was required,first,to determine what the relevant activities of the malaysian government were.second,the court was required to decide whether those acts were tortious under the law of the state of new york,which indisputably would apply to the merits of the claim if those activities could not render the malaysian government liable for a tort under new york law,then it remained immune under a.and if it remained immune under a,there was no jurisdiction over it under.finally,if the district court concluded that the plaintiff did allege malaysian government action that constituted tortious acts under new york law,the court would have been required to decide whether those acts were.otherwise,malaysia sovereign immunity under a a prevailed.
in making the assessment of whether the plaintiff has alleged actions on the part of the defendant that constitute a tort,the district court may well have taken an excursion into the same legal territory that it would visit in the course of deciding the case on the merits.that is not remarkable.the fsia itself does not provide any substantive tort law to guide the inquiry.see first city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,d noting that the fsia was not intended to affect the substantive law of liability quoting,at,at.it is ordinary tort law that applies to foreign governments and into which the court inquiry would properly have been directed.as noted in the legislative history of the fsia,tortious act s or omission s for which the fsia permits suit include causes of actions which are based on strict liability as well as on negligence the purpose of section a is to permit the victim of a traffic accident or other noncommercial tort to maintain an action against a foreign state to the extent otherwise provided by law,at,at emphasis added.
courts are therefore regularly called upon to inquire into substantive state or federal law to resolve the threshold question of subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia.in zappia middle east construction,abu dhabi,cir,for example,on appeal from the grant of a rule b motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we held that the applicability of the expropriation exception to the fsia,a,required a determination whether the defendant conduct violated international law and,in that case,whether principles of corporate law permitted the plaintiff to pierce the corporate veil of a foreign corporation.we did so even though the same liability under international law of the foreign government for the behavior of the have been presented on the merits.in first fidelity bank,government of antigua barbuda,cir,on a motion to vacate a default judgment pursuant to rule b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia commercial activities exception,we reviewed new york agency law to decide whether antigua ambassador could bind its government by his signature on loan papers.the plaintiff would have been required to meet the same standard and make the same factual showing in order to prevail on the merits with respect to the country liability for the loan we held that the district court should have looked to the pleadings and factual submissions,including affidavits,to resolve a factual dispute as to whether the defendant engaged in sufficient commercial activity to permit jurisdiction.see id.at.we also specifically noted that a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in an fsia case,because it may involve an examination of substantive law,can look like a decision on the merits.id.at.
other circuits have pursued similar inquiries.in joseph office of the consulate general of nigeria,cir,for instance,the ninth circuit held that t he scope of employment provision of the tortious activity exception essentially requires a finding that the doctrine of respondeat superior applies to the tortious acts of individuals,id.at,and looked to the california law of respondeat superior to determine whether the individual accused of tortious behavior was acting within the scope of his office or employment with respect to the foreign state defendant,see id.at.it did so even though a court trying the case on the merits would have had to decide the same respondeat superior question in order to determine whether the defendant government could be held liable for the acts of its employee.accord,moran,at following joseph in applying state law applicable to the alleged tort to determine whether the individual alleged tortfeasors were acting within the scope of their employment at the time the events at issue occurred.and in liu republic of china,cir,the ninth circuit again applied the california doctrine of respondeat superior for similar purposes.the court explicitly noted that w hether the defendant foreign state is liable under respondeat superior is crucial not only to the issue of the court jurisdiction,but also to the merits of the appeal from the denial of the plaintiff judgment on the wrongful death claim there being pursued.id.at 
iv.appraisal of robinson claim under the fsia 
the government of malaysia is indisputably a sovereign foreign state.it is thus entitled to immunity unless one of the statutory exceptions applies.cargill int l,at citations omitted.it submitted evidence to the district court bearing on the jurisdictional issue.robinson responded with evidence of his own we can not tell from the brief order of the district court,however,whether it dismissed the complaint on the basis of the allegations in the complaint alone or on the basis of undisputed facts or the resolution of issues of fact.we need not return the case to the district court for clarification,however,because we conclude i that the allegations in the complaint,taken as true,do not allege a tortious act or omission required to sustain jurisdiction under the fsia,and ii even if the broad allegations could be read sufficiently to allege a tort,robinson has not met his burden of going forward with evidence together with any undisputed facts showing that under the torts exception to the fsia,immunity should not be granted id.citation omitted.
tortious act or omission by the malaysian government 
we must first inquire whether robinson pleaded or came forward with evidence sufficient to show that his claim is for a tortious act or omission caused by the malaysian government.
new york common law.under new york law,a landowner must maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition.see basso miller,scurti city of new york.but that duty of care extends only to reasonably foreseeable accidents.see basso,at,at,at.in the specific context of a building undergoing construction by independent contractors,this means that unless the owner created the condition or had actual or constructive notice of the condition for such a period of time that,in the exercise of reasonable care,the owner should have corrected it,the owner owes no duty of care with respect to defective condition s.richardson simone,dep t see also goodman,dep t holding that the owner of property who retained an independent contractor did not owe any duty of care to the plaintiff,who had slipped and fallen on the adjoining sidewalk.the only exceptions to this general absence of a common law duty of care on the part of owners are i for negligent hiring or supervision,ii for work that is inherently dangerous,and iii where the employer bears a specific duty.goodman,at,at.
robinson complaint alleges that his injuries were caused by the recklessness,carelessness and negligence of the malaysian government in the ownership,operation,maintenance and control of the premises east street,new york,new york.pl.compl.the complaint does not allege nor is there evidence to suggest that the malaysian government or any of its employees or agents left the white substance on which robinson alleges he slipped on the floor of the premises.indeed,both parties assume that one of the contractors,howell or walsh,did.and the complaint does not allege that the malaysian government in any relevant sense employed either of these third parties.
furthermore,there is neither an allegation nor evidence in the record that indicates that the malaysian government had actual or constructive notice of the condition.and neither the allegations nor the evidence suggests that the malaysian government engaged in negligent hiring or exercised supervisory control over walsh or howell,that construction at the premises was inherently dangerous,or that the malaysian government breached a specific duty to robinson thereby causing his injury.
the sole duty that robinson alleges malaysia breached is that of a landowner to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition,free from dangerous and hazardous conditions for all persons lawfully thereat pl.compl.the proper question at the jurisdictional threshold is whether this claim is cognizable as a tortious act or omission caused by the malaysian government under new york law.under the principles of new york law outlined above,it is not.
finally on this score,we note that the conclusory nature of robinson allegations alone would give us pause before we would allow them to sustain jurisdiction.see zappia,at finding,on appeal from a rule b motion under the fsia,conclusory allegations in the plaintiff affidavit insufficient to sustain jurisdiction accord arriba petroleos mexicanos,cir we would not allow such generalized allegations against an american government entity under the ftca to provoke massive discovery it is unimaginable that fsia would authorize broader exposure to suit of a foreign government instrumentality citations omitted see also jazini nissan motor,cir refusing to allow conclusory jurisdictional allegations to permit the plaintiff to obtain extensive discovery on that issue.to sustain federal jurisdiction on generic allegations of negligence caused by a dangerous and defective condition,pl.compl,absent an assertion or evidence of a factual predicate for such jurisdiction,would invite plaintiffs to circumvent the jurisdictional hurdle of the fsia by inserting vague and conclusory allegations of tortious conduct in their then to rely on the federal courts to conclude that some conceivable tortious act falls within the purview of these generic allegations under the applicable substantive law.this is at odds with the goal of the fsia to enable a foreign government to obtain an early dismissal when the substance of the claim against it does not support jurisdiction.
we therefore hold that robinson has neither pleaded nor come forward with evidence sufficient to show that his claim is for a tortious act or omission caused by the malaysian government.
new york labor law.on appeal,robinson also invokes new york labor law and as far as we can tell,this theory was not raised before the district court.in the absence of manifest injustice,we will not hear such an assertion.see singleton wulff,d third assocs.consulate general of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia,cir,and section v of this opinion,below 
non discretionary conduct 
because we conclude that robinson claim is not for a tortious act or omission caused by the malaysian government,a jurisdictional prerequisite,we affirm the district court dismissal on that basis.we do not reach the question of whether the alleged conduct of the malaysian government was discretionary for purposes of the fsia.
v.the commercial activities exception 
finally,robinson urges us in the alternative to sustain jurisdiction under the commercial activities exception to the fsia,a.he did not raise this argument in the district court,and the court did not consider it.we likewise decline to consider it on appeal because we find no manifest injustice sufficient to justify departure from the general rule that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.singleton,at.see also third,at finding,where plaintiffs invoked the fsia for the first time on appeal,no reason to depart from the settled principle that,absent manifest injustice,appellate courts do not pass on an issue not raised in the trial court.the only reason robinson offers for failure to raise the commercial activities exception in the district court is that his attorneys neglected the filing deadline and therefore were required to brief the issues on an expedited basis.there is no manifest injustice here.we decline to address this argument in the first instance on appeal.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
our holding today is narrow robinson failure to allege sufficiently a tort claim against malaysia deprived the district court of jurisdiction to entertain this suit under a,which extends jurisdiction only to torts.concerned that some of the language of the majority opinion might be read to reach beyond this holding,i write to emphasize what we have decided and what has been left for another day.
the majority opinion correctly states that f ederal jurisdiction under this fsia exception to immunity exists only if i the plaintiff claims some injury caused by the tortious act or omission of a foreign state and ii this act or omission was.ante,at.as the opinion observes,because robinson claim fails in the first respect we therefore need not determine whether it succeeds in the second.ante,at.the opinion ably explains that robinson has failed to allege,under applicable new york law,that malaysia has committed a tort against him.ante,at.for that reason,the district court had no jurisdiction to hear robinson claim under a.it is unnecessary,therefore,to speculate on what might have become of robinson complaint on this.b motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction had robinson sufficiently alleged that malaysia had committed a tort.
accordingly,i find no basis for the majority reference to the merits of robinson claim or its suggestion that the district court could have reached the merits on this.b motion.i believe that the distinction between the sufficiency of robinson allegations and whether those allegations have any merit is important because there is good reason to believe that jurisdiction under the tort least insofar as the tort is on a plaintiff allegations,not on their ultimate merit.
i do not dispute the general proposition noted by the majority opinion that,when jurisdiction depends on certain facts,and the moving party under b challenges these facts,the courts can dig beneath the allegations to decide the necessary jurisdictional facts.see gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake
