on august,a devastating truck bomb exploded outside the american embassy in nairobi,kenya.the blast killed more than people,including americans,and wounded more than others.most of the casualties were kenyan.the plaintiffs in this case are all kenyan victims,relatives of victims,and businesses harmed in the attack.they sued defendants osama bin laden and al qaeda for orchestrating the bombing,and defendant afghanistan for providing logistical support to bin laden and al qaeda.the district court dismissed the claims against afghanistan for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and those against bin laden and al qaeda for lack of personal jurisdiction.
although we agree that the foreign sovereign immunities act bars the plaintiffs claims against afghanistan,we reverse the dismissal of their actions against bin laden and al qaeda.those defendants engaged in unabashedly malignant actions directed at and felt in this country.gte new media,bellsouth.bin laden and al qaeda should therefore reasonably anticipate being haled into court here by those injured as a result of those actions,burger king rudzewicz,d,regardless of the plaintiffs nationality.
in early,odilla mutaka mwani and his fellow plaintiffs filed this action in the united states district court for the district of columbia.they sought compensatory damages and other relief from osama bin laden,the terrorist organization known as al qaeda,and the nation of afghanistan for the injuries they sustained in the embassy bombing the plaintiffs predicated subject matter jurisdiction for their claims against afghanistan on the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,et,and for those against bin laden and al qaeda on the alien tort claims act atca.the latter provides that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.id.
on february,the plaintiffs moved to serve defendants bin laden and al qaeda by publication.on august,the district court granted the plaintiffs leave to serve those defendants by publishing notice for six weeks in the daily washington law reporter,the international herald tribune,and in arabic.mwani united states,order at,august order.the plaintiffs later advised the court that the notice had run in all three newspapers,as well as in two additional east african publications.
to no one surprise,neither bin laden nor al qaeda responded.on august,the plaintiffs moved for entry of default against them.because the district court was not satisfied that it had personal jurisdiction over bin laden and al qaeda,it denied the motion without prejudice,granting plaintiffs additional time to pursue the issue.see mwani united states,mem.op.at,march opinion.the plaintiffs responded with a renewed motion for entry of default in july,and with supplemental memoranda in august,september,and october of that year.in these papers,the plaintiffs argued that bin laden and al qaeda had sufficient nationwide contacts with the united states to satisfy constitutional limits on the court exercise of jurisdiction 
on september,the district court held that,to enter a default,it must have jurisdiction over the party against whom the judgment is sought,and the plaintiffs must demonstrate such jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.mwani united states,mem.op.at,september opinion internal quotation marks omitted.applying those principles,the court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to sustain their burden of proving that this court can exercise personal jurisdiction over bin laden and al qaeda.id.that was so,the court said,both because of the quality of the plaintiffs evidence,and because of its failure to establish sufficient contacts between the defendants and the forum to permit the exercise of jurisdiction under the district of columbia statute and the constitution.see id.at.
the dismissal of the plaintiffs claims against bin laden and al qaeda left afghanistan as the only remaining defendant.the plaintiffs effected service of process by certified mail on afghanistan ministry of foreign affairs,through that country embassy in the district of columbia.an appearance was entered by the transitional islamic state of afghanistan hereinafter afghanistan the interim government for afghanistan established by the bonn accords of december,which were implemented under the united nations auspices after the taliban armed forces were defeated by an international coalition and the northern alliance.appellees br.at.afghanistan then moved to dismiss the plaintiffs claims for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction,citing the fsia.
in june,the district court granted afghanistan motion to dismiss,rejecting the plaintiffs contention that the case fell within two exceptions to the implicit waiver and commercial activities.mwani united states,mem.op.at june,june opinion.at the same time,it denied the plaintiffs request for jurisdictional discovery because it did not see what facts additional discovery could produce that would affect its jurisdictional analysis.id.at quoting goodman holdings rafidain bank.
the plaintiffs filed a timely appeal.in part ii,we consider their contention that the district court erred in dismissing the claims against bin laden and al qaeda.in part iii,we address their challenge to the dismissal of the claims against afghanistan.
we review the dismissal of a claim for lack of jurisdiction de novo.see,gorman ameritrade holding.in evaluating the district court dismissal of the claims against bin laden and al qaeda,we must consider two distinct determinations made by the court.the first is the appropriate burden and standard of proof for establishing personal jurisdiction over an absent defendant at this stage of the litigation.the second is whether the plaintiffs satisfied those requirements.
the district court correctly noted that the entry of a default judgment is not automatic,and that a court should satisfy itself that it has personal jurisdiction before entering judgment against an absent defendant.march opinion at the court acknowledged that when ruling upon personal jurisdiction without an evidentiary hearing,a court ordinarily demands only a prima facie showing of jurisdiction by the plaintiffs.september opinion at it is only if the court takes evidence on the issue or rules on the personal jurisdiction question in the context of a trial that a heightened,preponderance of the evidence standard applies.id nonetheless,the district court concluded that in this case it should require the plaintiffs to establish jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence,because it was on the cusp of a default judgment proceeding,and defendants are not presently before the court.september opinion at.and it further determined that,to satisfy that burden,the plaintiffs would have to proffer evidence meeting the standards of admissibility ordinarily reserved for the summary judgment and trial stages of litigation.see id.at.
we reject this approach.the absence of the defendant is precisely the reason the federal rules of civil procedure provide for default judgments,which safeguard plaintiffs when the adversary process has been halted because of an essentially unresponsive party.in that instance,the diligent party must be protected lest he be faced with interminable delay and continued uncertainty as to his rights.jackson beech,internal quotation marks omitted.far from constituting a rationale for increasing the plaintiffs burden of proof,if anything the absence of the defendants counsels greater flexibility toward the plaintiffs because it impedes their ability to obtain jurisdictional discovery.there is thus no reason for the district court to insist upon an evidentiary hearing,and it did not do so in this case.
in the absence of an evidentiary hearing,although the plaintiffs retain the burden of proving personal jurisdiction,they can satisfy that burden with a prima facie showing.edmond united states postal serv.counsel,citation omitted.moreover,to establish a prima facie case,plaintiffs are not limited to evidence that meets the standards of admissibility required by the district court.rather,they may rest their argument on their pleadings,bolstered by such affidavits and other written materials as they can otherwise obtain 
adherence to these principles does not unduly disadvantage those absent defendants who truly are beyond the power of the court.entry of a default judgment is not the court final say on a matter.rule c provides that f or good cause shown the court may set aside a judgment by default in accordance with rule b.fed.civ.c.under the rule,a defendant can successfully challenge a default judgment in the rendering court on the ground of lack of personal jurisdiction.see,combs nick garin trucking.and a defendant is always free to ignore the judicial proceedings,risk a default judgment,and then challenge that judgment on jurisdictional grounds in a collateral proceeding.insurance of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d see james moore,moore federal practice b i ed.
having set forth the appropriate burden and standard of proof,we now consider whether the plaintiffs have satisfactorily shown that the district court may exercise personal jurisdiction over bin laden and al qaeda.in the first section below,we address the sources of authority for such an exercise.in the second section,we consider whether the exercise of that jurisdiction would contravene constitutional due process.
before a federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant,the procedural requirement of service of summons must be satisfied.omni capital int l,rudolf wolff,d.the district court did not dispute that the plaintiffs had accomplished service by an acceptable method.rule of the federal rules sets forth the various methods by which a summons may be served in federal court proceedings,and rule f specifically addresses s ervice upon individuals in a foreign country.it provides,in relevant part 
unless otherwise provided by federal law,service upon an individual from whom a waiver has not been obtained and filed may be effected in a place not within any judicial district of the united states by means not prohibited by international agreement as may be directed by the court.
fed.civ.f emphasis added.
here,the district court authorized the plaintiffs to serve bin laden and al qaeda by publication.the court observed that their address is not known,nor is it easily ascertainable,august order at,and that bin laden had published at least one fatwa in,id.at.it concluded that publication was reasonably calculated to apprise bin laden and al qaeda of the lawsuit and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.id.in mullane central hanover bank trust,the supreme court sanctioned service by publication where it is not reasonably possible or practicable to give more adequate warning,holding that,in the case of persons missing or unknown,employment of an indirect and even a probably futile means of notification is all that the situation permits and creates no constitutional bar to a final decree foreclosing their rights.
the district court correctly recognized,however,that service of process does not alone establish personal jurisdiction.as the supreme court said in omni capital,b efore a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant,there must be more than notice to the defendant.at.there also must be authorization for service of summons on the defendant,and a constitutionally sufficient relationship between the defendant and the forum.see id.at.noting the distinction between an objection to the method of service and an objection to amenability to service.to determine whether these requirements were satisfied here,the district court undertook a traditional inquiry.it asked first whether there was an applicable statute that would authorize service on the defendants,and then whether the application of such a statute would comply with the demands of due process.see,gte,at jungquist sheikh sultan bin khalifa al nahyan.
with respect to the availability of a statute,the district court said that,b ecause there is no federal equivalent,district of columbia law provides the statute applicable in this case.september order at.citing one of our precedents,the court declared that the district statute is as as due process allows,meaning that only minimum contacts with the district are necessary to sustain jurisdiction here.id.at quoting caribbean broadcasting system,cable wireless plc.while it is true that some provisions of the district statute reach as far as due process permits the only provision applicable here does not.that provision is a,which provides that 
a district of columbia court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person as to a claim for relief arising from the person causing tortious injury in the district of columbia by an act or omission outside the district of columbia if he regularly does or solicits business,engages in any other persistent course of conduct,or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed,or services rendered,in the district of columbia.
code a emphasis added.it is unlikely that the defendants would be susceptible to jurisdiction under that provision,as no evidence was proffered that meets the italicized prerequisites.but it is also clear that the due process clause does not demand the level of contacts required by that provision,and hence that the provision does not extend as far as the clause.indeed,as the district of columbia court of appeals has said,in contrast to a,which we have held to be coextensive with the constitution due process limit,the drafters of a apparently intended that this subsection would not occupy all of the constitutionally available space.parsons mains,quoting crane carr,alterations in original.
prior to,the absence of a state statute reaching the defendants activity would have denied the district court personal jurisdiction,since the federal cause of action at issue no provision of its own.as the supreme court explained in its decision in omni capital,at that time the federal rules generally authorized service beyond the territorial limits of the state in which the district court was situated only when service was authorized by a federal statute or the statute of that state.omni capital,at.citing.civ.e.indeed,the problem the plaintiffs faced in omni capital was identical to that faced by the plaintiffs here.like the atca,the statute providing their federal cause of action a provision of the commodity exchange act did not authorize service on the foreign defendants.and like the district of columbia statute,the applicable state did not reach the omni capital defendants because it was limited to a defendant who regularly does or solicits business,or engages in any other persistent course of conduct,or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered in the state.id.at.quoting.stat.ann.d.thus,the federal rules did not authorize service of process on the defendants.see id.
in omni capital,the supreme court rejected a suggestion by the dissenters in the court below that it should remed y this bizarre hiatus in the rules with an ad hoc authorization of service of process on the defendants based on their contacts with the united states as a whole.id.at.quoting point landing,omni capital international,cir en banc wisdom,concurring in part and dissenting in part.nonetheless,the court was not blind to the consequences of the inability to serve process on the foreign defendants,id.at,and it offered the following suggestion 
a narrowly tailored service of process provision,authorizing service on an alien in a case when the alien is not amenable to service under the applicable state statute,might well serve the ends of certain federal statutes.it is not for the federal courts,however,to create such a rule as a matter of common law.that responsibility,in our view,better rests with those who propose the federal rules of civil procedure and with congress.
those who propose the federal rules of civil procedure took notice of the court suggestion,and a revision was enacted in.although no case in this circuit has yet cited that revision,the rules now contain their own provision which,in some circumstances,eliminates the need to employ the forum state statute.rule k now provides 
if the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states,serving a summons is also effective,with respect to claims arising under federal law,to establish personal jurisdiction over the person of any defendant who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction of any state.
fed.civ.k rule k thus permits a federal court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant for a claim arising under federal law,where a summons has been served,if the defendant is not subject to the jurisdiction of any single state court,provided that the exercise of federal jurisdiction is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states.
in the instant case,the claims arise under federal law the atca,and the summons was served by publication pursuant to rule f.whether the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the constitution turns on whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with the nation as a whole to satisfy due process.see fed.civ.k advisory committee notes to amendments.we address that question in part.the remaining question here is whether bin laden and al qaeda are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction of any state.fed.civ.k.
determining whether a defendant is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of any state presents no small problem.one could,of course,ponderously traipse through the states,asking whether each could entertain the suit.isi int l,borden ladner gervais llp,cir.to avoid that daunting task,the seventh circuit has adopted the following framework 
a defendant who wants to preclude use of rule k has only to name some other state in which the suit could proceed.naming a more appropriate state would amount to a consent to personal jurisdiction there personal jurisdiction,unlike federal jurisdiction,is waivable.if,however,the defendant contends that he can not be sued in the forum state and refuses to identify any other where suit is possible,then the federal court is entitled to use rule k.
id.we find this resolution eminently sensible,and,like the fifth circuit,we adopt the seventh circuit view that so long as a defendant does not concede to jurisdiction in another state,a court may use k to confer jurisdiction.adams unione mediterranea di sicurta,cir.
needless to say,defendants bin laden and al qaeda have not conceded to the jurisdiction of any state.accordingly,we now move to the final issue under rule k 
whether the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the constitution for purposes of rule k depends on whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with the united states as a whole to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.see fed.civ.k advisory committee notes to amendments see also adams,at isi int l,at.the clause protects an individual liberty interest in not being subject to the binding judgments of a forum with which he has established no meaningful contacts,ties,or relations,burger king,at.quoting international shoe washington,and requir es that individuals have fair warning that a particular activity may subject them to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign,id.quoting shaffer heitner,d second alteration in original.where a forum seeks to assert specific jurisdiction over an defendant who has not consented to suit there,this fair warning requirement is satisfied if the defendant has purposefully directed his activities at residents of the forum,id.quoting keeton hustler magazine,d,and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of or relate to those activities,id.quoting helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.
in reaching the conclusion that it lacked personal jurisdiction over bin laden and al qaeda,the district court focused on a list of specific,physical contacts that the plaintiffs alleged the defendants had made with the district of columbia and its environs.those contacts included the publication of fatwas in a newspaper distributed in the united states the shipment to virginia of the power supply for a cell phone that bin laden used in afghanistan the scheduling of a bin laden interview in afghanistan through an agent in washington,and the transmission of bin laden views to the district via interviews on cnn and abc.see september opinion at.much of this evidence came from the indictment and closing argument in united states bin ladin,as well as from government speeches,press releases,and other reports.all of plaintiffs submissions to the court have various evidentiary problems,the district court said.september opinion at see id.at concluding that several submissions constituted inadmissible hearsay.and those problems aside,the court thought the evidence did not demonstrate that bin laden and al qaeda purposefully directed their activities at the united states and that this litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of or relate to those activities.id.quoting burger king,at.
as we noted in part,the district court emphasis on satisfying strict evidentiary standards at this stage of the litigation was incorrect.while understandable given the absence of circuit precedent regarding rule k,so,too,was its exclusive focus on contacts with the district of columbia,rather than with the nation as a whole.see supra part.but the fundamental problem with the court analysis was its focus on specific,physical contacts between the defendants and the forum.although the constitutional touchstone remains whether the defendant purposefully established minimum contacts in the forum,burger king,at.quoting international shoe,at,the foreseeability of causing injury in the forum can establish such contacts where the defendant conduct and connection with the forum are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.id.quoting volkswagen woodson,d.jurisdiction in these circumstances may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not physically enter the forum.id.at.rather,s o long as an actor efforts are purposefully directed toward residents of another forum,the supreme court has consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there.id.at.quoting keeton,at.see gte,at noting that jurisdiction may attach if the defendant conduct is aimed at or has an effect in the forum state quoting panavision international,lp toeppen,cir.
in this case,there is no doubt that the defendants engaged in unabashedly malignant actions directed at and felt in this forum.id.the plaintiffs allegations and evidence were that bin laden and al qaeda orchestrated the bombing of the american embassy in nairobi,not only to kill both american and kenyan employees inside the building,but to cause pain and sow terror in the embassy home country,the united states.nor were the plaintiffs allegations and evidence of contacts with the united states limited to the nairobi bombing.the plaintiffs described an ongoing conspiracy to attack the united states,with overt acts occurring within this country borders.putting to one side the acts that took place after the embassy bombing including the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september,the plaintiffs pointed to the world trade center bombing,as well as to the plot to bomb the united nations,federal plaza,and the lincoln and holland tunnels in new york 
the plaintiffs thus amply made a prima facie showing that bin laden and al qaeda purposefully directed their activities at residents of the united states,burger king,at.quoting keeton,at,and that this litigation results from injuries to the plaintiffs that arise out of or relate to those activities,id.quoting helicopteros nacionales,at.bin laden and al qaeda therefore had fair warning that their activities would subject them to the jurisdiction of the united states.id.quoting shaffer,at.
the fact that injured kenyans,not injured americans,are the plaintiffs in this case does not deny the court personal jurisdiction over the defendants.see calder jones,d the plaintiff lack of contacts with the forum will not defeat otherwise proper jurisdiction.keeton,at.the plaintiff residence in the forum state is not a separate requirement,and lack of residence will not defeat jurisdiction established on the basis of the defendant contacts.the defendants decision to purposefully direct their terror at the united states,and the fact that the plaintiffs injuries arose out of one of those terrorist activities,should suffice to cause the defendants to reasonably anticipate being haled into an american court.burger king,at.quoting volkswagen,at.of course,a plaintiff citizenship may affect whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction or the plaintiff has a cause of action.here,however,the plaintiffs have sued under the alien tort claims act,which the supreme court has held to supply both subject matter jurisdiction and a cause of action for a narrow set of claims brought by aliens and involving violation of the law of nations.see sosa,d.the mwani plaintiffs certainly have more than a colorable argument that their claims fall within that narrow set 
it is true that even after it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum,these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice.burger king,at.quoting international shoe,at.but where a defendant who purposefully has directed his activities at forum residents seeks to defeat jurisdiction,he must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.id.at.here,the defendants purposefully directed their activities at forum residents,and the fact that the plaintiffs are kenyans who were injured in the process is not a consideration that would render the assertion of american jurisdiction incompatible with substantial justice.
in sum,we conclude that there is authorization for service of summons on the defendant s and a constitutionally sufficient relationship between the defendant s and the forum.omni capital,at.as a consequence,the district court may exercise personal jurisdiction over them.id.
we now turn to the plaintiffs appeal from the dismissal of their claims against the remaining defendant,afghanistan.the foreign sovereign immunities act provides the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this country.saudi arabia nelson,d internal quotation marks omitted.under the fsia,a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction of american courts unless the case falls within a statutory exception.see id.if no exception applies,the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.id.if an exception does apply,the district court has jurisdiction.id.a see kilburn socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,world wide minerals,republic of kazakhstan.
in the district court,the plaintiffs relied on two statutory implicit waiver,a,and for commercial activity,a the plaintiffs have abandoned the former on appeal and now rely solely on the latter,the third clause of which provides 
a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states in any case in which the action is based upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.
a.the fsia defines commercial activity as either a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act,and states that the commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act,rather than by reference to its purpose.id.d.
it is the defendant burden to prove that a plaintiff allegations do not fall within the bounds of an fsia exception.see kilburn,at.if the defendant challenges only the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff jurisdictional allegations,then the district court should take the plaintiff factual allegations as true and determine whether they bring the case within any of the exceptions to immunity invoked by the plaintiff.id.at quoting phoenix consulting,republic of angola.although afghanistan does not expressly concede the truth of the plaintiffs factual allegations,it argues that even if taken as true,the allegations are insufficient to come within the commercial activity exception.this amounts to a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the allegations,and we must thus decide de novo whether the alleged jurisdictional facts are sufficient to divest the foreign sovereign of its immunity.price socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya.
the gravamen of the plaintiffs claim to the commercial activity exception is in their appellate brief 
afghanistan had served as a place of refuge for international terrorists since the.the taliban actively aided bin ladin by assigning him guards for security,permitting him to build and maintain terrorist camps,and refusing to cooperate with efforts by the international community to extradite him.bin laden provided approximately million per year to the taliban in return for safe haven.
appellants br.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.but the plaintiffs contention that t his conduct constitutes commercial activity as defined by the fsia and the case law interpreting it,id.at,can not stand in the face of the supreme court precedents,or those of this court.
in nelson,the supreme court observed that the fsia largely codifies the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity,and that under that theory a state engages in commercial activity 
where it exercises only those powers that can also be exercised by private citizens,as distinct from those powers peculiar to sovereigns.put differently,a foreign state engages in commercial activity for purposes of the restrictive theory only where it acts in the manner of a private player within the market.
at quoting republic of argentina weltover,d.moreover,the court emphasized that whether a state acts in the manner of a private party is a question of behavior and not motivation.id.quoting weltover,at.as the court elaborated 
b ecause the act provides that the commercial character of an act is to be determined by reference to its nature rather than its purpose,the question is not whether the foreign government is acting with a profit motive or instead with the aim of fulfilling uniquely sovereign objectives.rather,the issue is whether the particular actions that the foreign state performs whatever the motive behind them are the type of actions by which a private party engages in trade and traffic or commerce.
id.at.quoting weltover,at.citations omitted.in accordance with this standard,the nelson court rejected an argument that saudi arabia wrongful arrest,imprisonment,and torture of the plaintiff,assertedly used by the government to resolve a commercial dispute with the plaintiff,could qualify a claim for the commercial activity exception.as it explained 
exercise of the powers of police and penal officers is not the sort of action by which private parties can engage in commerce.such acts as legislation,or the expulsion of an alien,or a denial of justice,can not be performed by an individual acting in his own name.they can be performed only by the state acting as such.
id.at.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
this court has reached a similar conclusion in a different setting.in cicippio islamic republic of iran,we held that for profit did not fall within the commercial activity exception.see.this was so,we said,because the act giving rise to jurisdiction must itself take place in a commercial context.and kidnapping,we concluded,
can not possibly be described as an act typically performed by participants in the market unless one distorts the notion of a marketplace to include a hostage bazaar.that money was allegedly sought from relatives of the hostages could not make an ordinary kidnapping a commercial act any more than murder by itself would be treated as a commercial activity merely because the killer is paid.
nelson and cicippio foreclose the plaintiffs argument that the
