in this case,we consider several aspects of,the statute providing assistance to litigants in proceedings before foreign and international tribunals.the statute authorizes a district court,upon the application of any interested person,to order a party found in the judicial district in which the court sits to produce discovery for use in a foreign proceeding.a.investment funds sought,by ex parte application,to discover certain documents from the defendant american and international accounting firms relating to audits conducted by their middle eastern affiliates.the district court naomi reice buchwald,judge denied the application on several grounds.we conclude that assuming arguendo that the funds were interested person s in ongoing foreign proceedings,the funds did not establish that the evidence they sought was for use in those proceedings and the district court did not err in finding that additional proceedings that the funds asserted they intended to initiate were not within reasonable contemplation at the time the application was made.we accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
are certain funds,accounts,investment vehicles managed by affiliates of fortress investment group,llc the funds.the funds held interests collectively amounting to roughly million in two saudi conglomerates,the saad group saad and ahmad hamad algosaibi and brothers company ahab.the largest of these interests was an interest in the golden belt sukuk,a financial instrument issued by saad the funds interest in the sukuk was valued at million,which amounted to about of the sukuk aggregate value,making the funds the single largest holder of its certificates.the funds held various other investments issued by saad and ahab,including participation in a cayman islands holding corporation for saad assets outside of saudi arabia,valued at million.
in,ahab began reporting financial problems that were traced to fraud and embezzlement of the conglomerate assets by maan al sanea,the owner of saad.in response to the alleged fraud,the saudi arabian monetary authority froze all of al sanea assets.this prompted moody to withdraw all ratings for saad.other international regulatory authorities reacted,including,as relevant here,the central bank of bahrain,which seized control of several subsidiaries of saad and ahab,and the grand court of the cayman islands,which issued a worldwide freezing order against al sanea and dozens of companies owned by saad,including the one in which the funds held their million interest.as a result of these events,all of the financial instruments of saad and ahab,once worth several billion dollars,are now in default.
various legal actions were instituted in several countries in the wake of the conglomerates default.first,the delegate of the sukuk brought a claim in saudi arabia against saad and al sanea to enforce the promissory notes that made up the sukuk.that claim was originally brought before the saudi negotiable instruments committee,a body that has binding authority to resolve disputes related to negotiable instruments.the claim has now been withdrawn,however,and after the district court decision in this case refiled before the saudi banking disputes committee,another committee with jurisdiction over bank debt.second,proceedings to liquidate the cayman island holding corporation were initiated in the cayman islands.third,a proceeding to liquidate the assets of an ahab affiliate in which the funds held an interest was commenced in bahrain.
nearly five years after the saudi conglomerates default,the funds filed an ex parte application in the united states district court for the southern district of new york pursuant to seeking documents and other evidence relevant to these foreign proceedings from the accounting firms kpmg,kpmg international cooperative,pricewaterhousecoopers,and pricewaterhousecoopers international limited collectively,the firms.kpmg and pricewaterhousecoopers are united accounting firms the firms,while kpmg international cooperative and pricewaterhousecoopers international limited are firms incorporated,respectively,in switzerland and england the international firms.according to the funds,affiliates of the firms in saudi arabia,egypt,and dubai audited various companies owned by ahab and saad that were involved in the offerings and investments that the funds held therefore,they contend,the firms are likely to have information about the finances of the two conglomerates that will be highly useful and relevant to the pending proceedings in the various foreign jurisdictions.
in addition to the ongoing proceedings described above,the funds alleged that they intended to use the information sought through their application in several legal actions that the funds planned to initiate directly.as part of their application before the district court,the funds asserted that they intend ed to instigate claims against the saad group and ahab before the two saudi committees,intend ed to bring claims,sounding in tort and breach of contract,against those responsible for the faulty financial reports that misled investors into purchasing interests in in english court,and intended to seek other relief from the kingdom of saudi arabia or its agencies.app x.
the district court denied the funds application.the court held that the funds sought documents primarily from the international firms,which are both different entities from the new firms,and that the international firms were not found in the judicial district in which the application was filed 
with respect to the ongoing foreign proceedings,the district court also held that the information the funds sought was not for use in a foreign proceeding,because the funds were not a party to any of the pending proceedings,and there was no discernible procedural mechanism whereby the discovered material would actually be used in the foreign proceedings.special app x.the district court held,moreover,that the funds had failed to demonstrate that they were interested person s in the context of the pending foreign proceedings,because they had no role in those proceedings and did not establish that they had a right to submit evidence to the foreign tribunals in question.id.although acknowledging that a can be an interested person under the statute,the district court held that simply being a creditor of a debtor that is the subject of a liquidation proceeding is not enough to confer such status.
with respect to the contemplated proceedings,although the funds had retained counsel to investigate and prosecute their claims in the planned proceedings,the district court held that a dispositive ruling by a foreign tribunal was not within reasonable contemplation.id.
having concluded that the funds failed to meet the statutory requirements that establish the court authority to order discovery under,the district court did not reach the discretionary factors that determine whether to grant the application.the funds appealed.
discussion 
statutory requirements 
provides,in pertinent part the district court of the district in which a person resides or is found may order him to produce a document for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal upon the application of any interested person we have summarized the statute as setting forth three requirements that the person from whom discovery is sought resides or is found in the district of the district court to which the application is made,the discovery be for use in a proceeding before a foreign tribunal,and the application be made by a foreign or international tribunal or any interested person.brandi dohrn ikb deutsche industriebank ag,cir.once the statutory requirements are met,a district court may order discovery under in its discretion,taking into consideration the twin aims of the statute,namely,providing efficient means of assistance to participants in international litigation in our federal courts and encouraging foreign countries by example to provide similar means of assistance to our courts.in re metallgesellschaft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because the district court here denied the funds application solely on statutory grounds,and did not reach the discretionary factors,our review is de novo.see in re application for an order pursuant to to conduct discovery for use in foreign proceedings,cir in re edelman,cir.
ii.analysis 
the international firms contend,and the district court held,that no discovery can be ordered as to them,because they are not found in the southern district of new york,where the application was made.we need not address that argument,however,because we conclude that the funds have failed to establish that the discovery they seek is for use in a foreign proceeding.since that failure defeats the funds application as to all the defendants,including the firms,who concededly are found in the district,we proceed directly to that issue 
to satisfy the second and third statutory requirements,an applicant for a order must be an interested person,and must establish that the discovery sought is for use in a proceeding before a foreign tribunal.brandi dohrn,at.the supreme court analyzed these statutory requirements in intel advanced micro devices,d.in that case,the applicant had filed an antitrust complaint against intel with the directorate general for competition of the european commission.id.at.that complaint triggered a preliminary investigation by the directorate general into the alleged behavior.in that investigation the applicant,as initiator of the complaint,had the right to present evidence.id.at.the investigation would ultimately lead to a formal written decision on whether to pursue the complaint.if the directorate general declined to proceed,or if the european commission failed to sustain its complaint,the applicant could seek review of that decision in the european courts.id.in light of that procedure,the supreme court ruled,the applicant ha d a significant role in the process,including various participation rights in the proceeding.id.at.moreover,the court concluded,the applicant could use evidence in the reviewing courts by submitting it to the commission in the current,investigative stage,and then relying on that evidence before the commission itself and the reviewing courts.id.at.the supreme court thus concluded that the applicant qualifie d as an interested person within any fair construction of that term,id.at,and that the discovery sought was for use in a foreign or international tribunal,id.at.
we make two preliminary observations about the supreme court decision in intel.first,the court did not lay down minimum requirements or tests to be met in determining whether the party seeking discovery is an interested person or whether the discovery is sought for use in a foreign proceeding.the court appeared to regard the case before it as an easy one,in effect finding that the facts before it were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute,and not suggesting that facts identical to those in intel were necessary to meet those requirements.second,the court analysis suggests that,while the interested person and for use requirements are independent,there is considerable overlap between them.the applicant participation rights in intel,on which the court relied in finding that the applicant was an interested person,prominently included the applicant ability to use the evidence it sought in the courts before the foreign administrative tribunal and courts by submitting the evidence to the investigating agency in the foreign proceedings.
ongoing foreign proceedings 
the defendant firms argue that the funds are not interested person s with respect to the ongoing proceedings in saudi arabia,bahrain and the cayman islands,because they lack the kind of participation rights possessed by the applicant in intel.it is unquestionably true that the funds do not have participation rights similar to the applicant in that case.the funds have made no showing that they are able to present evidence to any of the tribunals conducting those proceedings,or to appeal or otherwise seek further review,in courts or other institutions,of any decision reached in those proceedings,as the applicant could do with respect to the commission proceedings in intel.if such rights are necessary for an entity to constitute an interested person within the meaning of,the funds do not qualify.
we are cautious about reaching that conclusion in the absence of a need to reach the question,however.as noted above,the intel court did not state that such rights were necessary for an applicant to constitute an interested person,appearing to find that participation rights such as those possessed by the applicant there qualified it as an interested person within any fair construction of that term.id.at.moreover,in rejecting intel argument that interested person s under the statute must be litigants or formal parties to a proceeding,the court cited with approval the expansive definition provided by hans smit,a leading academic commentator on the statute who played a role in its drafting.id.at.professor smit maintained that the phrase any interested person is intended to include not only litigants before foreign and international tribunals,but also foreign and international officials as well as any other person who merely possess es a reasonable interest in obtaining the assistance.hans smit,international litigation under the united states code,colum.
the funds argue on appeal that they are interested person s in that broader sense,in that they have a reasonable interest in obtaining judicial assistance in the ongoing foreign proceedings.they base that argument on their substantial financial interest in the entities that are the subject of the ongoing proceedings,their ability to influence those proceedings through the delegate or trustees pursuing claims in the respective proceedings,and because of their status as creditors of the saad and ahab affiliates being liquidated in the cayman islands and bahrain.
preliminarily,we doubt that the funds financial interest in the outcome of the foreign proceedings alone could be sufficient to confer interested person status under the statute.various entities may have a financial stake in litigation to which they have no direct connection shareholders in a company facing a products liability suit are likely to have a financial interest in the outcome of that suit multiple competitors may have a financial interest in an antitrust case brought by the government a wide range of media companies may have a financial interest in a libel case involving one newspaper.most legal cases involve such externalities and have implications,including financial ones,for persons beyond the parties formally participating in the case.congress can not have intended to confer interested person status on all possible amici curiae when it passed 
whether the funds are interested person s based on their alleged ability to put evidence before other persons who are parties to the foreign proceedings,or by dint of their status as creditors in the liquidation actions,are closer questions.on the one hand,the ability simply to pass on information to parties in a proceeding,without more,can not confer interested person status any more than the ability of amicus counsel to pass along evidence and arguments to counsel representing one of the parties in litigation.on the other hand,an established right to provide evidence and have the party consider it,as the applicant had in intel,at,or a recognized relationship,such as that of an agent and principal,see lancaster factoring mangone,cir agent of trustee in bankruptcy proceeding is interested person for purposes of,may be sufficient to make an otherwise stranger to the proceeding an interested person.similarly,the role of a creditor under the relevant jurisdiction law might confer certain procedural rights that allow the creditor to participate and submit evidence in the proceeding.see,b under bankruptcy law,a party in interest,including a creditor may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in a case under this chapter.
we need not decide whether any of these circumstances might,in an appropriate case,render a party an interested person within the meaning of the statute,however,because even if the funds qualify
