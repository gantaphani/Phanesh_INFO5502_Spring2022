background 
defendant was indicted on one count of possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute in violation of a.defendant failed to appear for his arraignment on that charge after being released on bond.based upon this failure to appear,the government secured a superseding indictment that added a second count charging defendant with violating a.defendant was ultimately arraigned upon being extradited from the dominican republic,the country to which he fled.defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence flowing from police officers traffic stop of the rental vehicle that defendant was driving.after conducting an evidentiary hearing,the magistrate judge,to whom the district court had referred defendant suppression motion,issued a report and recommendation advising the district court to deny that motion.adopting the magistrate judge proposed findings and recommendation,the district court denied defendant suppression motion.defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty to count one of possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute in violation of a,expressly reserving his right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.the district court,pursuant to the government motion,dismissed count two charging defendant with failing to appear at his arraignment.however,in sentencing defendant on count one,the district court relied on this failure to appear in enhancing defendant sentence by two levels under for obstruction of justice and in refusing to reduce defendant sentence under for acceptance of responsibility.after applying all of the relevant factors,the district court ultimately arrived at a guidelines range in which it sentenced defendant to months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release.
ii.defendant suppression motion 
relevant facts 
in denying the suppression motion,the district court found the following facts.on the morning of september,patrolman terry lomax lomax of the shelby county sheriff department was parked in a marked squad car in the grassy median strip of interstate in shelby county,tennessee.when a chrysler lhs vehicle that defendant was his position,lomax pointed his radar unit at the sedan.yet,the radar picked up only a large that was traveling in the lane adjacent to the sedan it indicated that the was proceeding at the posted speed limit of mph.after the sedan passed the,lomax pulled his vehicle out of the median and pulled alongside the sedan.as he testified,lomax did not know whether the had maintained the posted speed or had slowed down.lomax speedometer and radar clocked the sedan at mph.activating his squad car lights,lomax pulled the sedan over for speeding.
upon approaching the driver side door of the sedan,lomax asked defendant,who was traveling alone,for his driver license.defendant handed lomax a puerto rico driver license in the name of elvis garrido.examining the license,lomax found it to be valid and current.lomax informed defendant that he had stopped him for speeding.lomax then inquired about defendant place of departure and destination.defendant replied that he had come from houston,texas,and was heading to new york to visit his mother.asked if he lived in puerto rico,defendant answered in the affirmative.lomax testified that he was suspicious of the fact that defendant,a resident of puerto rico,was driving a car with texas plates.after lomax asked about the vehicle ownership,defendant informed lomax that it was a rental car.defendant produced the rental agreement for which lomax asked.the rental agreement evidenced the following another individual named junior santana,a resident of new york,had rented the vehicle at the hobby airport,in houston,texas,on september,the vehicle was to be returned to that airport by the following a notation of add driver and an illegible signature near junior santana signature.lomax noticed that the rental agreement did not list defendant,in typewriting,as an additional driver.upon being asked,defendant informed lomax that junior santana was his cousin.defendant told lomax that defendant had flown from puerto rico to miami,florida,and then to houston,texas,where he and his cousin had rented the vehicle for defendant to drive to new york.lomax was aware that the vehicle that defendant was driving was known to have easily accessible places in which to hide narcotics.
believing that the rental agreement did not list defendant as an additional driver,lomax ran a license plate check to ensure that the vehicle was not stolen.at some point,lomax began filling out a warning courtesy ticket that carries no defendant speeding.lomax advised defendant that he was giving defendant a warning citation but that he was still awaiting the return of a computer check.lomax observed that,even after he had informed defendant that he would only receive a warning ticket,defendant continued to exhibit signs of nervousness,such as avoiding eye contact,laughing nervously,and fidgeting based upon his experience,lomax found this nervousness unusual.returning the rental agreement and license to defendant,lomax explained the courtesy citation,which he was still filling out,to defendant.lomax asked if defendant had any illegal contraband,such as drugs or stolen goods,in his vehicle.defendant replied in the negative.lomax asked if defendant would consent to a search of the vehicle.defendant answered in the affirmative.lomax gave defendant the courtesy citation to sign.after defendant signed the citation,lomax gave defendant a copy of the citation as well as a form.lomax advised defendant to read the consent form and to ask any questions that he might have before signing it.defendant signed the consent form.approximately ten minutes had elapsed between the initial traffic stop and defendant execution of the consent form.
around the time that defendant signed the consent form,patrolman dale lane lane also of the shelby county sheriff.although they used a drug detection dog to survey the vehicle,the dog did not alert to the presence of narcotics.both lomax and lane quickly looked around the sedan.at some point,lane and lomax saw unopened packages of a pair of pliers and an adjustable wrench in a bag on the floor of the front passenger seat.while standing beside the rear of the vehicle,lane informed lomax that he smelled a strong odor of gasoline.lomax smelled nothing as he suffered from sinus congestion at the time.they asked defendant,who was standing near the rear of the vehicle,to sit in the back of lane squad car.as lomax was placing defendant in the squad car,defendant volunteered that he had been stopped twice before on his trip and had been searched.when lomax questioned defendant about these stops,defendant stated that he had no documentation for them.upon being asked,defendant affirmed that he had been in possession of the vehicle at all times during his trip.because defendant would have been unable to exit the squad car,lomax instructed him on how to use its public address system in case he needed to communicate with the officers.
recalling that it affords easy access to the gas tank,in which drugs have been smuggled,they opened the trunk of the vehicle upon pulling the carpet back,lomax saw a sliver plate,which four bolts fastened and which provided access to the gas tank sending unit,a device that signals the dashboard about the amount of gasoline in the gas tank.lane and lomax noticed that the bolts fastening the silver plate had scratches around them as if they had been removed and then replaced.because the vehicle was new and had very low mileage,lomax found this apparent removal of the plate unusual.lomax believed that the tools in the passenger compartment were to be used in removing the silver plate so as to access the gas tank.lomax and lane removed the trunk silver plate to access the gas tank.by inserting a fiber optic scope into the top of the gas tank,lomax observed white bundles in the gas tank.believing that these bundles contained illegal narcotics,lomax and lane arrested defendant.at no time during the search did defendant object to its duration or scope.sometime after the completion of the search,lomax received the computer check and learned that the vehicle was not stolen.seven bundles of cocaine were subsequently seized from the vehicle gas tank.

validity of the traffic stop 
a traffic stop is reasonable under the fourth amendment where the stop was both proper at its inception and reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop in the first place.united states freeman,cir quoting terry ohio,d internal quotation marks omitted.a police officer may lawfully stop a motorist whom he has probable cause to believe has committed a traffic violation.id.however,a police officer can not continue to detain a motorist after the officer has completed the initial purpose of the traffic stop unless something that occurred during the stop caused the officer to have a reasonable and articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot.united states hill,cir.
defendant appeals the district court denial of his suppression motion on the ground that lomax initial stop of defendant vehicle violated the fourth amendment.in particular,defendant argues that lomax actually stopped defendant vehicle based upon his suspicion that defendant was involved in illegal drug trafficking,not based upon an alleged speeding violation.however,in whren united states,d,the supreme court held that,as long as a police officer has probable cause to believe that a motorist committed a traffic violation,the resulting traffic stop is generally reasonable under the fourth amendment regardless of the officer subjective intent or state of mind in conducting the traffic stop accord united states bailey,cir noting that i t is well established that an officer actual motivation for making a traffic stop is irrelevant to the constitutionality of that stop wellman,at finding that,where probable cause for the traffic stop exists,whether the police officer was motivated in conducting the traffic stop based upon his suspicion that the defendant fits into a drug courier profile or his membership in a drug interdiction unit is irrelevant to the stop constitutionality under the fourth amendment.
alternatively,defendant contends that lomax lacked probable cause to justify the traffic stop of defendant vehicle because defendant had not,in fact,been speeding prior to that stop.at the suppression hearing,lomax testified that,while pacing defendant vehicle with his squad car,he used both his calibrated speedometer and his radar to determine that defendant vehicle was traveling at mph in a mph zone.defendant asserts that this testimony is unworthy of belief.yet,the only evidence that defendant offers to refute this testimony is his own testimony at the suppression hearing.in particular,defendant testified that he did not think that he was speeding because he knew that the posted speed limit was mph,he had cruise control,he had never broken the law,and he had never been stopped for speeding.however,the district court reasonably found that defendant was not a credible witness.for example,defendant later testified that police had stopped him and had given him a courtesy citation the night before lomax had stopped him.defendant also demonstrated his propensity to lie under oath when,in,he failed to appear at his arraignment despite having promised the district court,as a condition of his bond,that he would appear at all required proceedings.in an attempt to negate lomax testimony,defendant contends that it would have been unreasonable for defendant to have sped past lomax squad car since it was clearly visible to passing motorists and was positioned so as to pursue any violators easily.similarly,defendant argues that it would have been even more unreasonable for him to have continued to speed after lomax began pacing defendant vehicle.however,as the district court aptly observed,c ommon experience teaches that speeding motorists are usually apprehended when police are positioned to observe them and often when the motorist can observe the officer as well.the district court correctly recognized that,in any event,no evidence in the record demonstrates that defendant is a reasonable motorist.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,the district court did not clearly err in choosing to credit lomax testimony that defendant was speeding over defendant and inconsistent testimony to the contrary.see peveler united states,cir we are generally reluctant to set aside credibility determinations made by the trier of fact,who has had the opportunity to view the witness es on the stand and to assess their demeanor.because defendant was speeding in violation of tennessee law,lomax had probable cause to stop defendant vehicle.
defendant also appeals the district court denial of his suppression motion on the ground that the traffic stop was not reasonably related in scope and duration to the initial purpose of the speeding violation.defendant contends that this initial purpose ended when defendant signed the courtesy ticket and lomax returned the rental agreement and driver license to defendant according to defendant,lomax then prolonged the detention when he,in effect,informed defendant that he could not leave because lomax was awaiting the return of a computer check.the thrust of defendant argument is that it was not reasonably related to the speeding violation for lomax to have conducted a computer check to ensure that defendant was lawfully operating the vehicle because such a check was unnecessary and,thus,unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances.defendant contends that a reasonable police officer would infer from defendant illegible signature near the renter signature and the notation of add driver on the rental agreement that defendant was lawfully operating the vehicle.at the suppression hearing,lomax testified that,after looking at the rental agreement closely,he ran the computer check on the vehicle license plate because he did not see defendant name listed or the agreement.lomax elaborated that about percent of the rental agreements that he had seen listed the name of the additional driver in the same type of print in which the renter name was listed.lomax testified that he first recognized the signature on the rental agreement as defendant after he had returned to the police station and was comparing that document with defendant driver license and the courtesy ticket that defendant had signed.as to whether it was reasonable to believe that the vehicle was stolen,lomax underscored that,along with defendant name not being printed on the rental agreement,lomax knew of instances in which authorized individuals had not done something that the rental agreement required them to do.as lomax testified,t here are always reasons to do checks.
defendant contends that lomax testimony is incongruous with the facts.to the extent that defendant asks us to set aside the district court determination that lomax was a credible witness,we find no reason to accept such an invitation.see peveler,at.moreover,defendant focus upon lomax subjective intent in or justification for running the computer check on the license plate is misplaced.t he touchstone of the fourth amendment is reasonableness measured in objective terms by examining the totality of the circumstances.ohio robinette,d internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.here,while the rental agreement displayed defendant signature and a charge for an additional driver,defendant signature was illegible and located in an odd location on that agreement.a reasonable officer likely would not have recognized that illegible signature as belonging to defendant unless and until he placed defendant driver license directly beside the rental agreement and compared their respective signatures a reasonable officer examining defendant driver license probably would have focused upon the picture and the expiration date,as lomax did.we note that,even if the rental agreement reasonably appeared to authorize defendant as an additional driver,a reasonable police officer would still have good reason to run a license plate check.for example,defendant may have forged that authorization,or the rental company may have rescinded such authorization,even if initially valid,due to a violation of the rental agreement.as the supreme court has recognized,states have a critical interest in ensuring that motorists observe licensing and registration requirements as well as a legitimate interest in controlling automobile thefts.delaware prouse,d.we note that defendant detention until the completion of the computer after the search of the not intrusive.the pendency of the computer check was largely with the vehicle search,to which defendant consented before lomax had finished issuing the warning citation and to whose duration defendant never objected.during the unknown amount of time between the completion of the search and that of the computer check,defendant was under lawful custodial arrest based upon the fruits of the search.in sum,under the totality of the circumstances,it was objectively reasonable and within the bounds of the traffic stop for lomax to have requested a computer check to ensure that defendant was lawfully operating the vehicle.see id.at.e xcept in those situations in which there is at least articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered,or that either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law,stopping an automobile and detaining the driver in order to check his driver license and the registration of the automobile are unreasonable under the fourth amendment.emphasis added wellman,at holding that the police officer lawfully asked defendant to sit in the squad car while he wrote a courtesy citation and performed record checks of his driver license and registration as it was within the scope of the traffic stop for speeding united states bradshaw,cir holding that the police officer could lawfully detain defendant in the back of the squad car until he had finished performing radio checks and issuing the citation because it was well within the bounds of the initial stop.hill,at holding that a driver license check was within the original scope of a traffic stop based upon a traffic violation.thus,we reject defendant contention that lomax needed a reasonable suspicion that defendant was unlawfully operating the vehicle to justify this detention 
alternatively,defendant claims that officer lomax exceeded the bounds of the initial traffic stop for speeding when he asked whether defendant possessed any illegal contraband.the circuit courts generally agree that the fourth amendment requires that,absent additional justification,any questioning during a valid traffic stop must not prolong the detention necessary to complete the initial purpose of that stop however,there is some disagreement as to whether the fourth amendment also requires that,absent additional justification,such questioning must be reasonably related in subject matter to the purpose of the initial traffic stop this circuit has yet to decide this issue expressly because additional justification supported the questioning here,we need not decide such an important legal issue.rather,we leave that determination for a case whose record affords a more appropriate basis upon which to make it.first,in asking defendant whether he possessed any illegal contraband,lomax did not exceed the time necessary to complete the original purpose of the traffic stop.at that time,lomax had not yet completed the initial purpose of the traffic stop because he was still filling out the courtesy citation and,as discussed above,was still waiting for the return of the computer check on the vehicle license plate.second,assuming that this questioning was not reasonably related to the speeding violation and,thus,that it required additional justification,lomax had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in criminal activity so as to validate his inquiry into whether defendant possessed any illegal contraband.at the time of this questioning,lomax had the following information available to him defendant route was circuitous and impractical in that defendant had flown from puerto rico to miami and then to houston only to rent a vehicle to drive to new york junior santana,a resident of new york,had rented the vehicle in houston so that defendant could drive it to new york the rental agreement had an illegible,additional signature in an irregular location rather than defendant typed name listing him as an additional driver at the time of the traffic stop,defendant was heading towards new york the day before the rental agreement required the vehicle to be returned in houston defendant was unusually nervous and lomax knew,based upon his training,that the model vehicle that defendant was driving had easily accessible hiding places for narcotics.lomax questioning defendant about whether he possessed any illegal contraband was not unreasonable under the fourth amendment.
the scope of defendant consent to search 
defendant appeals the district court denial of his suppression motion on the ground that the search of defendant gas tank exceeded the reasonable scope of defendant consent when law enforcement officers rely upon consent as the basis for a warrantless search,the scope of the consent given determines the permissible scope of the search.united states gant,cir.the standard for measuring the scope of a suspect consent under the fourth amendment is that of objective reasonableness florida jimeno,d.the proper question is what would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect.id.a reasonable person likely would have understood his consent to exclude a search that would damage his property.see id.at.generally,the expressed object of the search defines the scope of that search.id.at.
before lomax obtained defendant consent to search the vehicle,he had asked defendant whether he possessed any illegal contraband,such as drugs or stolen goods.in so asking,lomax thereby had informed defendant that those items would be the object of any search.defendant,per the form that he executed,consented to a search of the vehicle without expressly limiting the scope of that search.it was objectively reasonable for lomax and lane to have concluded that this general consent to search the vehicle included consent to search any container within that vehicle that might have held illegal contraband.as lomax testified,it was that the model vehicle that defendant was driving had an easily accessible gas tank in which to hide narcotics.moreover,the accessing and search of the gas tank caused no damage to either the vehicle,in general,or the gas tank,in particular.therefore,it was objectively reasonable for lomax and lane to have believed that defendant general consent to search the vehicle encompassed consent to search the vehicle gas tank.the fourth amendment did not require either officer to obtain s
