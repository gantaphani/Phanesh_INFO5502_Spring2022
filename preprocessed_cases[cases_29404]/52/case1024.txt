intel and dell 
in january,csiro initiated licensing negotiations with dell.dell manufactures and sells products that incorporate wireless networking components purchased from various suppliers,including intel.although dell repeatedly suggested that csiro contact its suppliers instead,csiro never contacted intel directly.in june,counsel for csiro sent dell proposed licensing terms,emphasizing that its offer was available for only a limited time.under its proposed arrangement,a licensee was rewarded with a discount in the base royalty rate if a license was taken within days after that,the discount was gradually reduced to days,days,days and days.csiro later explained that after days,the offer would close and it would then consider litigation to block firms that do not take voluntary licenses.around this time,dell requested that intel indemnify it against csiro claims of patent infringement and intel agreed to do so.intel has also agreed to indemnify hp.
on september,csiro formally offered dell a license,noting that this offer is only open for acceptance for a period of days,after which time the licenses under this voluntary licensing program will not be available.it included another copy of the proposed licensing terms and a draft license agreement.on december,csiro agreed to a extension of all the dates in its offer letter.the voluntary license offer thus expired on may.

on august,csiro moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.on september,this motion was denied as well.the district court first evaluated whether there was an actual case or controversy as required by the declaratory judgment act dja.despite csiro insistence that licensing negotiations were still ongoing,it found that the license offer had expired and that it was objectively reasonable for dell to be apprehensive that litigation would be the next step,especially since csiro had already filed one patent infringement lawsuit.because the parties agreed that dell produced an allegedly infringing device,the court concluded that there was sufficient case or controversy for purposes of establishing jurisdiction under the dja.as to intel,it also had a reasonable apprehension of being subjected to a lawsuit for patent infringement due to its indemnification agreement with dell.intel,slip op.at.
the district court then went on to consider whether csiro was immune from suit under the fsia or whether the commercial activity exception set forth in a applied.with respect to dell,it observed that t he parties appear to agree that csiro interaction with dell constituted commercial activity under the fsia.id.at.as to intel,it noted that t he parties have not cited,and the court has not found,a case directly on point.id.the court denied the motion to dismiss,reasoning that csiro indirectly engaged in commercial activity with intel because its licensing negotiations with dell necessarily implicated intel.id.
csiro filed a timely notice of appeal.intel responded by filing a motion for an order certifying the appeal as waived or otherwise frivolous,which was denied.the district court again emphasized that it was unaware of any cases expressly holding that initiation and involvement in licensing negotiations over a patent constitutes commercial activity sufficient to vitiate sovereign immunity under the fsia,although it was difficult to conceive of how csiro conduct could be characterized as anything other than commercial.intel commonwealth sci.and indus.research,no,slip op.at.yet,while the court was not persuaded by csiro argument,it declined to find the appeal frivolous.
microsoft,hp and netgear 
on april,csiro initiated licensing negotiations with hp.during a meeting on january,csiro explained its licensing program,wherein it would first make a formal licensing offer with royalty discounts that decreased over time,then pursue litigation against parties that failed to take a voluntary license.on may,counsel for csiro allegedly threatened hp counsel with a lawsuit if hp did not take a license.on june,csiro extended its formal offer,enclosing its proposed terms and a draft agreement.on october,csiro offered hp a temporary covenant not to sue while it asserted the patent against others for million,but hp did not accept.on december,as the offer period was nearing an end,csiro wrote hp,reiterating that it may decide to take further action against companies which have not availed themselves of the opportunity to have a voluntary license.although it was not threatening to bring any action against hp at this time,csiro stressed that once the offer expired,a voluntary license may not necessarily be available thereafter at any price.a few days later,the offer expired.
on april,csiro initiated licensing negotiations with netgear.csiro extended its formal licensing offer on august,enclosing its proposed licensing terms and a draft agreement.in the months that followed,netgear made a few counterproposals,but the parties did not reach an agreement.the voluntary license period ended in february.

on august,csiro filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,but it was denied on september,for essentially the same reasons described above.with respect to the question of foreign sovereign immunity,the district court found that csiro attempts to secure patent licenses in order to generate royalty income was not an activity peculiar to a sovereign state,but wa s,instead,a commercial activity that a private entity would engage in.microsoft,at.csiro filed a timely notice of appeal.plaintiffs responded by filing a motion for an order certifying the appeal as waived or otherwise frivolous,which was denied on november.
