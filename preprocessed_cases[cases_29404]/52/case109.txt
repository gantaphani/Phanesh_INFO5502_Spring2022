in kiobel royal dutch petroleum,the supreme court held that,with very limited exceptions,the alien tort statute,ats,does not apply extraterritorially to conduct that occurs outside the united states.at.the actions that form the basis of this case occurred far from the united states and many decades ago.it is beyond question and defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs allege shocking violations of internationally accepted norms.but it is also beyond question that,based on the supreme court interpretation of the ats,most of plaintiffs claims are not cognizable in an american court.plaintiffs remaining federal claims that even arguably survive kiobel are,in any event,barred by the statute of limitations.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs complaint.
plaintiffs claims stem from an alleged child migration program undertaken in the aftermath of world war ii.as part of the scheme,the purpose of which was to populate australia with pure white stock from britain and working boys from malta compl,defendants allegedly took plaintiffs away from their families as children,falsely told them that their parents had died or abandoned them,and transported them to australia,where plaintiffs and other children were made to work essentially as slaves,for long hours without pay,and were subjected to extreme physical and,in some cases,sexual abuse.
emmanuel ellul was born in malta in.at age fourteen,he and his brothers were sent to australia as part of the child migration program.ellul parents were told that he would be educated in australia,and that after his education was complete,he could return to malta or the family could be reunited in australia.once in australia,however,ellul and his brothers were taken to an agricultural school run by the congregation of christian brothers ccb,a roman catholic religious order,where they were made to work on a large commercial farm and were not given any schooling.the children at the farm performed physical labor from early morning until nightfall,were frequently beaten and threatened with physical violence,and were told that their parents were dead.at age seventeen,ellul was sent to another farm where he worked for a year.ellul was never paid for any of his labor and he lost contact with his brothers for nearly two decades.
valerie carmack was born in britain in.when she was ten years old,her mother was told that carmack had been adopted by another family in britain,but in fact she had been sent to australia.once there,she was made to work at nazareth house,a home for the elderly.for roughly six years,she worked long hours,seven days a week,for no pay.at age sixteen,carmack was sent to work at a where she was told that her wages were being kept for her savings,but upon reaching the age of majority,she was not given those savings.id.after leaving australia,carmack returned to nazareth house as an adult to obtain her birth certificate.she was then informed that she might have a mother but it would be pointless to contact her.id.carmack,who is now a citizen,made several attempts to locate information about what had happened to her,including a trip to australia in during which she sought records about herself from government officials.
hazel goulding was sent from britain to australia in when she was eight years old.like the other plaintiffs,she was made to work long hours for no pay and received virtually no education.she lived at an institution run by nuns who allegedly were part of the order of the sisters of mercy osm.the nuns routinely beat and starved their wards,including goulding.when goulding was fifteen,she escaped the institution,but was caught and returned to the custody of osm,after which she was kept in solitary confinement.in,goulding family managed to track her down and she and her sister returned to britain.she returned to australia in.since then,she has sought public records about herself.she also testified about her personal experiences as part of an inquiry into the child migration program by the australian senate,which resulted in the release of a comprehensive report on the program the senate report.see commonwealth of australia,lost innocents righting the record report on child migration,available at http community.
plaintiffs brought this suit in the southern district of new york on december.they brought claims against ccb,osm,and various unnamed catholic religious under the ats,alleging violations of customary international law including slavery and involuntary servitude,child trafficking,forced child labor,and cruel,inhuman,and degrading treatment or punishment,as well as common law claims of conversion,unjust enrichment,constructive trust,accounting,and breach of fiduciary or special duty defendants moved to dismiss or for summary judgment.
on march,the district court granted defendants motions and dismissed the complaint.ellul congregation of christian,civ.pac,wl.the court held that it did not have personal jurisdiction over ccb because ccb had never been properly served.id.at as to osm,the district court found,based on the allegations in the complaint and an affidavit submitted with osm motion,that osm was not a legal entity capable of being sued rather,osm was a loose term for nine independent,autonomous regional organizations of nuns that all use the name sisters of mercy.id.at therefore,the district court dismissed all claims against ccb and osm.
in the alternative,the district court determined that the statute of limitations barred plaintiffs claims.following decisions from the ninth circuit and another district court in the southern district of new york,the court borrowed the statute of limitations from the torture victim protection act tvpa,and applied it to the ats claims.id.at,citing papa united states,cir,and doe karadzic,civ.pkl,wl,at june.the court held that because the alleged conduct commenced more than sixty years ago,the statute of limitations had expired.id.the court concluded that the various statutes of limitations for the pendent state common law claims had also run.id.finally,the court determined that neither the rule nor the doctrines of equitable tolling and equitable estoppel saved plaintiffs untimely claims.id.at.
plaintiffs appealed.on appeal,defendants argued for the first time that our decision in kiobel royal dutch petroleum,cir,which held that ats claims for violations of customary international law could not be brought against corporations,barred plaintiffs ats claims.after the parties briefing,the supreme court granted certiorari in kiobel,heard oral argument,and then ordered reargument on the question w hether and under what circumstances the alien tort statute allows courts to recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than the united states.kiobel royal dutch petroleum.after that order,but before reargument in the supreme court,we heard oral argument in this case.at oral argument,we questioned whether it would be advisable to wait until the court rendered a decision in kiobel,which might affect the viability of plaintiffs claims based on conduct occurring abroad.
after kiobel was finally decided,the parties submitted supplemental briefing on its impact.plaintiffs conceded that kiobel likely precluded some of their ats claims,but argued that others survived the supreme court decision.pls.letter of may,ecf.after awaiting resolution of a number of other cases pending before this court that also presented kiobel issues and had precedence over this one,we now consider the district court march,opinion and order,the parties arguments on appeal,and the supplemental briefing in light of kiobel.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court dismissal for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b de novo,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true.see chambers time warner,cir.we may affirm on any ground that finds support in the record,regardless of the grounds upon which the district court relied.mccall pataki,cir.
ii.the ats and the supreme court kiobel decision 
the ats,passed in,provides that the federal district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.the act has been read as having been enacted on the understanding that the common law would provide a cause of action for the modest number of international law violations with a potential for personal liability at the time of passage.sosa alvarez machain.the supreme court has instructed,however,that courts may,proceeding cautiously,recognize ats claims for violations of the law of nations so long as the claims rest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the paradigms that the court has recognized.id.at.we assume without deciding that all of plaintiffs ats claims meet that standard.
in kiobel,nigerian nationals residing in the united states sued dutch,british,and nigerian corporations under the ats,alleging that the corporations aided and abetted the nigerian government in committing numerous atrocities that violated the law of nations.at.all of the alleged violations of international law in kiobel occurred in nigeria.id.following reargument,the supreme court considered whether those claims should be examined through the lens of the presumption against extraterritoriality,which states that when a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application,it has none.id.at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
the court determined that the presumption applied to ats claims.it rested that conclusion in part upon the three causes of action that were recognized as constituting violations of the law of nations when the ats was passed the violation of safe conducts,infringement on the rights of ambassadors,and piracy.id.at,citing blackstone,commentaries on the laws of eng.the first two violations concerned conduct occurring within the territory of the united states,while the third,piracy,occurred on the high seas,beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the united states or any other country.id.at.the court noted that pirates might be a category unto themselves since they were fair game wherever found,by any nation,because they generally did not operate within any jurisdiction.id.finding these examples of violations of the law of nations consistent with the presumption against extraterritoriality,the court determined that the presumption applied to international tort claims brought under the ats,thus barring petitioners case seeking relief for violations of the law of nations occurring outside the united states.id.at 
the court left open the possibility that conduct outside the united states could be covered by the ats where the claims touch and concern the territory of the united states.id.but even where the claims touch and concern the territory of the united states,the court cautioned,they must do so with sufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application.id.the conduct of the corporate defendants in kiobel did not meet that test,according to the supreme court,because c orporations are often present in many countries,and it would reach too far to say that mere corporate presence suffices.id.
iii.plaintiffs ats claims and extraterritoriality 
plaintiffs concede that kiobel could be read to bar those of their ats claims that stem from conduct that occurred entirely within the territory of australia.pls.letter of may,ecf,at the claims for forced labor,slavery and involuntary servitude as well as for cruel,inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment are likely precluded under kiobel.however,they argue that kiobel should not be read so broadly,and contend that their claims survive that decision because both defendants have a substantial nexus to the united states.id.moreover,they argue that even if read broadly to preclude most of their ats claims,kiobel by its own terms does not reach their human trafficking claim which alleges a transnational violation of international law not occurring within the exclusive jurisdiction of any sovereign.id.at 
plaintiffs base their substantial nexus argument on the fact that defendants were at all times unincorporated associations,and,while committing the alleged wrongs,maintained a substantial presence and significant operations in the united states.id.at.although kiobel provides no substantial nexus exception to the presumption against extraterritoriality,plaintiffs argument essentially contends that their claims touch and concern the territory of the united states,and therefore might overcome the presumption in the manner the supreme court recognized.see.at.
even so construed,however,plaintiffs claims fail to meet the court standard.kiobel rejected the notion that a defendant mere presence in the united states is sufficient to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality.see id.i t would reach too far to say that mere corporate presence suffices.and we have explicitly held since kiobel that even the citizenship of the defendant is irrelevant to jurisdiction to hear claims under the ats.see mastafa chevron,cir balintulo daimler ag,cir.therefore,plaintiffs substantial nexus argument fails to preserve their ats claims for slavery and involuntary servitude,forced child labor,and cruel,inhuman,and degrading treatment or punishment,all of which are based on actions that took place entirely in australia 
accordingly,following the supreme court controlling precedent,we hold that plaintiffs claims under the ats for violations of international law that occurred in australia,that is to say,all except plaintiffs claim for human trafficking,must be dismissed as extraterritorial applications of the ats.
plaintiffs sole remaining ats claim is for human trafficking.they argue that human trafficking is transnational in nature and does not occur within the exclusive territory of a single foreign sovereign.in this case,for example,the trafficking may have begun in britain and malta and ended in australia,but it also encompassed plaintiffs transportation from europe to australia on the high seas.therefore,plaintiffs contend,human trafficking,like piracy,does not take place exclusively within the jurisdiction of a foreign state and thus,like piracy,falls outside the presumption against extraterritoriality.see pls.letter of may,ecf,at.we need not decide whether human trafficking claims remain cognizable in courts after kiobel,however,because plaintiffs trafficking claim is barred by the statute of limitations.
iv.plaintiffs human trafficking claim and the statute of limitations 
the ats does not specify a statute of limitations.in the absence of a limitations period prescribed by statute,federal courts typically borrow the local state statute of limitations unless a rule from elsewhere in federal law clearly provides a closer analogy than available state statutes.star steel thomas,internal quotation marks omitted.several of our sister circuits have found such an analogy for ats claims in the tvpa,which provides a statute of limitations.see chavez carranza,cir jean dorelien,cir van tu koster,cir papa,at we have not decided whether the tvpa statute of limitations applies to all or any specific claims under the ats,and we need not decide that question here.because the parties agree that a statute of limitations applies to plaintiffs ats claims,see pls.br.ccb br.osm br,we assume without deciding that the limitations period for the human trafficking claim is ten years 
given that assumption,plaintiffs human trafficking claim is untimely.the complaint makes plain that the actions allegedly constituting trafficking took place more than fifty years ago,when plaintiffs were transported from their homes in europe to australia.consequently,for plaintiffs claim to be considered within the limitations period,plaintiffs must demonstrate that they did not discover their cause of action and could not have discovered it with due diligence until less than ten years before bringing suit.see guilbert gardner,cir noting that under the diligence discovery rule,a plaintiff cause of action accrues when he discovers,or with due diligence sho
