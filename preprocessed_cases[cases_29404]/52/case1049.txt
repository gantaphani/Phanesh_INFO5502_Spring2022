factual background 
guilt phase.prosecution case 
defendant lived with rocio cervantes,his wife,in carson city,nevada.living with them were rocio two teenage children from a previous relationship,sandra resendes and eric resendes,and three younger children defendant and rocio had together,sergio mendoza,martin mendoza,and edwardo mendoza.
on january,defendant hit sandra with a belt several times for not helping him wash his truck,but stopped after rocio interceded.defendant said he would not let sandra sleep that night,forcing her to stand up all night long as punishment.rocio left defendant and sandra alone.when she returned,rocio heard sandra crying and telling defendant,no,and saw defendant pulling sandra by the hand.defendant warned rocio not to interfere,repeating that sandra was not going to go to sleep that night.eventually,defendant fell asleep on the couch.rocio believed something else was going on and dialed.
at on january,emergency dispatch received a call that was traced to defendant residence.when carson city sheriff deputies graunke and mathews arrived at the residence,sandra told deputy graunke that defendant had arrived home very intoxicated and very angry.sandra told the deputy that defendant had used a belt to strike her approximately seven times on the leg.deputy graunke observed redness and bruises shaped like strap marks on sandra legs.the deputies found defendant sleeping on the living room couch and placed him under arrest for domestic battery.deputy graunke attached sandra witness statement to his incident report.in her statement,sandra wrote of defendant,i at sic one time he told me that he was going to touch me and he did.deputy graunke report,however,does not mention the topic of sexual abuse being broached with sandra or rocio 
after the deputies arrested defendant and took him to the sheriff detention facility,sandra told rocio that defendant had been sexually molesting her for seven to eight months.sandra told rocio that the first time it happened defendant came into her room at night,hugged her,and was telling her not to yell,that rocio was home,and no one was going to say anything.sandra also told rocio that defendant touched her on her breasts,kissed her,and told her that he was never gon na allow her to have a boyfriend.sandra said defendant told her he liked her,and not to tell rocio anything and that when she was older she was gon na be for him.sandra also told rocio that defendant threatened to kill us if sandra told anyone.sandra told rocio that defendant had attempted to kiss her that night before he had been arrested.
that same night,rocio told defendant brother,hector,about sandra accusations and then took the children and left for the home of her brother,antonio cervantes,in landers,california.
released on bail the next day,defendant returned home to find an empty house.defendant phoned rocio and she confronted him with the details of sandra accusations defendant denied molesting sandra and became very angry.defendant and rocio spoke on the phone numerous times in the following days,after which rocio decided to return to carson city with sergio,martin,and edwardo to attempt a reconciliation with defendant.rocio left sandra and eric in landers because neither wanted to return.while in carson city,rocio again discussed sandra allegations with defendant,which he continued to deny.three days later,rocio left defendant as a result of sandra claims and returned to landers with the children.after she left,defendant phoned rocio on six or seven occasions.during those conversations,rocio and defendant continued to discuss sandra accusations,which defendant still denied and which caused defendant to become increasingly angry.
several witnesses testified that defendant was greatly disturbed by sandra accusations and the departure of his family.he felt sandra had betrayed him by accusing him and that it was her fault that rocio left and took the children.he was unable to concentrate or go to work.he slept excessively and began drinking heavily and using cocaine.he could not stay at his apartment alone,so he went to his brother hector home,where he would fall asleep on the couch.defendant became unable to take care of his daily responsibilities.hector urged him to go home to mexico,put his wife behind him,rest,and collect his thoughts.
five days before the killings,defendant quit his job.on january,he bought some extra ammunition for a gun he owned,as well as duct tape and a knife.
on january,defendant borrowed a car from his brother,hector,to drive to landers to confront rocio and sandra.defendant asked his nephew,jose soria delgado to accompany him.on the way,defendant told soria he intended to kill rocio and sandra,adding he would use the knife in case the gun did not work.defendant plan was to have soria drive him to los angeles international airport,from which defendant would fly to mexico,while soria returned the car to his uncle.
defendant and his nephew arrived in landers at antonio cervantes house around on january.around or,defendant went to the house and knocked.angelica cervantes,antonio daughter,answered the door and defendant told her he wanted to see rocio.angelica told rocio,who came to the door.defendant was carrying a brown bag and was drinking a bottle of beer.he did not appear drunk,although the smell of alcohol was apparent on his breath.rocio told him that she had to get the children ready for school.defendant pleaded with rocio to come home with him and bring the children.rocio was not comfortable talking with defendant because she knew he owned a gun and assumed he had brought it with him because of what we had been through.she came outside to talk to him and let him hold the baby,edwardo.defendant held edwardo for a while,telling him that he was very little,and he was not involved for sic what was going to happen.rocio asked defendant what he meant by that statement.defendant smiled and told rocio to wait and she would soon find out.rocio took edwardo and gave him to angelica and then rocio went inside the house to get the children ready for school.
julio cervantes,antonio son,then walked out of the house a little before,saw defendant and said hello to him.julio left,taking his wife and brother to school.
a little while later,sandra and wendy cervantes,antonio daughter,told rocio that defendant was banging on the door,so rocio went outside again.defendant asked rocio whether she was afraid of him.he told her to come closer,asking repeatedly whether she was afraid of him.at that point it was getting close to the time the rest of the children had to go to school.julio returned and the children went outside to go to school.antonio was nearby on the porch.
defendant told rocio the children were not going to school.antonio and julio told defendant the children needed to go to school and julio told sandra,eric,sergio,martin,and wendy to get in the car.the children got in the car and defendant again yelled that no one was going to school.when julio asked why,defendant pulled out a gun.defendant grabbed rocio around the neck,and pointed a gun at her head.
julio asked defendant if he wanted rocio and the children to return with him.julio pulled sergio and martin out of the car and said t hey here.if you want to take them,take them.antonio told defendant to put the gun away because he was scaring the children.julio stood next to martin,and told defendant he was scaring the boy.defendant then shot twice in julio direction.antonio moved to take the gun away,but defendant shot at antonio.julio,antonio,and sergio ran inside the house.at that moment,soria drove away from the house,afraid that he would be blamed for whatever was going to happen.
defendant,still holding on to rocio with a gun to her head,walked off the porch and went next to the car.he ordered martin to the car and told sandra to get out of the car,telling her he would kill her mom if she did not get out.defendant then let go of rocio and grabbed sandra by her neck,with the gun to her head.sandra began crying and defendant told her to stop.defendant told her not to cry because he was going to kill them anyway.defendant told rocio to go around to the other side of the car and turn the car around so that it was facing the street.rocio did so and then got out of the car.defendant told sandra,eric,wendy,and martin,to get in the front seat,which they all did.
defendant told rocio to go inside and tell people not to call the police.he told rocio to tell antonio that he also had his daughter,wendy.defendant said that if the police were called,he would kill the children.rocio asked defendant if he wanted her to go back home with him,offering to take their biological children and return with him.defendant replied that it was too late.defendant ordered rocio to get his knapsack from the porch and to bring it to him,which she did.defendant was upset and nervous and said he did not know what would happen next.about three or four minutes passed.rocio then heard defendant tell sandra,turn around to look at your mother.look how she is and remember that this is your fault.if you would have told your mother anything,she would be with me.and now both of you are going to die.he told sandra not to cry or he would kill rocio first.defendant again told rocio to go inside and to tell everyone not to call the police or else he would kill the children.
meanwhile,julio phoned and told dispatch what was happening,warning that the officers needed to be careful because defendant had a gun to sandra head.julio told dispatch the officers could get to his house via a rear street because he was worried about what defendant might do.nonetheless,despite julio warnings,patrol car sirens became audible just as rocio was entering the house.at that moment,defendant shot sandra.defendant then shot the other children.antonio attempted to go outside,but defendant shot at him.when deputies from the san bernardino sheriff department arrived,defendant opened fire on them.the officers drew their guns and returned fire,wounding defendant.defendant attempted to flee,running to the side of the house.julio,who had been on the line with the operator,dropped the phone and ran after defendant.defendant and the deputies continued to exchange gunfire.defendant slipped in some sand and julio jumped on him and took his gun away.the deputies took defendant into custody.
rocio ran to see her children.sandra was lying in a pool of blood.wendy was lying against the driver side window.martin was under the car.eric was lying on the ground.sandra was already dead but wendy,eric,and martin were still alive.wendy and eric died before emergency personnel arrived.martin survived 
after they located soria,the police found in the car a map to antonio house on which defendant had written sandra name.defendant had also drawn a swastika and written the words mexican power kill.
defense case 
defendant version of events largely tracked the prosecutor,but defendant argued that he lacked the mental state necessary for first degree murder.defendant called jose moral,a forensic psychiatrist,who testified that rocio departure with the children caused defendant to develop a depressive disorder.moral testified that someone in that frame of mind would feel humiliated,angry,and out of control if their wish that the children not go to school was overridden.moral also testified that the deputies arriving with their sirens activated would have pushed such a person into a crisis state,perhaps rendering that person unable to properly react to the situation.the problem would be exacerbated by the presence of alcohol in one system.
defendant also elicited testimony about the response of the deputies to the situation in landers.defendant called frank saunders,a police practices expert,who testified that the officers responded properly initially,but escalated the situation by confronting defendant.
penalty phase 
the prosecution case in aggravation consisted of four witnesses sergio,rocio,and wendy parents,antonio and antonia cervantes.they described the sense of loss each felt due to the death of their family members.
defendant mitigation case consisted of six witnesses.joseph lantz testified about defendant limited mental functioning and low intellectual ability.he testified that defendant felt overwhelmed as a result of the departure of his family and his intellectual limitations left him unable to cope with the situation in landers.three family father,mother,and two friends testified about defendant good qualities,his difficult childhood,and their positive feelings for defendant.
ii.discussion 
guilt phase.admission of sandra accusation 
defendant contends the trial court erred when it failed to exclude rocio testimony that sandra accused defendant of sexually molesting her.first,defendant argues sandra statements constituted inadmissible hearsay.second,defendant claims admission of the accusations violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the united states constitution,as construed by the high court in crawford washington,d crawford.third,defendant contends that evidence related to the accusations should have been excluded because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice.we disagree.
as previously set forth,after the carson city sheriff deputies arrested defendant for hitting sandra,she told rocio defendant had been sexually molesting her for the previous seven to eight months.rocio took the children and drove to her brother house in landers.after defendant was released from jail,he phoned rocio and she confronted him with sandra accusations,which he angrily denied.defendant and rocio discussed sandra claims in detail during numerous other phone conversations as well.defendant became depressed,feeling betrayed by sandra and blaming her in part for rocio departure with the children.before killing sandra and the other two children on january,defendant told sandra,this is your fault.if you would have told your mother anything,she would be with me.and now both of you are going to die.
on june,the prosecutor stated his intention to offer sandra statements as evidence in the guilt and penalty phase.defense counsel filed a motion in limine to exclude the statements as inadmissible hearsay and highly prejudicial.at a hearing on the motion,the prosecutor argued the evidence did not constitute hearsay because sandra statements were not being offered to prove defendant actually molested her,but instead that defendant knew of the accusations and as evidence of his premeditation and motive for driving to landers to kill sandra.the trial court agreed that the evidence was not offered for a hearsay purpose.
defense counsel next argued the court should exclude the evidence under evidence code section.in defense counsel view,the evidence had minimal probative value and was simply icing on the cake of the prosecutor case.additionally,any probative value was outweighed by the significant danger of undue prejudice,given the nature of sandra statements.the trial court disagreed and denied defendant motion,although it stated it would give a limiting instruction.
during the guilt phase,rocio testified regarding sandra accusations and her own detailed communication of those accusations to defendant.defense counsel objected on hearsay grounds during rocio testimony and requested the court instruct the jury not to consider the statements for their truth.the prosecutor responded,that fine,and the court stated that it would so instruct the jury.the court admonished the jury during rocio testimony that the statements were not being offered for their truth but rather to explain defendant conduct.the court also gave similar limiting instructions before the jury began their deliberations.
counsel also stipulated to the admission of the two incident reports deputy graunke incident report,which included sandra written statement accusing defendant of touching her,and detective wolf interview of deputy graunke,in which deputy graunke stated sandra denied having been sexually abused by defendant.
during the prosecutor questioning of the forensic pathologist about the autopsy conducted on sandra,the prosecutor briefly addressed whether sandra had been molested.the prosecutor asked if sandra body had been examined to ascertain whether or not there was any evidence that sandra might have been molested.the pathologist testified that he had,but that there was no evidence of molestation.defense counsel did not object.
during the penalty phase,sandra accusations were again discussed,albeit mostly via indirect references.the prosecutor made only a slight reference to it in his closing argument.rocio briefly alluded to the accusations of sexual abuse on two occasions.defendant did not object to either the prosecutor reference or rocio testimony.additionally,the psychologist testifying for the defense,while on direct examination by defense counsel,stated w e know that defendant was upset because sandra had spoken about abuse.
defendant renewed his objections to the admission of sandra statements in his posttrial motion to set aside the verdict.the trial court denied defendant motion.
hearsay claim 
the evidence code defines hearsay as evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated.the trial court concluded the prosecutor was not offering sandra statements to prove defendant actually molested her,but rather to prove defendant was aware of the accusations and to explain defendant motive for killing sandra.accordingly,the evidence did not constitute hearsay.we agree.
sandra accusations were properly admitted to explain defendant state of mind,motive,and conduct.people hill cal th,d,people duran cal d.rocio testified that,after sandra told her about defendant abuse,she had numerous conversations with defendant during which she confronted him with the details of sandra accusations.there is no dispute defendant was aware of the accusations before he went to landers.
defendant argues the prosecutor actual purpose in presenting evidence of sandra accusations was to suggest defendant actually molested sandra.the record does not support defendant contention.the prosecutor contended defendant anger about the allegations and their effect on his family led him to murder sandra and the other children.indeed,as the prosecutor pointed out in his closing argument in the guilt phase,the veracity of sandra accusations was immaterial to their relevance in explaining defendant motive.whether the allegations were true or false,is not for you to consider.that not what we here about.he not being tried for molestation.sandra is not here to testify about it.so just remember,it only there to help you understand that he was angry,one way or the other.either that he did molest sandra and she copped on him,or that he did do it and she lied about it,but he was mad at her.
furthermore,in his guilt phase opening statement,the prosecutor even noted that sandra had denied being abused to deputy graunke and that defendant consistently denied doing so.the prosecutor made clear that the statements were only being offered to explain defendant conduct because,true or not,the claim was made,and rocio was furious about it,and she took the kids while he was in jail and left this disturbed him a great deal.he started thinking about it incessantly about five days before the killings took place.
accordingly,we conclude the trial court correctly admitted the statements for the limited nonhearsay purpose for which it was offered 
sixth amendment and confrontation clause claim 
defendant contends the admission of sandra statements violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.we disagree.
the confrontation clause provides in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.however,as the high court acknowledged in crawford,the sixth amendment is not implicated by the admission of nonhearsay statements.crawford,supra,at.people combs cal th,d,the cases defendant cites to the contrary are inapposite as they involve testimonial statements being offered to prove the truth of the statements content,bockting bayer cir people sisavath th,d.because we have already concluded sandra statements were admitted for a nonhearsay purpose,defendant claim fails.
evidence code section claim 
defendant contends the trial court erred by admitting evidence of sandra statements,arguing the statements should have been excluded pursuant to evidence code section.we disagree.
it is within a trial court discretion to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission would create a substantial danger of undue prejudice.our review on this issue is deferential.a trial court decision whether to exclude evidence pursuant to evidence code section is reviewed for abuse of discretion.people barnett cal th,d.
while it is true that evidence suggesting defendant was not only a murderer but a child molester had the potential to be inflammatory,it did not amount to evidence which uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against the defendant as an individual and which has very little effect on the issues.citations.people barnett,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.as discussed above,sandra accusations were substantially probative of defendant premeditation and motive for coming to landers to kill sandra.evidence was presented that,after being confronted with sandra accusations,defendant became increasingly angry and distressed,and felt betrayed by sandra.several witnesses testified defendant told sandra right before he killed her that she was to blame for what he was about to do.
by contrast,any prejudice was limited by the instructions given by the trial court.during his examination of rocio,the prosecutor suggested the court admonish the jury that sandra statements were being offered to explain defendant conduct and not to prove the truth of the matter asserted,and the court did so.at the close of the guilt phase,the court instructed the jury that the evidence was admitted for a limited purpose and could not be considered by you for any purpose other than the limited purpose for which it was admitted.we presume,absent evidence to the contrary,that the jurors faithfully followed these instructions.people green cal d.in addition,any risk of prejudice was further minimized by the prosecutor repeated underscoring of the point in his guilt phase opening statement and closing argument,as discussed above.thus,the probative value of the statements was not substantially outweighed by the probability of a substantial danger of undue prejudice we therefore conclude the trial court did not err in admitting sandra statements.
prosecutorial misconduct 
defendant contends the prosecutor committed repeated acts of prejudicial misconduct requiring reversal of the guilt phase.we disagree.while several of the prosecutor comments were improper,reversal is not warranted as the misconduct was not prejudicial.
a prosecutor conduct violates a defendant constitutional rights when the behavior comprises a pattern of conduct so egregious that it infects the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.citation.darden wainwright,d.the focus of the inquiry is on the effect of the prosecutor action on the defendant,not on the intent or bad faith of the prosecutor.people crew cal th,d.conduct that does not render a trial fundamentally unfair is error under state law only when it involves the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to attempt to persuade either the court or the jury.citations.people espinoza cal th,d.
examination of deputy gordon 
defendant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by making disparaging remarks about defense counsel and defense evidence.see people bemore cal th,d.the first cited example occurred during the prosecutor examination of deputy stan gordon.discussing defendant theory that the deputies response to antonio house exacerbated the crisis,the prosecutor asked the deputy whether that theory had been raised in soria prior trial when the deputy testified that it had not,the prosecutor stated i n other words,that defense attorney did try to blame the cops for this defense counsel objected,stating e xcuse me,counsel has tried to disparage the defense a number of times.i would like an order that he knock it off.the prosecutor retorted it takes a big man to admit he wrong.the trial court intervened,sustaining defendant objection and admonishing the jury not to draw any inferences from the prosecutor question or comments.
while it is misconduct for a prosecutor to cast aspersions on defense counsel or suggest that counsel has fabricated a defense,we need not resolve whether the prosecutor comment was improper.in the present case,the trial court sustained the defense objections and admonished the jury to disregard the comments it is assumed the jury followed the admonishment and that prejudice was therefore avoided.people jones cal th,d.
later in the direct examination of deputy gordon,the prosecutor asked the deputy whether he had turned on his belt recorder during the incident and,when the deputy responded that he had,the prosecutor indicated his desire to play the recording and to question the deputy about it.defense counsel stated y our honor,i do know if there something that this witness needs his memory refreshed by listening to the recorder.perhaps the prosecutor could ask him the questions first,and if he does remember,then he might have to refresh his recollection.the prosecutor responded c lever objection,but it not the point.he has to authenticate the voices on the tape,and he has to hear them before he can do that.the court overruled the objection.
defendant claim that the prosecutor sarcastic retort constituted misconduct is forfeited by his failure to timely object on that ground and request the court admonish the jury.people ayala cal th,d,in re sheena cal th,fn,d.additionally,when the claim of misconduct focuses upon comments made by the prosecutor before the jury,the question is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury construed or applied any of the remarks in an objectionable fashion.people ayala,supra,at,d.while the prosecutor statement that counsel had made a clever objection may have been needlessly sarcastic,it did not constitute misconduct.
examination of defense psychiatrist 
the next alleged example of misconduct occurred during the prosecutor of defense psychiatrist jose moral.defendant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct when he mentioned defendant prior arrests without first seeking the court permission.moral testified about defendant anger issues,stating that defendant did not believe he had an anger issue prior to hitting sandra.the prosecutor then mentioned defendant arrest in for battery and in for discharging a firearm,asking moral whether the arrests would have put defendant on notice that he had prior problems with anger and alcohol.defendant objected and there was a discussion at sidebar.after the discussion,during which the prosecutor stated that he believed his examination complied with the trial court rulings,the trial court stated it would sustain defendant objection and instruct the jury to disregard the last questions and statements.
when defendant objections are sustained and the court admonishes the jury to disregard the improper comments,we assume the jury will follow the admonishment and any prejudice is avoided.people jones,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,we need not decide whether the prosecutor committed misconduct.
prosecutor closing argument 
defendant next focuses on the prosecutor closing argument.the prosecutor,discussing whether manslaughter would be appropriate,turned to the notion of an ordinarily reasonable person.and who is the ordinarily reasonable person you folks are.defendant objected and sought an admonition,explaining that is an incorrect statement of the law.the jury is not to put themselves in as a reasonable person.the trial court told the jury t he court instructions are what you are to follow in this case,not what counsel argues.
moments later the prosecutor continued,this is a situation where again you have to impose the reasonable person standard.it not what mendoza may have felt,or what he may have gone through.he not entitled to set up his own standard of conduct.can you imagine a society that allowed us to do that would any of you do what he did here and say that reasonable would any of you do that no.would any of you put a gun to people heads would any of you do what he did here is that reasonable defendant objected and the court admonished the jury that the standard is the ordinarily prudent person,which is an objective test,not an individual personal beliefs,but an objective test of what you think an ordinarily prudent,reasonable person would do or not do.
although counsel have broad discretion in discussing the legal and factual merits of a case citation,it is improper to misstate the law.citation.people bell cal d.here,the prosecutor misstated the law when he told the jurors that they,as individuals,could subjectively define the reasonable person standard.the reasonable person is a hypothetical individual who is intended to represent a sort of average citizen.therefore,it is one thing to refer to the jurors as members of society in the course of explaining the reasonable person standard as a means of determining whether a killing was caused by an event or situation that probably would cause a reasonable person to lose and kill.accordingly,it was not misconduct for the prosecutor to tell the jury and who is the ordinarily reasonable person you folks are.it is another thing,however,to imply that the jurors,as individuals,can substitute their own subjective standard of behavior for that of the objective,reasonable person.statements such as,would any of you do what he did here and say that reasonable would any of you do that no.would any of you put a gun to people heads would any of you do what he did here appear to encourage jurors to impose their own subjective judgment in place of applying an objective standard.it is here that the prosecutor went too far,committing misconduct.
however,arguments of counsel generally carry less weight with a jury than do instructions from the court.the former are usually billed in advance to the jury as matters of argument,not evidence citation,and are likely viewed as the statements of advocates the latter,we have often recognized,are viewed as definitive and binding statements of the law.boyde california,d.the prosecutor misconduct was not prejudicial.the trial court admonished the jury people jones,supra,cal th at,d,and gave them the correct standard,and the jury understood that the prosecutor statements merely constituted argument.
defendant next argues that the prosecutor injected his own feelings during closing argument.as the prosecutor argued,who can forget the very chilling testimony of little sergio when he talks about how his father was holding the gun to people head and saying he was gon na kill mom if he did if sandra did stop crying.how outrageous is that is that the act of a reasonable person shut up,stop crying,or i gon na kill your mom.i do know about you,i an old war horse.i been through a lot of these.that choked me up when i saw that testimony.defense counsel asked to approach the bench and,at sidebar,asked for a finding of prosecutorial misconduct and for a mistrial.defense counsel argued that the prosecutor improperly injected his personal opinion into closing argument and that it was only the most recent example of a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct.
the court denied the motion,but stated that it would caution the prosecutor.i do agree this last comment was probably not appropriate,your personal feelings about,about this.this is probably inappropriate,but i do think it rises to the level of a mistrial.the other problem you mentioned with the standard,the court admonished the jury,and has instructed them,and i think that problem is corrected.in any event,i will deny the motion but with that admonition to the prosecutor.
the prosecutor improperly stated his personal beliefs,i do know about you,i an old war horse.i been through a lot of these.that choked me up when i saw that testimony based on facts not in evidence.people ghent cal d.in underscoring the egregiousness of defendant crimes,the prosecutor emphasized his long experience as a basis for assessing sergio testimony.this constituted misconduct.people bandhauer cal d.however,the trial court found the statement did not warrant a mistrial,a decision which is within the sound discretion of the trial court.people price cal th,d.the prosecutor reference to his own feelings was brief and,after the trial court ruling,the prosecutor did not return to the point.moreover,the prosecutor statements were part of his argument and likely given less weight than instructions given by the court.boyde california,supra,at.
defendant next argues the prosecutor committed misconduct when it asked the jury to place themselves into the shoes of the victims.do you remember the thing he said to little sandra just before he executed her with a gun at her head can you imagine the terror that this child is going through,and that all the people are going through certainly the children.can you imagine that terror it not in the courtroom.we not here doing some scientific experiment.imagine yourselves at the scene.and what does he do 
defense counsel asked to approach the bench,and at sidebar again asked for a mistrial and a finding of prosecutorial misconduct.defense counsel argued that the prosecutor was improperly attempting to incite the passions of the jury by asking them to place themselves at the scene and to imagine the victims terror.the court denied the motion for a mistrial,telling the prosecutor to move off that subject and move on with your argument.
in the guilt phase of a trial,it is misconduct to appeal to the jury to view the crime through the eyes of the victim.people stansbury cal th,d.here,the prosecutor request that the jury imagine the fear defendant victims experienced was clearly improper.however,the misconduct was not prejudicial as his comments were brief and he did not return to the point.moreover,this was not a close case evidence of defendant guilt was overwhelming.accordingly,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant request for a mistrial.people price,supra,cal th at,d.
cumulative effect of prosecutorial misconduct 
defendant contends the numerous instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct rendered his trial fundamentally unfair,in violation of his federal constitutional right to due process and a reliable verdict.we disagree.although our review has uncovered several instances of misconduct,as discussed above,the incidents were not prejudicial.
in a number of instances,defendant failed to object or request an admonition and so forfeited the claim.people ayala,supra,cal th at,d,in re sheena,supra,cal th at,fn,d.in all other instances,the trial court sustained defense objections and admonished the jury.people jones,supra,cal th at,d.additionally,this was not a close case.as we have repeatedly noted,it is undisputed that defendant shot and killed three children,including his two stepchildren.there was also substantial evidence of defendant premeditation,including his purchase of ammunition,his statements to soria,and his statements to rocio and sandra in landers.we therefore reject defendant claim of prejudicial misconduct.people hinton cal th,d.
cumulative effect of court error and prosecutorial misconduct 
defendant contends the cumulative prejudicial effect of the various trial court errors and prosecutorial misconduct he has raised on appeal requires reversal of the guilt judgment.we have rejected his claims of error,with limited exceptions in which we found the instances of prosecutorial misconduct to be harmless.considered together,any errors were not prejudicial.
penalty phase 
prosecutorial misconduct 
defendant contends the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct during his penalty phase closing argument.we disagree.
in discussing the evidence that could be considered as part of section,factor a the prosecutor identified the victim impact testimony presented.in discussing the families suffering,the prosecutor made two additional comments about other victims.the prosecutor first stated w hen a child is murdered,we all suffer.we have all been made victims,have we he then told the jury y ou are victims in the sense that you have to make a decision as to whether or not somebody lives or dies.defense counsel asked to approach the bench.
at sidebar,defense counsel asked the trial court to find the prosecutor had committed misconduct by telling the jurors to consider themselves victims of defendant.defense counsel requested the trial court read a curative instruction counsel had prepared.the trial court agreed the prosecutor had erred,at which point the prosecutor offered to withdraw the comment and the court stated it would admonish the jury to disregard the statements.the trial court declined defense counsel invitation to read its curative instruction and instead gave its own admonition.in open court,the court admonished the jury that the court advises you that it was not proper for the district attorney to refer to you as victims in this case,and you are to disregard that statement.it not to enter into your consideration in any way.
as to the prosecutor argument that the murders victimized everyone w hen a child is murdered,we all suffer.we have all been made victims,have we,no misconduct occurred.see payne tennessee,d noting that a victim death represents a unique loss to society.as to the prosecutor second argument that the jurors were themselves victims of defendant because they had to act as jurors y ou are victims in the sense that you have to make a decision as to whether or not somebody lives or dies,as the trial court found,the comments constituted misconduct.however,the incident was not prejudicial.the trial court immediately admonished the jury to disregard the statements,specifically chastising the prosecutor.people jones,supra,cal th at,d.
as above ante,d at,at,we reject defendant claim that the cumulative effect of prosecutorial misconduct warrants reversal.
constitutionality of death penalty statute and instructions
