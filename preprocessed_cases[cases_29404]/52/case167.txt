nine cayman islands hedge funds the funds,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york daniels,dismissing the complaint with prejudice.for the reasons set forth below,while we conclude that the complaint does not sufficiently allege the existence of domestic securities transactions,we conclude that the plaintiffs should be given leave to amend the complaint to assert additional facts suggesting that the transactions at issue were domestic.specifically,we hold that to sufficiently allege the existence of a domestic transaction in other securities,plaintiffs must allege facts indicating that irrevocable liability was incurred or that title was transferred within the united states.because there has been significant ambiguity as to what constitutes a domestic transaction in other securities,the plaintiffs should have the opportunity to assert additional facts leading to the plausible inference that either irrevocable liability was incurred or that title passed in the united states.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court in part,reverse the judgment of the district court in part,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a.the complaint 
the following facts are drawn from the allegations in the funds amended complaint filed on november,the complaint.
are nine cayman islands hedge funds that invested in a variety of asset classes on behalf of hundreds of investors around the world,including many investors in the united states.each of the funds engaged absolute capital management holdings limited acm from at least the middle of to act as its investment manager.acm typically charged each fund a monthly management fee of per annum based on the particular fund net asset value nav and a monthly performance fee of of the increase in value of the fund nav.
at all relevant times,defendant florian homm was the chief investment officer of acm,and defendants sean ewing and ullrich angersbach were the executive officer and head of investor relations and marketing,respectively,of acm.homm had powers of attorney to invest on the funds behalf.defendants and brothers colin and craig heatherington were acm employees who were principals of defendant cic global capital cic todd ficeto,a resident of california and registered securities agent in california,florida,illinois,massachusetts,new jersey,new york,texas,and washington,was the president,director,and along with homm,a of hunter world markets,hunter,the incorporated and based in california with offices in beverly hills.
the complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in a variation on the classic scheme,causing the funds to suffer losses of at least million through cycles of fraudulent trading of securities.defendants fraud allegedly operated as follows defendants homm,ficeto,hunter,and colin heatherington collectively,the trading defendants first caused the funds to purchase billions of shares of thinly capitalized companies the penny stock companies directly from those companies.all of these companies were incorporated in the united states and their shares the penny stocks were quoted on the over the counter bulletin board or by pink otc markets.
over approximately three years,the trading defendants allegedly caused the funds to purchase the penny stocks directly from those companies in subscriptions pursuant to private offerings known as private investment in public equity pipe transactions.acting in their capacity as placement agents,homm,ficeto,and hunter arranged the financing for these transactions and received placement fees in return.at or around the time of these purchases,the penny stock companies registered their shares with the sec.
at the time of each of these initial purchases by the funds,the trading defendants either already held in their own names,or otherwise controlled,substantial amounts of shares warrants of the penny stock companies,or received shares warrants from the penny stock companies for little to no money in exchange for causing the funds to purchase shares from those companies.after causing the funds to purchase the penny stocks directly from the issuers,the trading defendants then artificially inflated the prices of those stocks by trading and the penny stocks,often between and among the funds,each time trading the stock at a higher price to create the illusion of trading volume.for example,on april,the trading defendants allegedly inflated the price of shares of proelite,by causing one of the funds,absolute return europe fund limited,to sell shares of proelite,at per share times its valuation just six months earlier.moreover,this fraudulent trading was typically conducted through hunter in its function as a.
according to the complaint,the purpose of these fraudulent trades was twofold to generate substantial commissions for homm,hunter,and ficeto,and to artificially inflate the stock price to the point at which the trading defendants together with craig heatherington were free to sell previously shares and exercise warrants to obtain additional shares,which they then sold to the funds for a windfall,having obtained the shares or warrants for nothing or almost nothing.once defendants had manipulated the prices of the penny stocks to the desired levels,the trading defendants,craig heatherington,and cic sold the shares they had obtained fraudulently to the funds at inflated prices.
in addition,ficeto allegedly created a fraudulent vehicle called the hunter fund,the only investors in which were certain of the funds.the hunter fund invested the funds money in some of the penny stock companies.the funds derived no benefit from the funneling of their money through the hunter fund prior to being invested in the penny stocks.homm and ficeto merely used the hunter fund to earn additional fees and to make loans to the penny stock companies.
while the trading defendants caused the funds money to be invested in the penny stocks,other defendants allegedly raised money from investors in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme.as head of investor relations and marketing at acm,defendant angersbach was responsible for courting investors around the globe,including many in the united states.with knowledge of the fraudulent scheme,angersbach allegedly encouraged further subscription in the funds,marketing them heavily in the united states and elsewhere.similarly,with knowledge of the fraudulent scheme,defendant ewing allegedly traveled to the united states to meet with investors and potential investors in the funds and to reassure those investors who were concerned about homm disciplinary history.ewing also allegedly facilitated the fraud by misrepresenting the composition of the funds investment to investors.
the complaint alleges that the defendants benefited substantially as a result of the fraudulent scheme and at the expense of the funds.homm,ficeto,and hunter charged millions in fees and commissions on the funds loans to,subscriptions in,and other purchases of shares in the penny stock companies.after inflating the prices of the penny stocks,homm,ficeto,hunter,colin heatherington,craig heatherington,and cic profited by causing the funds to purchase from them penny stocks that they owned and had acquired for pennies or less.angersbach,through a corporate entity he controlled,collected proceeds of at least million through sales of his acm holdings,and ewing,through a corporate entity he controlled,collected proceeds of million.both angersbach and ewing obtained further proceeds by redeeming their holdings in the funds at a profit.while the defendants reaped enormous profits,the funds allegedly suffered losses in the amount of.

discussion 
we review de novo a district court dismissal pursuant to.b or.b,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true.ford union local,cir per curiam reciting standard of review for rule b motion flagler trainor,cir reciting standard of review for rule b motion.to survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,u,internal quotation marks omitted.
section b of the exchange act makes it unlawful t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.b.rule,which was promulgated under b,provides 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
in determining whether b and rule could apply extraterritorially,this court had previously applied the conduct and effects test,which focused on whether the wrongful conduct occurred in the united states,and whether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in the united states or upon united states citizens.see sec berger,cir.however,in morrison,the supreme court rejected the conduct and effects test and held that b and rule do not apply extraterritorially,but only apply to transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges and domestic transactions in other securities.at.
a.the morrison decision 
in morrison,three australian plaintiffs sued an australian bank,national australian bank,under b of the exchange act for losses they allegedly suffered on purchases of the bank stock on australian exchanges.id.at.the district court dismissed the foreign plaintiffs claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.this court affirmed,see morrison austl.bank,cir,and the foreign plaintiffs successfully sought review in the supreme court.
the supreme court first dismissed the notion that the extraterritoriality of b raises an issue of subject matter jurisdiction and distinguished subject matter jurisdiction,which relates to a tribunal power to hear a case,from the merits question of whether b applies to particular conduct.morrison.at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the supreme court clarified that the district court did,in fact,have jurisdiction under to address whether b applied to the defendant conduct.id.
turning to the merits,the supreme court,noting the longstanding principle of american law that legislation of congress,unless a contrary intent appears,is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,held that b of the exchange act does not apply extraterritorially,id.at in so holding,the supreme court eschewed the second circuit conduct and effects test in favor of a transactional test,which provides that b only applies to transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges and domestic transactions in other securities.id.at.with regard to securities not registered on domestic exchanges,the exclusive focus is on domestic purchases and sales id.at.
the case at hand does not concern the first prong of morrison whether a transaction involves a security listed on a domestic exchange rather,we must interpret morrison second prong and determine under what circumstances the purchase or sale of a security that is not listed on a domestic exchange should be considered domestic within the meaning of morrison.see plumbers union local pension fund swiss reins,d,w hile morrison held that a domestic purchase or sale is necessary and,as far as that opinion reveals,sufficient for section b to apply to a security that is not traded on a domestic securities exchange,it did not have occasion to discuss what it means for a purchase or sale to be made in the united states.for the reasons that we elaborate below,we hold that transactions involving securities that are not traded on a domestic exchange are domestic if irrevocable liability is incurred or title passes within the united states.
subject matter jurisdiction 
as an initial matter,the district court erred in dismissing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because morrison makes clear that whether b applies to certain conduct is a merits question.see morrison.at.notwithstanding this threshold error,see id.at,all the parties ask us to reach whether the district court erred in dismissing the complaint because it determined that the transactions were not within the territorial reach of b.see mcginty new york,cir noting that where the parties have fully briefed the questions raised on appeal and the issues are predominantly of a legal nature,we may decide the substantive issues even though the district court dismissed the case sua sponte without notice.moreover,while the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,it indicated in a footnote that dismissal would be properly granted under rule b as well as b.absolute activist value master fund,wl,at.it is thus clear that a remand would only require a new rule b label for the same rule b conclusion.see morrison.at.we now turn to whether the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to allege the existence of domestic transactions.
domestic purchases and sales 
the meaning of a domestic transaction 
while morrison holds that b can be applied to domestic purchases or sales,it provides little guidance as to what constitutes a domestic purchase or sale.to determine the meaning of a domestic purchase or sale,we first consider how these terms are defined in the exchange act.the terms buy and purchase each include any contract to buy,purchase,or otherwise acquire.a.similarly,t he terms sale and sell each include any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of.id.a.while the supreme court has previously noted that these definitions are for the most part unhelpful because they only declare generally that the terms purchase and sale shall include contracts to purchase or sell,see sec,these definitions nonetheless suggest that the act of purchasing or selling securities is the act of entering into a binding contract to purchase or sell securities.put another way,these definitions suggest that the purchase and sale take place when the parties be
