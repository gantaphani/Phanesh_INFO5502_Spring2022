background 
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa authorizes the secretary of state to designate an entity as a fto if the secretary finds 
a the organization is a foreign organization 
b the organization engages in terrorist activity or retains the capability and intent to engage in terrorist activity or terrorism and 
c the terrorist activity or terrorism of the organization threatens the security of united states nationals or the national security of the united states.
a.terrorist activity is defined,in relevant part,as 
any activity which is unlawful under the laws of the place where it is committed and which involves any of the following 
iv an assassination.
v the use of any 
a biological agent,chemical agent,or nuclear weapon or device,or 
b explosive,firearm,or other weapon or dangerous device other than for mere personal monetary gain,
with intent to endanger,directly or indirectly,the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.
vi a threat,attempt,or conspiracy to do any of the foregoing.
id.a b iii.to engage in terrorist activity includes,among other acts,solicit ing funds or other things of value for aa a terrorist activity or bb a terrorist organization.id.a b iv.
designation as a fto has three main consequences except as authorized by the secretary,any financial institution that becomes aware that it has possession of,or control over,any funds in which a foreign terrorist organization has an interest shall retain possession of,or maintain control over such funds,a any alien who is a representative of a terrorist organization,a b i,is ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the united states,id.a and it becomes a crime to knowingly provide material support or resources to the foreign terrorist organization,or attempt or conspire to do so,a.
kach and kahane chai,organizations the stated purpose of which is to restore the biblical state of israel,were declared terrorist organizations by the israeli cabinet in pursuant to israel terrorism law.the secretary of state first designated kahane chai and kach as ftos in,designation of foreign terrorist organizations,and redesignated them as such in,designation of foreign terrorist organizations,and,redesignation of foreign terrorist organizations.in the secretary also designated kach and other organizations as aliases of kahane chai.id.neither kahane chai nor any of its aliases sought judicial review of any of these designations.
on september,the department of state wrote letters to five persons it thought might represent kahane chai stating that the secretary proposed to redesignate kahane chai,kach,and kahane chai other aliases as ftos.the notice stated that the unclassified portion of the administrative record before the department would be provided to any representative of kahane chai or of an alias who so requested within ten days from receipt thereof the representative would have days from receipt of the record to submit a response.
on september samuel abady,sent a letter in which he identified himself as counsel to one of the addressees of the september notice noted his response was timely conveyed his client position that kahane chai,kach,and the other presumed aliases were legitimate,jewish activist organizations not one of which practices,supports or advocates terrorism and demanded disclosure of the administrative record.the department of state deemed the letter defective because it did not say abady was requesting the record as a representative of kahane chai or one of its aliases.on october kenneth klein,sent a letter to the department in which he identified himself as the attorney for a representative of kach and requested the record,but the department deemed his letter untimely.
on october,secretary of state colin powell redesignated kahane chai as a fto and kach and others as aliases of kahane chai.redesignation of foreign terrorist organizations.at the same time the secretary newly designated more entities as aliases of kahane chai,including,and.id.drawing upon both classified and unclassified information,the secretary concluded that kahane chai engaged in terrorist activity by using explosives or firearms with intent to endanger the safety of individuals or cause substantial damage to property,threatening and conspiring to carry out assassinations,and soliciting funds and members for a terrorist organization.the secretary also concluded that kahane chai retains the capability and intent to engage in terrorist activity.
after the petitioners had filed for judicial review of the secretary decision,the state department agreed to provide klein and abady,as representatives of kahane chai,with the unclassified portion of the administrative record,to accept relevant submissions for inclusion in the record,and to make a de novo decision on redesignation.in,the secretary conducted the de novo review and concluded that,although the record included conflicting information on many of the bombings previously attributed to kahane chai,the rest of the record supported its redesignation.the secretary also concluded that was no longer an alias of kahane chai and revoked its designation as a fto,but left in place all other designations as aliases of kahane chai.foreign terrorists and terrorist organizations.
ii.analysis 
the three petitioners,in a joint brief,raise both statutory and constitutional objections to their designations.first,they argue the designations were made without substantial support in the administrative record.second,they contend the state department refusal to provide them with the administrative record prior to the designations denied them due process,in violation of the fifth amendment to the constitution of the united states.third,the petitioners allege that designating a website as a fto violates the first amendment to the constitution.finally,the petitioners contend the state department discriminated upon the basis of religion because it designated as ftos the websites only of jewish organizations.
statutory claims 
our standard of review is deferential.under the aedpa as amended by,stat,we are to set aside the secretary designation of a fto only if that designation was 
a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law 
b contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity 
c in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitation,or short of statutory right 
d lacking substantial support in the administrative record taken as a whole or in classified information submitted to the court or 
e not in accord with the procedures required by law.
c.our review is to be based solely upon the administrative record,except that the government may submit,for ex parte and in camera review,classified information used in making the designation.id.moreover,we make no judgment as to the accuracy of the information in the record our only function is to decide if the secretary,on the face of things,had enough information before him to come to the conclusion that the organizations were foreign and engaged in terrorism.people mojahedin org.of iran dep t of state,pmoi i.
the petitioners challenge as a denial of due process the secretary use of classified information in designating them ftos.we need not resolve that claim,however,for in this case we can uphold the designations based solely upon the unclassified portion of the administrative record.see people mojahedin org.of iran dep t of state,pmoi ii id.at edwards,concurring.
redesignation of kahane chai as a fto 
the petitioners assert the secretary finding kahane chai threatened an assassination is based upon a faulty interpret
