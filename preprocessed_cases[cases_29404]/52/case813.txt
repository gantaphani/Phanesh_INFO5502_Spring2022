the republic of peru,two of its ministries,and two of its government officials collectively peru appeal the district court award of summary judgment to jose guevara on guevara claim that peru owed him million in reward money for information that lead to the arrest of peru former spy chief,vladimiro lenin montesinos torres montesinos.peru contends that the district court should have recognized its sovereign immunity and therefore dismissed guevara claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.luis alfredo percovich appeals the district court denial of his motion to intervene in the case after the court granted guevara motion for summary judgment but prior to its entry of final judgment for the purpose of claiming the award we agree with peru that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and therefore reverse its judgment and remand the case with the instruction that it be dismissed without prejudice.
this case facts read like the latest spy thriller.an earlier,and partial,recitation of the facts appears in this court opinion in guevara republic of peru,cir guevara i,which we recite in this subpart.in the,montesinos was the head of peru national intelligence agency.during that time,while discharging the duties of his office,he purportedly committed several trafficking,drug dealing,money laundering,extortion,bribery,and more than a few murders.id.at.the peruvian media obtained videotapes of his participation in some of these crimes,including bribery,and after the videotapes became public,president alberto fujimori announced in september that he would dissolve the intelligence agency and step down as president.montesinos,seeing the writing on the wall,fled the country,first into venezuela,then,it seemed,into thin air.
a manhunt ensued,and in april,peru interim president,valentin corazao,issued an emergency decree that provided for a million reward for the person or persons who provide s accurate information that will directly enable locating and capturing montesinos.id.at the decree established a committee,the special high level committee shlc,as part of the ministry of the interior to receive such information and assess its accuracy the decree authorized the peruvian government to obtain a loan from a peruvian bank to pay the reward,with the funds to be deposited in a peruvian account in the interim.the reward would be paid hours after montesinos capture 
it turned out that guevara,a venezuelan national,was providing montesinos with a hiding place and a security detail in caracas,venezuela.in addition,guevara was handling montesinos communications with pacific industrial bank in miami,florida,where montesinos maintained a bank account.when the bank declined his request to transfer his funds to another bank,montesinos emailed percovich,the officer assigned to the account,threatening him with physical harm unless the bank honored his request.montesinos then sent guevara to miami with instructions for percovich.percovich,aware that guevara was coming to miami,contacted the fbi in the meantime to inform them of montesinos threat and guevara involvement with montesinos,so when guevara arrived in miami in june,the fbi detained him and prepared to charge him with a criminal offense the fbi informed guevara that he would not be charged if he disclosed montesinos whereabouts.and,if montesinos was captured,guevara could claim the million reward peru had posted 
guevara cooperated he revealed montesinos location in caracas and arranged through some of his associates in caracas for montesinos to be delivered into the hands of venezuelan officials.they arrested montesinos and turned him over to the peruvian authorities.peru,however,refused to pay guevara the million reward.
guevara sued peru in florida state court,and peru removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of florida under d.guevara framed his complaint in five counts,as set out in the margin peru moved to dismiss the case pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,rendered it immune from suit.the district court granted peru motion on the ground that peru conduct did not fall under any of the enumerated exceptions to the fsia presumption of sovereign immunity.guevara then appealed the dismissal to this court.
we held that peru offer of a reward fell within the fsia commercial activity exception we reasoned that instead of using its own police and investigatory powers to search for montesinos,peru ventured into the marketplace to buy the information needed to get its man.guevara i,at quoting hond.aircraft registry,gov t of,cir.because sovereign states can engage in commercial activities by contracting with private parties,id.at,and because peru acted like a private party in entering the market for rewards,id.at,the fsia definition of commercial activity in d fully encompassed the reward,id.at.in turn,because a state private,commercial acts divest it of sovereign immunity under the restrictive theory,id.at,peru was not immune from suit under the fsia exception.we accordingly vacated the district court judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.
on remand,the district court issued a new scheduling order and the parties engaged in discovery.at the close of discovery,guevara moved the court for summary judgment on two counts of his complaint,those claiming breach of contract arguing that he was entitled to the reward because he had fulfilled the terms of peru offer.deposition and affidavit evidence submitted in support of guevara motion had provided new information about guevara role in montesinos capture.we now recount the facts that evidence established 
guevara was formerly an officer in the venezuelan intelligence agency,dirección nacional de los servicios de inteligencia y prevención national directorate of intelligence and prevention services disip on december,guevara received a telephone call from his second cousin asking him to receive a visitor at guevara residence in caracas.later that day,one julio ayala brought a man wearing facial bandages,whom ayala identified as manuel rodriguez,to guevara house.guevara later realized that the man going by the name manuel rodriguez was actually montesinos,who had undergone facial reconstructive surgery to conceal his identity.
guevara second cousin asked guevara to provide ongoing security for montesinos.guevara agreed and saw to it that montesinos was protected while he was in hiding in caracas for his part,montesinos used guevara as an intermediary to run personal errands and to arrange for the deposit of funds into montesinos accounts in banks.on june,guevara traveled to miami for montesinos to deliver an envelope to percovich at pacific industrial bank.the envelope contained a letter instructing percovich to give guevara cash from montesinos account at the bank,and to transfer million from that account to an account montesinos had opened at another bank guevara met percovich at the intercontinental hotel in miami on june and gave him the envelope.while guevara was leaving the intercontinental hotel,fbi agents arrested him after the agents took guevara into custody,they questioned him briefly at the hotel where he was staying,then moved him to the fbi office in miami.
the questioning resumed at the fbi office.the agents informed guevara of the million reward for information that would lead to montesinos capture.guevara decided to cooperate,in that he would give the agents montesinos location if the charges were dropped and he received the reward.at this point,agent waldo longa made a telephone call,then told guevara that if he gave the fbi montesinos address and telephone number in caracas,he would be released,the charges would be dropped,and he would receive the million reward.guevara agreed to do that,and under the supervision of fbi agents,he called jose luis nunez residence,where montesinos was hiding.guevara briefly spoke with montesinos and,as the fbi had instructed,told montesinos that percovich had received the envelope.the fbi transmitted this information to venezuelan authorities,who were cooperating with the peruvian authorities,and developed a plan for guevara associates in venezuela to deliver montesinos to the peruvian embassy in caracas on june 
on the evening of june,the fbi transferred guevara to the federal detention center in miami for overnight custody.the following morning,june,the fbi brought guevara back to its miami office,where he made more telephone calls to his venezuelan associates,including nunez,to coordinate montesinos handover to the peruvian embassy nunez assured guevara that montesinos would be handed over later that day,and guevara relayed this assurance to the fbi.
while guevara was in the fbi office that day,agent longa informed guevara that he had spoken by telephone with the fbi agent responsible for overseeing the fbi interests in peru,kevin currier and with antonio ketin vidal herrera vidal,peru minister of the interior during the call,vidal said that guevara would be eligible to receive the million reward if he gave the fbi montesinos location in caracas.several hours after this conversation,the fbi asked guevara to give final instructions to nunez on where to turn over montesinos guevara complied,and nunez agreed to the instructions.on june,longa told guevara that montesinos had been captured by venezuelan authorities in caracas the day before.on june,guevara was released from custody,and the charges against him were dismissed.
peru responded to guevara motion for summary judgment by arguing that based on the facts that had been developed on remand,the district court should dismiss the case on the ground that peru had not waived its sovereign immunity under a.in an order entered on september,the district court rejected the argument,concluding that guevara i had decided the sovereign immunity issue adversely to peru the court therefore proceeded to rule on the merits of guevara motion for summary judgment.the court held that the emergency decree had created a unilateral contract and that guevara had satisfied the performance the contract called for by providing information that led to montesinos capture.then,relying on an august,shlc resolution acknowledging that guevara had provided such information and that the shlc would evaluate his reward request,the court effectively preempted the shlc evaluation that,on the basis of the record before the court,the shlc was bound to honor guevara request and thus to give him the entire million reward.
on september,after the district court had granted guevara motion for summary judgment but before it entered final judgment in the case,percovich moved the court,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,to grant him intervention as of right as a,or alternatively,to stay further proceedings in the case.percovich claimed that he was responsible for causing guevara to cooperate with the fbi and to reveal montesinos whereabouts,and that but for his percovich cooperation,montesinos would not have been captured.as a result,percovich contended,he was entitled to at least a share of the reward,and his rights would go unprotected if he were denied an opportunity to prove his claim to the reward money.the district court denied percovich motion on december.on december,the district court entered final judgment in guevara favor for million plus pre and interest.percovich appeal and peru followed 
peru contends that the district court should have dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that it is entitled to sovereign immunity under a.assuming that we hold that it was not entitled to sovereign immunity,peru contends that the district court erred in granting guevara motion for summary judgment on the merits.percovich contends that the court abused its discretion in refusing to grant him intervention as of right.if peru is entitled to sovereign immunity,the case is due to be dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction,and we would be foreclosed from proceeding further.we therefore turn to the question of whether peru is entitled to sovereign immunity under a.
the district court concluded that,in guevara i,we already resolved this a issue.we disagree.we begin with the proposition that the fsia provides the sole basis for obtaining subject matter jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign in the united states,guevara i,at,and grants original jurisdiction over nonjury civil actions against foreign states,a the exercise of that jurisdiction is limited to the fsia exceptions to the general rule that foreign sovereigns enjoy immunity from suit in united states courts.see also id.a.section,general exceptions to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state,provides 
a a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states or of the states in any case 
in which the foreign state has waived its immunity either explicitly or by implication,notwithstanding any withdrawal of the waiver which the foreign state may purport to effect except in accordance with the terms of the waiver 
in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.
in guevara i,guevara appealed the district court decision that peru was entitled to sovereign immunity because its offer of a reward did not constitute a commercial activity.in reaching its decision,the district court bypassed the question of whether,assuming that the offer of a reward constituted a commercial activity,peru established that it had immunity under subsection a.in appealing the district court decision,guevara,in his opening brief,focused his argument for reversal solely on the commercial activity issue.peru,in its answering brief,did the same.its brief did not seek affirmance on the additional ground the district court had not reached whether it had immunity under subsection a.
guevara i thus resolved the issue guevara had peru offer of a reward was a commercial resolved it against peru.in doing so,the court left open,albeit implicitly,the question of whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to entertain guevara case.guevara i,at if the court finds that it does not have subject matter jurisdiction,the court sole remaining act is to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.quoting morrison allstate indem,cir.
in holding that guevara i resolved the sovereign immunity issue against peru,the district court was,in effect,invoking the law of the case doctrine.

piambino bailey,cir.
in light of the parties guevara i briefs on appeal and the court statement that the district court must dismiss the case if it does not have subject matter jurisdiction,we could hardly say that guevara i decided all of the sovereign immunity issues a presents.we therefore conclude that those the exception of whether the offer of a reward constituted a commercial activity remain for decision here.we now address them de novo.venus lines agency cvg industria venezolana de aluminio,cir per curiam.
section a lists three exclusive bases,or nexuses,for a foreign state commercial activities to subject it to the united states courts jurisdiction in cases based upon commercial activities within the united states,based upon acts performed in the united states in connection with commercial activity elsewhere,or based upon acts performed in connection with commercial activity elsewhere that cause a direct effect in the united states.see samco global arms,arita,cir.
the district court did not analyze whether peru activity fell under any of the three bases for jurisdiction in a because it apparently assumed that guevara i had performed the analysis.guevara i,however,merely held,as we observed above,that peru reward offer constituted commercial activity.it held nothing regarding the existence of subject matter jurisdiction,and,in fact,the opinion implicitly recognized the possibility that the district court could discover a lack of subject matter jurisdiction later in the case we now embark on the task the district court assumed guevara i had undertaken whether peru was subject to the district court jurisdiction under one or more of the three jurisdictional nexuses of a.in carrying out this task,we rely on the record before the district court when it entertained and granted guevara motion for summary judgment more to the point,we consider the evidence that bears on a three jurisdictional nexuses.
the evidence bearing on the first nexus,commercial activities within the united states,establishes that no such activities occurred in the united states.rather,the commercial activity in this case,described by guevara i as an offer of a reward for information enabling the capture of a fugitive,at,took place in peru first,the emergency decree,which created the offer,was published in an official publication in peru.second,the decree established the shlc to evaluate the veracity of information leading to montesinos arrest and decide whether to pay the reward.if the shlc decided to pay the reward,the payment would be made in peru from funds the peruvian government had placed in escrow in a peruvian bank.in short,all of the shlc commercial activity would take place in peru.although information leading to montesinos capture might be provided by someone in the united states,as it was here,the act of providing the information to the shlc would not be part of the commercial activity therefore,by offering the reward,peru was not waiving its sovereign immunity from suit in the united states by a person who may have provided information that led to montesinos capture.
next,the evidence bearing on the second nexus,acts committed by peru in the united states in connection with commercial activity elsewhere,established that on june,currier in chile placed a long distance telephone call to longa in miami and to vidal in peru.during the call,vidal told longa that guevara would receive the reward if he provided information that led to montesinos capture.the narrow question here is whether vidal act of communicating these words to longa in miami constituted an act performed in the united states in connection with peru offer of the reward in peru and,thus,was sufficient to waive peru sovereign immunity under the second nexus.
the shlc was a special committee of the ministry of the interior.vidal was the minister of the interior we thus assume that he had supervisory authority over the shlc.vidal statement to longa was a statement he would have made to anyone professing to have information that might lead to montesinos capture if you believe that your information has led to montesinos capture,you may submit it to the shlc.if the shlc determines that it is reliable,you will receive the reward.if similar information is submitted to the shlc by others and found reliable,they will share in the reward.
if what vidal said to longa constituted an act in connection with peru offer of the reward,then almost any statement he may have made about the reward to anyone else in the united states would have operated to waive peru immunity from suit.we are reluctant to find a waiver based on such de minimis evidence.
the federal courts application of exceptions to sovereign immunity supports our position.for example,section a provides that a foreign state shall not be immune in any case in which it has waived its immunity either explicitly or by implication.in creighton government of the state of qatar,the court stated that 
implicit in a is the requirement that the foreign state have intended to waive its sovereign immunity.see princz federal republic of germany.a n implied waiver depends upon the foreign government having at some point indicated its amenability to suit,islamic republic of iran,courts rarely find that a nation has waived its sovereign immunity without strong evidence that this is what the foreign state intended.
the offer of the reward was made in peru and was to be administered in peru by the shlc.we assume,for purposes of this case,that vidal,by virtue of his position as minister of the interior,had the authority to waive the state immunity that said,we are unwilling to hold that vidal intended to waive peru sovereign immunity via the solitary act of telling a person in the united states what he must do to obtain the reward.
lastly,the evidence bearing on the third nexus had to establish that peru actions in connection with commercial activity outside the united states caused a direct effect within the united states.to be direct,an effect must follow as an immediate consequence of the defendant activity.republic of arg.weltover,quotation and ellipses omitted.as we have framed it,the question presented is,was the effect sufficiently direct and sufficiently in the united states that congress would have wanted an american court to hear the case harris iranian radio television,cir quoting.trading milling fed.republic of,cir.
in harris,an american manufacturer of fm transmitters harris corporation sued to enjoin payment on a letter of credit that an iranian state bank extended to harris corporation as part of a performance guarantee in favor of an iranian broadcaster.harris corporation contended that the letter of credit and associated performance guarantee had been terminated by force,the iranian revolution.the guarantee was an integral part of the contract between harris corporation and the iranian broadcaster,and was backed by a standby guarantee that required harris corporation to indemnify continental bank,which would reimburse the iranian bank if the latter had to pay on the first letter of credit.harris corporation sought to enjoin the iranian bank receiving payment from continental bank because in the injunction absence,harris corporation would have been obligated to indemnify continental bank to the extent it reimbursed the iranian bank payment on the original letter of credit.the district court granted the injunction,and,on appeal,the iranian bank argued that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia.in rejecting that argument,this court held that the letter of credit arrangement extend ed into this country,and the appellants demands thus ha d significant financial consequences here,establishing a direct effect for purposes of a.harris,at.
here,guevara presents two ways in which direct effects in the united states flowed from peru promise to pay the reward in peru,neither of which we find persuasive.first,he argues that he accepted the reward offer while in custody in miami,creating a direct effect in the united states.the record,however,indicates that the extent of guevara activity was the alleged,telephone communication between vidal,currier,and longa.in the context of personal jurisdiction,however,we have rejected the argument that one telephone call is sufficient to create minimum contacts with the forum state,see future tech.today,osf healthcare,cir sculptchair,century arts,cir rejecting,as a basis for jurisdiction under florida statute,a series of telephone conversations and a meeting between the canadian defendant and the plaintiff florida office,and we find the same reasoning applicable here.at oral argument,moreover,counsel for guevara conceded that the primary activity for purposes of a analysis was really peru failure to make the reward payment within the united sort of negative activity.we are unaware of any federal court holding that such negative activity satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of a,and we decline to reach that holding here.
second,guevara argues that his arrest in the united states constituted a direct effect in the united states of shlc commercial activity in peru.the fbi arrested guevara because he was participating in the execution of montesinos threats of physical harm to percovich if percovich did not handle montesinos bank deposits as instructed.guevara arrest was an immediate consequence of his criminal activity,not of peru offer of a reward for montesinos capture.only after guevara was arrested and agreed to cooperate with investigators did the availability of reward money come into play 
neither of guevara arguments for a direct effect in the united states reflects weltover requirement of immediate consequences or harris focus on significant financial consequences in the united states.therefore,we can not conclude that a direct effect occurred in the united states as a result of peru promise to pay the reward money.
guevara i did not resolve in full the jurisdictional issues presented by a.accordingly,the district court should have determined whether peru was subject to the court subject matter jurisdiction because peru failed to establish that its commercial activity fell under one of the a nexuses for jurisdiction.the court failed to do so.this left us with two possible dispositions remand the case to the district court with the instruction that it resolve the a issues,or resolve those issues on appeal because the appropriate disposition is clear.we have chosen the latter course.we reverse the district court judgment and remand the case with the instruction that the case be dismissed without prejudice.
so ordered.
cox,circuit judge,dissenting 
the majority opinion rests on a faulty premise that,in deciding the prior appeal in this case,this court did not decide whether peru is entitled to sovereign immunity.the court holds that guevara i decided only the question of whether peru offer of the reward constituted commercial activity.but that is incorrect.guevara i held that fsia commercial activity exception applies to exempt peru from the general immunity granted by the statute to foreign sovereigns.at this appeal presents the issue of whether a foreign state offer of a reward in return for information enabling it to locate and capture a fugitive falls within the foreign sovereign immunities act commercial activity exception to sovereign immunity.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that it does.id.at the question in this appeal is whether guevara can use the courts of this country to compel peru to keep its contractual promise to pay him the money it offered.
the commercial activity exception states 
a a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states or of the states in any case 
in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.
a.in deciding that the statutory exception applies to peru actions,the guevara i court decided more than that peru had engaged in commercial activity the court necessarily decided that a nexus existed between that commercial activity and the united states.it implicitly held that the commercial activity was carried on in the united states,that an act was performed in the united states in connection with commercial activity elsewhere,or that a direct effect of the commercial act was caused in the united states.
most importantly,the guevara i court explicitly decided that there was no immunity available to peru under the fsia.in explaining that the individual defendants were not entitled to sovereign immunity because any such immunity would be derivative of the sovereign state immunity,the opinion says 
there is no present need to review the district court conclusion that the individual defendants were acting within the scope of their authority.even if they were,they are not entitled to sovereign immunity because the sovereign itself is not.
guevara i,at emphasis added.
guevara i did not implicitly leave open the question of subject matter jurisdiction,remanding the case for the district court to decide that question.in claiming that it did,the majority opinion takes a statement in the guevara i opinion out of context.guevara i reversed the district court dismissal of the case on subject matter jurisdiction grounds and remanded the case with the sole instruction that personal jurisdiction over the individual defendants could be examined by the district court.id.at.in explaining what the district court had already done and why the district court had not considered the personal jurisdiction arguments of the individual defendants,the guevara i opinion said,if the court finds that it does not have subject matter jurisdiction,the court sole remaining act is to dismiss the case for lack or jurisdiction.id.at citations omitted contrary to the majority opinion assertion,the quoted statement is not an indication to the district court that,on remand,it should reconsider subject matter jurisdiction.
guevara i holding that the commercial activity exception to sovereign immunity applies to peru activities is a holding that subject matter jurisdiction exists over this case pursuant to the fsia.that is the law of this case,notwithstanding the fact that the guevara i opinion did not explicitly address the nexus between peru commercial activities and the united states.see eeoc int l longshoremen ass n,cir noting that the law of the case doctrine applies to things decided by necessary implication as well as those decided explicitly.quotation and citation omitted bonner city of pritchard,cir en banc adopting as precedent decisions of the former fifth circuit handed down prior to the close of business on september.the district court did not err in so finding,and this panel can not properly revisit the question.see free abbott,cir joining other circuits in refusing to recognize a jurisdiction exception to the doctrine explaining that although a federal court must examine each case to determine whether it has jurisdiction,this does not require perpetual of precisely the same issue of subject matter jurisdiction see also mckesson islamic republic of iran,applying the doctrine to a prior appeals panel ruling concerning the existence of subject matter jurisdiction hanna boys center miller,cir same.
although i disagree with the majority conclusion that the fsia bars guevara suit,i have reservations about the propriety of resolving this dispute in the courts of this country.dismissal pursuant to the discretionary doctrine of international comity,rather than dismissal for want of jurisdiction,may be the appropriate way to dispose of this case the peruvian government created the reward and the special high level committee charged with administering the reward.after considering guevara claim to the reward,the committee rejected his claim.i suspect it would violate international comity for united states courts to review that decision.
