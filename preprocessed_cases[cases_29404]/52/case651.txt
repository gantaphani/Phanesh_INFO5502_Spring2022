claude cassirer cassirer filed this action in federal district court against the kingdom of spain spain and the collection foundation the foundation to recover a camille pissarro painting now on display at the foundation museum in madrid,spain.cassirer alleges that the painting was taken from his grandmother in violation of international law in by an agent of the government of nazi germany.on appeal,appellants challenge the district court denial of their respective motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,standing,a justiciable case or controversy,and subject matter jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity.
we dismiss this appeal with regard to appellants challenges to personal jurisdiction,standing,and the existence of a justiciable case or controversy.we lack appellate jurisdiction because there has been no final judgment and these issues are not immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.
however,under the collateral order doctrine,we have jurisdiction to consider the issue of sovereign immunity.gupta thai airways int l,cir.we consider for the first time whether the expropriation exception of the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,a,applies when the foreign state against whom a claim is made is not the entity that expropriated the property in violation of international law.we hold that it does.we also hold that advertising and promotional activity,purchase and sale of goods and services,and the exchange of artwork with persons and entities,all within the united states,are sufficient to constitute commercial activity in the united states under a.finally,based on guidance in our recent decision in sarei rio tinto,plc,cir en banc plurality opinion,we remand to the district court to determine,in the first instance,whether the circumstances of this case warrant judicial imposition of an exhaustion requirement.
background.
for the purposes of this appeal,we take the factual allegations in this case as true at the heart of the present dispute is the rue,effet de pluie the painting,an oil painting by the french impressionist master camille pissarro.the painting was originally purchased in by cassirer,julius cassirer,a member of a wealthy jewish family living in germany.the painting remained in the family for the next forty years.first passing upon julius death to his son,fritz,and later to fritz widow,lilly cassirer.
in,as persecution of jews living in nazi germany increased,lilly and her new husband sought official permission to leave germany and take their possessions,which included the painting.before granting permission,the nazi government appointed munich art dealer jakob scheidwimmer as the official appraiser to evaluate the works of art that lilly wished to take with her.after his appraisal,scheidwimmer refused to allow lilly to take the painting out of germany and demanded that she sell it to him for approximately.because she feared she would not be allowed to leave germany,she relinquished the painting,knowing that she would never receive the funds she was promised 
scheidwimmer traded the painting to another art dealer who,also persecuted by the nazis,fled germany and took the painting to holland.after germany invaded holland,the gestapo confiscated the painting and returned it to germany,where it was sold at auction to an anonymous purchaser in.the painting surfaced at a new york gallery in and was then sold to a private collector in louis.it was sold again in to an unknown dealer,who subsequently sold it to baron the baron,a resident of switzerland and one of the world foremost private art collectors.
in,spain paid the baron million to lease his collection for ten years.five years into the lease,spain paid the foundation approximately million to purchase the baron entire collection,including the painting.under the terms of the purchase,spain provided the foundation a palace in madrid,free of charge,for use as the museum the museum.in addition,the purchase agreement requires that the collection be exhibited at the museum in spain and sets limits regarding loans to other art institutions.if the collection is not used in accordance with the purchase agreement or if the foundation ceases to exist,spain will become the owner of the collection 
in,claude cassirer the grandson and heir of lilly cassirer,discovered that the painting was on display in madrid at the museum.he petitioned spain minister for education,culture and sports who was also chair of the foundation board,requesting the return of the painting.his request was denied.in july,five united states congressmen wrote to the minister,again requesting that appellants return the painting to cassirer.the request was again denied.cassirer never attempted to obtain the painting through judicial proceedings in spain.
on may,cassirer filed suit against the foundation and spain in the central district of california.on february,the foundation filed a motion to dismiss,contending that the district court lacked subject matter and personal jurisdiction and that venue did not lie in the central district of california.while the foundation motion was pending,cassirer moved the court for leave to conduct jurisdictional discovery.
on april,the district court reviewed,as a question of law,whether the expropriation exception to sovereign immunity in a of the fsia applied to a sovereign entity that was not alleged to have taken property in violation of international law.after receiving further briefing from the parties,the district court ruled that a requires only that property was seized in violation of international law,not that the foreign sovereign itself violated international law.the district court also granted sixty days to conduct discovery for the purpose of determining whether the foundation conducted commercial activity in the united states within the meaning of the fsia.
on june,spain filed its own motion to dismiss,contending lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to sovereign immunity and various other grounds.on august,after hearing argument,the district court issued a memorandum and order denying both the motions to dismiss.the district court held that cassirer presented a case or controversy against both the foundation and spain cassirer was not required to exhaust judicial remedies a of the fsia applies to the foundation and spain,despite cassirer admission that neither took the painting in violation of international law affirming its earlier decision on this point the foundation and spain engage in commercial activity in the united states within the meaning of a,such that they are not entitled to sovereign immunity under the language of the fsia,personal jurisdiction exists over the foundation and spain by virtue of the fact that subject matter jurisdiction existed and venue is proper in the central district of california.see cassirer kingdom of spain,d.
the appellants brought this timely interlocutory appeal.cassirer subsequently filed a motion to dismiss,contending that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over any issues other than whether the appellants are entitled to sovereign immunity.
ii.jurisdiction.
we first address the issue of appellate jurisdiction raised by cassirer.we have jurisdiction to review final decisions of the district court.final decisions end the litigation on the merits and leave nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.am.states ins.dastar,cir internal quotations and alterations omitted.typically,a district court denial of a motion to dismiss is not final for purposes of.see marx government of guam,cir.under the collateral order doctrine,we may nonetheless review that small category of decisions that are conclusive because they resolve important questions separate from the merits,and that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.swint chambers county comm n,d citation omitted.
t he denial of a claim of lack of personal jurisdiction is not an immediately appealable collateral order.van cauwenberghe biard,d batzel smith,cir orders denying motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction are not final and are not appealable under the collateral order doctrine.therefore,we do not have jurisdiction to review the district court denial of appellants motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,and we dismiss this appeal with regard to that issue.
likewise,we dismiss the appeal with regard to the issues of standing and article iii case or controversy.the district court order denying appellants motion to dismiss on these issues is fully reviewable on appeal from a final judgment.therefore,we hold that such a denial is not immediately appealable as a collateral order see swint,at.to be immediately appealable under collateral order doctrine,decision must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action 
we have jurisdiction to review the district court order as it pertains to sovereign immunity.a n order denying immunity under the fsia is appealable under the collateral order doctrine,because sovereign immunity is immunity from suit,which is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.gupta,at.
iii.sovereign immunity under the fsia.
the primary issue before us is whether appellants are entitled to sovereign immunity under the fsia,such that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.the existence of subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia is a question of law reviewed de novo.adler fed.republic of nigeria,cir.a district court factual findings on jurisdictional issues are reviewed for clear error.id.
a.the fsia provides limited exceptions to sovereign immunity.
the district court has original jurisdiction of any civil action against a foreign state,including its agencies and instrumentalities see a.under the fsia,however,foreign states are immune from the jurisdiction of united states courts,subject only to the specific exceptions in,and specified existing international agreements.see id.at thus,the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court is the existence of an exception to the fsia.argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d.the fsia exceptions include waiver of immunity,a,commercial activities occurring in the united states or causing a direct effect in this country,a,property expropriated in violation of international law,a,inherited,gift,or immovable property located in the united states,a,torts occurring in the united states,a,and maritime liens,b.id.
b.the expropriation exception.
cassirer contends that neither the foundation nor spain is entitled to sovereign immunity due to the expropriation exception of a section a provides that a foreign state shall not be immune in any case in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue the issue regarding the applicability of this exception arises because the statute uses the passive voice and does not expressly require that the foreign state against whom the claim is made be the entity that took the property in violation of international law.appellants invite us to read such a requirement into the statute.the parties agree that germany,and not spain,allegedly took the painting in violation of international law.therefore,under the construction urged by appellants,the expropriation exception could not apply.we disagree.
we find a to be unambiguous.where the intent of congress is clear and unambiguously expressed by the statutory language,that is normally the end of the statutory analysis.zuni pub.sch.dist.dep t of,d.we hold that the plain language of a does not require that the foreign state against whom the claim is made be the entity who expropriated the property in violation of international law.
our holding is consistent with the legislative history in reviewing congress intent in enacting the fsia,we consider,which sets forth congress findings and purpose.this section expresses congress understanding that foreign states are not immune from suit insofar as their commercial activities are concerned.in explaining,the house report states that congress is adopting the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity,that is,t he sovereign immunity of foreign states should be restricted to cases involving acts of a foreign state which are sovereign or governmental in nature,as opposed to acts which are either commercial in nature or those which private persons normally perform,at,reprinted in.
consistent with the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity described in and the house report,the exceptions in a apply to situations in which foreign states act more like private persons or are engaged in commercial activities.the plain language of a is entirely consistent with congress intent,because a gives a court jurisdiction over a foreign state in cases involving stolen property only if the foreign state or its agency is engaged in a commercial activity in the united states.
citing in re republic of philippines,cir,appellants argue that a applies only when the foreign state against whom the claim is leveled actually took property in violation of international law.republic of philippines required us to interpret the exception in a,which provides that a foreign state loses its immunity in any case in which rights in property in the united states acquired by succession or gift or rights in immovable property situated in the united states are in issue.we construed the statute as applying only to rights in property in the united states acquired by succession or gift by the foreign state.in reaching this conclusion,we relied on language in the house report which stated 
there is general agreement that a foreign state may not claim immunity when the suit against it relates to rights in property,real or personal,obtained by gift or inherited by the foreign state and situated or administered in the country where the suit is brought the reason is that,in claiming rights in a decedent estate or obtained by gift,the foreign state claims the same right which is enjoyed by private persons.
republic of philippines,at quoting.emphasis added.in other words,to effectuate congress intent to grant courts jurisdiction over foreign states only when they act more like private persons,we read by the foreign state into a.under this reading,courts gain jurisdiction over a foreign state only if the state acted like a private person and by claiming rights in a decedent estate or obtaining a gift.contrary to appellant argument,our interpretation of a in republic of philippines is entirely consistent with a plain language reading of a.it is not necessary to read by the foreign state into a to achieve consistency with the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity.the plain language of a already grants courts jurisdiction over foreign states only if they act like a private person by engaging in commercial activities.republic of philippines therefore provides no justification to depart from the plain language of a.
because nothing in the plain language of the fsia or the legislative history requires us to read additional language into the statute,we hold that the expropriation exception to sovereign immunity found in a does not require that the foreign state against whom the claim is made be the foreign state that took property in violation of international law.
commercial activity in the united states.
for the expropriation exception to apply,the fsia also requires that property or any property exchanged for such property is owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and that agency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial activity in the united states.a.the foundation admits that it is an agency or instrumentality of spain and that it owns the painting.we agree with the district court that the foundation has engaged in sufficient commercial activity in the united states to satisfy a.
as defined in the fsia,commercial activity 
means either a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act.the commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act,rather than by reference to its purpose.
d.the central question is whether the activity is of a kind in which a private party might engage.siderman de blake republic of argentina,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in siderman,we concluded that argentina conducted commercial activity in the united states,because it advertised an expropriated hotel in the united states it solicited guests through its united states agent argentina national airline numerous americans stayed at the hotel and the hotel accepted all major american credit cards.id.at.
likewise,in altmann,we concluded that authoring,promoting,and distributing books and other publications in the united states to exploit expropriated paintings were sufficient to constitute commercial activity for the purpose of satisfying the fsia.altmann,at.
in this case,after allowing limited jurisdictional discovery,the district court found that the foundation engaged in commercial transactions in the united states,including transacting business as a purchaser and a seller of goods and services and as an advertiser in distributing marketing and other commercial promotional materials.cassirer kingdom of spain,d.for example,the foundation made numerous purchases of books,posters,post cards,and related materials from united states businesses in new york,california,and washington.the foundation also purchased books about nazi expropriation of great works of and a book presumably about the works of pissarro.id.at.the foundation sold posters and books to united states residents and businesses,and licensed the reproduction of images to various united states businesses.id.the foundation also admitted that it worked with entities to secure goods to be sold in the museum gift shop,including paying citizens to write for its exhibit catalogs.id.further,it admitted that it has shipped gift shop items to purchasers in the united states.id.notably,the foundation sold a poster of the painting at issue in this case to individuals in both california and north carolina.the california purchaser resides in the central district of california and used her american express credit card to consummate the transaction.id.
the foundation also solicited,recruited,and commissioned writers and speakers from the united states to provide services at the museum.id.the foundation facilitated the production of a film on the foundation collection,featuring the painting,which it knew would be presented on iberia airlines flights to and from the united states.id.at.
the foundation placed advertisements in magazines that are distributed in the united states and sent press releases,brochures,and general information to tourespaña and the spanish national tourist offices in the united states.for example,the foundation advertised in news publications such as newsweek,time magazine,and the new yorker.id.it also distributes its museum bulletin,perspectives,to individuals in the united states,including two in the central district of california.id.
the foundation also contracted with museums in the united states to loan its artwork to the institutions or to borrow artwork for display in the foundation museum in spain.id.at.
the record supports the district court factual findings,which are not clearly erroneous.cassirer has produced numerous examples of the foundation commercial activity in the united states that are of a kind in which a private party might engage.siderman,at internal quotation marks omitted.much of that activity was connected with the painting.thus,cassirer has adequately demonstrated that the foundation has engaged in sufficient commercial activity in the united states to satisfy a.
iv.exhaustion of remedies.
cassirer unsuccessfully petitioned the foundation for return of the painting,but cassirer has not alleged that he made recourse to the spanish or german judiciaries to settle his claim to the painting thus,spain argues that a can not apply,because cassirer has not exhausted judicial remedies in the foreign forum.the district court held that the plain language of a of the fsia contains no requirement and therefore the court refused to impose such a requirement on cassirer.cassirer,d at.whether the fsia,specifically a,requires exhaustion is a matter of statutory interpretation and an issue of first impression.
of paramount importance to any exhaustion inquiry is congressional intent.mccarthy madigan,d citing patsy board of regents of florida,d internal quotation marks omitted,superceded by statute as stated in booth churner,d where congress specifically mandates,exhaustion is required.id.citing coit independence joint venture fslic,d patsy,at.but where congress has not clearly required exhaustion,sound judicial discretion governs.mccarthy,at.citing mcgee united states,d.to discern the intent of congress,w e look first to the plain language of the statute,construing the provisions of the entire law,including its object and policy.united states in currency,cir quoting carson harbor,unocal,cir.
as the district court noted,the fsia is silent as to any exhaustion requirement.the legislative history is also devoid of any enlightening reference to exhaustion accordingly,we hold that congress has not clearly required exhaustion for claims brought under the fsia.this,however,does not end our analysis.
to determine whether an action brought against a foreign state invoking an exception to the fsia requires exhaustion,it is important to put into context what the fsia is and what it is not.the fsia is not a source of substantive law and does not create any causes of actions.rather,it is a jurisdictional statute incorporating international law principles to guide courts in determining when a foreign state is or is not entitled to sovereign immunity.see.in other words,claims brought in courts,against foreign states,for violations of international law depend on the applicability of an exception to the fsia for jurisdiction.such claims,however,depend on the law of nations to define the substantive rights embodied in any cause of action.the supreme court has similarly recognized the alien tort statute ats,to be a jurisdictional statute that creates no new causes of action and relies on the common law and the law of nations to define substantive rights.see sosa,d t he ats is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action 
the doctrine of exhaustion of domestic remedies is a rule of customary international law.see sarei,at quoting interhandel case switz.this rule generally provides that a state is not required to consider a claim,made by a person against a foreign state,and alleging a violation of international law until that person has exhausted domestic remedies,unless such remedies are clearly sham or inadequate,or their application is unreasonably prolonged.see sarei,at citing restatement third of foreign relations law cmt.f cmt.d.because united states courts import principles of international law to define substantive rights in cases brought under the fsia,there are logical arguments suggesting that courts should also import the limitations to such causes of action,including the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies.sarei,at bea,concurring discussing exhaustion in the context of the ats sarei,at bybee,dissenting same.nonetheless,where congress has not clearly required exhaustion,we have not and likely can not impose exhaustion as an absolute jurisdictional requirement.see sarei,at w e decline to impose an absolute requirement of exhaustion in ats cases.see also sampson federal republic of germany,cir a lthough international law is part of our law,it does not follow that federal statutes must be read to reflect the norms of international law.citation omitted.
the jurisdiction of federal courts derives from and is circumscribed exclusively by article iii of the united states constitution and by federal statutes enacted by congress.see karcher may,d the power of federal courts to hear and decide cases is defined by article iii of the constitution and by the federal statutes enacted thereunder.sheldon sill,how.congress,having the power to establish the courts,must define their respective jurisdictions courts created by statute can have no jurisdiction but such as the statute confers.in the domestic context,we have acknowledged that statutory exhaustion requirements are jurisdictional in nature.see sarei,at gathering cases where congress requires exhaustion,a failure to exhaust available remedies typically deprives the federal court of jurisdiction.such is not necessarily the case,however,when international norms,and not congress,purport to circumscribe jurisdiction by requiring exhaustion of remedies.international law may define the substantive rights of parties in actions permitted by the fsia,but it can not compel or restrict article iii jurisdiction.sampson,at i nternational law itself does not mandate article iii jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns.absent clear congressional intent,we can not incorporate exhaustion as an absolute requirement merely because international law would require it.an absolute exhaustion requirement amounts to an absolute limitation on the jurisdiction of federal courts.to impose such a requirement would,in essence,usurp the constitutional power vested in congress and cede foreign lawmakers and jurists with power to limit the jurisdiction of united states federal courts.
neither congress nor this court have imposed an absolute exhaustion of remedies requirement in cases brought against foreign states under an exception to the fsia.yet,where principles of international comity and rules of customary international law require exhaustion,we exercise sound judicial discretion and consider exhaustion on a prudential,basis.see sarei,at.in sarei,we held that domestic prudential standards and core principles of international law require a district court to consider exhaustion in appropriate cases.id.at citing sosa,at.under our prudential approach,when a defendant affirmatively pleads failure to exhaust remedies,the district court must,as a discretionary matter,determine in the first instance whether to impose such a requirement on a plaintiff.id.at.
although sarei addressed exhaustion in the context of the ats,where congress has not clearly adopted or rejected exhaustion as a jurisdictional prerequisite,our formulation of prudential exhaustion applies equally to cases brought against foreign states and their instrumentalities under the fsia in this case,appellants have asserted that cassirer failed to exhaust available remedies in spain or germany.although the district court correctly concluded that the fsia does not require exhaustion of remedies,the court erred by failing to conduct a prudential exhaustion analysis 
on remand,the district court should be guided by the principles we outlined in sarei.summarizing the sarei framework generally,we first note that the district court need only consider exhaustion to the extent the defendant has affirmatively pleaded cassirer failure to exhaust local remedies.see sarei,at the defendant bears the burden to plead and justify an exhaustion requirement,including the availability of local remedies.citation omitted.second,the court must consider whether congress has clearly required exhaustion for the specific claims asserted in the complaint.if,as in this case,congress has not imposed or rejected such a requirement,the court must then determine whether the applicable substantive law would require exhaustion third,the court must consider whether the defendant has met its burden to show the availability of local remedies and that such remedies have not been exhausted.id.the plaintiff may rebut a showing of unexhausted remedies abroad by demonstrating the futility of exhaustion by showing that the local remedies were ineffective,unobtainable,unduly prolonged,inadequate,or obviously futile.id.citations omitted.finally,the court may,in its sound discretion,impose or waive exhaustion after assessing the availability,effectiveness,and possible futility of any unexhausted remedies in light of various prudential factors,including but not limited to the need to safeguard and respect the principles of international comity and sovereignty,the existence or lack of a significant united states nexus,the nature of the allegations and the gravity of the potential violations of international law,and whether the allegations implicate matters of universal concern for which a state has jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims without regard to territoriality or the nationality of the parties.see id.at.
conclusion.
we dismiss this appeal with regard to the issues of personal jurisdiction,standing,and article iii case or controversy.we affirm the district court with regard to its statutory interpretation of a.we likewise affirm the district court conclusion that the foundation engaged in sufficient commercial activity within the united states to satisfy the requirements of a.we reverse the district court,however,with regard to exhaustion of remedies and we remand for the limited purpose to determine in the first instance whether to impose an exhaustion requirement on cassirer.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.
each party shall bear its own cost.
i concur in sections i,ii and iii.i disagree with section iv,however,because in my view we should not take it upon ourselves to write an exhaustion requirement into the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia when congress has chosen not to.in enacting the fsia,congress created uniform and clear standards for litigants seeking to bring lawsuits against foreign sovereigns,and there is no indication that congress contemplated that courts would impose an additional exhaustion requirement on litigants.moreover,our case law on prudential exhaustion in the context of the alien tort statute ats is both inapposite and.because imposing a exhaustion requirement here is contrary to congressional intent and does nothing more than create a trap for the unwary,i respectfully dissent.
as always,we begin with the plain language of the statute.prince jacoby,cir.as the majority acknowledges,the fsia does not include an exhaustion requirement.op.at.
nor is there any evidence that congress intended to require plaintiffs to exhaust their remedies in a foreign nation before bringing suit under the fsia.to the contrary,as explained below,the history of the fsia indicates that congress intended to create a comprehensive scheme governing lawsuits in federal courts against a foreign sovereign that would establish once and for all a plaintiff rights,thereby eliminating inconsistency and uncertainty.
before the enactment of the fsia,federal courts deferred to the decisions of the political particular,those of the executive whether to take jurisdiction over actions against foreign sovereigns and their instrumentalities.verlinden cent.bank of,d citing the schooner exchange,cranch.before,the executive branch generally asked federal courts to recognize the sovereign immunity of friendly sovereigns in all lawsuits.id.in,however,the state department changed course,and announced that the executive branch had adopted the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity under which the executive branch would request courts to recognize sovereign immunity only in suits involving the foreign sovereign public acts,and not in cases arising out of a foreign state strictly commercial acts.id.at.
judicial application of the restrictive theory proved troublesome however.id.foreign sovereigns often put diplomatic pressure on the state department to recommend that courts recognize sovereign immunity in cases not fitting the restrictive theory,and the executive branch involvement in judicial immunity determinations proved inconsistent.id.these problems resulted in a lack of uniform,predictable standards regarding when federal courts would exercise jurisdiction in lawsuits against foreign sovereigns.see id.at.see also republic of austria altmann,d.
seeking to remedy these problems,congress passed the fsia in.id.at.the statute purpose was to free the government from the diplomatic pressures,to clarify the governing standards,and to assure litigants that decisions are made on purely legal grounds and under procedures that insure due process.verlinden,at.internal quotation marks omitted citing,at,reprinted in.
the fsia codif ied,as a matter of federal law,the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity,and created a comprehensive set of legal standards governing claims of immunity in every civil action against a foreign state or its political subdivisions,agencies,or instrumentalities.id.section of the fsia added a to title,thereby conferring on federal courts subject matter jurisdiction as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either under sections of this title or under any applicable international agreement.a section provides foreign sovereigns with a presumption of immunity and and a work in tandem bars federal and state courts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state is entitled to immunity,and a confers jurisdiction on district courts to hear suits brought by united states citizens and by aliens when a foreign state is not entitled to immunity by operation of an exception in to.argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d.the exceptions to immunity in to including actions based on specified commercial activities,rights in personal and real property under certain conditions,and enforcement of certain agreements,among others generally require some form of substantial contact with the united states.verlinden,at.citing.
if a foreign state is not entitled to sovereign immunity under the fsia,it is treated like any other private individual litigant with the exception that punitive damages are unavailable because the state is acting as a private party rather than a sovereign exercising power over its own citizens.see republic of arg.weltover,d a foreign state engaging in commercial activities does not exercise powers peculiar to sovereigns rather,it exercises only those powers that can also be exercised by private citizens.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted see also permanent mission of india to the city of new york,d holding that a foreign sovereign is not immune from an action for declaratory relief regarding tax liens on the sovereign real property,and stating that property ownership is not an inherently sovereign function weltover,at.holding that sovereign immunity does not apply when a foreign government acts,not as a regulator of a market,but in the manner of a private player within that market.
the fsia governs the types of actions for which foreign sovereigns may be held liable in a court in the united states,verlinden,at,but it does not focus on international law claims.rather,it merely opens united states courts to plaintiffs with claims against foreign states.altmann,at.see also id.at.scalia,concurring noting that plaintiff claims were based primarily in california law and explaining that the fsia affects substantive rights only accidentally,and not as a necessary and intended consequence of the law.the fsia treats claims arising under international law the same as claims arising under federal or state law,granting federal courts jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns in circumstances that meet the requirements of to,while granting immunity in those cases involving alleged violations of international law that do not come within one of the fsia exceptions.amerada hess,at.holding that federal courts lacked jurisdiction over a liberian corporation suit against argentina for damage to an oil tanker during war between great britain and argentina,because the fsia was the sole source of jurisdiction over a foreign state,and it did not authorize jurisdiction in that case see also saudi arabia nelson,d holding district court lacked jurisdiction over claims against saudi arabia for wrongful arrest,imprisonment,and torture because the conduct boils down to abuse of the power of its police by the saudi government,and however monstrous such abuse undoubtedly may be,a foreign state exercise of the power of its police has long been understood for purposes of the restrictive theory as peculiarly sovereign in nature.
in short,the fsia established clear and comprehensive standards regarding the limited situations in which congress deemed it appropriate to allow plaintiffs to sue foreign sovereigns in federal courts.plaintiffs may bring such suits only in cases having a substantial connection to the united states and involving claims relating to a sovereign private or commercial activities.the purpose of this comprehensive framework was to rectify the inconsistency and lack of uniformity that had previously beleaguered litigants.the supreme court has emphasized the importance of developing a uniform body of law in this area,and that the fsia standards control in the courts of the united states and of the states.verlinden,at.internal quotation marks omitted 
given congress intent to establish a uniform and consistent framework for jurisdiction over and litigation involving foreign sovereigns,and given that congress chose not to include an exhaustion requirement in the fsia,there appears to be little room for federal courts to impose a new,requirement on top of the statutory requirements already in the fsia itself.f ederal courts are vested with a virtually unflagging obligation to exercise the jurisdiction given them,mccarthy madigan,d internal quotation marks omitted,and courts have no authority to devise an additional exhaustion requirement when a statute clearly sets out the prerequisites for federal jurisdiction,see darby cisneros,d.
in imposing a exhaustion requirement on litigants in the fsia context,the majority relies primarily on cases addressing exhaustion of administrative remedies.op.at citing mccarthy,at.coit independence joint venture fslic,d patsy bd.of regents of,d mcgee united states,d.because the reasoning in these cases is based on considerations of separation of powers,administrative efficiency and expertise,and other concerns,they provide little assistance in determining whether an exhaustion requirement should be imposed in the fsia context.see,mccarthy,at.t he exhaustion doctrine recognizes the notion,grounded in deference to congress s delegation of authority to coordinate branches of government,that agencies,not the courts,ought to have primary responsibility for the programs that congress has charged them to administer.accord mcgee,at.noting that the task for courts in deciding the applicability of the administrative exhaustion requirement is whether allowing all similarly situated registrants to bypass the administrative avenue in question would seriously impair the agency ability to perform its functions internal quotation marks and modifications omitted.
to the extent it is appropriate to look to these cases for guidance,they do not support the majority conclusion.rather,they counsel exercising caution and considering carefully whether an exhaustion requirement is consistent with congressional intent.in both mccarthy and patsy,the supreme court looked first for an indication that congress intended to impose exhaustion requirements upon plaintiffs.see mccarthy,at.a ppropriate deference to congress s power to prescribe the basic procedural scheme under which a claim may be heard in a federal court requires fashioning of exhaustion principles in a manner consistent with congressional intent and any applicable statutory scheme.patsy,at.t he initial question whether exhaustion is required should be answered by reference to congressional intent and a court should not defer the exercise of jurisdiction under a federal statute unless it is consistent with that intent.the court has rarely discerned such an intent,and indeed has in general declined to require claimants to exhaust administrative remedies when it is not required by statute.see,darby,at.holding that courts may not impose a prudential exhaustion requirement on litigants under the administrative procedure act when neither the statute nor agency rules specifically mandate exhaustion as a prerequisite to judicial review.mccarthy,at.holding that a prisoner was not required to exhaust the bureau of prisons administrative procedure before making a bivens claim for money damages coit,at.holding that creditors were not required to exhaust the federal home loan bank board administrative claims procedure before bringing suit against a federal bank patsy,at.holding that a plaintiff claiming discriminatory treatment was not required to exhaust state administrative remedie
