c whether the continued application of the antidumping order is otherwise necessary to offset dumping.
b i.thus,after the fifth and sixth de minimis determinations,icdas needed only one more consecutive de minimis margin to be eligible for revocation of the antidumping order.
in its complaint in the court of international trade,gerdau alleged that the sixth review significantly understated icdas dumping margin,due to three errors by commerce first,the decision to collapse data for icdas and its affiliate demir sanayi into a single producing entity second,the determination that demir sanayi steel rolling services are not a major input and third,the decision to treat icdas united states sales price as the export price instead of using a constructed export price.gerdau stated that these errors led commerce to an inaccurately low dumping margin,and it asked the court to declare commerce determination unlawful and to remand for redetermination.

discussion 
gerdau does not request reliquidation of the icdas rebar that was subject to the sixth review however,gerdau seeks redetermination of the de minimis dumping margin for the period of the sixth review,stating that it was incorrectly measured and that correction of the sixth review would have the tangible consequence of averting revocation of the antidumping order after the seventh review,and therefore that the appeal is not mooted by the liquidation.
the government and icdas respond that gerdau lost its only ground for challenging the sixth review when gerdau did not seek to enjoin or suspend liquidation of the icdas entries subject to the sixth review,and that this court decision in zenith requires that result.zenith held that since liquidation deprives a challenger of its only remedy for an incorrect dumping margin determination,this creates an irreparable injury that must be weighed in considering whether to enjoin liquidation pending judicial review.at.the appellees argue that,with one exception,this holding of zenith has led the courts to find appeals of administrative reviews moot where liquidation has already occurred.see,skf usa united states,finding action challenging administrative review of antidumping order moot under zenith in light of deemed liquidation chr.bjelland seafoods united states.int l trade,dismissing challenge to administrative review of antidumping determinations as moot.but see hylsa,de united states,d.int l trade finding liquidation did not moot challenge to the dumping margin calculated in an administrative review where that margin may have consequences for future revocation determinations in light of b.
gerdau contends that zenith does not extend to the present facts,because there was no issue in zenith of the effect of liquidation of a specific entry on the future application of the antidumping order,quite apart from the antidumping duty assessed for that specific entry.gerdau acknowledges that liquidation ended its right to challenge the duty assessed on the goods subject to the sixth review,but it argues that since its challenge to the dumping margin of the sixth review affects subsequent years,that challenge is not extinguished or mooted by the liquidation.the government disagrees,and also argues that gerdau can not seek relief that would have an effect outside the sixth review,because separate periods of review must be challenged separately.icdas further argues that the regulation establishing condition
