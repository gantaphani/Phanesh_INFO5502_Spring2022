notice of review hearing 
in dependency matters,parents are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard at every stage of the proceeding in order to protect their fundamental interest in the companionship,care,custody and management of their children.in re cal d,in re dejohn th.but parents are not served with process in the usual sense.compare code of civ,et governing service of summons and complaint on defendant in civil action.dependency proceedings often commence on an emergency basis with a detention hearing,and under section,notice of a detention hearing may be written or oral,subd.e.if the parents were present at the detention hearing,it is permissible to thereafter serve a copy of the petition and a notice of the jurisdictional and dispositional hearings by first class mail,subd.e see in re raymond th,a parent general appearance at the detention hearing will be considered a waiver of the parent right to challenge adequacy of notice of the proceedings.if parents were not present at the detention hearing,they must be personally served with a copy of the petition and a notice of the jurisdictional and dispositional hearings served by certified mail,return receipt requested,subd.e.notice of the review hearings held under section and,which generally follow the jurisdictional and dispositional hearings,may be provided by mail addressed to the last known address of the person to be noticed,subd.e.
while appellant brief includes a heading that appears to question whether service was sufficient under section,he concedes that section only requires service by first class mail and acknowledges that the spanish version of appellant notice of the review hearing was sent by first class mail.with respect to service of notice of the original hearing and the section petition,appellant notes that t he court concluded service of notice was proper under the convention and under section and concedes that t he record supports the court finding because notice was sent by registered mail and included spanish translations of the notice and the petition.he contends,however,that the hague service convention required dcfs to serve notice of the review hearing by international registered mail,return receipt requested.we disagree 
the hague service convention is a multilateral treaty that was formulated in by the tenth session of the hague conference of private international law.the convention revised parts of the hague conventions on civil procedure of and.the revision was intended to provide a simpler way to serve process abroad,to assure that defendants sued in foreign jurisdictions would receive actual and timely notice of suit,and to facilitate proof of service abroad.volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft schlunk,volkswagenwerk.article defines the scope of the convention it says the present convention shall apply in all cases,in civil or commercial matters,where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.id.at.in volkswagenwerk,the supreme court explained that in its view,article i refers to service of process in the technical sense and further explained t he term service of process has a technical meaning.service of process refers to a formal delivery of documents that is legally sufficient to charge the defendant with notice of a pending action.id.at.the court concluded that t he only transmittal to which the convention applies is a transmittal abroad that is required as a necessary part of service.id.at accord,denlinger chinadotcom th,both the text and context of the hague service convention demonstrate that the convention is meant to apply only to service of process,italics deleted griggs group,ltd filanto spa,t he convention as a whole does not purport to address aspects of litigation other than service of process.
because the hague service convention governs only service of process in the technical sense and in a dependency proceeding,there is no service of process in the technical sense,an issue exists as to whether it applies at all to dependency proceedings.the issue was addressed by two courts,in in re alyssa th alyssa and in re jorge th jorge.both courts concluded that when the parent is a resident of mexico or other signatory nation,the petition and notice of jurisdictional and dispositional hearings must be served pursuant to the convention requirements.alyssa,supra,th at jorge,supra,th at.the courts stated that such service was required in order to acquire personal jurisdiction over the parent.alyssa,supra,th at jorge,supra,th at.neither alyssa nor jorge suggested that the hague service convention procedures should be applied to every notice of hearing served in a dependency action or that subsequent notices must be served with the formality of the petition and notice of hearing.
as there is no authority for the proposition that hague service convention procedures must be followed whenever any judicial notice of any kind is served on a parent residing outside the united states,we turn for guidance to the general rule a court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of process or by that party general appearance once either occurs,jurisdiction continues throughout the action and service of subsequent pleadings and papers can be by less formal means see in re larry d,quoting witkin,cal.procedure ed.jurisdiction,once jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person is obtained in a particular action,that jurisdiction continues throughout the action and in proceedings incidental thereto.code civ,a except as otherwise provided by statute,the court in which an action is pending has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served a general appearance by a party is equivalent to personal service of summons on such party.b jurisdiction of the court over the parties and the subject matter of an action continues throughout subsequent proceedings in the action.thierfeldt marin hosp.dist.d,code of civil procedure provisions permitting service by mail apply to service of notices in a pending action upon a party who has appeared or has been served in that action.
here,there can be no dispute that appellant was properly served with the petition and notice of the hearing,was aware of the pendency of juvenile court proceedings involving his three children,and made a general appearance,thus permitting service of the subsequent notice of the review hearing by mail.the record reflects that in august,dcfs served multiple copies of the petition and notice of the hearing in english and spanish by certified or registered mail to the address reported by appellant in july.the caseworker also discussed the matter with appellant over the telephone.counsel was appointed for appellant,and appeared at the hearing to argue on his behalf without raising any issue regarding the adequacy of service.appellant filed a notice of appeal of the jurisdictional order,making another general appearance and confirming his submission to the jurisdiction of the court.thereafter,notice of the review hearing was served by mail on appellant at his last known address,which complied with california law,subd.e in re dejohn,supra,th at.accordingly,notice of the review hearing was properly served.
in a supplemental brief,appellant focuses on the phrase s ervice of the notice in section,subdivision e,contending that the requirement that notice of the review hearing be served triggers the hague service convention because the convention applies by its terms to all cases in civil or commercial matters,where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for
