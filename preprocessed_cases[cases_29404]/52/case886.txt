the plaintiff in this case is the grandson of gholam oveissi,who was chief of the iranian armed forces under the shah regime.members of the terrorist organization hezbollah,operating under the name islamic jihad,assassinated oveissi in paris in.in,the plaintiff sued the islamic republic of iran and the iranian ministry of information and security mois in the united states district court for the district of columbia,alleging that the defendants had funded and directed islamic jihad.the district court found that iran and mois were not entitled to sovereign immunity and that they were culpable in oveissi murder,but the court rejected the plaintiff claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and wrongful death.we conclude that the court applied the wrong law to the plaintiff claims because it conducted an erroneous analysis.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
gholam oveissi,an iranian citizen,served as a general and chief of iran armed forces until early.in that year,revolutionaries deposed the shah and established an islamic republic.oveissi,a supporter of the shah government,fled the country,traveling first to the united states and then to france,where he took up residence in paris.oveissi son and also fled from iran to the united states.their son,plaintiff amir oveissi,was born during their stay in california.several months after the plaintiff birth,his family moved to paris,where they shared an apartment with gholam oveissi.
while the family lived together in paris,gholam was outspoken in his opposition to iran revolutionary government and met with other expatriates in the family apartment.oveissi islamic republic of iran,d.fearing reprisal for his political views,oveissi hired a bodyguard.despite this precaution,on february,oveissi was shot and killed while he walked on a crowded paris street.members of the terrorist group hezbollah,operating under the name islamic jihad,immediately claimed responsibility,and the district court found n o reason to dispute this claim.id.oveissi family left paris as soon as they learned of the assassination,traveling first to morocco for eighteen months and then to the united states,where they eventually settled in virginia.
on june,the plaintiff filed a complaint against iran and mois in the united states district court for the district of columbia,invoking the court jurisdiction under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,et.the complaint alleged causes of action for,inter alia,intentional infliction of emotional distress iied and wrongful death.the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on december,and effected service of process through diplomatic channels on may,pursuant to a.
iran failed to enter an appearance or respond to the complaint.the fsia,however,does not automatically entitle a plaintiff to judgment when a foreign state defaults,and instead requires a court to satisfy itself that the plaintiff has established a right to relief.roeder islamic republic of iran,citing e.the district court therefore conducted a bench trial,receiving evidence from the plaintiff,gholam oveissi bodyguard,and an international terrorism expert.the court summarized the expert testimony as follows 
i n the early,members of hezbollah,under the direction of mois,engaged in terrorist activities outside the middle east using the islamic jihad.these activities included assassinations of expatriate iranian dissidents,mainly in france.in the expert opinion,the killings were intended to silence the iranian regime critics and to deter french intervention in lebanon as well as guiding hezbollah terrorist activities,iran,through mois and other entities,provided logistical support and training that,according to the expert,were crucial to hezbollah ability to carry out the assassinations.
oveissi,d at footnote omitted.based on this evidence,the court concluded that the terrorism exception to the fsia,a,stripped iran of its immunity from suit,and that iran and mois were culpable in oveissi assassination.
the court nonetheless dismissed all of the plaintiff claims.with respect to the iied claim,the court began by conducting a analysis.applying district of columbia rules,it determined that ordinarily the the law of the plaintiff domicile at the time of the acts at issue would govern the claim.oveissi,d at.although the court found that the plaintiff was a domiciliary of france at the time of the assassination,it concluded that domiciliary status was not determinative in the instant case.t he united states,the court said,has a unique interest in having its domestic law apply when its citizens are injured by terrorist acts.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.because the plaintiff was born in california and had briefly resided there,the court determined that it should apply california law to the iied claim.in light of its reading of california law,however,the court concluded that the plaintiff lack ed standing to bring an iied claim based on gholam oveissi death.id.at.
without applying a analysis,the court found the plaintiff claim barred by lord campbell act,a law enacted by the british parliament in that became the prototype for statutes in many american states.id.at see,gaudet,d.lord campbell act permits certain near relatives to bring a action against a tortfeasor if the deceased would have been entitled to maintain an action if death had not ensued and the deceased had merely been injured.lord campbell act,ch,an act for compensating the families of persons killed by accidents,see restatement second of torts cmt.a.although the plaintiff is a citizen and is thereby entitled to bring an action under the terrorism exception of the fsia if the other statutory conditions are met,see a a,b,gholam oveissi was an iranian citizen and could not himself have sued under the terrorism exception had he survived the attack.because no action could have been brought by the deceased if still alive,the court thought it had to dismiss the plaintiff claim.oveissi,d at internal quotation mark omitted.
the plaintiff now appeals from the district court dismissal of his amended complaint.
we begin with some necessary background regarding the fsia.the act grants united states courts both subject matter and personal jurisdiction where service of process has been made over any claim against a foreign state as to which the state is not entitled to immunity.world wide minerals,republic of kazakhstan,citing a,b.under the fsia,foreign states generally are entitled to immunity unless the case falls within one of a list of statutory exceptions.see kilburn socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya.in,congress amended the fsia,adding an exception a colloquially known as the terrorism exception.kilburn,at.in pertinent part,that exception abrogates the sovereign immunity of foreign states in civil cases in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death that was caused by extrajudicial killing.a.this exception applies only if three additional criteria are also satisfied the foreign state was designated a state sponsor of terrorism at the time the act occurred the foreign state was given a reasonable opportunity to arbitrate a claim regarding an act that occurred within the state borders and the claimant or victim was a national of the united states.kilburn,at citing a a,b.
in this case,the district court correctly determined that it had jurisdiction over the plaintiff suit under the terrorism exception of the fsia.the assassination of gholam oveissi clearly qualifies as an extrajudicial killing attributable to the iranian government iran has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism continuously since january,one month prior to gholam ali oveissi death,oveissi,d at there was no need to give iran an opportunity to arbitrate the claim because the murder occurred outside iran borders and the claimant,amir oveissi,is a citizen.
although the fsia grants jurisdiction over certain claims against foreign countries,at the time the plaintiff filed his suit the terrorism exception did not provide a federal cause of action against a foreign state.see islamic republic of iran.the plain
