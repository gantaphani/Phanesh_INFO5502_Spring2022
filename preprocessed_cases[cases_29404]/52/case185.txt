in this action to recover principal and interest owed by the republic of argentina on certain floating rate accrual notes,the parties from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york thomas griesa,judge in favor of plaintiffs.appellant argentina contends that it was entitled to reformation of the notes because the relevant interest rate was unenforceable as a penalty,substantively unconscionable,or void on account of public policy.argentina further faults the district court for awarding statutory interest in addition to contract interest on defaulted but not interest payments.meanwhile,nml capital argues that the district court erred in denying it statutory interest for unpaid interest.we conclude that argentina appeal is without merit insofar as it challenges the district court refusal to reform the notes,but that the parties of the treatment of statutory interest turn on significant and unsettled questions of new york law,which we certify to the new york court of appeals as stated in part.of this opinion.
background 
plaintiffs acquisition of beneficial interests in argentina floating rate accrual notes 
in,at a time when its economy was relatively stable,argentina issued a series of securities known as floating rate accrual notes frans.these securities,their name interest at a floating rate,were issued pursuant to a fiscal agency agreement faa dated october,a prospectus dated march,a prospectus supplement also dated march,and a floating rate accrual notes certificate the frans certificate dated april,collectively,the bond documents 
plaintiffs are holders of beneficial interests in the frans.some of plaintiffs interests were purchased on the secondary market after argentina financial collapse and,in certain instances,after the frans stated april maturity date.other interests were purchased prior to the collapse,but at a time when argentina debt was trading at a steep discount given the prevailing view that financial collapse was imminent.
b.the frans certificate and the faa 
according to the terms of the frans certificate,argentina 
promise d to pay cede or registered assigns the principal sum of two hundred million dollars on april,and to pay interest thereon every six months in arrears on april and october in each year at the rate set forth below,until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.
frans certificate at.the interest rates for each payment period were to be calculated and published by a determination agent,this morgan stanley.the formula used to calculate those interest rates frans interest rate provision was based on the yields to maturity of other debt and thus accounted for any risk the market associated with the purchase of such debt consequently,the interest rate on the frans would fluctuate in accordance with argentina creditworthiness at any particular time.this structure arguably provided an incentive for those who were familiar with argentina troubled financial history and,as result,concerned about a potential default nevertheless to invest in the frans 
under the terms of the faa,argentina fail ure to pay any principal of any of the securities of any series when due and payable or its fail ure to pay any interest on any of the securities of such series when due and payable constituted an event of default so long as the failure continued for a period of days.faa at.argentina declaration of a moratorium on the payment of principal of,or interest on,its public external indebtedness also constituted an event of default id.at.in the event of any such defaults,holders of any of the securities were afforded the right to accelerate the securities and declare the principal due and payable immediately.id.the frans certificate,which repeats these default provisions,makes clear that it and all rights of the registered holder t hereof are expressly subject to the faa.frans certificate at.indeed,it states that the security and the faa together constitute a contract,all the terms and conditions of which the registered holder by acceptance t hereof assents to and is deemed to have notice of.id.
argentina december financial collapse 
prior to october,the frans interest rates published by morgan stanley ranged from to per annum.in late,however,argentina experienced a severe economic crisis.as a result of this crisis,on december,argentina announced that it would no longer service its approximately billion in external debt,including both the frans and the and bonds whose yields to maturity were factors in the frans interest rate provision.as a consequence,the notional yields to maturity on these bonds increased,thereby raising the interest rates applicable to the frans.at the time argentina announced its intention to cease service of its external debt,the semiannual interest rate on the frans as calculated by morgan stanley was.thereafter,it continued to climb,reaching or roughly per annum by the time of the frans april maturity date 
in addition to increasing the prevailing interest rates,argentina decision to declare a moratorium on the service of external debt triggered plaintiffs contractual right to accelerate the frans.while most plaintiffs declined to exercise this right,nml accelerated the maturity of million of the million in frans principal that it had purchased on the secondary market.in,argentina offered holders of certain of its defaulted debts the opportunity to exchange their beneficial interests in those debts for performing,but discounted,debt taking the form of guaranteed loans.according to plaintiffs,because the offer would have permitted them to recoup only of what they were owed,they did not accept this offer.
procedural history 
in a series of lawsuits filed in the southern district of new york,plaintiffs sued argentina for its failure to pay principal and interest due under the frans.following motions filed by plaintiffs from to in each of the cases underlying this appeal,the district court awarded plaintiffs summary judgment as to argentina liability under the frans and directed the parties to confer to determine the exact amounts in which final judgment should be entered.when no agreement was reached,plaintiffs jointly moved on april,for partial summary judgment as to the amount of interest argentina owed on the frans.in particular,they sought application of the floating interest rates calculated and published by morgan stanley for the various payment periods occurring through the maturity date.for purposes of calculating interest,plaintiffs sought application of the interest rate that governed the payment period ending on april.finally,plaintiffs sought to collect further interest at the statutory rate for all interest due and owing prior to or after acceleration or argentina had failed to make.
in opposing plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment,argentina argued that the frans interest rate provision was unenforceable subject to reformation because it constituted an unreasonable penalty effected a substantively unconscionable result and violated public policy,specifically new york usury law.argentina further argued that plaintiffs were not entitled to interest on interest for interest payments that it had allegedly missed.
on march,the district court granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment.finding that the interest rate mechanism specified by the frans was employed to determine argentina obligations under the contract,not its obligations resulting from a breach,the district court concluded that the frans interest rate provision was not a liquidated damages clause and,therefore,not subject to the rule that such clauses are unenforceable when they function as penalties.nml capital,republic of argentina,civ,wl,at.turning to argentina unconscionability claim,the district court determined that there was no basis for finding either procedural or substantive unconscionability,as argentina was a sophisticated party capable of understanding the contractual terms that it had itself proposed and the frans interest rate provision was reasonable at the time of contract.see id.at.in so holding,the court rejected argentina contention that events occurring after the time of contract were relevant to the substantive unconscionability inquiry and,therefore,warranted consideration.see id.at.because the district court determined that new york usury law did not apply to transactions as large as the one at issue,it further rejected argentina argument that the frans interest rate provision was unenforceable as a violation of the public policy expressed in such law.see id.at.finally,relying on this court prior decision in capital ventures international republic of argentina,cir,the district court ruled that plaintiffs were not entitled to statutory interest on any interest payments that had allegedly become due after acceleration of the bonds.see nml capital,republic of argentina,wl,at.it did,however,permit plaintiffs to seek statutory interest on unpaid contract interest accruing before acceleration,or where acceleration never occurred.id.at.this conclusion was based,at least in part,on the court finding that argentina ha d not objected to the accrual of statutory prejudgment interest in such circumstances.id.at.in light of these holdings,the district court again advised the parties to confer and submit proposed final judgments.
the proposed judgments subsequently submitted by plaintiffs included all outstanding principal,missed interest payments that came due prior to maturity or acceleration,statutory interest on those missed interest payments,interest on the principal at the rate provided by the contract from the date of maturity or acceleration to the date of judgment,and statutory interest on missed interest payments that argentina was purportedly obligated to pay.citing capital ventures,argentina objected to the fifth component of plaintiffs proposed judgments and submitted omitting such statutory interest.
following the parties submission of further letter briefing,the district court issued a may,opinion holding that plaintiffs were entitled to statutory interest on unpaid interest payments due after maturity because the frans certificate provided that argentina was obligated to pay interest every six months until the principal hereof is paid.nml capital,republic of argentina,civ,wl,at may,internal quotation marks omitted.in reaching this conclusion,the district court first observed that because argentina contested plaintiffs entitlement to statutory interest only with respect to the single case in which payment of the principal was accelerated,it had waived any argument that plaintiffs were not entitled to statutory interest in those instances where there was no acceleration but where argentina obligation to make contract interest payments continued after maturity.see id.the district court further noted that,even absent waiver,the argument was meritless,as neither the march opinion nor this court decision in capital ventures applie d to an award of interest where payments ha d not been accelerated.id.thereafter,and in accordance with its march and may,opinions,the district court entered the judgments in plaintiffs favor here at issue.

reformation 
argentina contends that the frans interest rate provision is unenforceable because it operates as a penalty.we are not persuaded.
under new york law,a contractual provision fixing damages in the event of breach constitutes an unenforceable penalty where the amount fixed is plainly or grossly disproportionate to the probable loss.jmd holding congress fin,at,at internal quotation marks omitted.whether the interest rates set by the controlling provision are reasonable in proportion to probable loss need not be decided here,however,because the is neither dependent on,nor affected by,argentina performance or under the bond not a liquidated damages clause at all.instead,it simply establishes the rate at which argentina is required to compensate holders of the frans for its use of principal.
although argentina attempts to position its default that is,its december decision to discontinue servicing all of its external debt,including the the event that precipitated the challenged interest rates,its efforts are unavailing.the moratorium on the servicing of external debt violated no provision contained in the bond documents.it simply altered argentina creditworthiness the interest rate provision accounts for such the effect of raising the applicable interest rates.while the moratorium constituted an event of default under the bond documents,its only consequence was to afford plaintiffs the right to accelerate the bonds.it did not alter the formula outlined in the rate provision.accordingly,the resulting interest rates can not be deemed default interest rates.indeed,had argentina continued making interest payments on the frans,but adhered to the moratorium with respect to its service of all other external debt,similar interest rates would have obtained.
in sum,because argentina has not demonstrated that the frans interest rate provision fixes damages for a breach of the bond documents,the provision can not be considered a liquidated damages clause subject to review as an excessive penalty.see kirby united states,concluding that contractual provision was neither a penalty nor liquidated damages because it was not to be paid for any breach of contract lipsky commonwealth united,cir concluding that provision was not a liquidated damages clause since it ha d nothing to do with a party breach it merely compensated one party for any loss due to registration delay.
unconscionability 
argentina next contends that it was entitled to reformation on the ground that the frans interest rate provision produced interest rates so grossly unreasonable and unfair to argentina as to render it substantively unconscionable and thus unenforceable under new york law.appellant br.at.this argument is also without merit.
the doctrine of unconscionability seeks to prevent sophisticated parties with grossly unequal bargaining power from taking advantage of less sophisticated parties.united states.martinez,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in general,a provision will be deemed unenforceable on unconscionability grounds only where it is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable when made.gillman chase manhattan bank.because argentina does not seriously contend that the process leading to the execution of the bond documents was flawed,it can not demonstrate procedural unconscionability.while there are some exceptional cases where a provision of a contract is so outrageous as to warrant holding it unenforceable on the ground of substantive unconscionability alone,id.at,at see also brower gateway,dep t,this is not such a case.
argentina unconscionability argument reduces to the disingenuous claim that no party negotiating the frans agreements in could have contemplated argentina unprecedented default in,appellant br.at,or the astronomical interest rates that would result,id.at.in fact,the bond documents explicitly define argentina declaration of a moratorium on the payment of principal of,or interest on,its public external indebtedness as an event of default giving bondholders the right to accelerate the bonds.faa at accord frans certificate at.this language confirms not only that the parties could have contemplated such a default,but that they did and expressly agreed to its consequences.moreover,given argentina default history and the knowledge that sophisticated parties like argentina and the prominent new york city law firm representing it presumably possessed regarding the impact of a sovereign impaired creditworthiness on its bonds yields to maturity,argentina can hardly profess surprise or prejudice at the consequences of its decision to discontinue paying any principal or interest on its external debt.see westinghouse transit,the bedrock of the doctrine of unconscionability is the prevention of oppression and unfair surprise and not of disturbance of allocation of risk.omission in original internal quotation marks omitted.
argentina has pointed to no we are aware of an agreement involving parties of like sophistication unenforceable on substantive unconscionability grounds.unlike in industralease automated scientific equipment,dep t,which argentina cites for the proposition that events occurring after it executed the bond documents are properly considered in determining whether the frans interest rate provision is substantively unconscionable there is no basis for concluding that the frans achieved none of the purposes of the parties.id.at,at.while argentina may regret the ultimate cost of its bargain,the frans achieved their intended goal of providing argentina with access to capital despite impediments presented by its troubled financial history and investors wariness of purchasing its debt.on this record,we decline to conclude that the frans interest rate provision is substantively unconscionable.
equally unconvincing is argentina argument that the frans interest rate provision is unenforceable in light of new york public policy against usury.see penal law,criminalizing adoption of interest rates exceeding.the usury laws are expressly inapplicable where the sum involved is equal to or greater than million and,therefore,do not apply to the facts of this case.see oblig.law b no law regulating the maximum rate of interest which may be charged,taken or received,including section and section of the penal law,shall apply to any loan or forbearance in the amount of two million five hundred thousand dollars or more.
argentina concedes the technical inapplicability of the criminal usury law but nevertheless contends that the district court should have considered the law in determining whether the interest rate provision was enforceable.while courts have looked to the usury law for assistance in determining whether a contractual provision is enforceable,argentina cites no we are aware of which courts have done so under circumstances that the legislature expressly exempted from the scope of the law.given the text of b of the general obligations law and the case law construing it,we can not conclude that the legislature intent was anything other than to permit parties negotiating the terms applicable to the borrowing and repayment of sums of million or more to choose to incorporate interest rates higher than.see in re venture mortg.fund,cir noting,in dictum,that because borrower to large loan transaction is less likely to need or deserve financial protection and because forfeiture of large amounts is more unsettling to financial arrangements,no new york usury law prohibits,voids,or regulates transactions over million,a financial plane above which all players apparently are deemed to be able to fend for themselves.for the foregoing reasons,the criminal usury law provides no basis for deeming the frans interest rate provision unenforceable.
statutory prejudgment interest 
argentina does not dispute its obligation to pay statutory interest on the interest payments it failed to make prior to the frans stated maturity date.it does,however,challenge the award of statutory interest on unpaid,interest payments as contrary to this court decision in capital ventures international republic of argentina.nml,arguing that capital ventures was wrongly decided or is otherwise distinguishable and that the district court therefore erred in denying nml statutory interest on interest payments that came due after nml exercised its right of acceleration.because resolution of these claims turns on significant questions of new york law not settled for purposes of this case by our decision in capital ventures,we certify those questions to the new york court of appeals and defer decision on the matter pending that court response 
statutory interest on missed interest payments 
argentina interest challenge requires us to consider whether the bond provision requiring argentina to make interest payments on principal until the principal hereof is paid is properly construed as an obligation to pay interest for so long as the principal is outstanding,including after the date of maturity and if so,whether that obligation provides a valid basis for awarding statutory interest under new york law on postmaturity interest payments that came due but were never paid.
under new york law,prejudgment interest shall be recovered upon a sum awarded because of a breach of performance of a contract.a.the new york court of appeals has held that a permits a creditor to recover prejudgment interest on unpaid interest and principal payments awarded from the date each payment became due under the terms of the promissory note to the date liability is established.spodek park prop.dev.the payment of such interest makes creditors whole by recognizing the benefits that a debtor that a creditor is deprived the debtor has use of the funds at issue during the pendency of litigation.see id.at,at.in determining the rate of interest to be recovered for unpaid principal,it is that when a contract provides for interest to be paid at a specified rate until the principal is paid,the contract rate of interest,rather than the legal rate set forth in cplr,governs until payment of the principal or until the contract is merged in a judgment.nyctl trust wagner,dep t quoting citibank,liebowitz,dep t see also young.
in capital ventures,we applied this new york law in deciding a similar interest dispute involving argentine bonds,whether a bondholder was entitled to statutory prejudgment interest on interest payments it claimed argentina failed to make after acceleration of bonds governed by some of the same bond documents here at issue.see at.there,as here,argentina was obligated to pay interest on the principal until the principal was paid.id.at ellipsis in original.although the relevant agreement contemplated,but did not identify,periodic dates on which interest would be due,we noted that its acceleration provision d id not specify whether or not interest was due on the periodic dates after any acceleration.id.we further observed that t he normal consequence of acceleration is that interest payments that would have been due in the future are no longer due,because,after acceleration,the entire principal is immediately due and owing in other words,future interest payments are unearned because the creditor is no longer loaning the debtor the principal.id.at.finding nothing in the language of the underlying bond documents to demonstrate that the parties intended to displace the normal meaning of acceleration with a concept of acceleration that allow ed interest to continue to come due after the principal was accelerated,we concluded that the district court properly refused to award statutory interest on the unpaid,interest payments alleged by the bondholder.id.at noting that language providing that argentina would pay interest until principal was paid was truism that lacked specificity required to alter the traditional concept of acceleration.
although argentina contends that a similar result should obtain here,this case involves interest payments and hinges on a provision nearly identical to the provision at issue in capital specifies the dates on which interest payments are due.we did not consider such circumstances in capital ventures,and we do not think existing new york law settles the questions before us.the following analysis informs that conclusion.
as in capital ventures,the provision here at issue does not contain any language explicitly stating that the parties contemplated periodic payment of interest after the frans april,maturity date.in addition,there is some support in new york law for the view that no meaningful difference exists between the and contexts,as acceleration merely advances the stated mat
