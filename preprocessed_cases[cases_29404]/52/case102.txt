background 
a.the florida default judgment 
in,aldo vera,acting as representative of his father aldo vera,estate,invoked the provision of the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia to sue the republic of cuba in florida state court for money damages resulting from his father murder in san juan,puerto rico.see u.a final judgment at,vera republic of cuba.may,construing fsia terrorism exception to allow action against foreign state for extrajudicial killing vera,alleged that his father formerly havana chief of police fled cuba after becoming disillusioned with the communist regime,residing thereafter in florida and puerto rico,where he participated in activities.final judgment at,vera republic of cuba.may.on october,as vera,was emerging from a political meeting in san juan,he was shot dead,allegedly by agents acting on orders of the cuban government.see id.while bbva disputes this account,that issue is not before us cuba failed to appear in the florida action,and,in,after holding a bench trial,the state court entered a default judgment in vera,favor for.see id.at,see also e requiring fsia plaintiff to establish his claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court before entry of default judgment against foreign state.
entry of the florida judgment in the southern district of new york and ensuing collection proceedings 
in,vera,again on behalf of his father estate,filed suit against the republic of cuba in the southern district of new york seeking entry of the florida judgment under the full faith and credit act.see vera republic of cuba,civ.akh hereinafter vera republic of cuba.after cuba failed to appear in this action,the district court,by default,entered the florida judgment on august,in the amount of,not recognizing that part of the judgment awarding million in punitive damages.see prohibiting award of punitive damages against foreign state judgment,vera republic of cuba,ecf.two months later,on october,the district court authorized vera,to pursue attachment and execution on the judgment.see c requiring reasonable period of time after entry of judgment before attachment of foreign state assets permitted.
toward that end,vera,issued subpoenas to the new york branches of various banks,seeking to discover assets that cuba held at those banks.see.a a.the subpoena challenged on this appeal was directed to bbva new york branch and sought disclosure of all of cuba sovereign assets held by bbva worldwide.bbva responded by identifying cuba sovereign assets at its new york branch,but it provided no information about any of cuba assets that the bank may hold abroad.
on november,vera,moved to compel bbva compliance with the subpoena request for disclosure of cuba worldwide assets.on december,bbva to quash the subpoena,arguing that the subpoena was void ab initio because the fsia did not support jurisdiction for vera,actions against cuba and under daimler ag bauman,bbva was not subject to personal jurisdiction in new york with respect to assets held abroad.
meanwhile,starting in february and for some time thereafter,vera,filed motions in the district court for orders directing various banks to turn over identified cuban sovereign assets held at the banks new york branches.a number of banks objected,maintaining that vera,had to proceed against them by special proceeding pursuant to b rather than by motion.see.a requiring judgment enforcement proceedings to comport with procedure of the state where the court is located on june,the district court orally directed vera,to file and serve a formal pleading for turnover naming the banks as defendants.the court explained that this action ensured its jurisdiction to order the banks to turn over cuba assets,see koehler bank of bermuda,explaining that use of special proceeding ensures jurisdiction to order third party to turn over assets and allowed the banks to interplead other potential claimants to the assets at issue.see tr.of june,at,vera republic of cuba,ecf see also order terminating mots.and regulating status,vera republic of cuba,ecf.
consistent with the court directive,on september,vera,filed with the court,and thereafter served on bbva and other banks,an omnibus petition for the turnover of cuban sovereign assets in new york against which writs of execution had been levied under the southern district recognized florida judgment.see pet.for turnover order,vera republic of cuba,ecf 
on september,while this turnover petition was pending,the district court rejected bbva challenges to jurisdiction and ordered bbva to provide full and complete answers with respect to the republic of cuba assets located in bbva branches outside of,as well as inside,the united states.order at,vera republic of cuba,ecf.bbva both timely appealed and moved for reconsideration,arguing that this court intervening decision in gucci america,weixing li,cir,compelled the conclusion that bbva was not subject to general personal jurisdiction in new york.in a single written opinion issued on march,the district court both denied reconsideration of its september,enforcement order,and granted the omnibus turnover petition as to cuba sovereign assets held at bbva new york branch.see wl.bbva timely appealed both orders 
bbva now moves for a stay of the district court enforcement order pending resolution of these appeals,arguing that the district court lacked jurisdiction to order worldwide discovery.in opposing a stay,vera,argues,inter alia,that this court is without jurisdiction because the appealed decisions are not final orders under.
ii.discussion 
this court has jurisdiction to review final decisions of a district court,as well as those interlocutory orders specified in.because bbva asserts jurisdiction only under,and not under we here consider only whether the appealed orders enforcing the subpoena and denying reconsideration are final decisions within the meaning of 
a final decision is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,internal quotation marks omitted accord cox united states,cir.under the collateral order doctrine,an interlocutory order can also be deemed final and immediately appealable under if it conclusively determines a disputed question resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment.em republic of argentina,cir see cohen beneficial indus.loan.the orders here at issue do not qualify as final decisions in either of these respects.
as precedent makes clear,u nder traditional finality principles,a district court decision to compel compliance with a subpoena or to deny a motion to quash a subpoena is generally not a final decision and therefore is not immediately appealable.in re air crash at belle harbor,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to obtain immediate appellate review of such an order absent b certification,the subpoenaed party must typically defy the district court enforcement order,be held in contempt,and then appeal the contempt order,which is regarded as final under.id.internal quotation marks omitted.this process,which recognizes only the contempt judgment,not the underlying enforcement order,as a final decision subject to appeal,promotes the strong congressional policy embodied in against piecemeal reviews,and against obstructi
