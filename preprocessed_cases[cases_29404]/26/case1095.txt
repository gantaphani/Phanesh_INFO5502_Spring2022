plaintiffs appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants on remand from our decision in twin peaks charter academy,cir.in the previous appeal,we affirmed the district court entry of judgment for defendants on most of plaintiffs claims but remanded for further proceedings on their three first amendment claims that they were subjected to an illegal prior restraint on speech and association that they were retaliated against for exercising their freedom of speech rights and that they were retaliated against for exercising their freedom of association rights.we stated that defendants were free on remand to assert those defenses not addressed by the district court in its opinion and order as well as any additional defenses that may exist.id.at.on remand,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on all claims based on qualified immunity and principles of municipal liability.plaintiffs appealed.
background 
from the fall of until the spring of,plaintiffs were employed as teachers at twin peaks charter academy,a charter school within the vrain valley school district in colorado.as more thoroughly detailed in our opinion in the first appeal and described as relevant below,plaintiffs alleged that academy,the school district,and the former administrator of the academy,dorothy plaintiffs first amendment rights while they were employed at the academy by unlawfully prohibiting them from meeting together to discuss school matters and retaliating against them when they did so.
it is undisputed that the academy requested its employees,including plaintiffs,to sign a code of conduct in which they promised to refrain from actions or behavior to others at this school,including malicious gossip and similar activities.appellants app.at.taken in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,the record also supports the conclusion that marlatt verbally directed teachers not discuss school matters with anyone and expressed her preference they not meet together socially at all the record further supports the conclusion that plaintiffs continued meeting and discussing school matters and marlatt retaliated by giving them poor performance evaluations and imposing increasingly strict restrictions on their speech and association.
in the spring of,plaintiffs each submitted letters of resignation to the academy.during their period,marlatt resigned.plaintiffs then attempted to rescind their resignations,but the academy board of directors voted against permitting them to do so.all but one plaintiff also reapplied for a teaching position with the academy,but none of them received a response.
plaintiffs then filed a complaint in the federal district court raising eleven claims for relief,including due process,first amendment,and state law claims.the district court granted in part defendants motion to dismiss certain of plaintiffs claims,including their claim based on the colorado constitution,and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that omitted the dismissed claims.the district court subsequently granted defendants motion for summary judgment on all claims.
on appeal,we affirmed the grant of summary judgment on plaintiffs due process,contract,and estoppel claims,holding plaintiffs were employees and defendants did not violate their rights by declining to accept their attempts to rescind their resignations,at.as for plaintiffs first amendment allegations,we concluded plaintiffs had asserted three distinct first amendment claims,and we held the district court erred in failing to discuss plaintiffs free association retaliation claim and prior restraint claims.id.at.we also held the summary judgment record supported the conclusion that plaintiffs discussed four matters of public concern whether the academy code of conduct could restrict plaintiffs freedom of speech,marlatt restrictions on speech and association,whether the academy charter would be renewed,and the upcoming board elections.id.at.we concluded the summary judgment record was sufficient to support a finding of retaliation for plaintiffs speech and association based on these four protected areas of speech,and we therefore reversed in part the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants on these claims.id.at.we also remanded the prior restraint claim for further proceedings.id.at.we specifically held defendants were free on remand to assert those defenses not addressed by the district court in its opinion and order as well as any additional defenses that may exist.id.at.
on remand,marlatt asserted she was entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiffs three surviving claims,and the academy and school district asserted there was no basis under for holding them liable as municipal entities.the district court agreed and again granted summary judgment for all defendants on all claims.this appeal followed.
discussion 
as an initial matter,we must consider whether plaintiffs have standing to assert the claims before us in this appeal.although this question was not raised by the parties nor addressed by the district court,we raise this issue sua sponte,as we must,to ensure that there is an article iii case or controversy with respect to each claim before us.people for the ethical treatment of animals rasmussen,cir.to establish article iii standing,the plaintiff must show injury in fact,a causal relationship between the injury and the defendants challenged acts,and a likelihood that a favorable decision will redress the injury.id.the first component of this test,the requirement of an injury in fact,requires an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks,citations,and footnote omitted.
plaintiffs have three claims that survived the first appeal and are still at issue in this appeal prior restraints on speech and association free speech retaliation and free association retaliation we are satisfied that plaintiffs have standing as to both of their retaliation claims.the prior restraint claim,however,requires some discussion.specifically,we must consider whether plaintiffs have shown the existence of an injury in fact.although their arguments were not framed in terms of standing,both parties appellate briefs addressed the question of whether plaintiffs speech and association were chilled by the alleged prior restraints.we therefore find it appropriate to review this issue under our usual standard for determining standing at the summary judgment phase,as opposed to the pleading phase.bischoff osceola county,cir applying the usual summary judgment standard for standing,even though the district court had raised this issue sua sponte,because the plaintiffs briefed this issue and the case had moved well beyond the preliminary stages.under this standard,mere allegations of injury are insufficient,and we look instead to whether the summary judgment record supports a conclusion that the plaintiffs have standing.dep t of commerce house of representatives,d.therefore,defendants should prevail on standing grounds if the record is devoid of evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact that would support the plaintiff ultimate burden of proving standing.day bond,cir.
a prior restraint claim is distinct from a retaliation claim because it is based on a restriction that chills potential speech before it happens,rather than an adverse action taken in response to actual speech,at quoting arndt koby,cir.while a plaintiff can not satisfy the requirement for a prior restraint claim through the mere allegation that the restraint has a subjective chilling effect on his speech or association,a chilling effect on the exercise of a plaintiff first amendment rights may amount to a judicially cognizable injury in fact,as long as it arise s from an objectively justified fear of real consequences.initiative referendum institute walker,cir quoting utah,cir thus,for example,a plaintiff who challenges a statute on first amendment grounds may satisfy the requirement by showing a credible threat of prosecution or other consequences following from the statute enforcement,at.
plaintiffs allege their exercise of their first amendment rights was chilled by two unconstitutional prior.marlatt directives regarding their speech and association and the academy prohibition on malicious gossip and similar activities.following the standard set out in,we consider for each restraint whether any evidence in the record supports the conclusion that the restraint actually chilled plaintiffs speech and association and such chilling effect was caused by an objectively justified fear of real consequences.
taken in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,the record supports the conclusion that marlatt directives,while not chilling plaintiffs speech and association entirely,did cause plaintiffs to alter the exercise of their speech and association rights.specifically,the record indicates plaintiffs changed the location of some of their meetings and staggered their departures from meetings to avoid detection we conclude that these alterations in the place and manner of plaintiffs speech and association are sufficient to show that plaintiffs were chilled in the exercise of their first amendment rights by marlatt directives.essence,city of federal heights,cir finding no standing because,inter alia,the plaintiff had not altered its behavior as a result of the challenged provision.
the record also supports the conclusion this chilling effect on plaintiffs speech and association was caused by an objectively justified fear of real consequences.taken in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,the facts support the conclusion that plaintiffs direct supervisor told them at a mandatory faculty meeting,in a very serious and angry tone,they were not to speak to anyone about school matters and she would prefer for them not to meet together socially at all.they feared this supervisor might give them poor evaluations or recommend they not be if she discovered they were violating these directives.as we noted in the previous appeal,poor performance ratings,especially for teachers such as plaintiffs,are adverse consequences that certainly could deter reasonable people from exercising their first amendment rights.see,at.thus,we conclude the record supports the conclusion that plaintiffs speech and association were chilled by an objectively justified fear of adverse consequences,satisfying the requirement of standing we are convinced the causation and redressability requirements for standing are met as well,and we therefore hold that plaintiffs have standing to challenge marlatt directives.
as for the academy code of conduct,however,we conclude plaintiffs do not have standing as to this alleged prior restraint.plaintiffs have cited to nothing in the record indicating their speech or association was altered or deterred in any way by the code nor have we found any such evidence in our de novo review of the record.nothing in the,for that matter,in the allegations of plaintiffs the conclusion this code caused plaintiffs a concrete,judicially cognizable injury.we therefore dismiss for lack of jurisdiction plaintiffs challenge to the academy code of conduct.
having resolved the question of standing,we must now determine whether the district court correctly held that all of plaintiffs remaining claims were barred by qualified immunity as to marlatt and by principles of municipal liability as to the academy and school district.we review the district court summary judgment decision de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.hackworth progressive cas.ins,cir.that is,summary judgment is appropriate where no genuine issue of material fact exists,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.in applying this standard,we examine the factual record and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.clinger highlands.bd.of regents,cir.because this case implicates first amendment concerns,we have an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.citizens for peace in space city of.springs,cir.
qualified immunity 
we first consider the district court conclusion that marlatt was entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiffs three surviving claims.qualified immunity protects a government official from personal liability and the burden of having to go to trial unless he violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.anderson mccotter,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.thus,to defeat marlatt qualified immunity defense,plaintiffs must show both that her actions violated a constitutional or statutory right and that the rights she violated were clearly established at the time of the conduct at issue.nelson mcmullen,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to meet this burden,they must do more than simply allege the violation of a general legal precept rather,they are required to demonstrate a substantial correspondence between the conduct in question and prior law allegedly establishing that the defendant actions were clearly prohibited.jantz muci,cir.
for a right to be clearly established,t he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson creighton,d.clearly this standard does not require a precise factual analogy to law however,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the unlawfulness of the conduct was apparent in light of law.jantz,at internal quotation marks omitted.this preexisting law must consist of either a supreme court or tenth circuit decision on point,or the clearly established weight of authority from other courts,oil means,cir.
prior restraints on speech and association 
thus far we have referred,as the parties did,to plaintiffs prior restraint claim as a single claim that marlatt directives constituted an illegal prior restraint on speech and association.however,a closer consideration of the challenged directives suggests the alleged restraint on speech was separate and distinct from the alleged restraint on association.we therefore consider these alleged restraints separately.
plaintiffs allege marlatt placed an illegal prior restraint on their association.however,even taken in the light most favorable to plaintiffs,the facts in the record establish marlatt only expressed a preference that plaintiffs not meet together socially in public she did not forbid them from meeting.plaintiffs have cited to no authority,and we have found none,to suggest an employer who expresses a preference regarding employee association thereby imposes an unconstitutional prior restraint.we are not persuaded marlatt violated plaintiffs association rights by expressing this preference,and she certainly did not violate clearly established law by doing so.we accordingly conclude marlatt is entitled to qualified immunity as to the alleged prior restraint on association.
as for the alleged prior restraint on speech,we must first consider the scope of marlatt directives and their restrictions on speech.defendants argue that both of marlatt directives were focused on speech which could be overheard in public and endanger the school charter and her directives would not be understood in context to constitute a prior restraint on all speech relating to school matters.appellees br.at.while the record might support such an inference,the record and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom must be taken in the light most favorable to plaintiffs for purposes of summary judgment.defendants stress the apparently undisputed fact that marlatt issued her first directive following an incident in which confidential student information was released to the public in violation of the family educational rights and privacy act.however,this fact would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding marlatt directives nevertheless prohibited far more speech than the type of speech that provoked them.the in the light most favorable to the conclusion marlatt directives were not limited to the improper discussion of such confidential information but were instead broad bans on the discussion of all school matters with anyone.appellants app.at.for purposes of summary judgment,we must consider them to be such.
in luethje peavine school district of adair county,cir,we considered the constitutionality of a similar broad ban against the discussion of school matters by school employees.the plaintiff in luethje,a cafeteria worker,made several complaints both internally and externally about allegedly unsanitary practices in the cafeteria and the school refusal to do anything about these problems.id.at.in response,the school board issued the following rule for lunchroom personnel if you have any problems,consult the principal.do take any school problems other places,or discuss it sic with others.id.alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.in considering the constitutionality of this policy,we stated that the question was whether this policy potentially stifled speech of public concern,and,if so,whether the policy was permissible in any event,considering the interests of both the employee and the district.id.at.we concluded the plaintiff actual speech related to a matter of public concern,and we noted the rule was broad enough to prohibit other speech of public concern.id.at.we then concluded the defendants interest in efficient functioning of the school did not override the plaintiff first amendment rights to the extent necessary to justify the rule the board adopted.id.at.we acknowledged that g uidelines for school employees public comments might in some circumstances be permissible,but we concluded the broadly worded rule here covered more ground than was necessary to satisfy the school interest in functioning efficiently.id.at.
the defendants in luethje conceded the prohibition on speech in that case was provoked by the plaintiff speech on matters of public concern,while here marlatt first directive,at least,was provoked by speech that was not protected by the first amendment.however,we are not persuaded this fact is sufficient to distinguish luethje from the instant case.in luethje,we stated the proper question was whether the school policy potentially stifled speech of public concern.id.at emphasis added.marlatt in the light most favorable to certainly broad enough to potentially stifle speech of public concern.indeed,all of the speech we recognized as involving matters of public concern in the first school code of conduct,marlatt directives on teachers discussing school matters,renewal of the school charter,and school board to fall under her broad prohibition of speech about school matters.as for the second prong of the luethje test,we conclude marlatt broadly worded prohibitions covered more speech than necessary or permissible marlatt legitimate interests in ensuring the efficient functioning of the school and deterring teachers from disclosing confidential student information did not justify a ban on the discussion of all school matters.
defendants argue plaintiffs can not now complain about marlatt directives when they did not contemporaneously ask for clarification or complain regarding the directives potential infringement on their first amendment rights.for support,defendants cite to a district court case from another circuit concluding that a plaintiff interpretation of his employer speech restrictions was unreasonable and noting the plaintiff never requested clarification of the restrictions nor expressed his concerns about their reach to his employer.see murray.state dep t of ecology,no,wl,at.this case appears to be distinguishable on the facts.moreover,we find no support in our precedent for imposing the requirement that a government employee request clarification or complain to his supervisor before being permitted to file a complaint challenging his employer speech restrictions,and we decline to impose such a requirement in this case.
having determined for purposes of summary judgment that marlatt directives violated plaintiffs free speech rights,we must consider the second prong of the qualified immunity these rights were clearly established at the time.we find this question easy to resolve.more than twenty years ago,we held in luethje that a school interest in efficient functioning does not justify a broad ban on the discussion of school problems with anyone except the school principal.the minor differences between the ban in luethje and the ban in this distinction between school problems and,in this case,the broader category of school matters,and the addition in luethje of one individual with whom these matters could be make the unlawfulness of this ban more apparent.although defendants have asserted one governmental interest that the defendants in luethje did not assert,an interest in deterring the disclosure of confidential student information,we are not persuaded that a reasonable official would conclude that this interest alone would justify almost the same restraint that we found unconstitutional in luethje,particularly where this interest could easily be satisfied by a less sweeping restraint on speech.we therefore hold that marlatt is not entitled to qualified immunity on the claim that her directives constituted an illegal prior restraint on speech.
retaliation for exercise of free speech and association rights 
we turn now to the question whether marlatt is entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiffs free speech retaliation and free association retaliation claims in the first appeal,we discussed plaintiffs allegations that marlatt gave them poor performance evaluations and imposed increasingly strict prohibitions on their speech and association,as well as their suggest ion that they were blacklisted from future employment at the academy because of their speech,at.we then held there was enough evidence in the summary judgment record to create a genuine dispute about whether these adverse actions occurred and whether they were motivated by plaintiffs speech and association.id.in the instant appeal,defendants argue the summary judgment record does not demonstrate marlatt retaliated against plaintiffs for engaging in protected speech.however,this issue was already resolved in the first appeal,and under the doctrine we will not reconsider our prior holding.see huffman saul holdings,cir.therefore,we hold the first prong for defeating qualified immunity has been we have already held,the summary judgment record supports the conclusion marlatt violated plaintiffs constitutional rights by taking adverse employment actions motivated by plaintiffs exercise of their constitutional rights.we thus turn to the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis and consider whether marlatt actions were in violation of clearly established law.
the law was clearly established at the time of marlatt actions that an employer could not take adverse actions such as these in retaliation for employees protected first amendment activities.see schuler city of boulder,cir holding an employer violated clearly established law by,inter alia,giving low performance ratings in retaliation for protected speech.thus,the relevant inquiry is whether the protected nature of plaintiffs speech was sufficiently clear that defendants should have been reasonably on notice they were not entitled to regulate it.melton city of.city,cir,reh g in part granted on other grounds,cir.
in arguing it was clearly established their speech was protected by the first amendment,plaintiffs focus narrowly on the specific matters we found to be protected in the first appeal.however,while our precedent held that each instance of speech should be treated separately when there are multiple instances of speech,each dealing with separate subjects,johnsen independent school district,cir,our analysis indicated an instance of speech was distinct from a topic of speech.for example,in johnsen we described connick myers,d,as involving a single instance of speech,even though this instance of speech a multiple matters.johnsen,at.we held,when an instance of speech involves multiple distinct subjects,the question of whether speech should be balanced separately is fact sensitive and depends on how interrelated are the different aspec
