professor kelly cherry taught in the english department at the university of from to.the board of regents of the university of wisconsin system the board is a state entity that oversees the university of,which is a state educational institution and recipient of title ix funds from the federal government.cherry was a tenured professor at the university of until she resigned on august.
after her resignation,cherry sued the board,alleging that her salary remained significantly lower than that of her male colleagues with similar credentials,and thus,over a number of years,she was subjected to sex discrimination on the basis of salary in violation of the equal pay act epa,d,and title ix of the education amendments of.cherry sought compensatory and punitive damages in her amended complaint.the board moved to dismiss cherry amended complaint,arguing that title vii is cherry sole avenue for her claims,and thus it precludes her epa and title ix claims cherry fails to state a title ix claim the eleventh amendment bars the epa and title ix claims and the board is immune from any punitive damages award under title ix.the district court denied the board motion,rejecting all of the board arguments.the board appealed.
in this collateral order appeal,the board reasserts all of the arguments that it raised in its motion to dismiss.under,we have jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of the district courts.furnace board of trustees of southern illinois university,cir quoting.a district court denial of a motion to dismiss is not a final decision.lac courte oreilles band of lake superior chippewa indians state of wisconsin,cir.but the collateral order doctrine is a narrow exception to the finality rule.in re moens,cir.it permits an appeal from a judgment if three criteria are met the order must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judg ment.midland asphalt united states,d quoting coopers lybrand livesay,d see also furnace,at.the third criterion is difficult to satisfy,as the supreme court has stressed that the narrow exception of the collateral order appeal is limited to trial orders affecting rights that will be irretrievably lost in the absence of an immediate appeal.in re moens,at quoting,koller,d.we must determine whether the board claims are immediately appealable without regard to whether a prompt decision by this court will resolve the litigation more quickly.see digital equipment desktop direct,d.
because the eleventh amendment concerns the board privilege not to be sued,which is a privilege that would be irretrievably lost if it were not immediately appealable,the issue of immunity from suit is properly raised in this collateral appeal.puerto rico aqueduct sewer authority metcalf eddy,d see also id.the very object and purpose of the amendment were to prevent the indignity of subjecting a state to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties.quoting in re ayers.but the additional nonimmunity claims asserted by the board in support of its motion to dismiss that cherry failed to state a title ix claim,and that title vii precludes cherry epa and title ix claims are not immediately appealable because they can be effectively reviewed on appeal from a final judgment.see lac courte,at a refusal to dismiss a complaint or part thereof is the classic example of a nonfinal order that is not appealable under,either directly or by invoking the collateral order rule.after a later final judgment of the district court,this court may effectively review the issues of whether title vii precludes cherry epa and title ix claims,and whether cherry properly failed to state a title ix claim.in line with this court reluctance to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over additional issues in a collateral appeal,we decline to exercise such jurisdiction in this case.see united states bloom,cir see also swint chambers county comm n,d expressing concern that a rule loosely allowing pendent appellate jurisdiction would encourage parties to parlay collateral orders into interlocutory appeal tickets.
we also decline to address the board claim that it is immune from a punitive damages award under title ix.a claim of immunity to a certain class of damages is far removed from a claim of immunity from litigation.chandler,cir quoting pullman constr,united states,cir.t he supreme court has made it clear that a potentially erroneous ruling on liability may be reviewed effectively on appeal from final judgment,at quoting swint,at.if punitive damages are permitted to be,and in fact are assessed against the board,this court can certainly review that issue if it arises from a later final judgment of the district court.in the meantime,the board claimed immunity from a punitive damages award will not be irretrievably lost if it is not reviewed in this collateral appeal.see,moreno consolidated rail,cir en banc in affirming a district court denial of a jury award of punitive damages to a plaintiff under of the rehabilitation act,the sixth circuit concluded that does not provide a punitive damages remedy see also rein socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,cir.we thus decline to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over this issue.see crymes dekalb county,georgia,cir declining to extend pendent appellate jurisdiction to the nonfinal issue of the district court denial of appellants motion to dismiss a punitive damages claim.
the remaining issues properly raised in this collateral order appeal are whether the eleventh amendment bars cherry epa and title ix claims.we review de novo a district court judgment on whether to dismiss a claim on eleventh amendment immunity grounds.mci telecommunications illinois bell telephone,cir.
the board argues,however,that pursuant to vermont agency of natural resources ex rel.stevens,d,we should avoid the immunity issues and dismiss cherry claims on grounds.in support of its contention,the board claims that title vii precludes cherry epa and title ix claims,and thus that we should dismiss cherry claims on that ground instead of addressing whether the eleventh amendment bars cherry claims.in vermont agency,the supreme court determined that when a statute provides no indication that it permits the cause of action it creates to be asserted against states,it is appropriate for the court to first make that statutory determination before conducting an eleventh amendment inquiry.id.at.see floyd thompson,cir.the court concluded in vermont agency that because the false claims act fca provides no indication that states are subject to its penalties,the court could resolve the case with that statutory determination without considering the issue of immunity.at.but in this case,if it appears in any way possible for cherry to sue the state under the epa and title ix,then vermont agency indicates we should resolve the eleventh amendment issue first.floyd,at.
the board argument is unavailing because unlike the fca,the epa and title ix permit suits against the states.see varner illinois state university,cir b authorizes private suits against the states to enforce the epa citing kimel florida board of regents,d see also a states are not immune from suit under title ix.thus,we must resolve the eleventh amendment issues raised in this appeal.see floyd,at.
a.the epa claim 
the board argues that the eleventh amendment bars cherry epa claim.the eleventh amendment provides 
the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.
const.amend.xi.according to the amendment,states may not be sued by private individuals in federal court.board of trustees of the university of alabama garrett,d.but this immunity from suit is not absolute.college savings bank florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board,d.the supreme court has recognized that congress may abrogate the states eleventh amendment immunity when it both unequivocally intends to do so and act s pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.garrett.at quoting kimel,at.the court has held that the eleventh amendment is limited by the enforcement provisions of of the fourteenth amendment,and that congress may subject states to suit in federal court pursuant to a valid exercise of its power.garrett.at.accordingly,the epa can apply to the states only to the extent that the statute is appropriate legislation.id.
the fourteenth amendment provides,in relevant part 
section no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
section.the congress shall have power to enforce,by appropriate legislation,the provisions of this article.
const.amend.xiv kimel,at.section grants congress the power to enforce the substantive guarantees contained in by enacting appropriate legislation.garrett.at.hence,congress determines what legislation is necessary to secure the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment,and its conclusions are entitled to much deference.city of boerne flores,d.pursuant to,congress has the authority to remedy and deter violations of rights guaranteed under the fourteenth amendment by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct,including that which is not itself forbidden by the amendment text.garrett.at quoting kimel,at.
nevertheless,the supreme court has also recognized that grants congress the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment,not the power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation.kimel,at.quoting city of boerne,at.it is the responsibility of the supreme court,not congress,to define the substance of constitutional guarantees.garrett.at.in other words,congress can enact legislation to remedy or prevent conduct that violates the fourteenth amendment,but congress can not redefine or expand the substance of the fourteenth amendment itself.thus,there must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.kimel,at.quoting city of boerne,at.this means that congress must carefully tailor its legislation so that it enforces the fourteenth amendment without altering the amendment meaning.but the court has acknowledged that because it is often difficult to identify whether a statute constitutes appropriate remedial legislation,or instead effects a substantive redefinition of the fourteenth amendment right at issue,kimel,at,congress must have wide latitude in determining where that line lies.id.quoting city of boerne,at.
in applying the congruence and proportionality test to a federal statute,the supreme court has examined the scope of the statute to determine whether it is consistent and compatible with the fourteenth amendment,or whether it essentially expands the amendment by prohibiting more state action than would be unconstitutional.city of boerne,at.florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board college savings bank,d kimel,at.garrett.at.the court has also considered whether congress identified in the legislative record a pattern of unconstitutional conduct by the states that was targeted by the statute at issue in order to determine whether the statute is a proportional response to unconstitutional state action.city of boerne,at.florida prepaid,at.see also kimel,at.garrett.at.but the court has stated that the lack of support in the legislative record is not determinative of the inquiry.kimel,at.florida prepaid,at.see also city of boerne,at.such evidence tends to ensure that congress means are appropriate under when the statute in question pervasively prohibits constitutional state action.see city of boerne,at.
in four recent cases,the supreme court has held that congress exceeded its enforcement powers.in each case,the court found that the statute in question prohibited substantially more state action than would be unconstitutional.see city of boerne,at.the restrictions of the religious freedom restoration act rfra far exceed any pattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct by the states under the free exercise clause florida prepaid,at.under the patent remedy act,an unlimited range of state conduct would expose a state to claims of patent infringement kimel,at.the age discrimination in employment act adea prohibits substantially more state employment decisions and practices than would likely be held unconstitutional garrett.at the americans with disabilities act ada imposes restrictions that far exceed those of the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause.the court also concluded in each case that congress had not identified in the legislative record a pattern of unconstitutional conduct by the states that was targeted by the statutes.see city of boerne,at.rfra legislative record lacks examples of modern instances of generally applicable laws passed because of religious bigotry florida prepaid,at.in enacting the patent remedy act,however,congress identified no pattern of patent infringement by the states,let alone a pattern of constitutional violations.kimel,at.in enacting the adea,congress never identified any pattern of age discrimination by the states,much less any discrimination whatsoever that rose to the level of constitutional violation.garrett.at congress failure to mention states in its legislative findings addressing discrimination in employment reflects that body judgment that no pattern of unconstitutional state action had been documented.
in varner illinois state university,cir varner i,this court affirmed a district court finding that congress validly abrogated the states eleventh amendment immunity through its passage of the epa.on writ of certiorari to the supreme court,the varner i decision was vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of the court intervening decision in kimel,in which the court held that the adea was not a valid exercise of congress power under of the fourteenth amendment.kimel,at.varner illinois state university,cir,cert.denied,d varner ii.after considering kimel,this court issued varner ii in which it upheld the holding of varner i that congress validly abrogated the states immunity from epa claims.varner ii,at.
subsequent to varner ii,the supreme court issued board of trustees of the university of alabama garrett,d,in which the court held that congress failed to validly abrogate the states immunity from claims under the ada in support of the board immunity claim,it argues that garrett conflicts with varner ii,and thus that the eleventh amendment bars cherry epa claim.
in varner ii,this court first noted that the equal pay act prohibits discrimination in wages based on gender,at,and that a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case under the epa by demonstrating that she received unequal pay for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill,effort,and responsibility,and which are performed under similar working conditions.id.quoting d.thus,an employee may establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination under the epa without showing discriminatory intent.varner ii,at.in that sense the court acknowledged in varner ii the epa is unlike the fourteenth amendment,which requires a showing of the employer discriminatory intent,and thus the epa does not perfectly mirror the constitution prohibition on gender discrimination.id.but the court also noted that once an employee has met her burden of showing unequal pay for equal work,an employer may avoid liability under the act by proving that the wage disparity exists pursuant to a differential based on any other factor other than sex.id.q
