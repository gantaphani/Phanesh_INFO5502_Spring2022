plaintiff nicholas lassonde brings this action under,alleging that school officials violated his first amendment rights by censoring sectarian,proselytizing portions of a speech that plaintiff gave at his high school graduation ceremony.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants,concluding that the school officials acts were necessary to avoid violating the establishment clause.we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
because of his sterling average of,plaintiff was one of two of the amador valley high school class of.as a result of his academic standing,he was invited to deliver a speech at the school graduation ceremony that year.plaintiff,who is a devout christian,drafted a speech that quoted extensively from the bible.in his declaration,plaintiff explained that he intended for the speech to express his desire for his fellow graduates to develop a personal relationship with god through faith in christ in order to better their lives.
principal coupe,who maintained control over all aspects of the graduation ceremony,asked plaintiff to submit a draft of his speech.plaintiff did so.coupe reviewed the draft and,in conjunction with the school district counsel,determined that allowing a student to deliver overtly proselytizing comments at a public high school graduation ceremony would violate the establishment clauses of both the united states and the california constitutions.accordingly,coupe and the district counsel advised plaintiff that references to god as they related to plaintiff own beliefs were permissible,but that proselytizing comments were not.
for example,plaintiff intended to discuss the general moral decay of american society during the past years and to encourage his fellow students to turn to god and jesus for strength.the three portions of his speech that the school told him to remove were 
i urge you to seek out the lord,and let him guide you.through his power,you can stand tall in the face of darkness,and survive the trends of modern society.
as psalm says,do not put your trust in princes,in mortal men,who can not even save themselves.when their spirit departs,they return to the ground on that very day their plans come to nothing.blessed is he whose help is the god of jacob,whose hope is in the lord his god,the maker of heaven and earth,the sea,and everything in lord,who remains faithful forever.he upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry.the lord sets prisoners free,the lord gives sight to the blind,the lord lifts up those who are bowed down,the lord loves the righteous.the lord watches over the alien and sustains the fatherless and the widow,but he frustrates the ways of the wicked.
for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord.have you accepted the gift,or will you pay the ultimate price 
although defendants demanded that plaintiff excise those portions,they allowed him to retain several personal references to his religion.for example,plaintiff speech began with a dedication to the memory of his grandfather,who had planned to attend the graduation but who,just that past week,had gone home to be with the lord.plaintiff speech closed with the words,good luck and god bless 
before plaintiff agreed to excise the proselytizing portions of the graduation speech,the parties engaged in discussions to determine what plaintiff would and would not be allowed to say.plaintiff counsel suggested that the school district provide a disclaimer that would state that the views of the student speakers did not represent the views of the school district.this suggestion was rejected.the parties eventually reached a compromise.under protest,plaintiff agreed that he would deliver his speech without the proselytizing passages and would hand out copies of the full text of his proposed draft speech just outside the site where the graduation ceremony would be held.
on june,amador valley high school held its graduation ceremony.the ceremony took place at the alameda county fairgrounds,but it was financed and insured entirely by the school district and was conducted entirely under the school direction.plaintiff delivered his speech at the ceremony and distributed handouts as agreed.when he reached the portions of the speech that had been excised,he informed his fellow students that portions had been censored.he told the audience that he would distribute copies of the uncensored speech outside the graduation ceremony and that he would give the full speech on sunday at his church.
nearly one year later,plaintiff filed this action seeking damages from the school district mary frances callan,the school district superintendent jim negri,assistant superintendent and bill coupe,the principal.plaintiff asserted seven claims against defendants violation of plaintiff federal constitutional rights to free speech,religious liberty,and equal protection violation of plaintiff state constitutional rights to free speech,religious liberty,and equal protection and violation of a state education statute.defendants answered that their actions were protected by qualified immunity.
both parties moved for summary judgment.after dismissing claims against the school district and the school officials in their individual capacities under the eleventh amendment,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the remaining defendants in their official capacities.relying on this court decision in cole oroville union high school district,cir,the district court concluded that defendants actions were necessary to avoid violating the establishment clause.the court rejected plaintiff equal protection argument and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff claim.
plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.his appeal is limited to the question whether,under the first step of the qualified immunity analysis required by saucier katz,d,plaintiff has alleged facts amounting to a federal constitutional violation.specifically,the questions posed are whether the restriction on plaintiff speech violated the first amendment and whether the school rejection of plaintiff suggested disclaimer as a less restrictive alternative to censoring plaintiff speech violated the first amendment.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.henderson city of simi valley,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if,drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,there are no genuine issues of material fact.id.
discussion 
under saucier,at,we must conduct a inquiry in order to determine whether defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.first,we must decide whether plaintiff has asserted facts that amount to a violation of his federal constitutional rights.id.if so,we must decide whether the law surrounding that constitutional violation was clearly established when defendants acted.id.
at the first step,plaintiff has not alleged facts amounting to a constitutional violation.that being so,we need not reach the second step of the saucier analysis.
under our precedent in cole,defendants actions were necessary to avoid a conflict with the establishment clause.at.the supreme court opinion in good news club milford central school,d,which was decided after cole,does not require a different result.
cole controls.
our decision in cole squarely controls plaintiff case.the facts are almost identical the student speakers in cole,one of whom was a,sought to give similar proselytizing speeches at their graduation ceremony.cole,at.as was its policy,the school district reviewed the speeches before the graduation ceremony took place.id.the school district required that the students in cole tone down the proselytizing and sectarian religious references.id.the students refused and sued for damages.
applying a qualified immunity analysis that is consistent with saucier,at,we concluded in cole that we need not go beyond the first step 
we conclude the district officials did not violate the students freedom of speech.even assuming the oroville graduation ceremony was a public or limited public forum,the district refusal to allow the students to deliver a sectarian speec
