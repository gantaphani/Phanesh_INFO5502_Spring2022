fifteen female plaintiffs collectively,employees formerly or currently employed as janitors by the east baton rouge parish school board appeal the district court decisions granting summary judgment in favor of the board,its individuals members,and james manley,the personnel supervisor for the board maintenance department collectively,the board.in granting summary judgment,the district court dismissed employees title vii retaliation and disparate impact discrimination claims,as well as their retaliation claim,against the board.employees argue that the district court erred in concluding that employees failed to make a prima facie showing of an adverse employment action under either title vii or.according to employees,the board implementation of a reading requirement and new salary structure for a new janitor position,which was created pursuant to a consent decree entered into with the department of justice the doj,thwarted employees immediate promotion.this action,according to employees,kept them from reaching their appropriate pay level and step and was,therefore,an adverse employment action under both title vii and.employees also argue that the district court erred in concluding that employees failed to make a prima facie showing under title vii that the reading requirement,implemented by the board,selected applicants for the new janitor position in a discriminatory pattern resulting in a imbalance in the board workforce.
we begin with a brief summary of the unique facts of this case.the board employed janitors in three capacities janitor i,janitor ii,and janitor iii.janitor i employees,all of whom were female,worked for six hours a day,nine months of the year.they were responsible for performing the most basic janitorial tasks.the janitor ii employees,most of whom were male,worked eight hours a day for the entire year.they were responsible for performing tasks essentially the same as those performed by janitor i employees,with the addition of some duties,such as lawn care.janitor iii employees,all of whom were male,worked and were responsible for performing tasks essentially the same as those performed by janitor i and janitor ii employees,with the addition of some supervisory tasks,such as locking up buildings and supervising cleaning crews.
the employees,all of whom are female,were janitor i employees.after the board decided to eliminate the medical benefits received by janitor i employees and to reduce their working hours from six hours per day to four hours per day,a number of janitor i employees,including employees,sued the board in state court,alleging that the board action had a disparate impact on female employees in violation of louisiana state law,since all janitor i employees were female.their suit also alleged intentional sex discrimination in violation of louisiana state law.
while the state court lawsuit was still pending the doj began an inquiry into the board procedures for placing women into the janitor ii and janitor iii positions.the impetus for the doj investigation was the allegation that the board discriminated against women on the basis of their gender in violation of title vii by reserving the janitor ii and janitor iii positions for males only.
subsequently,the board began to evaluate all school system positions,including job descriptions and salary schedules,for the stated purpose of eliminating the inefficient use of resources.all janitor and custodian classifications were included in this study.the board decided to phase out the janitor position and replace it with two new positions janitor and lead janitor.the janitor position the new janitor position combined the duties of the janitor i and janitor ii positions.the lead janitor position was intended to be the equivalent of the janitor iii position.both the new janitor position and the lead janitor position were positions,with medical benefits.however,the board created a new pay scale,which resulted in lower hourly pay for any janitor i employee who accepted the new janitor position.additionally,the board implemented a testing procedure to select applicants for the new janitor position.applicants were required to take and pass a practical test involving the use of maintenance equipment,as well as a reading test,which tested an applicant ability to read at an level.applicants for the lead janitor position were not required to take either of these two tests.
the board implementation of the reading test for the new janitor position was,according to the board,its response to an incident in which at least one board employee was sickened as a result of a custodian failure to follow printed instructions on the use of a pesticide.the board maintains that safety concerns demanded its new janitors be able to read at an level,since the safety guidelines of the occupational safety and health administration were written on an level,as were most material safety data sheets,which are required for all chemicals used in the workplace.
the board subsequently entered into a consent decree the consent decree with the doj,which incorporated the board plan for the new janitor position and lead janitor position,as well as its plan for a new salary structure.the purpose of the consent decree was to resolve all issues raised by the doj in a separate lawsuit that the doj,after its lengthy investigation of the board,brought against the board under title vii,alleging discrimination against females in the hiring and promotion of janitors.see united states east baton rouge parish sch.the consent decree provided that interested and qualified incumbent employees in the janitor i positions would be provided an opportunity to be promoted to the new janitor position.it made no mention of the reading requirement,though it did state that a pplicants selected for possible employment as janitors or lead janitors may be required by the school board to pass additional lawful and selection devices or requirements.
thereafter,when employees except those who chose not to do so applied for the new janitor position,they took the practical test and the reading test though all passed the practical test,only one passed the reading test unlike the substitutes and applicants off the street who were later given an opportunity to apply for the new janitor position,janitor i employees who failed the reading test were given the option of either remaining in their old janitor i jobs or taking the new janitor position on a probationary basis,regardless of their current reading ability attendance at adult reading classes was a condition of this probation.those who accepted the probationary janitor position would be paid at the lowest step in the new pay scheme until demonstrating an reading level on the retest,at which time the person would be moved up the salary schedule to a step corresponding to the step she had occupied on the old janitor i salary schedule.according to employees,some were informed that,if they failed the reading test a second time,they would lose their jobs and all were informed that,if they decided to accept the new janitor position on a probationary basis,they could not return to their old janitor i positions.employees also claim that they were informed that any janitor i employee who failed the first reading test for the new janitor position would not be allowed to remain in her current janitor i position while preparing to retake the test.also,according to employees,when plaintiff rosa malveau asked james manley why the janitor i employees had to take a reading test for the new janitor position,manley responded,that what you get for filing a lawsuit.
after filing a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission,in which employees claimed that the board discriminated against them on the basis of their gender and retaliated against them for participating in the state court lawsuit,employees filed the instant suit against the board in the federal district court.their federal suit claimed unlawful retaliation and disparate impact employment discrimination under title vii,as well as unlawful retaliation under.concluding that employees failed to state a prima facie case of retaliation or disparate impact discrimination under title vii,or of retaliation under,the district court granted the board motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of employees claims.

employees contend that the board implemented the new salary structure and reading requirement for the new janitor position in retaliation for employees participation in a previous state lawsuit against the board.according to employees,the district court erred in concluding that employees failed to make a prima facie case of retaliation under title vii 
to survive summary judgment in a title vii retaliation case,the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that the plaintiff engaged in activity protected by title vii,that an adverse employment action occurred,and that a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse action.raggs.power light,cir.an employment action that does not affect job duties,compensation,or benefits is not an adverse employment action under title vii.hunt rapides healthcare,llc,cir.only ultimate employment decisions such as hiring,granting leave,discharging,promoting,and compensating satisfy the adverse employment action element.dollis rubin,cir citation omitted.a demotion also qualifies as an adverse employment action under title vii.sharp city of houston,cir.title vii does not,however,address every decision made by employers that arguably might have some tangential effect upon those ultimate decisions.burger cent.apartment,cir.for example,a decision made by an employer that only limits an employee opportunities for promotion or lateral transfer does not qualify as an adverse employment action under title vii.see burger,at holding that an employer refusal of an employee request for a purely lateral transfer does not qualify as an adverse employment action under title vii dollis,at affirming the decision that an employer denial of a desk audit to a female employee is not an adverse personnel action under title vii,even though the employee claimed it was an ultimate employment decision that restricted her promotional opportunities.
here,the district court reasoned that employees failed to demonstrate that the board implementation of the reading requirement and new salary structure for the new janitor position was an ultimate employment decision,since the creation of the new janitor position was not an ordinary promotion situation,and since employees had the choice of staying in their current janitor i positions with no adverse consequences.however,according to employees,the board implementation of a reading requirement and a new salary structure for the new janitor position thwarted employees immediate promotion to their appropriate pay level and step and was,therefore,an ultimate employment decision.the board placement of onerous conditions on the new janitor position,employees contend,denied employees the greater hours,greater compensation,and medical benefits which they sought.
regardless of whether the conditions placed on the new janitor position were unfavorable to employees seeking to be promoted to it,the board implementation of this new position,with its new salary structure and reading requirement,did not amount to an ultimate employment decision under title vii.as the district court correctly reasoned,the move from janitor i to the new janitor position was not a part of any internal ordered scheme of promotion to which the plaintiffs were entitled,either from years of service or job performance.pursuant to the consent decree,which provided that interested and qualified incumbent employees in the janitor i positions would be provided an opportunity to be promoted to the new janitor position,the board gave employees a right of first refusal for the new janitor position yet,employees have not provided any authority showing that an employer act of giving an employee a right of first refusal for a new job can constitute an ultimate employment decision under title vii.neither have employees demonstrated that,by giving employees a right of first refusal for the new janitor position,the board in any way coerced employees into accepting that position and its lower hourly wages on the contrary,the summary judgment evidence established that,consistent with the consent decree,janitor i employees who either did not apply for the new janitor position or did not accept the position on a probationary basis were allowed to stay in their janitor i positions at their current wage rate and seniority status,free from adverse consequences thus,the board implementation of the new janitor position,for which employees had a right of first refusal,did not constitute an ultimate employment decision because it did not affect employees job duties,compensation,or level of benefits as janitor i employees.see hunt,at.
as for the reading requirement,employees argue that its implementation was an ultimate employment decision by the board because it was represented to employees as the requirement for an immediate promotion to a position which they sought,and because it was a stumbling block to their immediate promotion to the position,for which,employees claim,they were qualified we do not agree that the board implementation of the reading requirement constituted an ultimate employment decision.although the reading test prevented all but one of the employees from making an immediate change to the new janitor position,any of the employees who failed the reading test still had the option of exercising her right of first refusal and occupying the new janitor position on a probationary basis until the retest.because employees do not allege that the reading test was unfairly rigged to prevent them from passing,we may assume that the test was a fair assessment of reading skills.see mattern eastman kodak,cir reasoning that,because the plaintiff who failed two major skills tests did not maintain that the tests were unfairly rigged,the tests were,presumably,a correct assessment of her ability to perform those skills.even assuming that the board told employees they would lose their jobs if they accepted the probationary position but failed the retest,the board decision to implement the reading requirement was,at most,a mediate decision that could lead to an adverse employment decision for an applicant who failed that retest.thus,the board decision to implement the reading requirement for the new janitor position does not qualify as an ultimate employment decision under title vii.see dollis,at title vii provision does not refer to interlocutory or mediate decision s which can lead to an ultimate decision.internal quotations omitted.
for these reasons,we conclude that employees failed to show that the board implementation of the reading requirement and new salary structure for the new janitor constituted an adverse employment decision we therefore hold that the district court correctly decided that employees failed to make a prima facie showing of title vii retaliation.
employees argue that the board actions had a disparate impact on female janitorial employees,since the only persons impacted by the reading test were janitor i employees,all of whom were female.thus,according to employees,the district court erred in ruling that employees failed to state a prima facie case of disparate impact employment discrimination under title vii.the district court reasoned that employees failed to show that the reading requirement resulted in a imbalance in the board workforce,regardless of any imbalance in the workforce.
to establish a prima facie case of title vii disparate impact employment discrimination,a plaintiff must show that the employer facially neutral hiring standards select applicants in a significantly discriminatory pattern.dothard rawlinson,d citing griggs duke
