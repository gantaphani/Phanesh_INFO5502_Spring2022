on december,linh thanongsinh,a custodian at oakhill elementary school,brought the present suit against his employer,school district the school district,and his supervisor,hanan javetz,in his individual and official capacities.thanongsinh alleges that he was demoted from group v head custodian to group ii building custodian in violation of both title vii,see et,and a.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.the plaintiff now appeals.we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.facts 
thanongsinh,an of chinese and laotian descent,began working as a custodian for school district in.he subsequently was promoted to the position of group v head custodian and assigned to oakhill elementary school in kane county,illinois.his immediate supervisor at oakhill was hanan javetz,the director of plant operations for the school district.
thanongsinh received consistently favorable work performance evaluations while employed as a group v head custodian at oakhill.for example,in,the principal of oakhill,carolyn,ranked as outstanding or exceptionally high thanongsinh job knowledge,quantity and quality of work,dependability,organization,flexibility and potential level of ability thanongsinh was given excellent or high marks in the remaining categories,attendance and cooperation,at.remarked in this evaluation that thanongsinh is fussy about things being done right.this was especially evident after our retrofitting project was completed,id.at,and that he can do many things in the way of repairs,and he does so,id.at.
similarly,in,gave thanongsinh the highest marks possible in the categories of job knowledge,quantity of work,dependability,organization,flexibility and potential level of ability.he received favorable marks in the other of work,attendance and cooperation.added the following comments 
linh has a wide variety of skills related to maintenance and upkeep of the physical plant,equipment and supplies.these skills are evidenced by the work he has done in the areas of plumbing,electricity,and hvac,without assistance of those in the trades.
id.at.concluded that thanongsinh is fully capable of handling more responsibility.id.at 
the employment of school district custodians is governed by a collective bargaining agreement between the school district and the education support services organization,the union that represents school district employees.in late,the school district and the union,due to budgetary constraints,agreed to phase out group v custodians through the implementation of a certification process.to remain a group v custodian under the collective bargaining agreement the agreement,the employee first was required to score at least out of on a written exam.if he scored below,he was permitted to retest if,however,after the second try,he did not pass the written exam,he would not be allowed to proceed to the second portion of the exam,which tested skills.by contrast,those who scored or above on the written exam then were asked to perform tasks for which a group v head custodian traditionally is example,testing boiler water and performing asbestos and playground inspections to obtain certification,the employee average score from the two portions of the test had to equal or exceed.see collective bargaining agreement.
thanongsinh took the written portion of the test in november.he received a score of.he proceeded to the portion of the exam,which was administered on march,by javetz and ron dugo,the maintenance supervisor for the school district.he received a score of.the average of his written and scores was,which,under the terms of the agreement,constituted a failing score.
pursuant to this agreement,thanongsinh was permitted to retake the test.he received a score of on the written portion and did not advance to the portion of the exam.effective july,the school district therefore demoted thanongsinh to the position of group ii building custodian as a group v head custodian,thanongsinh had earned per hour upon demotion,he suffered a pay loss of approximately per hour.although thanongsinh remains employed as a custodian at oakhill,numerous job responsibilities formerly performed by thanongsinh were reassigned upon his demotion to a group employee,mike digioia,who visits oakhill once weekly.
shortly after thanongsinh demotion,his union representative requested a meeting with school district officials to discuss the reduction in pay associated with thanongsinh demotion.the persons present at this meeting included thanongsinh his union representative catherine mcnamara,a school district supervisor and javetz.thanongsinh expressed at the meeting his frustration with the difficulty of the test javetz response to thanongsinh concerns is the subject of vigorous dispute between the parties.in his affidavit,thanongsinh claimed 
at the meeting,i began explaining my side of the story regarding the portion of the certification testing program.javetz crossed his arms and said in an argumentative manner that he could not understand me.he immediately thereafter stated that i should learn better english.javetz comment about my alleged need to learn better english was not made in response to any statements by me in regard to the written portion of the certification exam or my english language abilities.
at.javetz,by contrast,testified in his deposition that he merely suggested to thanongsinh that he improve his english skills because,without such skills,there would be little opportunity for job advancement 
i said any position,if you want to move to a higher position from four and higher,you have to take a written test and to pass the test you need to have some basic or even a little higher than basic english skills.so to do that,to be more successful,you know,i would recommend that you can see if we had some free incentive administration,basically,the same idea,some programs that might be free to improve your skills.
district court proceedings 
upon receiving a letter from the eeoc,on december,thanongsinh filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois against the school district and javetz.he alleged that his demotion was motivated by his race,in violation of both title vii,see et,and a specifically,thanongsinh claimed that he had the ability to meet and exceed the expectations for the test,but that javetz scoring and administration of that portion of the test was racially motivated and willful and wanton.at.he requested both equitable and legal relief,including back pay,attorneys fees and compensatory and punitive damages.
after the district court denied the defendants motion to dismiss,the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.in this motion,the defendants contended that thanongsinh had not established a prima facie case of discrimination and had not rebutted the defendants claim that he was demoted for the legitimate,reason that he was unable to pass the group v certification exam.the defendants also contended that javetz could not be held liable in his official capacity under title vii because the claim was duplicative of the plaintiff claims against the school district.
in response to this motion,thanongsinh invited the court attention to three pieces of evidence that he claims demonstrate that the portion of the test was scored in a discriminatory manner.first,according to thanongsinh,he was scored in a manner different from at least one caucasian custodian,mitchell cain.specifically,on topic of the exam,group v head custodians were required to demonstrate their knowledge of how to complete material safety data sheets.thanongsinh forgot to bring his materials to the exam and therefore was awarded zero points for these questions.cain score sheet indicates that he also forgot to bring his materials to the exam nevertheless,javetz and the other school district official administering the exam asked cain the relevant questions,and cain was awarded a score of out of on topic.second,thanongsinh contended that he was not given calming instructions at the commencement of the exam,as were caucasian applicants.at.as a result,the testing room was filled with tension in the air,causing thanongsinh nervousness and anxiety and,ultimately,resulting in mistakes on the exam.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.third,thanongsinh claimed that javetz gave caucasian custodians an average score on the exam of,while he gave minority custodians an average score of,supporting an inference of discriminatory intent.
on march,the defendants filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment,requesting that the court also dismiss thanongsinh claims against javetz in his individual capacity.the defendants contended that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that javetz personally participated in the administration of the written tests that led to thanongsinh demotion.at.
the district court granted the defendants motions for summary judgment on june.applying the analysis of mcdonnell douglas green,d,the court first held that thanongsinh was not qualified as a group v head custodian 
thanongsinh admits that he attempted to obtain certification on three separate occasions and that he received a failing score on all three attempts.thanongsinh was given every opportunity to achieve certification.the fact that on two of his three attempts he could not even proceed past the written portion of the certification process which tests his knowledge of the requirements for a group v position is a clear indication that he was not qualified for the position.
at internal citations omitted.
the district court next concluded that thanongsinh had failed to identify similarly situated individuals who were treated more favorably than he.mitchell cain,according to the court,perhaps was similarly situated to thanongsinh because both were group v employees,but the only evidence that cain was treated more favorably than interview score inadmissible at trial.according to the court,
thanongsinh has pointed to no testimony or evidence that would lay a proper foundation for the introduction of the score sheet at trial.in the testimony of dugo that thanongsinh refers to on this issue,dugo merely indicated what information he saw on the paper given to him at the deposition.
id.at.additionally,mike digioia,the caucasian employee who took over various custodial responsibilities from thanongsinh at oakhill,is not similarly situated to thanongsinh because he is not a group v employee.notably,he was not required to take the group v certification exam,the subject of the present litigation.the court further rejected the contention that the caucasian employees who had taken the group v certification exam and therefore are similarly situated to thanongsinh were treated more favorably than he was because of calming instructions administered at the beginning of the exam.id.at.there is no evidence,according to the district court,that the administration or of these instructions was based on the applicant race.rather,one of the interviewers,cathy mcnamara,gave the instructions to all candidates,whereas other interviewers,such as dugo and javetz,gave the instructions to no candidate.see id.at concluding that the calming instructions were merely how mcnamara chose to speak to the test takers before administering the tests.
the district court also held that,even if thanongsinh could establish a prima facie case of discrimination,the defendants had offered a legitimate,reason for his thanongsinh failed the certification exam.according to the district court,the plaintiff had not established that this reason was pretextual.first,thanongsinh favorable work performance evaluations as a group v head custodian do not automatically mean that he would not make mistakes on the test.id.at.moreover,thanongsinh comparison of passage rates for minority versus candidates was based on pure speculation the relevant inquiry is not the raw scores received by candidates of a particular race,but whether all applicants received fair scores based upon their performance on the tests.id.evidence that javetz harbored animosity towards thanongsinh also was not dispositive,according to the court stress or tension in the examination room logically could be attributed to the natural atmosphere that might develop during a test which is often a stressful experience for a test taker.id.at.finally,the district court held that the stray comment by javetz in the meeting that thanongsinh should learn better english merely was intended as helpful advice it simply is not sufficient evidence to meet the pretext requirement even when considered with the other evidence mentioned above.id.
with regard to the title vii and claims against javetz in his official capacity the district court dismissed them as redundant,holding that they were synonymous with the claim against the public entity itself.id.at.
lastly,the district court granted summary judgment to the school district and javetz in his individual capacity on the plaintiff claims.it held that there was no evidence of a policy or practice of discrimination by the district.id.at.with regard to the individual claim against javetz,the court reiterated that thanongsinh had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination and held that there certainly was no specific evidence that any discriminatory conduct concerned the making and enforcing of a contract,a requisite element of a cause of action.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the plaintiff timely appealed.
discussion 
the plaintiff submits that the district court erred in dismissing his title vii claims against the school district and his claim against javetz in his individual capacity our review of a district court judgment on a motion for summary judgment is de novo.see in re copper antitrust,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d.our function is not to weigh the evidence but merely to determine if there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.in performing this task,we must construe all facts and draw all reasonable inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see id.at.
under title vii,an employer may not discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a.a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of discrimination in response to a motion for summary judgment in one of two ways by producing direct or circumstantial evidence under the direct method of proof or by utilizing the indirect,method set forth in mcdonnell douglas,d.
thanongsinh relies on the indirect method of proof,which requires him to demonstrate that he is a member of a protected class is qualified for the position sought was rejected for the position and was treated less favorably than similarly situated individuals outside of his protected class.see id.at.if a plaintiff fulfills all four requirements,then the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate a legitimate,reason for the adverse employment action taken.see id.at.the plaintiff ultimately bears the burden of producing sufficient evidence from which a reasonable could conclude that the defendant proffered reason is pretextual.see id.at.
thanongsinh raises three issues with regard to his title vii claim whether he is qualified for the position of group v head custodian whether he has identified similarly situated individuals outside his protected class who were treated more favorably than he and whether his failure to pass the portion of the certification exam constitutes a,justification for his demotion we address each of these issues in turn.
qualification 
to show that he was meeting his employer legitimate expectations at the time of his demotion,thanongsinh relies on his and work performance evaluations and the deposition testimony of ron dugo.see dugo,at stating that,under thanongsinh care,oakhill was in generally good condition.the defendants concede that thanongsinh received strong annual employment evaluations,but contend that he nevertheless was not meeting the school district legitimate expectations because he failed to obtain group v certification under the terms of the agreement between the union and the school district.
we do not think that the defendants can rely on the certification test to establish that the plaintiff lacks the requisite qualifications to be a group v head custodian.after all,thanongsinh alleges that the administration of that examination in a racially discriminatory manner was the vehicle employed by the school board to demote him on account of his race.consequently,the results of that examination can not be the basis of establishing that thanongsinh is unqualified as a head custodian.
certainly,thanongsinh certification through a fairly administered examination would be a legitimate measure of his qualification as a group v head custodian.here,however,the integrity of the administered examination is at issue,and thanongsinh is attempting to establish,through the indirect method,that the examination was administered in a racially discriminatory manner.at this initial stage of the proceedings,therefore,we must rely on the record evidence of thanongsinh performance,other than the examination,to determine whether he has met this initial requirement of his prima facie case.
the other evidence of record is the very favorable work reviews that he had received in the past for performing the duties of a group v head custodian.notably,performing on a daily basis tasks that are similar in form and substance to the tasks tested on the exam,thanongsinh received consistently favorable annual reviews from the principal of oakhill.he was commended for the pride and ownership he shows for oakhill school in,at his job knowledge and quality of work in,see id.at and his wide variety of skills and capab ility in,id.at.this evidence is sufficient to show that thanongsinh was performing his duties satisfactorily.johnson zema,cir johnson bears a burden only of producing some evidence that he was meeting zema legitimate expectations.in coming forward with consistently positive employment evaluations and president reyes recommendation,johnson has met his burden.
the defendants nevertheless maintain that thanongsinh failure to pass the written certification exam on his second and third attempts demonstrates that he does not have the requisite skill level to perform competently the responsibilities of a group v head custodian.they contend that there is no causal link between the allegedly discriminatory administration of the portion of the exam and thanongsinh demotion.in their view,thanongsinh suffered no adverse employment action at the time of his failure of the portion,but instead was not demoted until after having failed the written portion of the exam for the third time in september.appellees br.at.
we can not accept this argument.at this stage of the proceedings,we must assume that there is at least the possibility that the scores thanongsinh received on his second and third attempts to pass the written exam were tainted by the results of the exam.thanongsinh testified in his deposition that he reviewed his materials for the first written exam in november,but chose not to study before retaking the exam in june or in september.see,at.a jury reasonably could conclude that thanongsinh indifference in preparing to retake the written exam was traceable to the defendants discriminatory conduct if an individual believes that the outcome of an event may be beyond his control because of an improper consideration,such as his race,it certainly is reasonable that he would exert less than maximum effort in readying himself for that event.int l of teamsters united states,d when a person desire for a job is not translated into a formal application solely because of his unwillingness to engage in a futile gesture he is as much a victim of discrimination as is he who goes through the motions of submitting an application.even if this were not true,we have no difficulty in finding a causal relationship between the defendants allegedly discriminatory conduct and thanongsinh ultimate demotion.reading the evidence in the light most favorable to the,thanongsinh was required to retake the written exam only because of the defendants discriminatory conduct had the portion of the test been scored fairly,thanongsinh would have received a passing score on his first certification exam.vakharia swedish covenant,cir observing that,when the standards for assessing qualifications are themselves allegedly discriminatory,whether the plaintiff was meeting her employer legitimate performance expectations dovetails with the issue of pretext and requires a court to assume,for the purpose of reaching the pretext inquiry,that the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case.
the district court therefore erred in determining that thanongsinh had not met his burden of establishing under mcdonnell douglas that he was meeting his employer expectations as a group v head custodian.
similarly situated individuals 
the district court also erred in determining that thanongsinh had not identified similarly situated individuals outside of his protected class who were treated more favorably on the portion of the exam than he.to be similarly situated to the plaintiff,an individual must be directly comparable to the plaintiff in all material respects.brummett sinclair broad.group,cir internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.in the course of this inquiry,we consider all of the relevant factors,including 
whether the employees i held the same job description,ii were subject to the same standards,iii were subordinate to the same supervisor,and iv had comparable experience,education,and other the employer considered the latter factors in making the personnel decision.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.thanongsinh identifies a number of similarly situated employees we address each relevant individual in turn.
mike digioa 
the first similarly situated individual identified by the plaintiff is mike digioia,a caucasian group custodian employed by the school district.after thanongsinh was demoted to the position of group ii custodian,various custodial tasks previously performed by thanongsinh at oakhill were transferred to digioia,who travels among various elementary schools in the area and visits oakhill once weekly.
the plaintiff comparison is unavailing.unlike thanongsinh,who before his demotion was a group v employee,digioia is a group employee.although in some situations this may be merely a job title,appellant br.at internal quotation marks omitted,in this context it is a material distinction.under the agreement between the school district and the union,only group v employees were required to take the group v certification exam therefore,digioia,as a group employee,never took this exam.he was not subject to the same standards as,and can not be considered similarly situated to,thanongsinh.brummett,at.
mitchell cain 
thanongsinh also identifies mitchell cain as a similarly situated individual.we agree that cain meets the criteria of a similarly situated individual.cain is a caucasian male who,at the time of taking the group v certification exam,had been employed by the school district as a head custodian for a year.in that position,he had a job description similar to and was subject to the same standards as thanongsinh.specifically,like thanongsinh,cain was required to obtain an average composite score of on the certification exam to remain a group v employee.although it is not clear from this record whether cain and thanongsinh had the same supervisor,thanongsinh and cain certification exams both were administered by javetz.
thanongsinh has presented sufficient evidence that he was treated less favorably than cain by the interviewers.notably,both men forgot to bring their materials to the portion of the exam.see thanongsinh score sheet,at interviewers handwrote do have next to question cain score sheet,noting,in the narrative section,no book the test administrators therefore awarded thanongsinh zero points on topic of the portion of the exam,which required the candidate to answer various questions related to the materials.see also dugo,at explaining that thanongsinh m ost likely received zero points on these questions because he did not bring to the interview his materials.but cain,despite also failing to bring the relevant documents to the exam,was awarded ten points on topic,after being asked by the interviewers questions related to the missing materials.
the defendants respond that the only evidence supporting the conclusion that cain and thanongsinh were treated differently by interviewers is inadmissible.the district court held that thanongsinh had failed to lay a proper foundation for the admission of the document containing cain interview scores and the interviewers handwritten notes according to the court,because the document would be inadmissible at trial,it also could not be relied upon by thanongsinh to survive summary judgment.we review the district court evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion.see united states white,cir this court will reverse a district court evidentiary ruling only upon a showing that the district court committed an abuse of discretion.
the district court abused its discretion when it excluded the interviewers score sheet from cain interview and the handwritten notes on that sheet.this document is admissible under the business record exception to the hearsay rule.see.rule provides that 
a memorandum,report,record,or data compilation,in any form,of acts,events,conditions,opinions,or diagnoses,made at or near the time by,or from information transmitted by,a person with knowledge,if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity,and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum,report,record or data compilation,all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness,or by certification that complies with rule or rule 
shall be admissible at trial,even when introduced for the truth of the matter asserted.id.because a business depends on the accuracy of its recordkeeping,its records,although of course not sworn,are likely to be at least reasonably accurate,or at least not contrived for the purpose of making the business look better if it is sued.lust sealy,cir.
in this case,cain score sheet is precisely the type of memorandum or record that falls within the ambit of the business record exception.first,the parties do not dispute that interviews were conducted,the sheets completed and kept,and the notes taken in the normal course of business.it was the regular practice of the school district to conduct certification interviews of group v employees pursuant to their agreement for certification testing with the union.id.moreover,it was the school district regular practice to keep records of these interviews,ex at second,the cain score sheet was completed at or near the time of the events in question.there is no reason to believe that the handwritten comments,such as the notation that cain had forgotten his materials,were not made during the interview itself.lastly,the score sheet was completed by person s with knowledge the interviewers,mcnamara and javetz these two administrators filled out the score sheet as a way to transmit information about the content of the interview to other school district officials,in order to facilitate an informed certification decision and to maintain accurate personnel records.
the defendants respond that cain score sheet has not been properly authenticated because,in response to the motion for summary judgment,thanongsinh did not present testimony from the person who created the record.appellees br.at.but thanongsinh need not present testimony from the interviewers themselves rather,rule permits the authentication of a business record by the custodian of the record or any other qualified witness.ordinarily,the custodian or other qualified witness will testify in court that it was the regular practice of the business to make and keep the business record.id.alternatively,the plaintiff can certify the document under rule or,both of which require the plaintiff to introduce at trial a written declaration by the custodian or other qualified person that the record 
a was made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters set forth by,or from information transmitted by,a person with knowledge of those matters 
b was kept in the course of the regularly conducted activity and 
c was made by the regularly conducted activity as a regular practice.
in both situations,the custodian need not be the individual who personally gather ed in a business record.the custodian of the records need not be in control of or have individual knowledge of the particular corporate records,but need only be familiar with the company recordkeeping practices.united states jenkins,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
on appeal from an order granting summary judgment,the party seeking admission of a document as a business record need not have secured already the deposition testimony of these witnesses.instead,he only need establish that the document has sufficient indicia of trustworthiness to be considered reliable.woods city of chicago,cir.generally,
to demonstrate such trustworthiness and reliability at the summary judgment stage,the party seeking to offer the business record must attach an affidavit sworn to by a person who would be qualified to introduce the record as evidence at trial,for example,a custodian or anyone qualified to speak from personal knowledge that the documents were admissible business records.
see also patel,cir holding that the affidavits submitted by the plaintiff constitute d appropriate summary judgment evidence adequate to support a grant of summary judgment,given that those affidavits were sworn to by employees of the bank who were familiar with its practices and therefore were qualified to speak from personal knowledge that the documents attached to the affidavits are admissible business records.the requirement that the party seeking the admission of the evidence must submit supporting affidavits,however,has been relaxed by this court in certain,limited circumstances.for example,in woods,the plaintiff contended that the district court had erred in relying on his arrest report and misdemeanor complaint in granting summary judgment to the defendants because those documents contained inadmissible hearsay the plaintiff further submitted that the documents were not admissible as business records because they had not been properly authenticated by an affidavit sworn to by the custodian of the record or by an individual with personal knowledge of the events.although recognizing that,in most cases,an affidavit authenticating the document as a business record is required at summary judgment,we held that an exception is applicable when the party challenging the document admissibility relied on that same document for its accuracy in earlier proceedings,or otherwise conceded the accuracy of the documents that the opposing party sought to introduce.woods,at.
in this case,thanongsinh has not submitted an affidavit by the custodian of the school district records,attesting that the cain score sheet qualifies as a business record under rule.but a careful examination of the record reveals that the defendants have conceded the admissibility of cain score sheet see id.first,they admitted in discovery that the score sheet is what the plaintiff purports it to be.as verified by the affidavit sworn to by thanongsinh attorney,see,cain score sheet was produced by the school district in the course of discovery.the school district then confirmed in its response to the plaintiff interrogatories that cain w as tested by defendant school district,and that cain score sheet was the product of testing for the group v certification exam,ex at producing,in response to an interrogatory,cain score sheet.the school district also confirmed that cathy mcnamara was the individual from school district who filled out the test topics sheet produced by the defendants,ex at interrogatory.
our sister circuits have held documents to be admissible under the business record exception under similar circumstances.for example,in cerqueira cerqueira,cir,the plaintiff disputed the admissibility of an unsigned agreement between the parties prepared by the plaintiff attorney for use in an earlier case between them.the plaintiff conceded that he had drafted the document,but nevertheless argued that the defendant was required to authenticate the document as a business record.the first circuit recognized that,generally speaking,the document should have been introduced into the record through affidavits.id.at.however,it held,there was no point in remanding this case to permit the defendant to file an affidavit stating the very thing that the plaintiff has conceded,namely,that the document is what it purports to be.see also woods,at noting that the reasoning in cerqueira is persuasive and applicable to the facts of this case.as in cerqueira,the defendants responses to the interrogatories in this case provide us with sufficient assurance that cain score sheet was made at the time of the interview by a person with knowledge and was prepared and kept in the course of the regularly conducted business activity of certifying group v custodians under the collective bargaining agreement,rendering a remand to permit thanongsinh to file an affidavit on this question unnecessary.cerqueira,at.
second,the school district,by relying on thanongsinh score sheet,which is substantially similar in all material respects to the score sheet completed in the course of cain interview,has conceded the accuracy of these documents.see defs.motion for summary judgment,at relying on the score sheets from thanongsinh interview in the course of argument defs.of undisputed mat l facts,at,summarizing the contents of thanongsinh score sheet.both score sheets necessarily were prepared and kept by the school district in the same manner and according to the same internal procedures.as we did in woods,we therefore conclude that the defendants can not reasonably question the reliability of score sheets made by school district employees and produced in the course of this litigation.woods,at.requiring authenticating affidavits in this case would be an empty formality.id.
even if this were not true,the cain score sheet would be admissible against the school district as an admission by one of its representatives under federal rule of evidence d.rule d a provides that written statements may be admitted as against the party who made the statement in their individual or representative capacity.d.in this case,cathy mcnamara,the person who filled out the score sheet,is a representative of the school district,or a person authorized to complete the score sheet,id.d c.as under rule,thanongsinh still would be required to lay a foundation for the document status as an admission by a under rule d.authentication for the purposes of rule d is governed by rule a,which requires that the plaintiff prove that the document is what its proponent claims.a see also united states dhinsa,cir rule does not erect a particularly high hurdle.internal quotation marks omitted.rule requirements are satisfied if evidence has been introduced from which a reasonable juror could find that the document is authentic.see dhinsa,at.this standard has been met in this case.as discussed previously,the school district admitted in its response to the plaintiff interrogatories that cain score sheet was completed by a school district employee.see,ex at,ex at identifying cathy mcnamara as the individual who filled out the score sheet previously produced.one can reasonably conclude from these discovery documents that the cain score sheet is what the plaintiff claims it to document completed by interviewers in the course of cain certification exam.
therefore,the district court abused its discretion in refusing to credit this document as evidence that thanongsinh was treated less favorably than a similarly situated individual outside of his protected class 
now that we have determined that thanongsinh has identified a similarly situated individual outside of his protected class who was treated more favorably than he,the burden shifts to the defendants to identify a reason for thanongsinh demotion.the defendants submit that thanongsinh was demoted because he failed to obtain group v certification,a requirement imposed on all employees similarly situated to the plaintiff.the parties dispute whether thanongsinh has established that the defendants proffered reason for demotion is pretextual,an issue on which thanongsinh bears the burden of proof.the district court disregarded each piece of evidence cited by thanongsinh on this matter as being based on pure speculation or requiring unreasonable inferences.at.thanongsinh now responds that,taken together,this evidence creates a material issue of fact regarding whether the true reason for his demotion was his race.
in order for a plaintiff to show that the defendant explanation for the adverse employment action is pretextual,he must show more than that the decision was mistaken,ill considered or foolish,and so long as the employer honestly believes those reasons,pretext has not been shown.ballance city of springfield,cir internal quotation marks omitted and alteration in original.pretext means a dishonest explanation,a lie rather than an oddity or an error.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,if the plaintiff is correct that the certification exam was administered in a discriminatory manner,then the defendant invocation of the results of that exam to justify thanongsinh demotion necessarily can not be considered a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision.mcdonnell douglas,at.we believe that thanongsinh has created a triable issue of fact regarding whether his exam was administered in a discriminatory fashion and,therefore,whether the defendants justification for his demotion is pretextual.although each piece of evidence offered by thanongsinh may not be sufficient standing alone to create a material issue of fact for trial,when this evidence is considered in the aggregate,a reasonable jury could find discriminatory animus in the scoring of the exam.
first,the differential scoring of cain and thanongsinh on topic of the exam is relevant and probative of the defendants intent.both thanongsinh and cain failed to bring with them to the portion of the exam their materials,a prerequisite to being able to answer questions associated with topic.but,as discussed previously,cain score sheet indicates that he was asked the questions relevant to these missing materials and scored out of,while the plaintiff was not questioned on this matter and was awarded zero points.see,at.from this evidence,a reasonable jury could infer that javetz scored the exam differently for minority and candidates based on their race.
the defendants respond that the discriminatory scoring of topic is irrelevant because,even had he scored out of on this topic,thanongsinh still would have failed the certification exam and would have been demoted.with the additional points,thanongsinh score would have been averaged with his score of on the written portion of the exam,his composite score would have been,which constitutes a failing score under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.see appellee br.at.this argument misapprehends the import of this evidence under mcdonnell douglas.even if the discriminatory scoring of topic was not outcome determinative in thanongsinh case,this evidence nevertheless is relevant in assessing the accuracy of thanongsinh overall score on the exam the fact that thanongsinh was treated differently than candidates on topic is probative evidence that the exam as a whole may have been administered in a racially discriminatory manner,affecting the scoring of thanongsinh performance on other portions of that exam 
thanongsinh also contends that comments made by javetz at his grievance meeting demonstrate pretext.specifically,in his affidavit,he claims that,at this meeting,javetz responded without sympathy to his concerns about the administration of the certification exam.according to thanongsinh,after explaining his 
side of the story regarding the portion of the certification testing program,javetz crossed his arms and said in an argum
