these two cases,consolidated for oral argument,raise questions about the obligations of public schools under federal law to students who are deaf or.the plaintiffs central claim is that their school districts have an obligation under the americans with disabilities act ada to provide them with a transcription service so that they can fully understand the teacher and fellow students without undue strain and consequent stress.
a high schooler in the tustin unified school district tustin in orange county,california,and,a high schooler in the poway unified school district poway in san diego county,california,both have hearing disabilities.each student,through her parents,requested that,to help her follow classroom discussions,her school district provide her with communication access realtime translation cart in the classroom.cart is a transcription service,similar to court reporting,in which a trained stenographer provides captioning that appears on a computer monitor.in both cases,the school district denied the request for cart but offered other accommodations.also in both cases,the student first unsuccessfully challenged the denial of cart in state administrative proceedings and then filed a lawsuit in federal district court.
in the district court,both and claimed that the denial of cart violated both the individuals with disabilities education act idea and title ii of the ada.in each case,the district court granted summary judgment for the school district,holding that the district had fully complied with the idea and that the plaintiff ada claim was foreclosed by the failure of her idea claim.on appeal,both and do not contest the conclusion that their respective school districts complied with the idea.they challenge,however,the district courts grants of summary judgment on their ada claims,because they maintain that title ii imposes effective communication obligations upon public schools independent of,not coextensive with,schools obligations under the idea.
in light of this litigation history,these appeals present this court with a narrow question whether a school district compliance with its obligations to a deaf or child under the idea also necessarily establishes compliance with its effective communication obligations to that child under title ii of the ada.for the reasons explained below,we hold that it does not.we do not find in either statute an indication that congress intended the statutes to interact in a mechanical fashion in the schools context,automatically pretermitting any title ii claim where a school idea obligation is satisfied.moreover,in one of these cases,tustin,the department of justice doj has filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiff that includes an interpretation of the relevant title ii regulations,to which we accord deference under auer robbins,and which bolsters our conclusion.
factual and procedural background 
because of her hearing loss,is eligible for special education services under the idea.her eligibility means that tustin must provide with a free appropriate public education fape suited to her individual needs.see a.as required by the statute,tustin has convened regular meetings to develop an annual individualized education plan iep identifying educational goals and laying out which special services tustin will provide to address those goals in the upcoming academic year.see id.a.
in spring,when was completing the eighth grade,tustin and her parents began to prepare for her upcoming transition to high school.at a june meeting of iep team,mother requested that tustin provide her with cart beginning the first day of ninth grade,in fall.therapist recommended that receive cart in high school.the iep team deferred a decision on the cart request,instead developing an iep that offered other accommodations.
shortly thereafter,filed an administrative complaint challenging the june iep.during the course of ninth grade year,her parents and tustin officials met for several iep meetings but were unable to come to an agreement that would resolve the complaint.after providing with trials of both cart and an alternative transcription technology called typewell,her iep team concluded that she did not require transcription services to receive a fape under the idea,see a,and reaffirmed the june iep.
challenge to the june iep proceeded to a hearing before a california administrative law judge alj.testified that she could usually hear her teachers but had trouble hearing her classmates and classroom videos.several of teachers testified that,in their opinion,could hear and follow classroom discussion well.
applying the relevant legal standards,the alj concluded that tustin had complied with both its procedural and substantive obligations under the idea and had provided with a fape.the alj observed that mother was requesting cart so that could maximize her potential,but the idea,as interpreted by the supreme court in board of education of hendrick hudson school district,westchester county rowley,does not require schools to provide a education.
dissatisfied,filed a complaint in district court challenging the alj decision on her idea claim.she also asserted disability discrimination claims under section of the rehabilitation act,title ii of the ada,and california unruh civil rights act.with respect to her ada claim,she sought,in addition to other relief,an order compelling defendants to provide cart.the complaint alleges that cart is commonly paid for by other southern california public school districts,including the los angeles unified school district and the santa monica malibu school district,and is also commonly provided at the college level under the ada.
in declarations submitted to the district court,teachers declared that she participated in classroom discussions comparably to other students.saw her situation quiet differently,emphasizing that she could only follow along in the classroom with intense concentration,leaving her exhausted at the end of each day.
the district court granted summary judgment for tustin.first,as to idea claim,the district court stated that it was reluctant to adopt fully teacher and administrator conclusions about comprehension levels over the testimony of herself,and found that testimony reveals that her difficulty following discussions may have been greater than her teachers perceived.nevertheless,the district court agreed with the alj that,under the relevant legal standards,had been afforded a fape compliant with the idea.second,the district court held that claims under the ada and the rehabilitation act fail on the merits for the same reason that her claim under the idea failed.finally,the district court noted that unruh act liability requires intentional discrimination or an ada violation,neither of which had shown.
this appeal followed,in which challenges only the district court rulings on her ada and unruh act claims 
like,is eligible for and receives special education services under the idea,pursuant to an annual iep.at an iep meeting held towards the end of year,parents agreed that was making progress,but said that they believed that she needed cart in order to have equal access in the classroom.the iep team decided that cart was not necessary to provide with a fape,noting that was making good academic progress.
filed an administrative complaint challenging her april iep.during the ensuing hearing,testified that she sometimes had trouble following class discussions and teacher instructions.the alj concluded,however,that poway had provided with a fape under the idea,finding that hears enough of what her teachers and fellow pupils say in class to allow her to access the general education curriculum and did not need cart services to gain educational benefit.
challenged the alj decision on her idea claim in district court,and also alleged disability discrimination claims under section of the rehabilitation act and title ii of the ada,seeking,in addition to other relief,an order compelling defendants to provide cart.like complaint,complaint alleges that cart is commonly provided by other southern california school districts and at the college level.
entered high school in fall.before the district court,submitted a declaration in support of her motion for summary judgment which she declared that she has continued to have difficulty hearing in her classes.although can use visual cues to follow conversations,u se of these strategies requires a lot of mental energy and focus,leaving her drained at the end of the school day.declaration questioned whether her teachers understood the extra effort it required for her to do well in school.
the district court initially granted partial summary judgment for poway on idea claim,holding that the april iep provided a fape under the idea.although noting that it was sympathetic to the parents view that the cart service would make it easier for to follow the lectures and class discussions,the district court denied the request to order the service,on the ground that the idea does not require states to maximize each child potential later,the district court granted summary judgment for defendants on remaining ada and section claims.relying in part on the earlier district court decision in tustin,the district court held that a plaintiff failure to show a deprivation of a fape under the idea dooms a claim under section,and,accordingly,under the ada.
this appeal,in which challenges only the district court ruling on her ada claim,followed.
discussion 
general statutory background 
before discussing and specific claims,we provide some necessary context concerning the three statutes primarily implicated by these appeals,the idea,title ii of the ada,and section of the rehabilitation act,especially as they apply to accommodation of students with communication difficulties.
the idea requires schools to make available to children with disabilities a free appropriate public education,or fape,tailored to their individual needs.d a.states receiving federal funds under the idea must show that they have implemented policies and procedures to provide disabled children with a fape,including procedures to develop an iep for each eligible child.id.a,a,a.
the idea enumerates several general factors that a child iep team must consider in developing her iep.these are the strengths of the child,the concerns of the parents for enhancing the education of their child,the results of the initial evaluation or most recent evaluation of the child,and the academic,developmental,and functional needs of the child.id.d a.in addition,the idea enumerates special factors that must be considered if a child has a particular type of disability.for a child who is deaf or,the iep team is required to 
consider the child language and communication needs,opportunities for direct communications with peers and professional personnel in the child language and communication mode,academic level,and full range of needs,including opportunities for direct instruction in the child language and communication mode.
id.d b iv.the iep team is also required to consider whether the child needs assistive technology devices and services.id.d b v.
the idea does not,however,specify any substantive standard prescribing the level of education to be accorded handicapped children.rowley,at.rather,the idea primarily provides parents with various procedural safeguards,including the right to participate in iep meetings and the right to challenge an iep in state administrative proceedings and,ultimately,in state or federal court.rowley saw the statute as resting on the premise that adequate compliance with the procedures prescribed would in most cases assure much if not all of what congress wished in the way of substantive content in an iep.rowley,at see also schaffer ex rel.schaffer weast.the core of the statute is the cooperative process that it establishes between parents and schools.schaffer,at.
the idea does have a substantive component,but a fairly modest one the iep developed through the required procedures must be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.rowley,at.the idea does not require states to provide disabled children with a education.id.at.this standard means that,for a child being educated in mainstream classrooms,an iep is substantively valid so long as it is reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.id.at.
in contrast to the more idea,the ada imposes less elaborate procedural requirements.it also establishes different substantive requirements that public entities must meet.
title ii of the ada,the title applicable to public services,provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity,and requires that the doj promulgate regulations to implement this provision,emphasis added.we have recognized that,under the principles of deference established in chevron natural resources defense council,the doj title regulations should be given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.armstrong schwarzenegger,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
among the doj title regulations,and at the core of these appeals,is the effective communications regulation,which spells out public entities duties towards those with disabilities.see the title ii effective communications regulation states two requirements first,public entities must take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with applicants,participants,and members of the public with disabilities are as effective as communications with others.id.a.second,public entities must furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to participate in,and enjoy the benefits of,a service,program,or activity conducted by a public entity.id.b.the title ii regulations define the phrase auxiliary aids and services for purposes of as including,inter alia,transcription services and videotext displays.id.in determining what type of auxiliary aid and service is necessary,a public entity shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with disabilities.id.b.
a separate,more general title ii regulation limits the application of these requirements notwithstanding any other requirements in the regulations,a public entity need not,under title ii,take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service,program,or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens.id.the public entity has the burden to prove that a proposed action would result in undue burden or fundamental alteration,and the decision must be made by the head of the public entity or his or her designee after considering all resources available for use in the funding and operation of the service,program,or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion.id.the public entity must take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that,to the maximum extent possible,individuals with disabilities receive the benefits or services provided by the public entity.id.
as should be apparent,the idea and title ii differ in both ends and means.substantively,the idea sets only a floor of access to education for children with communications disabilities,but requires school districts to provide the individualized services necessary to get a child to that floor,regardless of the costs,administrative burdens,or program alterations required.title ii and its implementing regulations,taken together,require public entities to take steps towards making existing services not just accessible,but equally accessible to people with communication disabilities,but only insofar as doing so does not pose an undue burden or require a fundamental alteration of their programs.
finally,at least as a general matter,public schools must comply with both the idea and the ada.the idea obviously governs public schools.there is also no question that public schools are among the public entities governed by title ii.see a listing education in the ada congressional findings section as one of critical areas in which disability discrimination exists tennessee lane,listing public education among the sites of discrimination that congress intended to reach with title ii.
moreover,congress has specifically and clearly provided that the idea coexists with the ada and other federal statutes,rather than swallowing the others.see payne peninsula sch,f d,cir en banc.after the supreme court interpreted an earlier version of the idea to provide the exclusive avenue for pursuing an equal protection claim to a publicly financed special education,smith robinson,congress enacted legislation to overturn that ruling.an amendment to the idea,enacted in,clarified that the idea does not foreclose any additional constitutional or federal statutory claims that children with disabilities may have,so long as they first exhaust their idea claims through the idea administrative process.see,stat.see also mark lemahieu,cir.in its current version,the idea provision reads 
nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights,procedures,and remedies available under the constitution,the americans with disabilities act of et,title v of the rehabilitation act of et,or other federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities,except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under this subchapter,the procedures under subsections f and g shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under this subchapter.
l alterations in original.
it is against this statutory background that we shall consider how the idea and title ii interact with respect to school districts obligations to students,like and,who are deaf or.first,however,we must clarify one way in which the statutes do not interact.
in the district court analysis in,relied upon by the district court in,the plaintiffs ada claims were tethered to their idea claims through the connective thread of a third federal statute,section of the rehabilitation act.section bars the exclusion of individuals with disabilities from any program or activity receiving federal funds.see a.the district court in reasoned that the fact that has failed to show a deprivation of a fape under idea dooms her claim under section,and,accordingly,her ada claim emphasis added.similarly,the district court in reasoned that a plaintiff failure to show a deprivation of a fape under the idea dooms a claim under section,and,accordingly,under the ada emphasis added.
the district courts arrived at this reasoning by combining two lines of our case law.in the first line of cases,we have identified a partial overlap between the statutory fape provision under the idea and a similar provision within the section regulations promulgated by the department of education,requiring schools receiving federal funds to provide a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient jurisdiction.a.although both the idea and the section regulation use the locution free appropriate public education,or fape,we have concluded that the two fape requirements are overlapping but different.see mark,at,at the same time,we have noted that,as provided by the section fape regulation,adopting a valid idea iep is sufficient but not necessary to satisfy the section fape requirements.id.at citing b see also monrovia unified sch,cir.
in the second line of cases,we have discussed the close relationship between section and title ii of the ada.congress used the section as a model when drafting title ii.see duvall cnty.of kitsap,cir.we have observed on occasion that there is no significant difference in the analysis of rights and obligations created by the two acts.vinson thomas,cir.
combining these two lines of cases,the district courts reasoned that a valid idea iep satisfies the section fape regulation section and title ii are substantially similar statutes therefore,a valid idea iep also satisfies title ii.this syllogism overstates the connections both between the idea and section,and between section and title ii.
first,we have never held that compliance with the idea dooms all section claims.in mark,we held only that adopting a valid idea iep is sufficient to satisfy the section fape requirements.at emphasis added citing b.we so held because the section fape regulation itself provides that provision of a fape under the idea is one means of meeting the standard established in paragraph b i of this section,b emphasis added,the section fape standard.because a school district provision of a fape under the idea meets section fape requirements,a claim predicated on finding a violation of the section fape standard will fail if the idea fape requirement has been met.section claims predicated on other theories of liability under that statute and its implementing regulations,however,are not precluded by a determination that the student has been provided an idea fape.
second,the connection between title ii and section is nuanced.although the general mandates in the two statutes are worded similarly,there are material differences between the statutes as a whole.first,their jurisdictions,while overlapping,are not coextensive section governs all entities receiving federal funds public or private,while title ii governs all public entities federally funded or not.compare with.second,title ii prohibition of discrimination or denial of benefits by reason of disability establishes a motivating factor causal standard for liability when there are two or more possible reasons for the challenged decision and at least one of them may be legitimate.martin cal.dep t of veterans affairs,cir.in other words,if the evidence could support a finding that there is more than one reason for an allegedly discriminatory decision,a plaintiff need show only that discrimination on the basis of disability was a motivating factor for the decision.id.by contrast,t he causal standard for the rehabilitation act is even stricter,requiring a plaintiff to show a denial of services solely by reason of disability.a.
congress has also delegated regulatory responsibility differently under the two statutes.section mandates generally that the head of each executive agency must promulgate its own regulations as may be necessary to implement section nondiscrimination mandate with respect to that agency programs.see a.thus,for example,the department of education promulgates regulations implementing section with respect to federally funded education programs.see generally part.for title ii,congress made a more specific,and centralized,delegation,confiding regulatory authority wholly in the justice department.see a.
congress also mandated that the federal regulations implementing title ii be consistent with certain,but not all,of the regulations enforcing section.see id.b.specifically,congress mandated that the title ii regulations as to all topics e xcept for program accessibility,existing facilities,and communications be consistent with the section regulations codified at part,and that the title ii regulations as to program accessibility,existing facilities,and communications be consistent with the section regulations codified at part.id.congress did not,however,mandate that title ii regulations be consistent with the section fape regulation,which is codified at part.
neither nor theory of title ii liability is predicated on a denial of fape under any definition of that term indeed,title ii does not impose any fape requirement.rather,both and ground their claims in the title ii effective communications regulation,which they argue establishes independent obligations on the part of public schools to students who are deaf or.insofar as the title ii effective communications regulation has a section analog,it is not the section fape regulation at we construed in the mark line of cases.rather,it is the section communications regulation at,as that is the regulation with which congress has specified that title ii communications regulations must be consistent.see b.
