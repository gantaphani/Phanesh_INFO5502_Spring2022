our previous opinion in this appeal issued on august.after we issued our opinion,the district court found that by error or accident the clerk had failed its duty to forward to this court the exhibits admitted at trial.see fed.a,b.as it is permitted in this circumstance,the district court has transmitted those exhibits to this court to correct the record.see fed.e b.in the light of this development,we grant the petition for panel rehearing filed by michael,vacate our previous opinion,and substitute the following opinion in its place.
the issue in this appeal is whether the district court erred when it entered judgment as a matter of law against a high school principal who argues that the school board violated the first amendment when the board terminated him in retaliation for his efforts to convert his school to a charter school.while he served as principal of kathleen high school in polk county,florida,met with teachers,consulted with principals of other local high schools,and held two faculty votes regarding the conversion of his school to charter status.complains that the school board of polk county discharged him in retaliation for the exercise of his rights to freedom of speech,to petition the government for redress of grievances,and to freedom of association.the district court reasoned that efforts to convert kathleen high to charter status were part and parcel of his official duties and were not undertaken as a citizen.the district court concluded that,in the light of garcetti ceballos,d,work as principal was not protected by the first amendment and granted the school board judgment as a matter of law.we affirm.
background 
on june,the school board hired to be the principal of kathleen high.the school did not compare favorably with other high schools in polk county and had received a d grade on the florida comprehensive assessment test.made improvements and,within one year,raised the assessment score to a c grade.
after he learned that the school would not receive additional staff or funding,explored converting the school to charter status.florida law provides that c harter schools shall be part of the state program of public education.stat.an application for a conversion charter school shall be made by the district school board,the principal,teachers,parents,the school advisory council id.b.charter conversion requires the support of at least percent of the teachers employed at the school.id.
beginning in the spring of,took several steps toward charter conversion.he and other individuals from his school attended a seminar on charter schools.he held staff meetings at school and divided the faculty into committees to study and give reports on charter schools.also met on several occasions with the principals of other local high schools to discuss charter conversion.
in an email to an assistant principal at kathleen high,explained his duty to pursue charter conversion.wrote that he in good conscience could not continue the practice of providing an inferior educational opportunity to the ese students at kathleen high.he explained that,with the charter opportunities granted by the state of florida,he would be remiss in his duties as the leader of kathleen high school if he did not explore any and all possibilities to improve the quality of education at the school.
testified at trial that charter conversion was not one of his assigned duties,but he admitted that i t was incumbent upon him to investigate charter and to move towards charter for the betterment of the students at kathleen high school.he explained that his number one duty,and the duty of any principal,wa s to do whatever he could for the kids.according to,if principals do do everything they possibly can to create avenues for kids to succeed,then they are not doing their duty.one aspect of job as a principal was to provide the best educational opportunities he could,and he felt that his responsibility as a leader of kathleen high was to make sure that he exhausted every avenue that he could,and charter happened to be one.pursu ed charter school for kathleen high school to meet the mission and vision of the polk county school district.
performance evaluations reveal that he was expected to support the mission and vision of the school district.his list of specific job duties and responsibilities included the obligation to provide leadership for and implement school improvement initiatives.as principal of the high school,major function was to provide the vision and leadership necessary to develop and administer educational programs that optimize the human and material resources available for a safe and successful school for students,staff,parents,and community while emphasizing the learning process for all students leading to enhanced student achievement.
an initial faculty vote on charter conversion occurred on october,but the votes were not tallied because of an irregularity with the number of ballots.on april,the rescheduled faculty vote failed with votes in favor of conversion and votes against.then planned to convert only part of kathleen high to charter status and invited teachers interested in this new plan to attend a meeting at pm on april.
the meeting did not occur.the superintendent called on the day of the meeting,and cancelled the meeting.according to,the superintendent was not happy that was going to have a meeting and was kind of upset that and others were still continuing on the charter process.some members of the school board also had been displeased with efforts to convert kathleen high to charter status.
on may,was called to the district office and terminated.four days earlier,had received a rating of h igh quality performance from the deputy superintendent.contemporaneously,kathleen high had received a favorable evaluation from the southern association of colleges and schools.
filed a complaint with the florida department of education.florida law provides that n o district school board,or district school board employee who has control over personnel actions,shall take unlawful reprisal against another district school board employee because that employee is either directly or indirectly involved with an application to establish a charter school.stat,and an employee may file a complaint with the department of education within days,id.a.after investigation,the department of education concluded that there was no direct correlation to contract not being renewed due to the fact that he attempted to convert kathleen high school to a charter school.
filed a complaint in federal district court that alleged the school board had terminated him in retaliation for his exercise of rights protected by the first amendment.the action proceeded to a jury trial,and after the close of,the school board moved,under federal rule of civil procedure a,for judgment as a matter of law.in his argument against the motion,clarified that he was raising first amendment claims on petitioning,association and speech related to charter only.
the district court granted the motion of the school board.the court concluded that,under garcetti,speech was not protected by the first amendment.the court then determined that there was absolutely no evidence in th e record to support complaint that the school board violated his rights to free association and to petition the government for redress of grievances.
ii.standard of review 
a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law is reviewed de novo abel dubberly,cir.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to,but he must put forth more than a mere scintilla of evidence suggesting that reasonable minds could reach differing verdicts.id.
iii.discussion 
presents three arguments on appeal.he contends that the district court erred when it entered judgment as a matter of law against his three claims that the school board discharged him in retaliation for his exercise of rights to freedom of speech,to petition the government for redress of grievances,and to freedom of association.we affirm the district court on each ground.
a.the district court correctly entered judgment as a matter of law against claim that the school board violated his right to freedom of speech.
a few weeks before jury trial,the supreme court held in garcetti that a public employee who spoke pursuant to his official duties had not sp oken as a citizen and was not protected by the first amendment.at.the district court concluded that,under garcetti,had not engaged in protected speech.the court reasoned that efforts to convert kathleen high to charter status were part and parcel of his official duties and done in his capacity as the principal of the school.we agree with the district court.
our analysis of this issue is divided into two parts.first,we discuss the law in this circuit regarding the termination of a public employee in retaliation for that employee exercise of his right to freedom of speech,and we explain the effect of garcetti on those precedents.second,we consider whether engaged in protected speech.
a public employee must speak both on a matter of public concern and as a citizen to receive protection under the first amendment.
before garcetti,it was that an employer could not discharge a public employee in retaliation for the employee exercise of his right to freedom of speech,but th e employee right to free speech was not absolute.brochu city of riviera beach,cir.as the supreme court first explained in pickering board of education,the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern had to be balanced against the interests of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees,d.w hen a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern,but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest,a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency connick myers,d.
we adopted the analysis that evolved after pickering for actions that involved the termination of a public employee in alleged retaliation for that employee exercise of first amendment rights.brochu,at.the first stages were questions of law designed to determine whether the first amendment protect ed the employee speech.anderson burke county,cir.at the first stage,the threshold legal question was whether the employee speech could be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern.brochu,at internal quotation marks omitted.we sometimes also asked whether the speech at issue was made primarily in the employee role as citizen,or primarily in the role of employee.morris crow,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in garcetti,the supreme court emphasized that a public employee must speak both on a matter of public concern and as a citizen to be protected under the first amendment.the court noted that the court of appeals had considered whether richard ceballos,the public employee who had been terminated,spoke on a matter of public concern but had failed to consider whether the speech was also made in ceballos capacity as a citizen.garcetti.at.the court then cited the precedents of pickering and connick for the principle that the first amendment protects a public employee right to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern,garcetti.at emphasis added,and reversed the court of appeals because ceballos spoke pursuant to his official duties and not as a citizen,id.at.
ceballos had been employed as a calendar deputy district attorney in los angeles county.id.at.according to ceballos,it was not unusual for persons employed in that capacity to be asked by defense attorneys to investigate aspects of pending criminal actions.id.in february,a defense attorney contacted ceballos and asked him to investigate an affidavit that supported a search warrant in a pending criminal action.id.ceballos wrote a memorandum that questioned the affidavit and recommended dismissal of the case.id.at.ceballos complained that he was then reassigned,transferred,and denied a promotion in violation of his first amendment right to free speech.id.
the supreme court concluded that ceballos did not speak as a citizen by writing a memo that addressed the proper disposition of a pending criminal case,because ceballos did not dispute that he prepared the memo pursuant to his duties as a calendar deputy.id.at.the court held that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties,the employees are not speaking as citizens for first amendment purposes,and the constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.id.the court never considered whether ceballos speech was on a matter of public concern.
after garcetti,we and several of our sister circuits refined our analysis of the first step of the pickering test.in battle board of regents,we initially described the threshold legal question as whether the employee speech is on a matter of public concern,cir quoting anderson,at.we then quoted garcetti and restated that threshold question we must first ask whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.id.at quoting garcetti.at emphasis added.the tenth circuit concluded that garcetti revisit ed and significantly modified the first prong,casey las vegas indep.sch,cir,and the seventh circuit explained that garcetti holds that before asking whether the of particular speech is a topic of public concern,the court must decide whether the plaintiff was speaking as a citizen or as part of her public job,mills city of evansville,cir see also reuland hynes,cir.
the district court correctly concluded that garcetti factors into th e first stage.it then determined that,in the light of garcetti,failed the first stage and had not engaged in protected speech.we agree and address that issue next.
did not speak as a citizen.
speech on charter conversion is not protected by the first amendment because he did not speak as a citizen,as required by garcetti.we come to this conclusion for at least two reasons,and we discuss each reason in turn.
first,it is clear from florida law that undertook his efforts to convert kathleen high to charter status in his capacity as the principal and not as a citizen.the florida statute that governs the establishment of charter schools provides,an application for a conversion charter school shall be made by the district school board,the principal,teachers,parents,the school advisory council.stat.b.because there is no evidence that was a parent or a teacher,his efforts to convert kathleen high to charter status necessarily were in his capacity as the principal of the school.
second,the supreme court held in garcetti that a public employee who make s statements pursuant to his official duties is not speaking as a citizen.at,and admitted that his efforts to convert his school to charter status were to fulfill his professional duties.was not expressly assigned the duty to pursue charter conversion,but the supreme court explained in garcetti that the listing of a given task is n ot necessary to demonstrate that conducting the task is within the scope of the employee professional duties for first amendment purposes.id.at.it is enough that admitted that he pursued charter conversion to explore any and all possibilities to improve the quality of education at his school,which was one of his listed duties and he described as his number one duty in his job as a principal.see battle,at relying on admission of plaintiff that she had a clear employment duty.although and the amici curiae now argue that these admissions were about moral obligations as a human being and not his responsibilities as a principal,unambiguous statements do not support this characterization.
the amici contend that certain evidence in the record supports their position.they focus on the email sent to his assistant principal,in which explained that he would be remiss in his duties as the leader of kathleen high if he did not pursue charter conversion.the amici note that then wrote,my obligation is to do the right thing,which in their view proves that was not discussing his professional responsibilities.
the argument of the amici fails.the statement to which they refer is part of a quotation by william carey,the english missionary,that
