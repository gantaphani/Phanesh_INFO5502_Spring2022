introduction 
plaintiff leticia bareno appeals from a judgment entered in favor of defendants san diego miramar college the college,san diego community college district,and san diego community college district administrative facilities corporation 
in early,bareno was disciplined by her employer,the college,in relation to her employment as an administrative assistant.thereafter,bareno required medical treatment and accompanying leave from work,and she requested medical leave from her supervisor.bareno provided medical certification for this request for leave.after the time frame specified in bareno initial request for leave had ended,bareno continued to be absent from work.bareno had attempted to her supervisor a recertification of her need for additional medical leave,but the college claimed that bareno supervisor did not receive any such request from bareno for additional leave.as a result,after bareno continued to be absent from work for an additional five consecutive days,the college took the position that she had voluntarily resigned.after bareno learned that the college considered her to have voluntarily resigned as a result of her continued absence from work,bareno attempted to provide the college with information regarding the medical necessity of the leave that she had taken.the college refused to reconsider its position.
bareno filed suit against all three defendants,alleging that in effectively terminating her employment,sdccd retaliated against her for taking medical leave,in violation of government code section,the family rights act,commonly referred to as the california family rights act cfra.see cal.code,tit,subd.b.sdccd moved for summary judgment on bareno sole claim for retaliation under cfra,and the trial court granted the motion.
on appeal,bareno contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on her cfra retaliation claim because there remain triable issues of material fact in dispute.we agree.because there remain material issues in dispute and the record is capable of supporting a judgment in favor of bareno,the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of sdccd.we therefore reverse the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings.
factual and procedural backgrounda.factual background 
bareno began working as a student services assistant for the college in march.in,bareno was promoted to senior secretary at the school of business,technical careers and workforce development.
in,the college suspended bareno for a period and recommended that her employment be terminated.however,rather than terminate bareno employment,the college entered into a last chance agreement agreement with bareno.the agreement indicated that the college agreed to postpone its termination recommendation to the board of trustees in exchange for bareno following specified terms and conditions of her employment,as set forth in the agreement.among other things,bareno agreed to maintain regular and predictable attendance and to comply with the college policies and procedures for reporting absences.the agreement was in effect for months,and expired in may.
the record reveals no additional issues documented in bareno personnel file until.in may,dean lynne ornelas,bareno supervisor,issued bareno a counseling conference letter to memorialize an oral discussion between the two regarding bareno excessive absences and disagreements over the fall schedule.in august,ornelas issued bareno a written reprimand,citing a number of problems with bareno work,including absences without reasonable cause,incompetence,inefficiency,and neglect of duty.
in january,ornelas prepared a written recommendation that bareno be suspended for performance issues similar to those noted in the written reprimand from august.on february,the college held a predisciplinary meeting with bareno to discuss the problems that ornelas had identified.on february,the college disciplined bareno with a suspension from work with no pay.the suspension was set to run from wednesday,february through friday,february.
according to bareno,on monday,february,she called ornelas at and told ornelas that she would not be at work because she needed to seek medical attention.bareno indicated that she was sick,depressed,stressed,and had to go to the hospital.later that evening,bareno ornelas to say that she would be out on medical leave through march,and stated that she would contact ornelas sometime on friday,march to inform you of the date of my return to work.
the following day,february,ornelas responded to bareno,and copied the college vice president,jerry buckley,informing bareno that before she could return to work,she would have to provide a physician statement on either the district station e ry,or on the physician official station e ry.
on february,bareno responded to ornelas with an stating,thank you for the information.the same day,bareno ornelas a copy of a work status report from kaiser permanente indicating that bareno had a medical need to take leave from work from february,through march.the document identified the onset of the condition as february,and indicated that bareno next appointment with a medical provider would take place on march,there is no indication in the record that anyone at the college regarded this document as insufficient certification to support bareno request for medical leave during the period between february and march.
on friday,march,bareno buckley regarding her desire to appeal the suspension.bareno also indicated in her to buckley that she was out on a medical leave and would notify all concern ed of her return.
also on march,bareno went to a ups store where she utilized the ups store system to ornelas a copy of a new work status report from kaiser permanente indicating that bareno required leave from work for a medical reason during the period of time between march,and march,specifically,the report,which appears on a kaiser permanente form,indicated that it had been prepared by evan george tzakis.the form identified bareno as the subject of the order based on an e ncounter with her on march,at.the form included the title work status report and indicated the date of onset of condition as.the form also stated,off work.this patient is placed off work from through.underscore omitted.this work status report is in the same format as,and includes similar information to,the work status report that bareno had submitted to ornelas on february.
according to ornelas,she did not receive bareno march.
bareno did not appear for work on monday,march.that day,ornelas contacted the human resources office for the college and informed someone there of bareno absence without any contact for that day.ornelas forwarded bareno february medical request,as well.on march,robin lewison ornelas and buckley,informing them that five consecutive days of unauthorized absences would constitute an abandonment of an employee position under the collective bargaining agreement governing bareno employment.
bareno did not report to work for the rest of the week of march.bareno testified that sometime during the time period between march and march,she received a call from one of her coworkers,but she just could not discuss anything,and so she did not speak to anybody.according to bareno,her coworker left a message and said that she was checking up on bareno.bareno did not return the telephone call.bareno did not call anyone at the college during those five days.
on friday,march,will surbrook,vice chancellor of human resources,sent a letter to bareno via certified mail to inform her that her unauthorized absences constituted a voluntary resignation,effective march,the letter indicated that bareno had a right to request a meeting with her supervisor,within five days of the proof of mailing of the notice,if she believed the proposed action was incorrect.the record does not contain information as to when the letter was delivered to bareno home address that was on file with the college.
also on march,peter alvino engaged in an exchange with ornelas regarding bareno absences.alvino said to ornelas,good question.as you know,her leave is only approved through march.however,as you may also know,she may request from her physician an extension from march and forward.
the following day,saturday,march,bareno ornelas another work status report from kaiser permanente that authorized her leave from work for the period between march,and march.the work status report identified february,as the date of onset of the condition for which bareno required continued leave from work.in this,bareno also informed ornelas that she intended to return to work on april.
on the morning of monday,march,ornelas robin lewison in the college human resource department,buckley,and alvino to inform them of the march bareno had sent her.ornelas asked,can i require a medical verification for all days missed since her suspension lewison response did not directly answer ornelas question,but instead quoted a portion of the collective bargaining agreement governing bareno employment regarding the provision stating that absence from duty without authorized leave for five days constitutes a voluntary resignation,and indicating to ornelas that she should not contact bareno,but should instead wait to see whether bareno would request a meeting with her supervisor pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.
on wednesday,march,bareno again ornelas medical leave notices from kaiser permanente for the period between march and march,as well as an sdccd form used to request a formal leave of absence.ornelas forwarded bareno to lewison,who responded,our position remains the same in that we wait for the unit member to contact you,lynne,to request a meeting.
on monday,march,bareno faxed to ornelas her sdccd form seeking a formal leave of absence,as well as kaiser permanente work status reports indicating the need for leave between march and march.that same day,bareno,who had been seeking medical treatment in riverside county during these events,traveled to san diego to retrieve mail from her post office box.on this date,bareno finally received surbrook march,letter informing her of her voluntary resignation.bareno immediately telephoned surbrook,who told bareno bluntly that he could no longer talk to her because she was no longer an employee for the district.that day,surbrook sent bareno another letter via certified mail and home delivery,in which he referenced the college march letter informing bareno that her five days of unauthorized absence s constituted abandonment of position.surbrook letter also stated that bareno had possessed the right to meet with her supervisor if she had made the request within five working days of proof of the mailing of the prior notice,but that since she had not made such a request,her voluntary resignation was effective as of march.
on wednesday,march,bareno received surbrook march,letter.on monday,march,bareno drove to the school and scheduled an appointment to speak with chancellor constance carroll.thereafter,surbrook called bareno and agreed to schedule a meeting with her and alvino.
bareno met with alvino on april.she provided him with copies of all of her documentation from kaiser permanente and reiterated her position that she had been on medical leave from february forward,and that she had not voluntarily resigned.bareno also mailed,via certified mail,copies of her medical documents to both lewison and alvino on april.these documents included the kaiser permanente work status report indicating that a doctor had placed bareno on medical leave from work between march and march,during the disputed time period.
more than ten days later,on tuesday,april,alvino mailed bareno a letter informing her that his office received your recent documents,but had ultimately concluded that n one of the documents mailed to us supports your claim that you requested a leave of absence for the dates in question and that you had contacted your supervisor.alvino letter further stated that the college continued to accept bareno voluntary resignation.bareno apparently received this letter on the same day it was sent.
three days later,april,bareno mailed another package to alvino.this package included a copy of the work status report indicating bareno need to be off of work between march and march for medical reasons,as well as a copy of the sent to ornelas from the ups store in which bareno had attached this work status report.during a telephone call,alvino told bareno that he would review the materials and would discuss the issue with the committee.bareno did not hear from alvino after that point in time.
procedural background 
bareno filed a complaint against sdccd on february,alleging one cause of action for retaliation in violation of cfra.sdccd moved for summary judgment,which the trial court granted on october.the court then entered judgment in favor of sdccd on october.bareno filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussiona.applicable legal.summary judgment standards 
summary judgment is granted when a moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law.citation.on appeal,the reviewing court makes an independent assessment of the correctness of the trial court ruling,applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.hesperia citizens for responsible development city of hesperia th.
in independently examining the record on appeal to determine whether triable issues of material fact exist,we consider all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections were made and sustained.ambriz kelegian th,ambriz.further,we must view the evidence in a light favorable to plaintiff as the losing party citation,liberally construing the plaintiff evidentiary submission while strictly scrutinizing the defendants own showing,and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in plaintiff favor,italics added.
in the summary judgment context,the evidence must be incapable of supporting a judgment for the losing party in order to validate the summary judgment.faust california portland cement th,faust,italics added.thus even though it may appear that a trial court took a reasonable view of the evidence,a summary judgment can not properly be affirmed unless a contrary view would be unreasonable as a matter of law in the circumstances presented,italics added.
overview of cfra 
in,the legislature enacted cfra code.cfra is intended to give employees an opportunity to take leave from work for certain personal or family medical reasons without jeopardizing job security.nelson united technologies th,nelson.
generally,cfra makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer of or more persons to refuse to grant a request by an employee to take up to workweeks in any period for family care and medical leave,subds.a,c a.cfra has two principal components a right to leave of up to weeks in any period to care for a family member or for the employee own medical condition code,subds.a,c a,and a right to reinstatement in the same,or a comparable,position at the end of the leave.code,subd.a.richey,supra,cal th at.
violations of cfra generally fall into two types of claims interference claims in which an employee alleges that an employer denied or interfered with her substantive rights to protected medical leave,and retaliation claims in which an employee alleges that she suffered an adverse employment action for exercising her right to cfra leave.rogers,supra,th at.
further,in order to ensure that employees are aware of their rights under cfra,employers who are subject to cfra are required to provide notice to their employees of the right to request cfra leave.cal.code,tit,subd.a see also cal.code,tit,subd.a.the text of the minimum notice requirements is set forth at california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision d failure of the employer to give or post the required notice regarding an employee right to request cfra leave precludes an employer from taking any adverse action against the employee,including denying cfra leave,for failing to furnish the employer with advance notice of a need to take cfra leave.cal.code,tit,subd.a.
it is generally an unlawful business practice for a covered employer to refuse to grant,upon reasonable request,a cfra leave to an eligible employee.cal.code,tit,subd.a.
the legal framework for considering retaliation claims under cfra in the summary judgment context 
the elements of a cause of action for retaliation in violation of cfra are the defendant was an employer covered by cfra the plaintiff was an employee eligible to take cfra leave the plaintiff exercised her right to take leave for a qualifying cfra purpose and the plaintiff suffered an adverse employment action,such as termination,fine,or suspension,because of her exercise of her right to cfra leave.faust,supra,th at.like claims for discrimination,cfra retaliation claims,such as the one bareno asserts here,are subject to the mcdonnell douglas analysis.loggins kaiser permanente internat.th,loggins.
in order to establish a prima facie case for retaliation as required by the first prong of the mcdonnell douglas analysis,an employee must show he or she engaged in a protected activity such as taking leave for a purpose,the employer subjected the employee to an adverse employment action,and a causal link existed between the protected activity and the employer action.yanowitz usa,cal th.if the employee successfully establishes these elements and thereby shows a prima facie case exists,the burden shifts to the employer to provide evidence that there was a legitimate,nonretaliatory reason for the adverse employment action.loggins,supra,th at.if the employer satisfies this prong by producing evidence demonstrating the existence of a legitimate reason for the adverse employment action,the presumption of retaliation drops out of the picture,citation,and the burden shifts back to the employee to provide substantial responsive evidence that the employer proffered reasons were untrue or pretextual.ibid.
in applying the mcdonnell douglas test in the context of a summary judgment motion,however,w e must keep in mind that the mcdonnell douglas test was originally developed for use at trial citation,not in summary judgment proceedings.arteaga brink,th,arteaga.
in such pretrial motion proceedings,the trial court will be called upon to decide if the plaintiff has met his or her burden of establishing a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation.if the employer presents admissible evidence either that one or more of plaintiff prima facie elements is lacking,or that the adverse employment action was based on legitimate,non retaliatory factors,the employer will be entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff produces admissible evidence which raises a triable issue of fact material to the defendant showing.in short,by applying mcdonnell douglas shifting burdens of production in the context of a motion for summary judgment,the judge will determine whether the litigants have created an issue of fact to be decided by the jury.thus,a lthough the burden of proof in a retaliation action claiming an unjustifiable termination ultimately rests with the plaintiff,in the case of a motion for summary judgment or summary issue adjudication,the burden rests with the moving party to negate the plaintiff right to prevail on a particular issue.in other words,the burden is reversed in the case of a summary issue adjudication or summary judgment motion.id.at.
whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate in any particular case will depend on a number of factors.these include the strength of the plaintiff prima facie case,the probative value of the proof that the employer explanation is false,and any other evidence that supports the employer case.guz bechtel national,cal th.we therefore reiterate m any employment cases present issues of intent,motive,and hostile working environment,issues not determinable on paper.such cases are rarely appropriate for disposition on summary judgmen t,however liberalized summary judgment standards may be.nazir united airlines,th,italics added.
according to sdccd,bareno cfra retaliation claim fails because the undisputed evidence demonstrates that she can not satisfy the third element of her claim,she can not show that she exercised her right to take leave for a qualifying cfra purpose.faust,supra,th at.as sdccd notes,the trial court determined that bareno could not establish her prima facie case on summary judgment for two reasons she did not show that she requested leave from the college,and even if she did request the leave for march via the ups email,the doctor note she offered did not meet the requirements of the cfra to constitute a reasonable request.sdccd contends that the trial court reasons were correct and support judgment in its favor.
sdccd also argues on appeal that bareno cfra retaliation claim fails because the undisputed evidence demonstrates that she can not satisfy the fourth element of her claim,she can not show that she suffered an adverse employment action because she exercised her right to take cfra leave.faust,supra,th at.
our review of the record leads us to conclude that sdccd was not entitled to summary judgment on these grounds.we must therefore reverse the trial court order granting judgment in favor of sdccd.
there are material issues in dispute regarding whether bareno sufficiently and timely requested leave for a reason 
sdccd asserts that the trial court correctly concluded that sdccd was entitled to judgment on bareno cfra retaliation cause of action because bareno did not properly notify the college that she was taking medical leave.formatting omitted.alternatively,sdccd contends that bareno did not exercise her right to cfra leave for the period between march and march,because the medical documentation formatting omitted that she provided to sdccd was inadequate.formatting omitted.the record does not support the conclusion that sdccd is entitled to judgment as a matter of law with respect to either contention.rather,the evidence,when viewed in the light most favorable to bareno,demonstrates that she did provide sufficient notice of her need for leave.
additional relevant legal standards 
cfra does not itself define what constitutes a valid request for cfra leave.instead,the legislature expressly delegated to the fair employment and housing commission the commission the task of adopt ing a regulation specifying the elements of a reasonable request for cfra leave,subd.a.cfra does require that if an employee need for a leave pursuant to this section is foreseeable,the employee shall provide the employer with reasonable advance notice of the need for the leave,subd.h,italics added.cfra is silent with respect to how an employee may request leave for a purpose that is not foreseeable 
the regulation adopted by the commission regarding requests for leave provides in relevant part that,to request cfra leave,a n employee shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the employer aware that the employee needs cfra leave,and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave.the employee need not expressly assert rights under cfra or fmla,or even mention cfra or fmla,to meet the notice requirement however,the employee must state the reason the leave is needed,such as,for example,the expected birth of a child or for medical treatment.the mere mention of vacation,other paid time off,or resignation does not render the notice insufficient,provided the underlying reason for the request is,and the employee communicates that reason to the employer.the employer should inquire further of the employee if necessary to determine whether the employee is requesting cfra leave and to obtain necessary information concerning the leave,commencement date,expected duration,and other permissible information.cal.code,tit,subd.a,italics added.
this provision appears to presume the existence of circumstances in which an employee is able to provide an employer with notice of the need for leave.indeed,the regulation permits employers to require that employees provide at least days advance notice before cfra leave is to begin if the need for the leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth,placement for adoption or foster care,or planned medical treatment for a serious health condition of the employee or a family member.cal.code,tit,subd.a,italics added.however,the regulations provide that this general rule is inapplicable when the need for medical leave is not foreseeable if days notice is not practicable,such as because of a lack of knowledge of approximately when leave will be required to begin,a change in circumstances,or a medical emergency,notice must be given as soon as practicable.cal.code,tit,subd.a,italics added.further,a n employer shall not deny a cfra leave,the need for which is an emergency or is otherwise unforeseeable,on the basis that the employee did not provide advance notice of the need for the leave,so long as the employee provided notice to the employer as soon as practicable.cal.code,tit,subd.a,italics added.
in response to a request for leave for a purpose,cfra permits an employer to request certification from an employee who seeks to take cfra protected leave for his or her own medical care.in this regard,cfra provides 
k an employer may require that an employee request for leave because of the employee own serious health condition be supported by a certification issued by his or her health care provider.that certification shall be sufficient if it includes all of the following 
a the date on which the serious health condition commenced.
b the probable duration of the condition.
c a statement that,due to the serious health condition,the employee is unable to perform the function of his or her position.
the employer may require that the employee obtain subsequent recertification regarding the employee serious health condition on a reasonable basis,in accordance with the procedure provided in paragraph,if additional leave is required,subd.k.
if an employer has doubts regarding the validity of the employee proffered certification,cfra establishes a specific procedure that the employer must utilize before the employer may reject the employee request for cfra leave 
k a in any case in which the employer has reason to doubt the validity of the certification provided pursuant to this section,the employer may require,at the employer expense,that the employee obtain the opinion of a second health care provider,designated or approved by the employer,concerning any information certified under paragraph.
b the health care provider designated or approved under subparagraph a shall not be employed on a regular basis by the employer.
c in any case in which the second opinion described in subparagraph a differs from the opinion in the original certification,the employer may require,at the employer expense,that the employee obtain the opinion of a third health care provider,designated or approved jointly by the employer and the employee,concerning the information certified under paragraph.
d the opinion of the third health care provider concerning the information certified under paragraph shall be considered to be final and shall be binding on the employer and the employee,subd.k.
the commission implementing regulations provide further detail regarding how cfra is to be carried out in the workplace.for example,the regulations define certification for purposes of cfra 
a certification means a written communication from the health care provider of the child,parent,spouse,or employee with a serious health condition to the employer of the employee requesting a family care leave to care for the employee child,parent or spouse,or a medical leave for the employee own serious health condition.
for medical leave for the employee own serious health condition,this certification need not,but may,at the employee option,identify the serious health condition involved.any certification shall contain the information identified in government code section,as is demonstrated in section of these regulations.for purposes of the certification unable to perform the function of his or her position means that an employee is unable to perform any one or more of the essential functions of his or her position.the certification shall contain 
a the date,if known,on which the serious health condition commenced,
b the probable duration of the condition,and 
c a statement that,due to the serious health condition,the employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform any one or more of the essential functions of his or her position.cal.code,tit,subd.a.
the implementing regulations further detail that an employer may require that the employee provide any certification within no less than calendar days of the employer request for such certification,unless it is not practicable for the employee to do so despite the employee good faith efforts.this means that,in some cases,the leave may begin before the employer receives the certification.absent extenuating circumstances,unavailability of healthcare provider,if the employee fails to timely return the certification,the employer may deny cfra protections for the leave following the expiration of the time period until a sufficient certification is provided.the same rules apply to recertification.if the employee never produces the certification or recertification,the leave is not cfra leave.at the time the employer requests certification,the employer also must advise the employee of the anticipated consequences of his or her failure to provide adequate certification.cal.code,tit,subd.b,italics added.
when viewed as a whole,it is clear that cfra and its implementing regulations envision a scheme in which employees are provided reasonable time within which to request leave for a qualifying purpose,and to provide the supporting certification to demonstrate that the requested leave was,in fact,for a qualifying purpose,particularly when the need for leave is not foreseeable or when circumstances have changed subsequent to an initial request for leave.
given this legal framework,it is not surprising that the question w hether notice is sufficient under cfra is a question of fact.avila continental airlines,th.
b.the evidence is capable of supporting a finding that bareno sufficiently requested leave for a purpose 
sdccd asserts that bareno was absent on monday,march,without prior notice from bareno,and that it is undisputed that she did not call in nor respond to inquiries for the remainder of that.thus,sdccd asserts,bareno did not exercise her right to request cfra leave.sdccd recitation of the facts when it makes these assertions,however,requires one to ignore certain evidence in the record and also requires that one view other facts in the record in the light most favorable to sdccd,rather than bareno.in considering scddc motion for summary judgment,however,the court is required to view the record in the light most favorable to bareno,not sdccd.as we explain,a review of the record in the light most favorable to bareno reveals evidence that would support a finding in favor of bareno on the question whether she made a reasonable request for leave for a purpose.
it is undisputed that bareno originally notified sdccd of her need for leave on monday,february.on that day,bareno called ornelas and told her that she would not be at work because she needed to seek medical attention.bareno indicated that she was sick,depressed,stressed,and had to go to the hospital.later that evening,bareno also ornelas to inform her that she would be out on medical leave at least through march.on february,bareno provided sdccd with a document from her health provider at kaiser permanente in which the provider certified that bareno was placed off work by the provider for the period from february to march.sdccd apparently concedes that bareno notified it of her need for this medical leave,and there is no evidence in the record that sdccd ever challenged the propriety of the medical certification that bareno submitted for this period of time.nor is there evidence that sdccd sought to employ the procedure set forth in cfra to seek a second opinion regarding bareno need for medical leave.
there is also evidence in the record that on march,bareno ornelas a second document from her health provider,indicating her need for leave from work between march and march.this document identified the kaiser permanente provider,indicated the onset of bareno condition as,and stated,off work.this patient is placed off work from through.underscore omitted.this document,titled a work status report,is virtually identical to the document that bareno submitted to ornelas on february,which the college apparently accepted as sufficient certification of bareno need for medical leave for the period from february to march.
sdccd makes much of the evidence in the record regarding ornelas contention that she did not receive bareno,but this evidence does not entitle sdccd to judgment.cfra and its implementing regulations clearly contain a reasonableness component with respect to an employee request for personal medical leave.thus,even if a were to determine that bareno march,email was sent,but did not arrive in ornelas inbox,this would not settle the question whether this fact should be used as a basis to conclude that bareno request was not reasonable,given all of the circumstances of her multiple communications with sdccd,or whether sdccd was justified in rejecting bareno later attempts to rectify the situation by providing copies of the medical certification that she had attempted to provide to ornelas in that march.
further,at the time bareno sent the march to ornelas,bareno had already placed sdccd on notice that she was receiving medical treatment that required her to take leave from work.again,sdccd knew that bareno was out for a medical reason the entire week of february through march,and there is no dispute that bareno sent an to buckley on friday,march,which he received,in which bareno indicated that she was out on a medical leave and would notify all concern ed of her return.despite this indication that bareno was seeking additional leave,beyond march,for a reason,sdccd did not contact bareno about the apparent lack of recertification for that time period.in fact,the evidence demonstrates that sdccd intentionally did not engage with bareno however,a reasonable could conclude,based on sdccd conduct,that it did not fulfill its obligations under cfra,which places on employers an obligation to inquire with an employee if its requires additional information from that employee regarding the employee request for leave.see cal.code,tit,subd.a the employer should inquire further of the employee if necessary to determine whether the employee is requesting cfra leave and to obtain necessary information concerning the leave.
in addition,the cfra regulations require that employers permit an employee up to days to provide necessary certification when the employer has requested that the employee provide certification to support his or her request for leave for a purpose.see cal.code,tit,subd.b where employer requires certification,such certification may be required within no less than calendar days of the employer request for such certification.the regulations thus expressly contemplate that an employee may be out on cfra protected leave prior to providing medical certification regarding that leave.cal.code,tit,subd.b this means that,in some cases,the leave may begin before the employer receives the certification.it is clear that sdccd was aware that leave may be taken even when an employee has not yet provided his or her certification,given that peter alvino notified others at sdccd that although bareno leave was only approved through march,bareno could request from her physician an extension from march and forward.
it is undisputed that bareno was in contact with sdccd after the week during which sdccd contends she was absent without request for leave,and she provided multiple other medical certifications for this period of time.yet,sdccd never informed bareno,in response to her later communications,that it believed it had not received certification for the week of march through march.instead,sdccd waited until the end of that week to send bareno a letter via certified mail,addressed to a post office box,informing her of its position that she had been absent without justification and that it therefore considered her to have voluntarily resigned.
based on all of the evidence,a reasonable could conclude that bareno attempts to contact sdccd about her need for leave for a purpose were reasonable,and that she therefore sufficiently requested cfra leave for the entire period during which she was absent in early.a reasonable could also conclude that sdccd was on notice that bareno was absent from work between march through march,due to a need for medical leave,for a reason.given this record,the fact that ornelas states that she did not receive one of many sent by bareno regarding an and changing need for medical leave is simply insufficient to support summary judgment in favor of sdccd on bareno cfra retaliation claim 
c.the evidence is capable of supporting a finding that bareno submitted sufficient medical certification to support her need for leave 
sdccd contends that,even if one presumes that bareno march to ornelas was sufficient to provide notice to sdccd regardless of whether ornelas received it or not,bareno still could not establish a prima facie case of retaliation because the kaiser permanente work status report that she provided as certification of the need for leave was inadequate.specifically,sdccd contends that the work status report did not contain the required information to qualify as a reasonable request under the cfra.we disagree with sdccd contention.
again,cfra establishes that a certification issued by an employee health provider is sufficient if it includes t he date on which the serious health condition commenced t he probable duration of the condition and a statement that,due to the serious health condition,the employee is unable to perform the function of his or her position,subd.k.
the work status report that bareno submitted for the relevant time period was issued by evan george tzakis on what appears to be a form regularly used by kaiser permanente for the purposes of informing employers that employees need time off from work or altered work arrangements due to medical necessity.the form provides that the onset of bareno condition that is the subject of the certification was,thereby clearly indicating the date on which the serious health condition commenced.further,the form states,off work.this patient is placed off work from through.underscore omitted.in doing so,the form provides both the probable duration of bareno condition,as well as an indication to the employer that the doctor believes that a leave of absence from work is necessary.in other words,the clear intention of this document is to inform the bareno employer that she can not fulfill the functions of her job and needs the identified time off in order to address a serious medical condition.the information provided on the standardized kaiser permanente form is sufficient to meet the standards set forth by cfra 
although sdccd argued in the trial court and now argues on appeal that this standardized form is insufficient to meet cfra standards,sdccd apparently accepted a virtually identical form from bareno as sufficient to certify the leave she took between february and march.in other words,one could readily conclude from this record that sdccd believed that an identical or similar form was sufficient to support bareno claim for the leave for the week prior to the week in question.at no point did sdccd ever indicate to bareno that any of the forms she had previously submitted did not meet the legal standard for a certification under cfra.yet on appeal,sdccd questions the legal adequacy of a substantially similar form with respect to bareno absences from work between monday,march and friday,march.
it is clear,however,that the regulations impose on the employer an obligation to request from the employee additional information if it believes that such information is necessary cal.code,tit,subd.a,and cfra provides for a specific process by which sdccd could have determined whether bareno leave was in fact needed for a reason if it had reason to doubt the validity of any of the medical certification forms that bareno ultimately submitted,subd.k.if sdccd did not believe that bareno medical certification was sufficient,it could have requested additional information from her cfra envisions exactly this kind of between an employer and an employee.sdccd did not at any point indicate to bareno that it viewed her documentation to be insufficient or seek additional information from her.
given this record,sdccd is not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that the medical documentation that bareno provided to sdccd was inadequate,as a matter of law,to constitute the exercise of a right to leave.
there remain material facts in dispute regarding the fourth element of bareno prima facie case,whether the she suffered an adverse employment action because she exercised her right to take leave.
sdccd argues on appeal that bareno cfra retaliation claim fails because the undisputed evidence demonstrates that she can not satisfy the fourth element of her claim.according to sdccd,bareno can not show that she suffered an adverse employment action because she exercised her right to take cfra leave.see faust,supra,th at.sdccd contends that t he true cause of the termination was that sdccd thought she had abandoned her job.however,the record does not establish this as a matter of law.
although the evidence indicates that bareno superiors had been unhappy with her for some time,the decision to consider her as having voluntarily resigned,which was effectively a termination,took place only after she sought medical leave,and virtually immediately thereafter.there is a close temporal connection between bareno absence for medical reasons and her effective termination by way of sdccd interpretation of her absences as a voluntary resignation,despite her continued communications with sdccd employees and her attempts to provide the necessary medical certifications for all of the time for which she was absent.when an adverse employment action follows hard on the heels of protected activity,the timing often is strongly suggestive of retaliation.collazo squibb,cir.
sdccd proffer of a nonretaliatory reason for termination does not entitle it to judgment as a matter of law 
finally,sdccd argues that it did not believe,nor have good reason to believe,that bareno absence from march through march,was protected,and contends that it reasonably believed that she was voluntarily resigning.sdccd asserts that bareno did not call to ask for leave,that sdccd did not receive the email or doctor note she claims she sent,that bareno had not responded to the telephone message left for her,and that bareno had not responded to the certified letter,which warned her that her leave was unauthorized so that she must contact her supervisor within five days or her unauthorized absence would be treated as a voluntary resignation.however,this recitation of the evidence is not complete,nor does it view the evidence in the light most favorable to bareno.a full review of the record demonstrates that there remain material issues of fact in dispute that should be decided by a trier of fact,not the court.
for example,although there is no evidence that bareno placed a telephone call to anyone at sdccd between march and march,there is evidence in the record that bareno multiple individuals at sdccd,including her direct supervisor,ornelas,and vice president jerry buckley,on march,in addition to other dates.although ornelas states that she did not receive the march from bareno regarding her need for additional medical leave,there is clear evidence demonstrating that bareno did,in fact,send the to ornelas work account.a could conclude that bareno sending this to ornelas was a reasonable effort to inform her employer of her continued need for leave,such that it was sufficient notice under cfra to protect bareno absences during the week of march through march,regardless of whether ornelas received the.a could also reach a number of other conclusions with respect to bareno march to ornelas,none of which would entitle sdccd to summary judgment on bareno cfra claim.for example,as discussed above,a could conclude that the was screened out before reaching ornelas mailbox or that ornelas did receive the,but failed to view it or purposely ignored it.regardless,what is clear from the facts presented on summary judgment is that there can be no certainty on this record that a would conclude that bareno request for medical leave for the week of march through march,was inadequate as a matter of law,under cfra requirements,given the evidence regarding bareno communications with sdccd.
even more problematic is sdccd suggestion that bareno did not respond to a telephone message left for her.the clear implication of sdccd contention is that sdccd reached out to bareno to clarify her need for medical leave and that she ignored sdccd attempt to engage with her.as we have previously explained,the evidence that sdccd relies on for this point is bareno deposition testimony a reasonable inference from bareno deposition testimony regarding this telephone call is that this was not an official call from sdccd attempting to glean additional information from bareno,but rather,that it was a personal telephone call from a coworker calling to check on bareno.sdccd suggestion that bareno decision not to return her coworker call may be viewed as her ignoring a request for information from sdccd is contrary to the requirement that we view the evidence in the light most favorable to bareno.
similarly,sdccd reliance on the fact that bareno had not responded to the certified letter,which warned her that her leave was unauthorized so that she must contact her supervisor within five days or her unauthorized absence would be treated as a voluntary resignation as an indication that it did no t have good reason to believe that bareno absences between march and march were cfra protected is misguided.sdccd did not place that letter to bareno in the mail until march,so she clearly could not have received it during the week that she was absent.therefore,her failure to contact her supervisor in response to that letter has no bearing on whether sdccd had reason to believe,at the time bareno was absent between march through march,that her absences were or were not cfra protected.
what does have bearing on sdccd reason to believe that bareno absences between march and march were cfra protected are all of bareno communications with her supervisors both prior to and after those dates.the record is replete with evidence from which a reasonable could conclude that sdccd knew,or reasonably should have known,that bareno had no intention of voluntarily resigning her position or being absent without excuse when she was absent from work between march and march.
indeed,both immediately before and immediately after the week of march through march,bareno contacted sdccd with information regarding her need for medical leave,and provided her original medical certification and additional recertifications regarding her absences.within a brief time after the relevant absences and immediately upon learning that sdccd was claiming that it had not received her original certification for the absences,bareno informed sdccd that she had been out for a medical reason and supplied the necessary medical certification.thus,even if sdccd had initially understood bareno to be absent without justification,not long after those absences,it was made aware that she had been out for medical reasons,pursuant to a doctor order.nevertheless,even after obtaining this information,sdccd would not reconsider its original position that her absences were unexcused.further,it took this position despite the fact that bareno had arguably provided sdccd with prior notice of her need for medical leave for the week in question although sdccd took the position that bareno had voluntarily resigned because of her apparent lack of communication during that week,in order to reach this conclusion,sdccd had to overlook many other communications from bareno,and had to ignore its own obligations to inquire of bareno when there was a question about her need to continue her leave for reasons.a reasonable could conclude,based on this evidence,that sdccd decided to interpret bareno absences as a voluntary resignation,despite evidenc
