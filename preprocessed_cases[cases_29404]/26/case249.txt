west run student housing associates,llc west run,tabor village,llc,and campus view jmu,llc campus view collectively,plaintiffs appeal the district court order dismissing their amended complaint against huntington national bank.we will affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
this lawsuit arose from three commercial real estate development projects for student housing at west virginia university the west run project,virginia tech the tabor project,and james madison the campus view project.the same group of individuals sponsors sponsored each project.
a.the west run project 
in august,the sponsors formed west run to facilitate the construction and management of housing at west virginia university in morgantown,west virginia.west run retained,a real estate broker,for the purpose of securing bank financing for the project.provided prospective lenders with confidential and proprietary information,consisting of an underwriting,a bank package,a loan request,a front end appraisal of the project,and financial information for each of the sponsors,in conjunction with its efforts to secure bank financing.amended compl.in september,west run selected sky bank to provide financing for the project,and the bank agreed to loan west run million.on july,huntington national bank huntington became the to sky bank rights and obligations under the west run loan transaction.
the west run project was to be constructed in two phases.phase i was completed on schedule in august.the apartments completed during that phase had an occupancy rate of in the fall of.construction of phase ii was completed in august.
in the fall of,as the west run project was being completed,construction commenced on an unrelated student housing project known as the copper beech townhomes copper beech,located across the street from the west run project.by the spring of,a number of the copper beech units were available for rent in competition with those in the west run project.according to the amended complaint,it was at this time that west run first learned that huntington had participated,to the extent of million,in the financing of copper beech.id.west run also alleges that huntington divulged to the copper beech developers the proprietary west run information that had been provided by to huntington predecessor,sky bank.
the west run project overall occupancy dropped from in the fall of to in the fall of,which greatly decreased west run available cash flow.consequently,west run anticipated that it would be unable to make the principal and interest payments due to huntington by december.west run contends that its occupancy crisis was caused by huntington financing of copper beech,with its resulting diminishment of the west run project revenues.id.
b.the tabor project 
in october,the sponsors formed tabor to facilitate the construction and management of an housing project at virginia tech in blacksburg,virginia.the tabor project was smaller than the west run project,consisting of only condominium units.huntington agreed to finance this development with a million loan,to be disbursed in installments.the loan agreement,however,required tabor to sell at least units before huntington was required to fund the entire project.in the spring of,as the project was nearing completion,huntington refused to provide the last construction advance,and the project failed.
c.the campus view project 
in february,the sponsors formed campus view to facilitate the construction and management of an housing project at james madison university in harrisonburg,virginia.the campus view project consisted of one hundred condominium units to be constructed in three phases.huntington agreed to finance the campus view project with a million revolving line of credit,which was secured by a mortgage on the property.the loan agreement required campus view to sell at least units before huntington was required to fund phase ii.in or around august,huntington refused to extend further construction advances to campus view.
on december,plaintiffs filed a verified complaint in the court of common pleas of allegheny county,pennsylvania.in count i,west run alleged that huntington had breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by financing the copper beech project.in counts ii and iii,campus view and tabor each alleged breach of contract based on huntington failure to provide funds under their respective construction loan agreements.
on january,huntington removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania.a week later,huntington filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the motion argued that west run claim count i should be dismissed for failure to state a plausible claim.it also argued that tabor and campus view claims counts ii and iii should be dismissed because the number of condominium units listed in the complaint established that they had sold an insufficient number of units to require huntington to disburse additional funds pursuant to the construction loan agreements 
in response to huntington motion to dismiss,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint,which simply omitted the factual allegations regarding the number of units.the amended complaint also included a new count,listed as count i,in which west run alleged that huntington had breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by disclosing confidential information it had received from to the copper beech developers.the other counts were renumbered counts ii,iii,and iv,in the same order as they originally appeared.
huntington then filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint,again arguing that west run claims should be dismissed for failure to state a plausible claim.as to the claims of tabor and campus view,huntington argued that they failed to state a claim based on the admissions as to the deficiencies contained in the original complaint.
the district court granted the motion and dismissed the amended complaint in its entirety with prejudice.run student hous,llc huntington bank,wl,at.may.this appeal followed 
plaintiffs raise three arguments on appeal the district court erred when it concluded that west run did not plead sufficient facts to support its allegation that huntington provided confidential information regarding the west run project to the copper beech developers the district court erred when it concluded that huntington had no duty to west run to refrain from financing copper beech and the district court erred by deeming the unit numbers listed in the superseded original complaint to be binding judicial admissions.we will examine each argument in turn.
the district court determined that west run alleged insufficient facts to support the conclusion that huntington provided any proprietary information regarding the west run project to the copper beech developers.we agree.to survive a motion to dismiss,the factual allegations of a complaint must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level and the complaining party must offer more than labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.bell atl.twombly,d see also ashcroft iqbal,d.
just as the complaint in twombly contained only an allegation of parallel conduct and a bare assertion of conspiracy,at,here west run offers no more than an allegation that confidential information was disclosed and a bare assertion that this violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing.west run does not plead facts regarding the nature of the disclosed information,who disclosed it,or when it was disclosed.nor does the amended complaint contain any corroborating factual averments that confidential information was disclosed at all.w here the facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct,the complaint has alleged but it has not show n that the pleader is entitled to relief.iqbal,at quoting.a.accordingly,we will affirm the district court dismissal of count 
in count ii,west run alleges that huntington breached the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by providing a loan to copper beech for a competing housing development
