on november,susan ulichny filed a complaint in the united states federal court for the eastern district of wisconsin claiming that the merton community school district in waukesha county,wisconsin,as well as the other named defendants,violated her amendment rights under the united states constitution the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,holding that ulichny did not have a property interest in performing the duties normally expected of a school principal in wisconsin.the judge also concluded that viewing the situation in its entire context as well as the specific conditions objected to by ulichny,no reasonable jury could conclude that a reasonable person standing in ulichny shoes would have found the working environment so intolerable as to leave no choice but to quit.ulichny was not constructively discharged and was not deprived of her property interest in public employment.
the district court judge further concluded that no reasonable jury could conclude that ulichny was defamed or stigmatized for the purposes of the amendment by the statements of any of the defendants and thus she was not deprived of her liberty interest in continuing her career in public school administration.finally,the trial judge concluded that even if there was merit to any of ulichny claims,the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity we affirm.
background 
a.the contract 
in august,the merton community school district mcsd hired susan ulichny as the district principal with a contract for the school year.as with all contracts of this nature,wisconsin statute requires a principal contract to be automatically renewed for a subsequent term unless mcsd issues a notice of to the principal at least four months prior to the contract expiration date absent,a principal contract can be terminated only by mutual consent of all the parties involved or if,after notice and a hearing,just cause existed for the principal removal.
under the responsibilities section of the contract between ulichny and mcsd,ulichny was to perform at a professional level of competence the services,duties and obligations required by the laws of the state of wisconsin and the rules,regulations and policies of the board which are now existing or which may be hereinafter enacted by the board.
to devote full time to the duties and responsibilities normally expected of the principal position during the term of this contract,and shall not engage in any pursuit which interferes with the proper discharge of such duties and responsibilities.
the school board,in turn,had the responsibility to furnish ulichny with a written copy of all rules,regulations and policies now in effect or becoming effective during the term of this contract,and to further provide ulichny with a written job description of the services,duties and obligations of the principal position.
ulichny first year 
when ulichny was hired in august of,bruce connolly was the district administrator for mcsd and ulichny was initially assigned to serve as the principal for the students of the merton school.however,shortly after ulichny was hired,a new school building was opened and the merton school was separated into two,elementary school and intermediate school.
as is the normal procedure for school administrators,connolly formally evaluated ulichny performance as principal during her first year.after reviewing the comments of teachers and staff connolly issued a formal,written evaluation of ulichny performance on september.connolly concluded that 
this evaluator has worked in supervising numerous principals over the course of the past years.i would not characterize ulichny first year as a completely successful one.while she faced many issues and problems and dealt successfully with most,some of the negatives outweighed the positives.i hope that ulichny takes to heart the recommendations and suggestions made in the body of the evaluation to work on her interpersonal relationships with parents and staff.i also hope she works on issues surrounding power and control.i genuinely believe that if she would practice a less judgmental style and use less positional authority and power,she will be successful.i expect ulichny to draft a plan for improvement in each of the areas where recommendations were shared.this plan for improvement should be in writing.together,we will then draft a plan for improvement and measurable outcomes for the school year.it would be my desire and hope that this plan for improvement would mediate many of the issues and concerns that occurred during the first year.since i will be leaving as of october,i would encourage the hiring of an independent evaluator to judge the process toward the completion of established goals.
however,before any plan could be implemented to improve ulichny performance as a principal,connolly resigned his position as district administrator.approximately four weeks thereafter,connolly was temporarily replaced by michael budisch,who served as interim district administrator.
ulichny second year 
staff and teacher evaluations of ulichny second year also produced varying opinions of ulichny performance as principal some believed ulichny to be doing an excellent job while others felt equally as strongly that ulichny was not performing well.although budisch did not issue a formal,written evaluation of ulichny,he did inform ulichny,via a letter,that the school board,based primarily on the negative comments of some of the teachers and staff,had issued a preliminary notice of on january.budisch letter to ulichny informed her that the board was considering the of her contract and that she was entitled to a hearing before a final decision was made.she requested a hearing and it was scheduled for february.
at the private hearing before the school board,ulichny presented the testimony of several supportive staff members and teachers who spoke at length concerning the criticisms that had been leveled against her.much of the discussion focused on criticisms alleging a negative school climate,strained relationships,poor communication between ulichny and some members of the staff and teachers.
after the hearing,the school board notified ulichny on march,that it was not renewing her contract.despite this decision,the board did offer her a contract for the school year as the merton intermediate school principal grades,and ulichny accepted the position.
after ulichny acceptance of the offer,the board issued a written evaluation of her performance during the school year.the board concluded,consistent with the criticisms leveled against ulichny by certain members of the staff and teachers,that ulichny leadership skills need a great deal of improvement and also that a large group of faculty and staff lacks confidence in her abilities as a principal.the school board cited school improvement,school climate,leadership,and interpersonal relationships as the areas where there was a significant need for improvement on ulichny behalf.the board suggested that ulichny register for classes and workshops to help her improve in those areas and stated its expectation that there will be measurable and significant improvement in her performance.the board also directed that ulichny agree to a formal plan of assistance that included a process of continuous evaluation and feedback on the areas previously noted and goals and steps to accomplish these goals.
ulichny third year and the wedgie incident 
on july,mark flynn replaced budisch as the district administrator.immediately after flynn assumed the district administrator position,he prepared a formal assistance plan for ulichny,dated august,which identified four areas for climate,leadership skills,interpersonal skills,and communication skills.additionally,flynn set goals and actions for ulichny to perform,and set a timeline in which he expected these goals and actions to be accomplished.flynn plan required weekly meetings between flynn and ulichny in order that he might monitor her progress in team building skills and healthy communication.additionally,flynn was supposed to prepare quarterly written progress reports evaluating ulichny performance and development in order that ulichny could continue to improve as a principal and the board could monitor that improvement.
on october,before flynn prepared any of the quarterly progress reports,approximately six and grade students physically and violently assaulted another boy on the playground code named a wedgie.according to the district court findings,
this was not a quick grab and release wedgie,a childhood prank between friends that even the court remembers.this particular wedgie was of a very aggressive variety,there were kids against,they forced their victim to the ground,they pulled so hard on his underwear that he was lifted into the air and dropped back to the ground,and his underwear tore in two places.the victim ran away crying.in short,this was not playful behavior between friends it was a act of cruelty intended to humiliate the child at issue.
emphasis added.
before deciding on any course of action,ulichny called district administrator flynn and informed him of the wedgie incident and she proposed calling the sheriff department.flynn agreed with ulichny suggestion and ulichny called deputy haizel,the school officer 
once at the scene,deputy haizel spoke with ulichny,the students involved in the incident,and some of the students parents.after his investigation,deputy haizel issued each of the students who had given the boy a wedgie a citation for disorderly conduct after the deputy issued the citations,ulichny notified the parents of the students involved in the incident,relayed the fact that the police had been called,and advised them about the issuance of disorderly conduct citations 
fallout from the wedgie incident 
the wedgie incident garnered a great deal of attention.local newspaper stories reported details of the incident,including the fact that some of the parents felt that ulichny had responded inappropriately and in too harsh a manner when calling the police.a petition was circulated in the community requesting an independent investigation into the handling of the incident.
although there were obviously members of the community who felt ulichny had mishandled the matter,there were also a significant portion of the community who supported ulichny actions.in fact,flynn,who had approved ulichny decision to call the police,publicly supported ulichny actions.also,waukesha county sheriff captain thomas lentz was quoted as saying,w hen the school requested our assistance,we responded,and it is my presumption the incident had gone beyond what was tolerable within the school.colleen krantz and linda spice,suspensions for wedgie upset students parents citations in merton middle school incident could cost boys,milwaukee journal sentinel,october.
on november,while some members of the community were still complaining about ulichny handling of the wedgie incident,flynn issued ulichny first quarterly progress report.flynn,who had approved ulichny proposal to call the police to the school after the wedgie incident,concluded that ulichny has demonstrated good performance in her role as principal and noted her willingness,with results,to actively participate in the improvement process thrust upon her by the board and the superintendent.furthermore,the school district had an outside consultant conduct a staff survey during the month of december.the survey report stated that there was an improvement in the relationship between ulichny and the professional teaching staff and noted that,while some distrust remain ed,it was on a subdued level since the school year.
on december,flynn gave ulichny her second quarterly progress report.in the second report,flynn concluded that susan continues to improve as a principal her improvement orientation,her introspection,are exemplary.three days after this report,and in an effort to assist the board in making its decision regarding the possible renewal of ulichny contract,flynn submitted a confidential report to the school board regarding ulichny contract status and the progress of her assistance plan.the report listed specific areas of strength,areas of improvement,and areas for future growth.furthermore,flynn recommended that ulichny receive a renewed contract for two years.according to flynn,
ulichny has earned a year contract.my impression was that i started with a first year principal.improvement has been substantial and her improvement orientation will continue to help her improve.her performance has been good this year,she has the potential to improve and has served the district well.
many times there currently exists with the employees and the community a propensity to make susan the issue,instead of children being the issue.the support of a year contract reduces that propensity.
at this time,flynn was aware of the propensity among school employees and community members to make ulichny the scapegoat for many of the problems.flynn further recognized that if the board showed its support for ulichny,in the form of a contract,the unwarranted fingerpointing at ulichny might be reduced.on december,the board,in a closed session,voted to issue a contract to ulichny covering the and school years.
f.the board remains supportive 
during a january,board meeting,some days after the wedgie incident,ulichny handling of the matter was again raised some of the parents still criticized ulichny actions while others spoke out in support of her exercise of judgment.like before,flynn spoke in strong support of ulichny actions,stating that susan had my percent support a nd has it to this day.
like a dog gnawing on a bone,some parents still could not let go of ulichny handling of the wedgie incident.when jeffrey musche,a parent of a child in the school district,learned that the board had voted to extend ulichny a twoyear contract,he complained apparently to the police that the board violated wisconsin open meetings law.stat.et,by not informing the public or voting in open session regarding ulichny contract renewal.after flynn discussed the vote with waukesha county district attorney paul bucher to whom musche complaint was forwarded and who concluded that the vote was illegal,the board met on february,and voted to rescind the prior vote on ulichny contract.
after a group of parents voiced their objections to the renewal of ulichny contract at the february,board meeting,the board delayed a second vote on ulichny contract.it should be noted that parents at the meeting also took issue with flynn evaluations of ulichny and now added to their complaints alleged teacher morale problems,teacher turnover,student achievement,an unsettled teachers contract,and delayed textbooks.as noted by the district court,newspaper reports following the meeting attributed the following position to flynn concerning ulichny the other issues raised 
superintendent mark flynn had completed ulichny evaluation.he has steadfastly upheld her decision to call law enforcement to the school.
flynn went on to say that he shared some of the concerns raised by the residents,including teacher morale,lack of trust,the public regard for the administration,an unsettled teachers contract,teachers regard for the board and teacher turnover.
flynn said there is a misperception as to why some teachers have left the district.the reasons are stated in correspondence the district has received from the teachers.he did not elaborate on the reasons.flynn also addressed concerns that had been raised about textbooks,students placement at arrowhead high school and curriculum flynn added he is looking at providing time for teachers to talk to each other about educational strategies 
asked about parents complaints,superintendent mark flynn said i not going to substantiate or deny them.it was these parents opportunity to state their perceptions and that what they did.parents of the youths said administrators overreacted by calling police.but flynn said the district acted appropriately.
emphasis added.
the newspaper articles also quoted school board president isabel brown as stating that,although numerous parents who attended the meeting wanted ulichny removed,we probably have more people who want her to stay than want her out.emphasis added.
school administrators and the board abandon ulichny 
the board met in open session on february,to again discuss whether to renew ulichny contract.however,the deadline for providing ulichny with a preliminary notice of under.stat.had passed and the board was thus obligated to renew ulichny contract.instead of merely renewing ulichny contract for a year,the board voted to continue susan ulichny employment with the merton community school district with a revised job title and description beginning with the school year.on february,flynn sent a memo to all school district employees stating in part 
the school board was advised by legal counsel of the fact that statutory timelines provided for the renewal of the employment contract for ulichny whether the board acted or not.given that advice,the board acted to continue ulichny employment contract with the merton community school district for the next years with a revised job title and description,beginning with the school year.
the board,after lengthy discussion,took this action in response to contractual obligations,statutory requirements,staff input,board input,parent input,and taxpayer interest.the board,in the coming months,will approve revised job duties for administrative staff that are responsive to the input received from staff and parents.
newspaper articles quoted brown and flynn as follows 
ulichny new duties likely will include some of the areas she now handles,such as curriculum and technology,brown said.
she will be the principal for the balance of this year,brown said.we hoping that the rest of the year goes well we will be working with susan and the staff to see where her abilities fit in best.
superintendent mark flynn said friday that he understands parents remain upset about the contract extension.but he said the board decision took into account both negative and positive comments the district received about ulichny,the district contractual obligations,a responsibility to taxpayers,and ulichny years of employment in merton schools.
when the job responsibilities are finalized,i think people will be able to readily see the board is responding in the best interests of the children of merton schools,flynn said.this is the start of a process of change.
however,an april,milwaukee journal sentinel article reported that the board could strip ulichny of her duties as principal at the end of the school year and quoted board president brown as stating that ulichny revised job duties could lead to her not being principal.the lake country reporter stated that although ulichny would be allowed to stay on at the merton intermediate school for at least two more years,she may no longer be principal of the school.the article went on to state that 
there will be some shifting of job responsibilities,said superintendent mark flynn.she could feasibly not be the principal of merton intermediate school.
i confident we can put together a plan that will work for the children and be responsive to their needs,said flynn,adding that the board was trying to accommodate the needs of everybody involved.
the board feels that the plan is responsive to the concerns of the board,staff and parents,he said.the division of duties is something that will reflect the concerns that the community and staff indicated they wanted.
flynn said neither he nor the board had decided on any specific changes to ulichny job description.
throughout the controversy,flynn and the school board have stood behind their principal,but at a raucous meeting last week a number of parents spoke out criticizing ulichny conduct and asking for her dismissal.
flynn did not describe the board as having been forced to keep ulichny on,but did say that the time had passed when the board could have asked her to leave.
despite the fact that newspaper articles were regularly appearing which quoted school administrators as questioning ulichny role as school principal it is most interesting to note that these supposed concerns did not exist just two months earlier when the board voted to extend ulichny contract for two years,ulichny accepted her contract on march.however,when flynn asked ulichny to assist him in drafting her revised job duties,she refused.this,in our opinion,was a matter of poor judgment on the part of ulichny because she passed up the opportunity to put her input in the changes.in spite of the fact that ulichny stated that she felt she was capable of performing all the current duties of her position,flynn drafted,without ulichny input,the proposed changes and provided her with a copy of the proposed job description and title changes just hours before the new job description was to be presented at the april,school board meeting.
in his plan,flynn recommended that he become the intermediate school principal in addition to being the district administrator.mike budisch,who was previously the primary school principal,would serve as the principal.ulichny would assist flynn in the administration of the intermediate school,while retaining her salary and the title of school principal.however,she was divested of the specific authority to perform many of the duties which she had previously performed,such as the direct supervision of employees and student discipline.
upon receipt of the new job description,ulichny attorney wrote a letter to the school board and stated that the proposed changes violated her contract wisconsin law and her federal due process rights.ulichny attorney also claimed that if the school board considered flynn proposed changes in an open session or released the proposed changes to the public,the school board would be violating ulichny due process liberty interest rights in her reputation.
the board saw fit not to respond to this letter and held the april,meeting in open session reporters and several community members were in attendance.at the meeting,flynn proposed changes were briefly discussed.the board did not vote on the proposed changes,but scheduled a meeting for may,to vote on the proposed job changes.however,prior to the meeting,ulichny served a notice of claim and claim on the clerk of the merton school board,which reasserted the claims made in her attorney letter to the board.in response to the notice,the board removed the scheduled vote on the proposed job changes from its formal agenda for the may meeting.instead,the board held a closed session meeting to confer with legal counsel and receive advice concerning strategy to be adopted with respect to litigation which is likely to occur.
after ulichny sent the notice,flynn began sending memos to ulichny criticizing various perceived lapses in her performance additionally,flynn failed to prepare and file the march and june quarterly progress reports despite the fact that they were set forth in the assistance plan put in place when ulichny was for the school year.it is important to note that ulichny did not recall ever receiving such critical memos from flynn in the past.it is also important to note that ulichny previous two performance reviews before her job duties were revised had been very positive.
despite flynn either contrived or careless failure to prepare and file the remaining quarterly progress reports,he did prepare a evaluation of ulichny performance on july.in the evaluation which he never discussed with ulichny,flynn radically and not surprisingly altered his evaluation of ulichny and cited regression in many critical areas since ulichny first two quarterly progress reports.flynn further concluded that ulichny performance if not reversed,will result in a,unsuccessful employment relationship with the merton community schools.it should be noted that even at this time newspaper reports were still reflecting a divided community.for example,an article in the milwaukee journal sentinel stated 
those who wrote in favor of ulichny said she is the victim of a vocal minority that is manipulating the school board.
parents greg and lisa overholt wrote to the board saying ulichny is a very professional and caring person.
unfortunately,as part of our human nature,you will hear more often and more loudly the voices of discontent we urge you to understand that those who are complaining speak for themselves only and do not speak for the community as a whole,the overholts wrote.
a school counselor,sanders,wrote to the board that ulichny had turned a turbulent atmosphere at the school into a sense of calm,a sense of orderliness.
even the delafield police chief weighed in on the matter,although he does live in the district.
i believe principal ulichny acted appropriately when she notified the sheriff about the wedgie incident and while i do not think the police should be called for every shoving match or disruptive act a student might get involved in,i think it very likely that school administrators do not call the police as often as they should,chief jack arndt wrote.
letters against ulichny were equally passionate.
morale of teachers,staff and students is the lowest i seen in the last eight years our curriculum leaves a lot to be desired,parent sandy wegner wrote to the board.we have lost some of the best teachers we ever had because of their problems with ulichny.wrote russell and cindy hauser there is an overwhelming feeling in this community that our intermediate school is in disarray and that is a direct reflection of the problems with our principal.one parent,whose name was censored from the letter by district officials,said ulichny,by calling police in the playground incident,stripped the parents of the right to discipline their own children.

on august,flynn sent ulichny a memo and stated that c oncrete changes were going to take effect in the upcoming school year.the changes were as follows 
under the category of,ulichny was required to be on the playground for a half hour before school,in the lunch room and on the playground for all three lunch periods of the intermediate school,in the halls when the and graders changed classes,and in the halls and outside school during school dismissal and bus departure.
under employee supervision,flynn was responsible for the supervision and evaluation of all teachers and ulichny would only assist with scheduling issues and would be assigned specific teacher evaluations to participate in.
under student discipline,ulichny would handle student discipline in grades,while flynn would handle discipline in grades and all enforcement situations.
under newsletter,ulichny and flynn would work together to set a schedule and contents for the school newsletter.
under nca and curriculum evaluation,ulichny would provide the administrative leadership in these areas.
under intermediate advisory council,flynn would work directly with the advisory council,and ulichny may participate if flynn deem ed it appropriate,but not in the beginning.
under support,ulichny was expected to support and carry out in spirit and letter,the positions,policies,and directions of the school board and superintendent a greement with the decision is not relevant.
on august,flynn and ulichny along with their respective counsel met to discuss the changes in her job responsibilities.according to flynn notes,he district counsel raised issues concerning ulichny job performance,including her failure to progress in inspiring trust,lack of attendance at special events,lack of judgment,and noncompliance with directives.flynn also elaborated on some of the responsibilities he would be assuming in light of ulichny new job description.for example,in the area of student discipline,flynn stated that he would assume a mentoring role on a temporary basis in grades and that ulichny would handle grades except special education and suspensions.flynn described his mentoring role as one in which he would,at his sole discretion,handl e some cases,others handled as a team,others with consultation,and some delegated to ulichny.additionally,in the area of employee supervision,flynn also stated that he would assume a mentoring role concerning the supervision of all employees at the intermediate school,for purposes as well as evaluation purposes.flynn described his mentoring role as one in which he,again at his sole discretion,exclusively handl ed some,others handled as a team,others with consultation and some delegated to ulichny.flynn explained that these changes were being taken because the building and its morale were viewed to be in crisis,and some modeling or teaching for ulichny was needed in light of the situation after her three years in the district.possibly the new description was a last attempt by flynn to save his own position from a politically biased school board.
at the beginning of the school year,flynn moved his office into the intermediate school and was directly across the hall from ulichny office.furthermore,in spite of the fact that flynn approved and supported as did the board ulichny decision to notify the police after the violent assault by the six children perpetrated on one single child,flynn presided over the first faculty meeting and informed the teachers and staff that he would be handling all discipline at the intermediate school and that he would perform all teacher supervision and evaluations.a subsequent memo to school staff informed them that they could contact either flynn or ulichny with questions or concerns,but stated that flynn was their direct supervisor.additionally,flynn hired a teacher for the school without conferring with ulichny.he also conducted staff meetings without informing ulichny of the meetings or what had transpired at them.flynn also dealt with staff,parents,and students regarding issues at the school and ulichny had to refer questions from parents or staff to him.
on september,ulichny asked flynn whether the current division of responsibilities would continue indefinitely and flynn responded that they would.after ulichny called in sick the next day,flynn ordered her to provide a doctor note.the note ulichny provided advised flynn that ulichny was suffering from an unspecified medical illness and that she was to remain off work until her condition is improved.
on september,flynn sent ulichny forms to apply for a medical leave of absence.however,ulichny responded that she was not requesting leave under the family medical leave act.on october,ulichny lawyer sent a letter to the school district claiming that ulichny had been constructively terminated because her main duties had been taken away and her job was,therefore,unbearable.
ulichny,at this time,filed a complaint in the united stated federal court for the eastern district of wisconsin alleging that the school district and the various other defendants had violated her due process rights when they altered her job responsibilities as mentioned before,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants because,based on the law according to the trial judge,ulichny did not have a property interest in her job as school principal and she was not constructively discharged.the district court judge further concluded that according to case law she was not deprived of her liberty interest in continuing her career in public school administration.finally,the judge concluded that even if there was merit to ulichny claims,the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.ulichny appeals.

property right 
ulichny federal constitutional claim depends on her having had a property right in continued employment as the school principal.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d board of regents roth,d reagan united states.if ulichny does have a such a right in her position as school principal,the school board could not terminate her without due process.memphis light,gas water div.craft,d goss lopez,d.in evaluating ulichny claim on appeal,it is important to understand that property interests are not created by the united states constitution.rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.roth,at.see also paul davis,d.accordingly,federal property interests under the amendment usually arise from rights created by state statutes,state or municipal regulations or ordinances,and contracts with public entities.furthermore,property interests subject to procedural due process protection are not limited by a few rigid,technical forms.rather,property denotes a broad range of interests that are secured by existing rules or understandings.perry sindermann.internal citations and quotations omitted.finally,a property right may be supplemented by other agreements implied from the promisor words and conduct in the light of the surrounding circumstances.id.at.internal citations and quotations omitted.
on appeal,ulichny argues that her 
contract and wisconsin law establish her federal property interest in performing the primary duties of school principal.this is so because her contract provided that the district employed her in the position of school principal and because wisconsin case law recognizes that if an employer refuses to allow an employee to perform the primary duties agreed upon,the employer has discharged the employee.ulichny further argues that while the board had the right to assign her additional duties,it did not have the right to take away the primary duties of her position.
two provisions of ulichny contract cover the duties responsibilities she was to have.the first provision obligated ulichny to devote full time to the duties and responsibilities normally expected of the principal position during the term of this contract emphasis added.the second provision required that she perform at a professional level of competence the services,duties and obligations required by the laws of the state of wisconsin and the rules,regulations and policies of the board with regard to wisconsin statutes,wisconsin state law requires that t he principal perform such administrative and instructional leadership responsibilities as are assigned by the district administrator under the rules and regulations of the school board.stat.ann.
the district court concluded that 
the wisconsin statutes do not support the existence of a principal property interest in performing specific duties.neither does the contract reference to the duties and responsibilities normally expected of the principal position this provision,placed within the responsibilities section of the statute,simply sets forth what ulichny obligations were under the contract.it does not place a reciprocal obligation on the board or prevent the district administrator acting with the board determining what the precise nature of ulichny duties would be.
in terry woods,the federal court in the eastern district of wisconsin was asked to address a very similar factual case.in terry,the 
employment contract,the basic source of any property interest the plaintiff may enjoy as a public employee,states that rusd racine unified school district does hereby employ terry.terry agrees to perform his duties in accordance with the rules set by the state and by rusd.the contract further provides that in consideration for services rendered,rusd agrees to pay terry a biweekly salary,to contribute to a retirement fund on terry behalf,and to afford terry various other benefits,such as vacation time,insurance,and so on.the term of the contract was from july,to june.terry aff.at ex.
the state statute concerning the employment of school administrators sets procedural requirements for the renewal or nonrenewal of a principal contract.prior to notice of nonrenewal,a principal must be given preliminary notice of nonrenewal,and has the opportunity for a hearing.the statute also provides that a principal 
shall perform such administrative and instructional leadership responsibilities as are assigned by the district administrator under the rules and regulations of the school board.
further,the statute provides that a principal under contract with any school board may not be employed by another school board.

that the circumstances surrounding terry employment do not indicate that he was entitled to go to work.most importantly,terry contract can not be read as conferring any such entitlement.the consideration flowing to him under the contract is limited to his salary and certain fringe benefits of an economic nature.although both the contract and state law require terry to perform certain duties,that requirement does not directly impose any obligation upon rusd.terry may have reasonably expected that he would be able to do his work,but an expectation by itself does not create a property interest.roth,at.at.

in bordelon chicago sch.reform bd.of trustees,cir,a case decided the day before oral argument in this case,this court also addressed the property rights a school principal has in his or her job.in fact,in bordelon,the school district not only took away the main duties of the school principal but also transferred the principal to an administrative position in the central office.id.at.in bordelon,this court held that the school board was entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff claim for deprivation of his property interest because he failed to offer any evidence of economic harm as a result of the board conduct.id.at.
however,in this case,ulichny was not transferred to another official position or location.in fact,she retained her title as principal and was paid the same wage.ulichny attempts to support her position by pointing to amorphous phrases like duties and responsibilities normally expected of the principal position.however,in roth,at,the supreme court held that t o have a property interest in a benefit,a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.emphasis added.we can,of course,understand ulichny desire to perform the duties that she reasonably believed constituted the position of school principal.however,the fact that ulichny could very well have reasonably believed that she should be able to perform certain duties as principal,this expectation without more either in the caselaw,the job description,the contract,or wisconsin statutes does not rise to the level of a protectable property right under the united states constitution because,under the terms of the contract and wisconsin law,she does not have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.id.
for example,in ulichny appellate brief she lists the following six duties she lost enforce discipline participate in the recruiting,screening,hiring,training,assigning,and evaluation of professional and support staff persons assigned to the school evaluate and counsel all staff members conduct staff meetings recommend to the district administrator whether or not to remove or discipline a staff member and delegate authority.however,the right to perform any one of these specific duties is neither enumerated in ulichny employment contract nor in any wisconsin state statutes.consequently,relying on federal and state law as we must,we are bound to conclude that ulichny does not have a recognized property interest in performing particular duties as a principal.this is not to say that we are unsympathetic to ulichny claim and we believe she was the victim of a school board who failed to support a school principal who not only acted in the best interest of the children but also in the best interest of the school,especially in this day of ever increasing school violence and litigation.however,not all torts or contract breaches committed by government entities are constitutional or civil rights violations with redress in federal court.bordelon,at 
constructive discharge 
ulichny also argues that she was constructively discharged when the board and the district administrator revised her job duties and thus made her working conditions so intolerable that she was compelled to quit.
in support of her claim of constructive discharge,ulichny cites a litany of developments and actions that allegedly created an intolerable working environment.in her brief to this court,ulichny identifies six actions which support her constructive discharge claim 
flynn moved his office into the intermediate school directly across from ulichny office and took control of the school.
over ulichny objection,defendants used an overhead projector to graphically display to the public that ulichny would have supervisory duties over no one.
flynn assigned ulichny the duties of a perhour aide for almost four hours every day.
flynn told ulichny on at least two occasions that she should get another job.
ulichny had less authority than her staff with respect to the discipline of students.
defendants never informed ulichny why they stripped her of the main duties of school principal.
as the district court aptly noted,
w hat is clear from the foregoing litany of complaints,and from the record as set forth in the factual section,supra,is that the political fallout from the handling of the wedgie incident brought substantial pressures to bear in the merton community school district and caused a substantial amount of stress and humiliation for both ulichny,flynn,the board and the school district as a whole.it is also clear that the political fallout was something that neither ulichny nor the school district could control the story assumed a course and life of its own through the efforts of several disgruntled parents and an energized media both locally and nationally.it is finally clear that the perhaps underestimating the magnitude of the situation,and when forced to consider the issue of ulichny job renewal in an open session with public surmised that the political situation required action to quell the storm.the action it took was to make flynn the direct principal of merton intermediate school and to revise ulichny job duties such that she was essentially an assistant principal with reduced responsibilities at least initially acting on flynn direction and guidance.perhaps this was unfair or even cowardly considering the undisputed strides ulichny had made prior to and for some time after the wedgie incident,and certainly it was a setback for ulichny 
in support for her claim that she was constructively discharged,ulichny cites to parrett city of connersville,cir.however,we are of the opinion that parrett provides no support for ulichny.in parrett,a former chief of detectives was removed and demoted and given a windowless room to sit in that formerly had been a storage closet.the room had a desk and chair but no other furniture and no telephone.id.at.additionally,parrett spent his entire shift sitting at the desk with nothing to do.id.we are of the opinion that ulichny situation certainly was far removed from the extreme situation in parrett and that her assignment did not rise to the level of warranting a resignation as the only alternative to avoiding or overcoming an intolerable situation.
for example,she retained her same title and pay as principal,and more importantly,she continued to perform some but not all of the duties and responsibilities usually assigned to a principal.ulichny can not argue that she was subjected to enforced idleness faced the distinct possibility that her professional skills as a principal would substantially depreciate.while it is undisputed that ulichny lost direct responsibility for some of the more significant or traditional duties of a principal,she did have a role in the administration of the school and did,as described above,retain some responsibilities and duties,unlike parrett.
rather than the circumstances being objectively intolerable as required under the constructive discharge doctrine,we are of the opinion ulichny must have believed that any changes in her duties were unacceptable.this is evidenced by her refusal to even participate or assist flynn in restructuring her job responsibilities,taking the position that no changes were necessary and thus suggesting that any change was unacceptable.not only is this position not objectively reasonable,but it is important to note that ulichny passed up the opportunity to have input and some possible influence concerning what changes to her responsibilities would be made.
it is also possible that the board gave ulichny different responsibilities in the hopes that sooner or later she would quit.however,the fact that ulichny endured the changes for a short span of only three weeks truly undermines her constructive discharge claim the duties to which she was assigned,although clearly beneath her level of experience and accomplishment,are not totally unexpected of teachers and administrators.we certainly understand her frustration at the board as well as district administrator flynn abandonment of her,but under the law she should have given the new regime more time before quitting.to hold otherwise would be to take the objectively unreasonable requirement out of the constructive discharge doctrine and place a premium on the intent of the employer.
we are of the opinion that ulichny act of resignation was not the only means to avoid objectively miserable working conditions.rather,it appears she was of the opinion that the school board was handling criticism of her,including the wedgie incident,improperly and that any changes in her contract were unnecessary.although her beliefs might very well have been reasonable,the fact that the politically active board chose to go another way even unreasonably does not make her working conditions so intolerable that she was constructively discharged.
liberty interest 
ulichny also claims that the defendants violated her federal liberty interests by publicly making false statements that she was untrustworthy and should not be around children.she also claims that her liberty interests were violated when she was assigned degradingly inferior duties.
as we stated in draghi county of cook,cir,
the concept of liberty protected by the due process clause has long included occupational liberty the liberty to follow a trade,profession,or other calling.wroblewski city of washburn,cir citing lawson sheriff of tippecanoe county,cir.the cases have consistently drawn a distinction,however,between occupational liberty and the right to hold a specific job.the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment secures the liberty to pursue a calling or occupation,and not the right to a specific job.wroblewski,at lawson,at.it stretches the concept too far to suggest that a person is deprived of liberty when he simply is not rehired in one job but remains as free as before to seek another.roth,at,d.
in her appellate brief,ulichny initially argues that and flynn stigmatized her by public comments they made.the first comment ulichny points to is when flynn,at a board meeting,stated that he shared concerns regarding ulichny lack of trust.
it is important to note that not every remark which may arguably affect one reputation violates due process if made by a government official without a hearing,for the fourteenth amendment protects only against charges that might seriously damage one standing and associations in the community.hadley county of dupage,cir quoting lipp bd.of educ.of city of chicago,cir.thus,this court has taken the position that a mere charge of mismanagement is not enough to give rise to a liberty interest requiring a hearing.id.liberty is not infringed by a label of incompetence or a failu
