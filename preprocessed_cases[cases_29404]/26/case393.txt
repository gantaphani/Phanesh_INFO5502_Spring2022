autism is a developmental disorder that affects a child ability to communicate,use imagination,and establish relationships with others.see amanda ex rel.annette clark county sch,cir.children with autism generally have significant deficits in language development,behavior,and social interaction.one of the primary ways that children learn is through imitation of the actions and sounds that they see and hear.autistic children,however,generally have a greatly reduced ability to imitate.autistic children also lack normal joint attention ability to follow another gaze and share the experience of looking at an object or activity.because these deficits affect the way autistic children learn and develop,
e arly diagnosis is crucial e ducation of children as well as of parents and teachers is the primary form of treatment,and the earlier it starts,the better.education covers a wide range of skills or not only academic learning,but also socialization,adaptive skills,language and communication,and reduction of behavior assist a child to develop independence and personal responsibility.
without early identification and diagnosis,children suffering from autism will not be equipped with the skills necessary to benefit from educational services.
amanda,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
was diagnosed as severely autistic when he was two.as the state hearing officer found,has significant communication deficits at months,spoke no words and at months he could not follow verbal commands.lacks normal joint attention skills and has very little ability to stay on task.when he was months old,could stay on task independently for about five minutes and could quietly wait unattended for approximately seconds.is easily frustrated,which can lead to disruptive behaviors such as crying,biting,slapping,kicking,and sweeping items off a table.also has deficits in gross motor skills and significant deficits in fine motor skills.
like many autistic children,when given the opportunity will engage in behavior,often referred to as stimming.stimming consists of repetitive patterns of behavior such as flapping of the hands,rocking back and forth,or repeating a word or a sound.stimming is often an behavior that directly interferes with an autistic child ability to engage in the environment appropriately and directly interferes with the child ability to learn.behavior in autistic children is,such that the more they engage in the behavior,the more they want to engage in the behavior.absent appropriate supervision or intervention,stimming can become the dominant behavior for kids with autism.
has several different forms of behaviors,including humming and wiggling long slender objects between his fingers while staring at them out of the corner of his eye.without intervention,would engage in stimming all day long.
after was diagnosed,the parents search for help led them to what is now known as the faison school.they enrolled him at faison in april,when he was not quite three years old.the faison school uses the applied behavioral analysis aba approach to teaching autistic children.aba is an iteration of the lovaas method,which involves breaking down activities into discrete tasks and rewarding a child accomplishments the method has been widely modified over the years,but common characteristics include intensive training,hours per week,discrete trial therapy dtt,and an component as opposed to therapy in a professional setting.g ex rel.rg fort bragg dependent,cir citations,internal quotation marks,and alterations omitted.at faison,a team comprised of a teacher and teaching assistants work with the students the school has four teachers for each student.one assistant is assigned to each student and is always with that student.the student and his assistant work in a private classroom for much of the day,moving into group sessions for certain activities.attends faison six hours a day,five days a week,thus receiving hours of instruction each week.parents and his older sister have all received training in aba methods,and they use the aba methods with at home.while at faison,has made real progress in some areas,and little progress in other areas.
in october,the school board identified as eligible for special education and related services.the school board met with the parents and developed an iep for the school year.the parents rejected that iep,leaving at faison for that school year.the adequacy of the iep is not at issue in this appeal.
in the summer of,the school board evaluated to determine his level of performance,testing and observing him at faison.in the fall of,the school board and the parents met to develop an iep for the school year.the iep called for to be placed in the autism class at twin hickory elementary school.
the twin hickory program primarily uses the teacch method,a method for teaching autistic children that was developed in north carolina and has been adopted by many school districts throughout the country.the teacch method differs from the aba method in many respects.it places greater emphasis on visual skills,encourages independent work on individual skills,and makes extensive use of group instruction.the twin hickory teacher,however,made it clear that she incorporates other methodologies in her classroom,including some aspects of aba therapy.
the twin hickory program is staffed by a teacher and a assistant.twin hickory has sessions in the morning and afternoon during the school year,four students attended the morning session and five attended the afternoon session.one of the students during the morning session had his own aide who worked with that student.in each session,students in the twin hickory program typically receive about minutes of instruction by the teacher,plus some additional instruction by the assistant.
in apparent recognition of the severity of autism,the board proposed iep called for to attend both the morning and afternoon session at twin hickory.the board had never before made such a other students attended one session or the other,but not both.the iep also called for minutes of direct occupational therapy once a week and minutes of speech therapy three times a week.
parents requested that the board provide him with a aide.this request was apparently neither formally rejected or iep stated that the iep t eam did not this request however was unable to determine time frame for training.
the parents were not satisfied with the iep proposed by the school board.their primary concern was that the class size at twin hickory would prevent from receiving the amount of direct instruction required to keep him focused and on task,particularly since the iep did not guarantee a aide.the parents therefore rejected the iep,choosing instead to leave at the faison school.after the parents rejected the iep,they were told by a school employee that an aide had been hired.the board never formally notified the parents that an aide would be or was in fact hired,and the iep was not amended to reflect that an aide for was hired.
the parents thereafter requested a due process hearing to challenge the appropriateness of the school board iep.see f west.in accordance with virginia idea procedures,an evidentiary hearing was held before a state hearing officer,who heard testimony from numerous witnesses,considered extensive documentary evidence,and personally observed the faison and twin hickory classrooms.
the hearing officer concluded that the board iep did not provide with a free appropriate public education.the hearing officer found that has a very limited ability to work independently and that he aggressively engages in activity when not attended to in a situation.the hearing officer concluded that when is engaged in behavior,he is so engaged in the activity that his ability to learn is precluded.in light of the testimony establishing that would receive approximately minutes per day of instruction at twin hickory,the hearing officer concluded that tendency to could not be adequately kept in check at twin hickory,thus precluding from learning in that environment 
given the number of other children,the requirement to work independently,the natural distractions at twin hickory and lack of communication skills,social behavior,inability to stay on task for more than a few minutes,his fear of other children and his severe propensity to self stimulate and his inability to learn when,ability to access the curriculum offered at twin hickory would be so impaired as to deny him educational benefit.
the hearing officer concluded that the faison school was an appropriate placement for and that the school board was therefore obligated to pay for the cost of placement at the faison school for the school year see school comm.department of,d concluding that retroactive reimbursement of private placement costs is an available remedy under idea if the school iep does not provide a fape.
the board then instituted this action in federal court seeking review of the hearing officer determination.the district court did not take additional evidence,but instead reviewed the record of the proceedings before the state hearing officer.the district court noted that it was required to give due weight to the findings of the state hearing officer.the district court,however,concluded that the hearing officer had so substantially departed from the norm that his findings were entitled to no weight.
according to the district court,the hearing officer improperly accepted the testimony of the parents witnesses,without giving proper consideration to the testimony of the school board witnesses.the district court concluded that the school board witnesses were entitled to great weight,and that the hearing officer at a minimum was required to explain why he chose not to credit the testimony of the school board witnesses.in this regard,the district court noted that the fourth circuit has repeatedly said that reviewing courts should not the educational judgments of school employees.the district court never explicitly concluded that the iep provided with a free appropriate public education.the court,however,recounted favorably the testimony of the board witnesses in which they expressed their belief that the iep was appropriate.the district court therefore appears to have implicitly concluded that the iep provided with a fape.the district court rejected the hearing officer analysis and granted summary judgment in favor of the board.the parents appeal.
on appeal,the parents contend that the district court failed to give proper deference to the hearing officer factual findings and legal conclusions.the parents argue that the hearing officer determination that the iep did not provide with a free appropriate public education was supported by the record and the district court therefore erred by setting aside the hearing officer decision and granting judgment to the school board.for its part,the school board contends that the hearing officer failed to give proper deference to the considered views of its professional educators that the iep was appropriate,and that the district court therefore properly rejected the hearing officer conclusions.
the idea authorizes an aggrieved party to bring an action in federal court challenging the decision rendered in the state administrative proceeding.see i a west.actions authorized under this provision are procedurally unique in that they are independent civil actions in which the district court considers the record of the state administrative hearing,as well as any new evidence offered by a party,and makes findings based on the preponderance of the evidence.see i b.although the federal action is an independent civil action and not an appeal of the state administrative proceeding,see kirkpatrick lenoir county bd.of,cir,the supreme court has made it clear that the district court must give due weight to the state administrative proceeding.see rowley,at.doyle arlington county sch,cir generally,in reviewing state administrative decisions in idea cases,courts are required to make an independent decision based on a preponderance of the evidence,while giving due weight to state administrative proceedings.
we have concluded that the due weight to be given the state administrative proceeding requires that 
findings of fact by the hearing officers in idea cases be considered prima facie correct,akin to the traditional sense of permitting a result to be based on such,but not requiring it.
we are further of opinion that when are regularly made and entitled to prima facie correctness,the district court,if it is not going to follow them,is required to explain why it does not after giving the administrative such due weight,if any,the district court then is free to decide the case on the preponderance of the evidence,as required by the statute.
doyle,at citations omitted.in our view,the district court misapplied these standards.
doyle makes it clear that factual findings made during the state administrative proceeding are entitled to a presumption of correctness,so long as the findings were regularly made.id.factual findings are not regularly made if they are reached through a process that is far from the accepted norm of a process.id.at.for example,in doyle we concluded that a state administrative appeals officer reviewing the findings of the local hearing officer who conducted the hearing violated the accepted norms of the process by rejecting,on review of a cold record,the testimony of a witness that the hearing officer had found credible,simply because the reviewing officer believed that the witness was acting as an advocate 
t he reviewing officer concluded that solomon saw her role as that of an advocate and found her testimony not to be credible.while it is true that by statute and regulation the reviewing officer is required to make an independent decision,we are of opinion that his reason for discrediting a witness who he had not seen or heard testify,in the face of the crediting of that same witness by a hearing officer who had seen and heard the witness testify,is so far from the accepted norm of a process designed to discover truth that we think the due weight which should be accorded the decision of the reviewing officer depending on that credibility decision is none.
in this case,the district court concluded that the hearing officer failed to consider and credit the testimony of the school board witnesses,which the district court viewed as a sufficient departure from the norm under doyle that the hearing officer findings should be accorded no weight at all.see district court opinion,t he hearing officer decision was presumably based on the testimony of the witnesses on both sides.a review of the hearing officer decision,however,suggests that the decision did not adequately,if at all,consider the testimony of the school board three expert witnesses but instead of crediting the testimony of these witnesses,the hearing officer appears to have relied on and based his decision on the testimony of the parents two experts in making his decision,the hearing officer placed too much,if not exclusive,reliance on the parents experts testimony and failed to give appropriate consideration to the basis for each witness opinion.in our view,what the district court identified as failings on the part of the hearing officer are not failings at all,much less failings of a degree that would warrant a wholesale rejection of the hearings officer findings.
the hearing officer opinion was thorough,with many citations and references to the testimony of the school board witnesses.it is thus clear that the hearing officer did give careful consideration to the opinions of the school board witnesses.as to what the hearing officer believed was the critical then had the ability to access twin hickory hearing officer was persuaded by the testimony of the parents witnesses.
the hearing officer noted strong propensity to engage in behavior if left on his own,a conclusion that was supported by the testimony of the parents witnesses and by that of a school board witness the hearing officer concluded that while some autistic children can learn while engaging in behavior,stimming was so severe that he could not learn while engaging in behavior.the hearing officer noted that the classroom at twin hickory,which was larger than private room at the faison school,would be too stimulating and too distracting to,another conclusion supported by the testimony of a school board witness the hearing officer also determined that the class size at twin hickory would preclude from receiving the amount of direct,instruction that would be necessary to keep him focused and to stop him from engaging in behavior.these facts,all of which find support in the record,led the hearing officer to conclude that would not be able to receive any educational benefit from the twin hickory program.
the evidence presented by the school board on these points was simply not of the nature or quality that would require the hearing officer to accept it over that of the parents witnesses.the school board presented evidence that the twin hickory staff was able to sufficiently control the behavior of their students,and that other students suffering from severe autism have benefitted from the twin hickory curriculum.the twin hickory teacher testified that no particular skills are required of a new student,because she and her assistants teach whatever skills are missing.while this evidence was relevant,it is not so compelling that we can conclude,as the district court apparently did,that the hearing officer was required to accept it.the hearing officer recognized that other students had benefitted from the twin hickory program,but simply concluded that problems were so severe that he would not be able to benefit 
to be sure,the hearing officer did not specifically state that he found the testimony of the school board witnesses to be less credible on these points.doyle,however requires the district court to explain its reasons for rejecting the findings of the hearing officer it does not require the hearing officer to explain in detail its reasons for accepting the testimony of one witness over that of another.in any event,the hearing officer analysis and explanation for the basis of his ruling make it clear that he was not persuaded,and why he was not persuaded by the school board evidence.we have held that credibility determinations implicit in a hearing officer decision are as entitled to deference under doyle as explicit findings.see ex rel.lawson,cir reversing district court opinion which rejected decision of hearing officer and noting that the district court disregarded the alj resolution of conflicting expert testimony.the alj carefully considered the views of the student experts,implicitly finding them unconvincing while crediting the contrary views of the school district experts.thus,contrary to the district court conclusion,the mere fact that the hearing officer accepted the evidence of the parents over that of the school board is not a reason to reject the hearing officer findings.
we recognize,of course,that at all levels of an idea proceeding,the opinions of the professional educators are entitled to respect.see rowley,at.t he provision that a reviewing court base its decision on the preponderance of the evidence is by no means an invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.the respect and deference that must be accorded to those professional opinions,however,does not give a district court license to ignore the requirement of rowley and doyle that the findings of the administrative proceeding must be given due weight 
the district court viewed the decision of the state hearing officers,reviewing the decision of the school board pursuant to federal and state statutes and regulations,as the decision to which deference was due under rowley the district court properly gave due weight to the results of the state administrative proceedings.to give deference only to the decision of the school board would render meaningless the entire process of administrative review.
school bd.malone,cir emphasis added.
nor does the required deference to the opinions of the professional educators somehow relieve the hearing officer or the district court of the obligation to determine as a factual matter whether a given iep is appropriate.that is,the is not required to conclude that an iep is appropriate simply because a teacher or other professional testifies that the iep is appropriate.the parents presented evidence outlined above tending to show that,because of the nature and severity of problems,the iep would not provide with a educational benefit.the idea gives parents the right to challenge the appropriateness of a proposed iep,and courts hearing idea challenges are required to determine independently whether a proposed iep is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.rowley,at.see tice ex rel.tice botetourt county sch,cir neither the district court nor this court should disturb an iep simply because we disagree with its content.rather,we must defer to educators decisions as long as an iep provided the child the basic floor of opportunity that access to special education and related services provides.emphasis added,internal quotation marks omitted.to conclude that the hearing officer erred simply because he did not accept the testimony of the school board witnesses,an argument that the school board comes very close to making,would render meaningless the due process rights guaranteed to parents by the idea.see malone,at.
the school board,however,contends that hearing officer findings are entitled to no deference because he failed to consider the bases for the witnesses opinions.the school board characterizes this as a major error because there was a wide disparity in the witnesses knowledge of the proposed program.brief of appellees at.we agree with the school board that the parents witnesses had limited knowledge about the general success of the twin hickory program.and if the hearing officer had relied on the parents witnesses to conclude that the twin hickory program was a bad one,then we might agree with the school board position that the hearing officer findings do not warrant any deference.the hearing officer,however,accepted and acknowledged that students had benefitted from the twin hickory program.see i take it for granted that students have succeeded at both institutions i think there are a lot of students who succeed in both programs.the hearing officer relied on the testimony of the parents witnesses to conclude that unique problems made the twin hickory program inappropriate for the hearing officer did not conclude that the twin hickory program was inappropriate for all autistic students.given the basis for the hearing officer conclusion that the iep did not provide with a free appropriate education,it was entirely proper for the hearing officer to rely primarily on the testimony of the parents witnesses.
to the extent that the district court concluded that the hearing officer findings were not entitled to deference because the decision was premised on the hearing officer preference for the aba methodology used by the faison school over the teacch methodology used at twin hickory,we again disagree.neither a state administrative hearing officer nor a reviewing court may reject an otherwise appropriate iep because of dissatisfaction with the educational methodology proposed in the iep.if an iep is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits,rowley,at,the hearing officer can not reject it because the officer believes that a different methodology would be better for the child.see id.at.o nce a court determines that the requirements of the act have been met,questions of methodology are for resolution by the states.mm,at the idea does not require a school district to provide a disabled child with the best possible education.as we have explained above,the hearing officer concluded that the school board iep was not appropriate and did not provide with a fape because problems were so severe that they would have precluded him from accessing the curriculum that would have been provided at twin hickory.if the school board iep were appropriate,then it would have been impermissible for the hearing officer to reject it simply because he thought the faison program would be better for.but that is not what the hearing officer did.the hearing officer concluded,as a factual matter,that the school board iep was not appropriate for,but that the faison program was appropriate.thus,the hearing officer did not impermissibly impose on the school board what he believed was a better method for teaching 
accordingly,for the reasons discussed above,we conclude that the hearing officer factual findings were regularly made.doyle,at.the district court,therefore,erred by failing to treat the hearing officer findings as presumptively correct.see id.
because we conclude that the district court erred by failing to give appropriate deference to the findings of the hearing officer,we must now determine what effect this error has on our disposition of this appeal.
whether an iep is appropriate and thus sufficient to discharge a school board obligations under the idea is a question of fact,see dibuo ex rel.dibuo board of,cir see also doyle,at,reviewed under a clear error standard.see carter ex rel.carter florence county sch.dist.four,cir affirming district court finding that iep was not appropriate because district court conclusion was not clearly erroneous,aff,d matthews ex rel.matthews davis,cir applying clear error standard to district court factual finding in idea case.while the district court concluded that the school board iep was appropriate,that factual finding was the product of the district court conclusion that the hearing officer factual findings were not regularly made and thus entitled to no deference,conclusions that we have rejected.the district court determination that the iep was appropriate is therefore not entitled to deference by this court.consolidation coal local,united mine workers of,cir t he clearly erroneous rule does not protect findings made on the basis of the application of incorrect legal standards.internal quotation marks omitted 
in some idea cases,this court has concluded that similar errors required us to remand the case to the district court so that the court could make findings based on a consideration of the evidence under the correct legal standard.see,jh ex rel.jd henrico county sch,cir concluding that district court and hearing officer applied incorrect legal standard when determining whether extended school year services were necessary to provide a fape and remanding for reconsideration under the correct standard fort bragg dependent,at concluding that the district court analyzed claim for compensatory education under an incorrect standard and remanding for reconsideration doyle,at concluding that the district court failed to give proper deference to the hearing officer factual findings that an iep was not appropriate and remanding for reconsideration under the proper standard.but in other cases,this court has made a ruling on the merits of the case without a remand.see,at,concluding that the district court erred by failing to give proper deference to the hearing officer findings and concluding,without remanding for additional by the district court,that the proposed iep was appropriate hartmann ex rel.hartmann loudoun county bd.of,cir concluding that district court failed to give proper deference to hearing officer findings and directing that parents challenge to hearing officer decision be dismissed.
as we have indicated previously,we believe that the hearing officer factual findings are supported by evidence in the administrative record and are entitled to deference under rowley and doyle.the record in this case would therefore support a conclusion by the district court that the iep is inappropriate because it is not reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.rowley,at.at this juncture,however,we are not confident that such a conclusion would be compelled.see doyle,at w e think that findings of fact by the hearing officers in cases such as these are entitled to be considered prima facie correct,akin to the traditional sense of permitting a result to be based on such,but not requiring it.because the idea requires the district court,while giving deference to the hearing officer decision,to make an independent finding as to the appropriateness of the iep,we believe it is prudent in this case to remand so that the district court can make the required findings under the proper legal standard.a remand is also required because the district court,given its conclusion that the iep was appropriate,did not make any findings with regard to the appropriateness of placement at the faison school,a fact that is essential to the parents right to tuition reimbursement.see,at when a state receiving idea funding fails to provide a fape,the child parent may remove the child to a private school and then seek tuition reimbursement from the state.the parent may recover if the proposed iep was inadequate to offer the child a fape and the private education services obtained by the parents were appropriate to the child needs.citation omitted.
on remand,the district court shall reconsider the question of the appropriateness of the school board iep,giving deference to the hearing officer decision if after according deference to the hearing officer decision the district court still concludes that the iep is appropriate,the district court must explain its decision,as required by this court in doyle.see doyle,at w hen are regularly made and entitled to prima facie correctness,the district court,if it is not going to follow them,is required to explain why it does not.and,as noted above,if the district court concludes that the iep is not appropriate,it must then determine whether the faison school program is appropriate.see,at.
because we conclude that the district court erred by failing to give deference to the decision of the state hearing officer,we reverse the district court order and we remand for reconsideration consistent with the principles set forth in this opinion.
reversed and remanded with instructions 
the district court rightly held that the hearing officer findings should not be followed because the hearing officer substituted his own views on education those of and his the determinations of the local educators charged with formulating an individualized education program iep.the majority opinion unwittingly thwarts the purpose of the individuals with disabilities act idea by supporting the hearing officer misapplication of the law.thus,i respectfully dissent.
as the majority notes,was diagnosed with autism at age two.he was referred to a school board child study committee approximately three months after he was diagnosed.prior to completion of the child study committee evaluations,parents enrolled him in the faison school program.the school board child study committee identified as developmentally delayed and determined that he was eligible to receive special education and related services.however,parents never enrolled him in public school.they rejected the school board ieps for the and school years.
it is undisputed that is severely autistic.the school board asserts that it is prepared to meet at his current level as it does with other severely autistic children,and provide him educational benefit.as the majority recognizes,the school board contends that its program can educate a child who has no particular skills and that the teacher in conjunction with her assistants teach whatever skills are missing.ante at.however,parents argue that without education,will receive no educational benefit and will not progress.
after the due process hearing,the hearing officer found 
given the number of other children,the requirement to work independently,the natural distractions at twin hickory and lack of communication skills,social behavior,inability to stay on task for more than a few minutes,his fear of other children and his severe propensity to self stimulate and his inability to learn when self stimulating,ability to access the curriculum offered at twin hickory would be so impaired as to deny him educational benefit.
however,neither the parents expert witnesses nor the hearing officer were able to establish in the record that autism is more severe or significantly different than other children that have received educational benefit at twin hickory.
according to the hearing officer,carlson agreed that the more severe the autism,the more intense the service should be.to address intensity,the school board offered both morning and afternoon instruction nevertheless,the hearing officer found that this was not enough,stating 
if dara butler had only one autistic child to teach she may choose to employ or the aba methodology depending on that child needs.the child given that level of intense instruction may very well respond to either method.the iep did not indicate that was going to get this type of intense personal supervision and accordingly,given his many problems and defects he would not be able to benefit from the program at twin hickory.
however,what the hearing officer describes would not be using the teacch method.the teacch method involves a great deal of visual stimulation,considerable work on individual skills,and extensive group instruction.thus,what the hearing officer was actually concluding was that without instruction,like the aba method primarily used at faison,can not receive educational benefit.his conclusion is a methodological one and the record does not support it.there is no evidence in the record that the teacch method,as employed by twin hickory,does not provide educational benefit to children as severely autistic as.the hearing officer fails to recognize this fact,but instead bases his decision on the testimony from one of the parents experts,carlson and his own limited observations.in so doing,he fails to give the appropriate deference required to the school board witnesses as professional educators see mm sch,cir.in mm,we noted 
we have always been,and we should continue to be,reluctant to professional educators.as we observed in tice botetourt county school board,once a procedurally proper iep has been formulated,a reviewing court should be reluctant indeed to the judgment of education professionals.indeed,we should not disturb an iep simply because we disagree with its content,and we are obliged to defer to educators decisions as long as an iep provided the child the basic floor of opportunity that access to special education and related services provides.

because the hearing officer did not give deference to the local educators and did not consider as evidence the school board ability to provide educational benefit to severely autistic children at twin hickory,the professional judgment of the local educators was undermined,which is contrary to congressional intent 
further,the hearing officer does not explain why the public school professional educators testimonies do not deserve any deference.even though the majority recognizes that the school board witnesses teach severely autistic children at twin hickory,that these professionals have also tested,and that they have testified that their program is appropriate and will benefit him,the majority still concludes that the hearing officer need not give the professional educators deference or explain why he is dismissing their opinions.ante at.
the majority and the hearing officer treat the parents experts,who are not local educators,as if they are on par with the school board experts,who are local educators.that is simply not appropriate or
