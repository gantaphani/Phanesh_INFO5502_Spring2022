petitioner california faculty association the association,which is the exclusive bargaining representative for certain employees of the california state university the university,complained to the public employment relations board the board that the university committed an unfair labor practice when it excluded members of the association bargaining unit from parking in parking structures on the northridge and sacramento campuses of the university without first giving the association an opportunity to bargain over the issue.rejecting a proposed decision by an administrative law judge alj to the contrary,the board concluded the university had not committed an unfair labor practice because the university had no duty to bargain a change of parking location.the board based this conclusion on the determination that parking location does not involve the employment relationship.
on writ review of the board decision,we conclude that the terms and conditions on which the university provides parking to its where the employees are allowed to involve the employment relationship between the university and its employees,and the board determination to the contrary is clearly erroneous.accordingly,we will set aside the board decision and direct the board to conduct further proceedings to determine whether the association established the remaining elements of its unfair labor practice charge.
factual and procedural background 
the association is the exclusive bargaining representative of employees of the university in bargaining unit,which consists of faculty,coaches,academic counselors,and librarians.although they have not historically negotiated parking location,the association and the university have historically negotiated parking fees.in fact,the collective bargaining agreement for the period from may,to june,contained a provision in the benefits section article governing parking fees.under that provision,employees were required to pay the parking fees as determined by the university for parking at any facility of the university.the agreement also provided,however,that faculty will not be required to pay parking fees in excess of those applicable as of june,during the,contract years.
parking at each of the university campuses is a function,which means the campuses receive no general funds to cover the costs of constructing and operating parking facilities instead,at each campus those costs must be paid from parking fees generated at the campus.
as of the school year,employees at the northridge and sacramento campuses paid the same amount for their parking permits as the students at those campuses.at northridge,parking lots were designated either for faculty and staff or for students,but faculty and staff could park in either type of lot.at sacramento,a similar practice had been followed since around or.prior to that,faculty and staff could not park in student lots.
during the school year,administrators at both the northridge and sacramento campuses determined additional campus parking structures were needed and that,to pay for these new structures,parking fees would need to be raised.the university requested that the association reopen the collective bargaining agreement to negotiate the issue of raising employee parking fees at the northridge and sacramento campuses,but the association refused.
at northridge,the university negotiated with and obtained a parking fee increase for employees in various bargaining units not represented by the association.accordingly,beginning in september,the university raised parking fees for students and those employees who had agreed to parking fee increases.at sacramento,the university raised student parking fees at the beginning of the fall semester but left employee fees unchanged.at the same time,however,the university designated the new parking structure parking structure ii on the sacramento campus as parking for students only.
in october,the association filed an unfair practice charge with the board alleging that by excluding employees from parking in the new structure,the university had effectively changed the sacramento state parking fee structure by faculty parking permits sold at the contractually permissible rate and limiting the use of said permits in violation of previous practices on campus.the association asserted that this was a violation of subdivision c of government code section,which makes it unlawful for a higher education employer like the university to r efuse or fail to engage in meeting and conferring with an exclusive representative.
the board issued a complaint on the association charge in december.meanwhile,in march,the university informed the association that the members of its bargaining unit at northridge would not be permitted to park in the new parking structure parking structure on that campus when it was completed in the fall.in april,the association filed an amended charge adding allegations relating to northridge to its allegations relating to sacramento.the board issued an amended complaint in september.
in july,an alj issued a proposed decision concluding that when the university unilaterally prohibited employees from parking in the new parking structures,the university violated government code section,subdivision c.in reaching that conclusion,the alj concluded,among other things,that the issue of parking location is a matter within the association scope of representation.
two and years later,in december,the board declined to adopt the alj proposed decision on this issue and instead concluded that the issue of parking location is not a matter within the scope of representation and therefore the university did not have a duty to bargain with the association regarding that issue 
in january,the association filed a petition with this court for a writ of review of the board decision.following briefing,this court issued the writ in october.
discussion 
ithe role of the board 
labor relations between the university and the exclusive bargaining representatives of its employees like the association are governed by the provisions of the higher education relations act heera,et.government code section requires the university,as a higher education employer,to engage in meeting and conferring with the employee organization selected as exclusive representative of an appropriate unit on all matters within the scope of representation,and government code section,subdivision c makes it unlawful for the university to fail or refuse to do so.with respect to the university and with certain exceptions not applicable here,scope of representation means,and is limited to,wages,hours of employment,and other terms and conditions of employment,subd.r.
an employer unilateral change in terms and conditions of employment within the scope of representation is,absent a valid defense,a per se refusal to negotiate and a violation of heera.california state employees public employment relations bd.th,d.under board precedent,to prevail on a complaint of illegal unilateral change,the charging party must establish that the employer breached or altered the parties written agreement,or own established past practice such action was taken without giving the exclusive representative notice or an opportunity to bargain over the change the change is not merely an isolated breach of the contract,but amounts to a change of policy,the change has a generalized effect or continuing impact on bargaining unit members terms and conditions of employment and the change in policy concerns a matter within the scope of representation.id.at,d.
the board is specifically empowered under heera to determine in disputed cases whether a particular item is within or without the scope of representation,subd.b.interpretation of the statutory provision defining scope of representation thus falls squarely within the board legislatively designated field of expertise.under established principles the board construction is to be regarded with deference by a court performing the judicial function of statutory construction,and will generally be followed unless it is clearly erroneous.san mateo city school dist.public employment relations bd.cal d.
the primary question here is whether the university unilateral decision to preclude employees from parking in the new structures at northridge and sacramento,when they had previously been allowed to park in all areas designated for students,concerned the terms and conditions of employment.under board precedent,a subject is within the scope of representation as a term or conditions of employment if it involves the employment relationship,it is of such concern to both management and employees that conflict is likely to occur and the mediatory influence of collective bargaining is an appropriate means of resolving the conflict,and the employer obligation to negotiate would not unduly abridge its freedom to exercise those managerial prerogatives including matters of fundamental policy essential to the achievement of the employer mission.academic professionals of california trustees of the california state university perb.perc.
the board decision 
since we must give deference to the board determination of whether a particular subject is within the scope of representation and follow that determination unless it is clearly erroneous san mateo city school dist.public employment relations,supra,cal d at,we begin with the analysis from the board decision.essentially,the board determined that the university exclusion of employees from the new parking structures did not involve the employment relationship because p arking at both locations is not a condition of employment.employees are not required to drive to work.however,in the event they choose to drive,the employees are not limited to permitted spaces.they may,like student and members of the public,park in daily use spaces rather than permitted spaces or,alternatively,park off campus.the board bolstered its analysis by noting that faculty were permitted to park in the same areas as they did prior to the opening of the new parking structures.moreover,the number of spaces available to the faculty actually increased at both campuses when the respective structures opened.the board stopped short,however,of concluding that parking location can never be deemed a matter within the scope of representation under heera.in a footnote,the board stated that parking location might be deemed to impact the employment relationship under certain circumstances f or example,if parking was moved to a location that created significant health and safety risks.in the board view,a change of that sort might be found to impact the conditions of employment.
the board decision was clearly erroneous 
the association takes issue with the board determination that the change at issue here did not involve the employment relationship because employees are not required to drive to work and if they choose to drive they are not limited to permitted spaces.according to the association,the board previously rejected this captive reasonable alternative test in another case involving employee university police association regents of the university of california perb.perc,regents and therefore the board decision here is contrary to its own precedent.
before we discuss the board decision in the regents case,however,it is necessary to briefly discuss an underlying decision of the united states supreme court that played a substantial role in that motor nlrb,d ford.
the ford case involved the question of whether prices for cafeteria and vending machine food and beverages are terms and conditions of employment subject to mandatory collective bargaining under the national labor relations act.ford,supra,at.at,d at pp.the national labor relations board nlrb had concluded that food prices and services were subject to mandatory collective bargaining id.at.at,d at,and the supreme court agreed.in reaching this conclusion,the supreme court offered the following explanation it is not suggested by petitioner that an employee should work a full shift without stopping to eat.it reasonably follows that the availability of food during working hours and the conditions under which it is to be consumed are matters of deep concern to workers,and one need not strain to consider them to be among those conditions of employment that should be subject to the mutual duty to bargain.by the same token,where the employer has chosen,apparently in his own interest,to make available a system of feeding facilities for his employees,the prices at which food is offered and other aspects of this service may reasonably be considered among those subjects about which management and union must bargain.the terms and conditions under which food is available on the job are plainly germane to the working environment.id.at.at,d at,fn.omitted.
with this understanding of the ford case in mind,we turn to the board decision in the regents case.in that case,the board concluded that the university of california uc had violated government code section,subdivision c among others by refusing to negotiate and by unilaterally raising the fees paid by its police officer employees for parking in lots operated by uc.regents,supra,perb.perc.first,for the reasons set forth in the alj decision,the board affirm ed the alj finding that the amount of fees charged to employees for parking is a matter within the scope of representation under heera.id.at in that decision,taking heed of the ford case,the alj drew an analogy between increases in food prices and increases in parking fees.the alj explained that t he availability of parking and its costs are matters of concern to employees and t erms and conditions under which parking is available are plainly germane to working conditions.
after affirming the alj finding that parking fees are within the scope of representation under heera,the board went on to reject a number of arguments advanced by uc,including one aimed at defeating the analogy between the parking fees at issue there and the food prices at issue in ford.according to uc,the parking fees we re not a term or condition of employment since alternative modes of transportation exist for employees and this differentiates parking fees from the food service costs at issue before the supreme court in ford.regents,supra,perb.perc.the board rejected this argument based on the following reasoning in ford,the supreme court did point out that,in the plant in question,there appeared to be no reasonable alternative to the company cafeteria.however,it did not indicate that the nlrb consistent holding that food prices are among those terms and conditions of employment about which the employer must bargain would only be affirmed in those cases in which it was shown that there existed no reasonable alternative to culinary services,and in which employees were thus captive consumers of such services.rather,it cited with approval a series of nlrb cases in which the captive reasonable alternative situation did not exist.ibid.thus,the board found in the regents case that the amount of fees charged to employees for parking is a subject within the scope of representation under heera,whether or not alternative methods of commuting are available to employees.ibid.
the association argues that t he analysis employed by the board reliance on the fact that employees are not required to drive to work or use permitted parking identical to the captive reasonable alternative rationale the board rejected in regents.the association contends that the board failure to follow its own precedent warrants reversal.
in response to the association argument,the board offers no explanation for its retreat from the position it took in the regents case.instead,now advocating the distinction it rejected in that case,the board argues the ford case is factually distinguishable from the present case because t he employees in ford who did not want to purchase cafeteria food did not have any feasible alternatives whereas here employees retained access to the same parking locations available to them before the construction of the new parking structures,could park in daily use locations and off campus,and were also free to walk,bicycle,carpool,or take mass transit to work.
as the board explained in the regents case,however,the fact that the employees in ford c
