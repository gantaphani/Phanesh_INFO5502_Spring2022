background 
during the school year,whitney was a fourth grade teacher in an elementary school in utah grand county school district,near moab.she had been a teacher in the district for nearly two decades,and she had tenure.whitney had experienced classroom performance problems in the past a letter from a school principal documented parental complaints regarding whitney hair pulling,ear twisting,knocking student heads together,crying,and raising her voice.according to her principal,whitney had been investigated by state social services sometime in the.
at the start of the school year,several parents asked the school principal to have their children transferred from whitney class,expressing concerns about whitney yelling at and ridiculing students,crying in the classroom,and similar allegations.whitney maintains that she was not told of these concerns until a conference in january,and that even then the principal did not specifically identify any problems with whitney classroom management.defendants maintain,and whitney does not dispute,that the principal discussed the following concerns with whitney understanding and control of emotions,behavior management skills,parent perceptions,student perceptions,oral and written communication skills,and assistance from administrator.
on march,whitney received a written evaluation from the principal.it stated in part,while whitney still needs to make significant changes to remediate the issues listed above,continued informal assistance rather than formal remediation is recommended at this time.the report reiterated concerns regarding understanding and control of emotions use of terms of endearment such as honey,dear,and dolly and behavior management skills using a low threatening growl or a forced smile.
on march,a committee of the utah state department of human services submitted a report to the principal and to meador,which was based on classroom observation of whitney.the report described whitney manner as inappropriate,noting severe mood swings during which whitney would suddenly become angry and verbally abusive.
on march,a student in whitney class injured her foot on a piece of metal.the student wrote in a book that you whitney hurt my foot.whitney affidavit states that she could have leaned into her while directing her to sit down but that she did not intend to push the student and that whitney could have lost her balance.the local police investigated but no charges were filed.whitney was placed on leave pending an investigation by the state division of child and family services dcfs.
on april,dcfs issued a preliminary report based on student and parent interviews.the report found that the allegation of physical abuse arising on march was substantiated,and that seven of sixteen other allegations of emotional abuse by whitney investigated by dcfs were also substantiated.the report cautioned that whitney may be high risk for self destructive behaviors as well,which could include suicide attempts,and that she should be cleared psychiatrically.on april,meador notified whitney that she was being formally suspended pending the final dcfs report.
whitney responded on april with a letter in which she stated that her recent problems arose from either an actual or perceived disability relating to my mental competency.she stated it is obvious to me,as it may be to you,that i will require a reasonable accommodation.accordingly,i hereby request a reasonable accommodation 
the same day,meador responded with a letter which stated,it is impossible to respond to your request without obtaining further information.he asked whitney to provide the following within ten working days 
please specifically identify the disability which you claim.if there is a diagnosis regarding your mental competency by a licensed professional or a dsm iv diagnosis,please send such diagnosis to me.if not,then the school district must request that you submit to a diagnosis by a qualified professional to assess whether you are capable of performing essential job duties.please identify any specific job duties you believe you are unable to perform as a result of your mental incompetency.
in addition,you must specify the accommodation s you are requesting.your request is too vague to form an idea about what you have requested and what may be reasonable under the circumstances.
on april,whitney responded by letter that she could not provide the information meador requested,because nobody has told me what i am doing or not doing that constitutes the basis of my suspension.she thanked meador for what she characterized as his offer to pay for an evaluation,but suggested that such evaluation could not occur until the district had given her specific information about my conduct that led to her suspension.
on april,meador gave whitney by letter notice of termination of your employment for cause effective days after the date of this letter.meador letter informed her that pending the date of termination she would be placed on leave with pay.the letter stated that whitney had the right to a hearing before the board of education to appeal this decision to terminate your employment for cause.failure to request a hearing,the letter stated,would constitute waiver of whitney right to appeal.
the april letter explained that we are not aware of any disability perceived or otherwise and we are not aware of any possible accommodation.no evaluation was necessary,meador wrote,because no identified disability had been claimed.the stated grounds for termination were failure to fulfill duties and responsibilities,incompetence or inefficiency,inability to maintain classroom discipline,behavior outside of acceptable community standards,failure to maintain effective working relationships,or maintain good rapport,with parents,the community,or colleagues,and assault on an employee or student.
whitney requested a hearing before the school board,and in preparation of the hearing she was examined by a licensed psychologist,james ferro,on may and.the school board hearing was held june.ferro testified at length and submitted his written evaluation.he stated that whitney had become clinically depressed in late,and he diagnosed her as suffering from major depressive disorder,single episode,in partial remission and personality disorder not otherwise specified,with narcissistic features.ferro concluded in his report,since whitney disorder of affect and behavior is remediable by psychotherapeutic intervention and since,at the time of this writing,whitney is very motivated to engage in counseling,this examiner considers it very likely that she will be able to resume her teaching duties in the fall of.in testimony before the board,ferro stated that i really believe that she capable of being able to remediate,and he recommended that she be reevaluated in three months to determine whether she is fit to return to the classroom.
in its written findings and conclusions,the school board sustain ed the recommendation of superintendent meador to terminate whitney employment for the causes stated in his april letter to whitney.it stated that t he decision to terminate whitney employment is based solely on her conduct and performance related issues.id.at.
whitney filed suit against the school board and meador in utah state court on february.on march,the defendants removed to federal court in the district of utah.on december,whitney filed an amended complaint.she asserted causes of action under the ada,for alleged violations of due process and equal protection,two state utah orderly school termination act termination act,utah code ann.to,and the educator evaluation act evaluation act,utah code ann.to and for breach of contract.defendants answered on january,and on april,moved for summary judgment on all claims.
on september,the district court granted defendants summary judgment motion as to all claims.it later denied whitney rule e motion to set aside its judgment as to the state law claims.whitney filed a timely notice of appeal on february,abandoning her due process and equal protection claims and challenging the rejection of her ada,state statutory,and breach of contract claims.
discussion 
judgment granting or denying a motion for summary judgment under federal rule of civil procedure is reviewed de novo,applying the same standard employed by the district court.kingsford salt lake city sch.summary judgment is appropriate where,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.id.
the ada mandates in relevant part that n o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability.a discrimination,as defined in the ada,includes not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee b a.disability,as defined in the ada,means 
a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual 
b a record of such an impairment or 
c being regarded as having such an impairment.
whitney only claim is that she suffered from an actual impairment accordingly,we do not consider the record of or regarded as prongs.
if a mental limitation is not known to the employer,then any failure to accommodate that limitation is not discrimination within the meaning of the ada.b a.the district court regarded this provision as dispositive because i t was until after her suspension that whitney informed meador that she had a disability.the problem with this conclusion,however,is that whitney is challenging her termination,not her suspension.it is therefore irrelevant whether the defendants knew of her limitation at the time of the suspension if they knew of her limitation when she was terminated.in light of ferro testimony,including his diagnosis that whitney suffered from major depression,it is clear that whitney condition was known to the school board at the time it voted to terminate her.we thus are compelled to conclude that the district court reasoning in dismissing the ada claim against the school board was erroneous.
conversely,this same reasoning dictates that meador did not violate the ada by any actions that he took prior to the school board termination decision.indeed,whitney appears to have conceded any ada claim she had asserted against meador.see aplt at arguing that it is irrelevant what meador knew about whitney condition aplt at same.accordingly,we affirm summary judgment on the ada claim as to meador.
at oral argument on appeal,the defendants argued for the first time that whitney actually had been terminated by meador per the april letter,rather than by the school board in its written findings and conclusions.the board hearing,the defendants argue,merely afforded whitney the opportunity to appeal a decision that already had been made.thus,they argue,whitney had not made her disability known to the defendants at the time that the termination decision was made,and summary judgment may be affirmed on this alternative ground.
we conclude that the defendants argument to support summary judgment is foreclosed by material factual issues in the record.indeed,reviewing the record,we find that the evidence strongly supports an argument that the school board,rather than meador,was responsible for terminating whitney employment.meador april letter did not purport to terminate whitney.instead,it gave her notice of termination,and specifically stated that whitney would continue to be paid p ending the date of termination.it also stated that whitney had the right to appeal meador decision.further,it is clear that the school board itself viewed meador decision as merely a recommendation rather than a final decision.when the board issued its written findings and conclusions,it referred to meador action as the recommendation of superintendent meador to terminate whitney employment.at the termination hearing,the administration attorney argued to the board why it necessary that we recommend termination to the board of education.finally,the board use of the present tense is significant in stating that t he decision to terminate whitney employment is based solely on her conduct and performance related issues.
further support for the conclusion that whitney was fired by the school board rather than meador is to be found in the terms of whitney only written contract contained in the record.the contract was signed by the school board president on behalf of the school board,and was not signed by meador.the contract stated that this contract may be cancelled by the board at any time for misconduct,poor health,incompetence or insubordination on your part.
finally,we note that the suggestion that superintendents rather than school boards are responsible for firing teachers appears to be quite a novel one under utah law.with a single exception published decisions involving wrongful termination suits brought by utah teachers all have involved a school board as the sole defendant.see durfey bd.of educ.of wayne county sch,utah pratt bd.of educ.of uintah county sch,utah stringham jordan sch,utah rowley bd.of educ.of duchesne county sch,utah brown bd.of educ.of morgan county sch,utah broadbent bd.of educ.of cache county sch,utah bd.of educ.of alpine sch.dist.ward,utah declaratory judgment action brought by school board regarding termination of teachers.
we do not here decide as a matter of law whether whitney was fired by the school board or meador.that issue involves a factual determination of the sort generally reserved for the fact finder.we hold simply that material issues of fact preclude affirming summary judgment in favor of the defendants on their proposed alternative ground that whitney was fired by meador rather than the school board.
the defendants remaining arguments for affirming summary judgment on the ada claim are similarly unavailing.they argue that whitney firing was permissible under the ada because she posed a direct threat to the safety of her students.we reject this argument,at least as a basis for summary judgment the direct threat defense applies where the employee poses a significant risk to the health or safety of others that can not be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.here,there is a material factual issue regarding whether whitney posed any significant risk to the students and,if so,whether that risk could be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.accordingly,the asserted direct threat is not an appropriate basis for summary judgment.the defendants also argue that whitney has failed to allege substantial limitation of a major life activity,a,an argument not considered by the district court below.because the resolution of this argument is not clear from the record,we decline to consider it in the first instance.anixter prod,cir.
in sum,the district court grant of summary judgment on the ada claim is affirmed as to meador but reversed as to the school board.
ii.state statutory claims 
whitney appeals the summary judgment granted in favor of the defendants on claims brought under two utah state statutes.the first statute is the termination act,utah code ann.to,which establishes procedures for firing employees of local schools.the second statute is the evaluation act,utah code ann.to which sets out procedures for reviewing teacher performance.in essence,whitney alleges that each statute entitled her to more notice of her alleged perfo
