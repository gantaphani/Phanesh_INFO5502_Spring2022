plaintiff suffered injury while practicing arrest and control techniques during a peace officer training class.he sued the community college that offered the class for negligence.the trial court granted the college motion for summary judgment,determining the complaint was barred by the doctrine of primary assumption of risk.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
undisputed facts 
in,plaintiff enrolled in helicopter flight school in sacramento to become a helicopter search and rescue pilot.after four months of training,plaintiff left the school due to financial concerns.he planned to complete the remaining hours required for his training through experience as a search and rescue helicopter pilot.
to improve his chances of being hired,plaintiff enrolled in a class at defendant sierra college entitled administration of justice,also referred to as pc referring to,arrest,communications,and firearms.sierra college is a community college operated by the sierra joint community college district.for convenience,we refer to the different sierra college entities named in plaintiff complaint as the college.
the course was open to any student who could pass a firearms background check.the college catalog for spring described the course as follows arrest,communication,and firearms meets requirements of california penal code section requiring individuals having peace officer powers to complete a training course prescribed by the commission on peace officer standards and training post.partially satisfies post level iii module training.covers ethics,courts,community relations,laws of arrest,use of force,search and seizure,investigations,arrest and control methods,shooting principles,and range qualification.the class was scheduled for about four hours every tuesday and thursday evening from january through february.the class would also meet all day on three saturdays.plaintiff believed having the post certificate would help get his foot in the door.
the course consisted of three portions lectures,methods of arrest and control,and a firearms portion.plaintiff declared in his separate statement of undisputed facts that participation in the activity to learn arrest and control methods was required the class was.in order to pass the class,the students were required to attend and pass all three parts including arrest and control procedures.
auburn chief of police nick willick was the lead instructor of the course.he taught the lecture portion of the course,and other officers taught the control methods and firearms portions.willick explained the arrest techniques portion of the course to the students.although he did not use the word,willick informed the students they would learn the techniques in as realistic an experience as possible,and they would be modeling the actions an actual police officer would take when performing a takedown in the field.
at one of the lecture sessions held before the control methods activity,lieutenant david johnstone of the rocklin police department gave a lecture on the arrest and control techniques the students would subsequently learn.in the lecture,he told the students they would be playing the roles of police officer and suspect in order to learn the techniques.when asked if a student could pass the class if the student could not meet the physical requirements of the techniques portion,johnstone testified the student would not complete that portion of the class.if,however,a student was able to play the role of police officer but not suspect,that student could still pass the class.
officer scott horrillo was one of the instructors at the activity where the techniques and maneuvers were taught and practiced.horrillo also testified the students were required to attend the activity.they could not pass the course unless they passed that activity.
saturday,february,was the first day the students performed techniques and maneuvers for controlling a suspect.the class was held at a private kickboxing gym.mats covered the entire floor area.scheduled to last most of the day,the class began at with a period for stretching exercises and calisthenics.
three police officers,officers horrillo,susan davis,and casey finney,taught the class that day.finney first demonstrated a maneuver,showing the students how to get away from a suspect.he next demonstrated a maneuver on a student a couple of times.after the demonstration,the students paired up and practiced the move on each other.plaintiff,weighing pounds and standing six feet one inch tall,paired up with terry giese,who weighed pounds and stood five feet ten inches tall.
after the move,the class went on to learn four different takedown moves.two of those moves were performed facing the suspect,and the other two were performed from behind the suspect.the first takedown move required the arresting officer to jab his fingers down inside the suspect collarbone with enough pressure to force the suspect down to his knees.finney demonstrated the move,and then plaintiff and giese practiced the move on each other.they performed the maneuvers at essentially half speed.
the second takedown maneuver required the arresting officer to grab the suspect by the shoulders and trip him over the officer leg.finney demonstrated this move,and plaintiff and giese practiced the move.both were able to knock each other over and onto the ground.
the third maneuver involved the arresting officer grabbing the suspect hair from behind and pulling the suspect backward and down to the ground.finney demonstrated this move on a student,and plaintiff and giese successfully knocked each other down to the mat by using this move.
the fourth takedown maneuver was described as a forehead sweep.according to plaintiff and johnstone,the arresting officer performing this move would come from behind the suspect,wrap his right hand around the suspect face and grab the bridge of the nose,put his right elbow in the suspect back,and then pull the head back to compress the neck into the spine,causing the suspect to fall to the ground.the officer was to stand to the left of the subject at a angle.
finney demonstrated this maneuver,and then plaintiff and giese performed the move on each other two or three times before breaking for lunch at each person knocked the other down,and neither was injured.while the students practiced the moves,the three officers walked around the room and observed the students to see if they were performing them correctly.at least one officer saw plaintiff perform each maneuver at least one time.
between noon and,plaintiff and giese practiced the maneuvers they had learned that morning.plaintiff was injured while the two performed the forehead sweep with giese acting as the arresting officer and plaintiff as the suspect.as giese pulled plaintiff down,plaintiff hit his neck on giese knee.plaintiff sustained a herniated cervical disc and other injuries that necessitated surgery.
at no time during the class did the students receive verbal or written instruction on where to place their feet while performing the maneuvers.however,officer finney,when demonstrating the forehead sweep,would step aside as he pulled the suspect back.this was the way he performed the maneuver that day.after learning how giese performed the forehead sweep maneuver on plaintiff,officer davis and johnstone opined giese had performed the maneuver incorrectly.his feet were not correctly positioned when the injury occurred.
plaintiff understood the class was a police officer training course.he later changed his testimony to say it was an administration of justice class.the college catalog indicated the class would cover the use of force and arrest and control methods.he understood the training had to replicate situations,and he acknowledged the curriculum called for demonstrations.he understood the class was designed to train him how to perform were he to become a police officer.he understood the class philosophy increased the risk of injury to a point.
when asked if he understood when he enrolled the class would include physical activity,plaintiff did not say no unequivocally.instead,he responded,i did not know that i would be used,so to speak,as a guinea pig by an inexperienced person to do these moves or have these moves done on me with a prior injury to my neck from when i was taking care of my mother.i would have really agreed to have done these if i knew that an inexperienced person would be doing these on me.
as the class progressed that morning,plaintiff knew the class involved him getting grabbed and getting knocked down.he became concerned about a preexisting neck injury,and wondered if it was safe for him to continue participating in the class.before he was injured,plaintiff considered informing the instructors of his prior injury,but he did not.he had no particular reason for not telling them.
plaintiff filed this action against the college seeking damages for his injuries.he alleged the college negligently failed to inform plaintiff when he registered for the class of the risk of injury from participating in the takedown maneuvers evaluate or screen plaintiff,or advise him to do the same,in light of the class physical requirements and risk of injury and supervise and properly train plaintiff and his classmates to perform the takedown maneuvers correctly.
the college filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing plaintiff claims were barred by the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk and the college owed no legal duty to prevent the harm he suffered.
the trial court granted the motion,ruling the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk applied to the facts of this case.the court reasoned plaintiff papers and evidence show at most that the instructors of the course may have been negligent.this is not enough as a matter of law.plaintiff must show that material issues of fact exist as to whether defendants intentionally injured the plaintiff,or engaged in conduct that is so reckless as to be totally outside of the range of the ordinary activity involved in teaching or coaching.kahn east side union high school dist.cal th,d.plaintiff facts submitted do not meet this burden.the court entered judgment against plaintiff.
plaintiff appeals,claiming the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk does not apply to the activities in which plaintiff was engaged when he was injured and it does not apply because the instructors increased the risks inherent in the maneuvers being taught and the college had a duty of care not to negligently structure the class.
discussion 
istandard of review 
a trial court will grant summary judgment where there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a defendant moving for summary judgment must prove the action has no merit.he does this by showing one or more elements of plaintiff cause of action can not be established or that he has a complete defense to the cause of action.at this point,plaintiff then bears the burden of showing a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or defense.code civ,subds.c,o aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
on appeal,we exercise our independent judgment,deciding whether undisputed facts negate plaintiff claims as presented in his complaint or state a complete defense.starzynski capital public radio,th,d.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
primary assumption of the risk 
as a general rule,persons have a duty to use due care to avoid injury to others,and may be held liable if their careless conduct injures another person.see.knight jewett cal th,d,hereafter knight.the doctrine of primary assumption of the risk is an exception to the general rule.the doctrine arises where,by virtue of the nature of the activity and the parties relationship to the activity,the defendant owes no legal duty to protect the plaintiff from the particular risk of harm that caused the injury knight,supra,cal th at,d.
primary assumption of the risk is an objective test.it does not depend on a particular plaintiff subjective knowledge or appreciation of the potential for risk.whelihan espinoza th,d calhoon lewis th,d.
determining the existence and scope of a defendant duty of care is one of law to be decided by the court,not by a jury,and therefore it generally is amenable to resolution by summary judgment.knight,supra,cal th at,d.kahn east side union high school,supra,cal th at,d.
whether a duty exists does not turn on the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the plaintiff conduct,but rather on the nature of the activity or sport in which the defendant is engaged and the relationship of the defendant and the plaintiff to that activity or sport.knight,supra,cal th at,d.
if a duty is found not to exist,primary assumption of risk applies,and a defendant is liable only if he intentionally injures the plaintiff or engages in conduct so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in the sport or activity.parsons crown disposal cal th,d,knight,supra,cal th at,d.
the trial court determined plaintiff claim for relief was barred by the doctrine of primary assumption of risk.plaintiff argues the trial court erred for numerous reasons.we will address each as they relate to the doctrine two required elements.
nature of activity 
courts have provided some guidance,particularly in the sports context,on how we review the nature of the activity to determine if primary assumption of the risk excuses the normally applicable duty of care.in general,the doctrine applies to activities or sports where conditions or conduct that otherwise might be viewed as dangerous often are an integral part of the sport itself.knight,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the knight court used skiing as an example of a sport that involved inherently dangerous conditions.a lthough moguls on a ski run pose a risk of harm to skiers that might not exist were these configurations removed,the challenge and risks posed by the moguls are part of the sport of skiing,and a ski resort has no duty to eliminate them.knight,supra,cal th at,d.
knight held that careless conduct by others involved in the activity could also be an inherent risk of that activity.for example,numerous cases recognized that in a game of baseball,a player generally can not recover if he or she is hit and injured by a carelessly thrown ball citation,and that in a game of basketball,recovery is not permitted for an injury caused by a carelessly extended elbow citation.knight,supra,cal th at,d.
in these types of activities,the integral conditions of the sport or the inherent risks of careless conduct by others render the possibility of injury obvious,and negate the duty of care usually owed by the defendant for those particular risks of harm.lilley elk grove unified school dist.th,d.a duty imposed in those situations would significantly change the very purpose or nature of the activity.the overriding consideration in the application of primary assumption of risk is to avoid imposing a duty which might chill vigorous participation in the implicated activity and thereby alter its fundamental nature.ferrari grand canyon dories th,d see knight,supra,cal th at,d.
the takedown maneuvers here bear similar risks of injury inherent in many sports.the maneuvers are inherently dangerous.one person is intentionally throwing another to the ground.whenever gravity is at play with the human body,the risk of injury is inherent.aaris las virgenes unified school dist.th,d.
careless conduct by others is also an inherent risk in performing the maneuvers.plaintiff acknowledged both he and his partner were inexperienced and had not learned or practiced these maneuvers before the class.even with the steps taken by the officers to minimize the risk of training,placing mats on the floors,demonstrating the moves,observing the students perform the risk of harm from participating in the actual maneuvers with an inexperienced person remained obvious,and plaintiff suffered injury from that particular risk.grabbing someone face from behind,pushing his head into his spine,and throwing him back an
