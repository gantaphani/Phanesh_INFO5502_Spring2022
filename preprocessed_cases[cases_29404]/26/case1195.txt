appellant maynard is a graduate of meharry medical college in tennessee.after completing medical school,maynard joined usf surgical residency program,which typically lasts five years.through this program,usf supplies residents to local hospitals for varying rotation periods and,in return,the hospitals pay usf a fee.to receive some compensation for their services,residents enter into annual agreements with usf known as house officer contracts,through which the residents receive a stipend.these contracts are limited to one year and are typically renewed so long as the resident receives acceptable reviews

shortly thereafter,maynard met with peter fabri,associate dean and accreditation council for graduate medical education,to discuss appealing karl decision to have him repeat his fourth year.maynard alleges that fabri explained that his problems were related to how others perceived maynard culture,his accent,and the way that he walked on june,maynard informed karl that he was going to file an appeal and again requested that karl give him an explanation as to why he was required to repeat his fourth year of residency.maynard claims he did not receive a satisfactory response.on june,maynard formally appealed the decision by filing a letter of dispute with the chairman of the residency program and requested that usf designate a professional dispute resolution committee pdrc to review his appeal,pursuant to the resident house officer policies and procedures manual manual in addition,maynard contacted ted williams,usf race relations manager,to explain that he believed usf actions were motivated by maynard race.
although the details are somewhat unclear,it appears that the two parties ultimately reached a compromise under which maynard would contract as a surgical resident while performing work.under this agreement,maynard work would be reviewed after six months and,if his performance was acceptable,usf would promote him to fifth year status,effective january,so that he could complete the program in june as originally scheduled.maynard signed the amended contract and dropped his appeal.despite this agreement,however,maynard continued to request written reasons as to why he was required to repeat his fourth year.
