the california whistleblower protection act,et hereafter the whistleblower act or the act prohibits retaliation against state employees who report waste,fraud,abuse of authority,violation of law,or threat to public health.the act authorizes an action for damages to redress acts of retaliation,subd.c,subd.c,subd.c.but in the case of retaliation against a university of california employee,the act provides that any action for damages shall not be available unless the injured party has first filed a complaint with the designated university officer,and the university has failed to reach a decision regarding that complaint within the time limits established for that purpose by the regents,subd.c,italics added.we conclude,as did the court of appeal,that this statutory language means what it says,precluding a damages action when,as here,the university of california has timely decided a retaliation complaint.
because this case comes before us on appeal from a judgment sustaining a demurrer,we assume the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those facts.see,fox ethicon,cal th,d,coleman gulf insurance group cal d,fn,blank kirwan cal d.
plaintiffs leo miklosy and luciana messina are computer scientists who,in february,were employed by the regents of the university of california hereafter the university of california or the university,filling positions at the lawrence livermore national laboratory the laboratory.plaintiffs worked in the national ignition facility on a project designed to determine the safety and reliability of the nation nuclear weapons stockpile.one method of evaluating the safety and reliability of these weapons involved shooting laser beams at nuclear material placed in a target chamber.
as their work proceeded,plaintiffs identified problems with the project,including,inter alia,potential collisions by large million dollar robotic positioners within the target chamber,the delivery of unusable and untested control software,a lack of defined engineering and operational processes,and inadequate control operator training plaintiffs repeatedly expressed their concerns to management,both orally and in writing,enumerating specific mechanical problems with the positioners and the robotic controls.
on friday,february,defendants kim minuzzo,larry lagin,and jerry krammen,who were supervisory employees of the laboratory,fired miklosy.as he was leaving the premises,miklosy heard minuzzo tell krammen messina is next.believing her performance was comparable to that of miklosy,messina submitted a letter of resignation.lagin and minuzzo asked messina to reconsider her resignation over the weekend,which she agreed to do.when messina returned to her office after this meeting,she found her computer disconnected.
on monday,march,messina inquired about transferring to a different position at the laboratory,but minuzzo telephoned her the next day and directed her to return to the national ignition facility.after that conversation had ended,but before the telephone call was disconnected,messina overheard minuzzo tell another employee that he intended to fire messina.messina resigned as of march.
on august,plaintiffs filed complaints with the university under section,subdivision a,of the whistleblower act.the laboratory personnel policies and procedures manual requires the director of the laboratory to appoint a retaliation complaint officer rco to investigate a complaint of whistleblower retaliation.the rco must prepare findings within days once the findings are submitted,the director of the laboratory must reach a decision on the complaint within days.the director decision may include appropriate relief for the complainant and may be appealed to the president of the university.this procedure is generally comparable to the procedure the state personnel board follows when evaluating similar complaints by state agency employees.see,tit,subd.a appointment of an investigator id.at,subd.b,subd.a issuance of findings based on the investigator report id.at,subd.d appeal to the state personnel board id.at,subd.c,subd.d,no right to a formal hearing at any point in the process,though one may be granted at the board discretion.
in regard to plaintiffs complaints,john hunt,a laboratory employee,acted as the rco.the laboratory has a staff that exceeds,and there is no indication in the complaint that hunt was in any way involved in the direct management of the national ignition facility or had any personal connection with the dispute.hunt interviewed witnesses and submitted his findings to robert perko,the staff relations officer,on november.hunt found that laboratory management had not reacted adversely to plaintiffs reports of problems at the national ignition facility,instead treating those reports as a normal part of project development.hunt found no support for the assertion that management had retaliated against either miklosy or messina.hunt determined instead that the laboratory had fired miklosy for unsatisfactory work performance and that the laboratory had never intended to fire messina and actually had tried to convince her to stay.the laboratory director adopted hunt findings and conclusions on november,and plaintiffs concede that the laboratory reached its decision within the time limits specified in its internal policies.plaintiffs did not appeal the director decision to the president of the university,and therefore the decision became the university final resolution of the matter.
on february,plaintiffs filed a damages action in superior court against the university and three supervisory,lagin,and krammen.the complaint alleged four causes of action unlawful retaliation in violation of the whistleblower act both plaintiffs wrongful termination in violation of public policy miklosy wrongful constructive termination in violation of public policy messina and intentional infliction of emotional distress both plaintiffs.the complaint sought compensatory damages,punitive damages,and attorney fees.
the trial court sustained defendants demurrer with leave to amend,and when plaintiffs filed an amended complaint,defendants again demurred.the trial court then sustained defendants demurrer without leave to amend,and dismissed plaintiffs action.the court of appeal affirmed,holding that plaintiffs had no viable claim under the whistleblower act because the university timely resolved their complaints,and further holding that plaintiffs common law claims were statutorily barred.we granted plaintiffs petition for review.
in,the legislature enacted the whistleblower act,codifying it as sections through.stats,ch.at that time,the act was entitled the reporting of improper governmental activities act,and its stated purpose was to encourage the disclosure of improper governmental activities,which the act generally defined as activities that were unlawful,economically wasteful,or involved gross misconduct or incompetence.id.at.the act was not wholly new rather,it built on existing provisions of the government code,in some cases renumbering those provisions without changing their substantive content.in,the legislature extended the act to cover disclosures of health and safety problems stats,ch,giving the act its present name,and declaring,as its purpose,that state employees should be free to report waste,fraud,abuse of authority,violation of law,or threat to public health without fear of retribution.
since its inception,the act has dealt with employees of the state and the university in separate provisions,indicating the legislature awareness of the university unique constitutional status and the concomitant need for special provisions to govern whistleblowing at the university.for example,section imposes liability on state employees or officeholders who use their authority to interfere with the disclosure rights conferred by the act,and section imposes similar liability on employees and officers of the university.likewise,section protects state employees against whistleblower retaliation,and section confers similar protections on employees and officers of the university.
regarding whistleblower retaliation,section,subdivision c,imposes liability in an action for damages on any person who intentionally engages in acts of reprisal,retaliation,threats,coercion,or similar acts against a state employee for disclosing improper governmental activities or unsafe conditions.but,as enacted,section,subdivision c,included the following caveat however,any action for damages shall not be available unless the injured party has first filed a complaint with the state personnel board,and the board has failed to reach a decision regarding any hearing conducted pursuant to section.stats,ch,italics added.thus,as enacted,section,subdivision c,appears to have limited damages actions by state employees to cases in which the state personnel board has failed to reach a decision,essentially making the damages action a secondary alternative,contingent on the malfunctioning of the primary alternative,rather than an additional source of relief.
section,subdivision c,imposes similar liability for retaliation against employees or officers of the university,and it includes a similar caveat,providing however,any action for damages shall not be available unless the injured party has first filed a complaint with the designated university officer,and the university has failed to reach a decision regarding that complaint within the time limits established for that purpose by the regents.italics added.this provision on its face appears to make the damages action an alternative remedy available only if the university fails to act.
in,the legislature added section to the act,extending whistleblower protections to employees and officers of the california state university.stats,ch.section,subdivision c,authorizes a damages action for whistleblower retaliation and includes the same caveat as sections governing state employees and governing university of california employees,but section,subdivision c,adds a sentence that does not appear in the other provisions.specifically,section,subdivision c,provides however,any action for damages shall not be available unless the injured party has first filed a complaint with the designated university officer,and the university has failed to reach a decision regarding that complaint within the time limits established for that purpose by the trustees.nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the injured party from seeking a remedy if the university has not satisfactorily addressed the complaint within months.italics added.the addition of the last sentence,and specifically the modifier satisfactorily,raises the possibility that a court might find the state university decision unsatisfactory though timely and on that basis permit a damages action.see ohton board of trustees of the california state university th,d.here,we need only construe section,subdivision c,and therefore we express no view on the substantive content,if any,of the term satisfactorily in section,subdivision c.above,we have set forth the text of section,subdivision c,and section,subdivision c,for the purpose of comparison with section,subdivision c,the provision at issue here.
in,the legislature amended section,subdivision c,governing state employees,to expressly permit a damages suit even when the state personnel board has issued timely findings.see stats,ch.as amended,the caveat in section,subdivision c,now provides however,any action for damages shall not be available unless the injured party has first filed a complaint with the state personnel board,and the board has issued,or failed to issue,findings italics added.arguably,this amendment changed the provision from an alternative remedy available only when the administrative remedy fails to function to a general remedy available in all cases,though requiring the employee to first exhaust administrative remedies the legislature,however,did not enact a comparable amendment to section,subdivision c,pertaining to employees of the university of california.
therefore,as amended,the whistleblower act appears at first blush to distinguish three groups of public employees a state employee may bring a damages action alleging whistleblower retaliation after first seeking relief from the state personnel board,subd.c a california state university employee may seek a remedy if the state university administrative remedy fails to proceed to a timely decision or does not satisfactorily address the employee complaint within months,subd.c and a university of california employee may bring a damages action only if the university administrative remedy fails to result in a timely decision,subd.c if the university reaches a timely decision in its own favor,the employee has no cause of action for damages.
plaintiffs argue that their claims against the university of california for damages under the whistleblower act remain viable notwithstanding the laboratory director timely decision rejecting those claims on the merits.this argument requires us to interpret the terms of section,subdivision c,which governs retaliation against university of california employees.our task is a familiar one.we apply principles of statutory construction in seeking to determine the legislature intent in enacting the statute,so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.kibler northern inyo county local hospital dist.cal th,d,see people king cal th,d,fitch select products cal th,d.we begin with the statutory language because it is generally the most reliable indication of legislative intent.city of burbank state water resources control bd.cal th,d.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute controls.people hudson cal th,d.shirk vista unified school dist.cal th,d.we consider extrinsic aids,such as legislative history,only if the statutory language is reasonably subject to multiple interpretations.people king,supra,cal th at,d.
the plain language of section,subdivision c,states that a damages action shall not be available unless the university has failed to reach a timely decision the word unless when used as a conjunction means except on the condition that.webster new collegiate dict.thus,as a matter of established usage,the unless clause states conditions that must be satisfied in every case if the conditions are not satisfied,then the damages action shall not be available.moreover,the two conditions set forth in section,subdivision c,are clear the injured party must have filed a complaint with the designated university officer,and the university must have failed to reach a decision regarding that complaint within the time limits established for that purpose by the regents.if,as here,the university has reached a timely decision in its own favor,then it has not failed to reach a decision,the conditions stated in section,subdivision c,have not been met,the unless clause is not satisfied,and an action for damages shall not be available,subd.c.
in short,the function of section,subdivision c,appears to be limited to enforcing the university internal mechanism for resolving disputes by providing an alternative secondary remedy that is available only when the university internal mechanism fails to operate.as long as the university completes in a timely fashion its own internal process,the alternative remedy of a damages action in state court is unavailable.if,however,the university process fails to function,the injured party is protected by the statutory alternative of bringing a damages action in state court,which has the potential to be much more costly to the university.
this interpretation is the only one that fits comfortably with the plain meaning of section,subdivision c,and it is also the interpretation we have given the statute in our prior decisions,albeit in dictum.thus,in campbell regents of the university of california cal th,d,campbell,we paraphrased the statute as follows t he employee may not proceed with a court action against the university unless that institution has failed to reach an administrative decision on the action within specified time limits,subd.c.if,by contrast,the university has reached a decision on the administrative action,the statute does not authorize any statutory damages action.
moreover,this interpretation is reasonable in light of the unique constitutional status of the university of california.as we explained in campbell the california constitution establishes the regents,the university of california as a public trust with full powers of organization and government.cal,art.ix,subd.a.we have observed that article ix,section,grants the r egents broad powers to organize and govern the university and limits the legislature power to regulate either the university or the r egents.this contrasts with the comprehensive power of regulation the legislature possesses over other state agencies.san francisco labor council regents of university of california cal d,this grant of constitutional power to the university includes the grant of powers,a view that is generally accepted in our jurisprudence.ishimatsu regents of university of california d.see also apte regents of university of california d.the regents may also exercise powers,subject to legislative regulation.indeed,policies established by the regents as matters of internal regulation may enjoy a status equivalent to that of state statutes.regents of university of california city of santa monica d,citing hamilton regents.the authority granted the regents includes full powers of organization and government,subject only to such legislative control as may be necessary to insure compliance with the terms of the endowment of the university and the security of its funds.goldberg regents of university of california d.thus,t he regents have been characterized as a branch of the state itself citation or a statewide administrative agency citation regents of university of california city of santa monica,supra,d at,and i t is apparent that the regents as a constitutionally created arm of the state have virtual autonomy in ibid.campbell,supra,cal th at,d.
in short,the university functions in some ways like an independent sovereign,retaining a degree of control over the terms and scope of its own liability.given the university unique constitutional status,it is not surprising that the legislature would take a deferential approach when authorizing damages actions against the university.thus,section,subdivision c,gives the university the flexibility appropriate to a semiautonomous branch of the state government to create its own mechanism for resolving whistleblower retaliation claims,but it also provides an alternative remedy when the university remedy is withheld.a damages action in state court may afford complainants a more favorable forum because the fact finder in state court is not a university employee,and because other procedural protections apply,such as evidentiary rules,testimony under penalty of perjury,and of witnesses.but the appropriateness of granting these procedural protections to university whistleblowers is a matter of policy that is not for this court to determine 
the legislature has encouraged the university to establish its own neutral procedure for resolving whistleblower retaliation claims brought by university employees or officers,and it has stated that if the university follows its procedure and reaches a timely decision,a damages action can not be brought against it in state court,subd.c.this legislative approach does not leave the university decision completely action for a writ of mandate provides limited review but it does give considerable leeway to the university to operate with relative autonomy within the state governmental system.
if the university fails to follow its own procedures in a timely manner,the legislature has provided injured parties the protection of an alternative remedy in the form of a state court damages action.this alternative remedy is not an additional source of relief over and above whatever the university awards or fails to award rather,it is a backup remedy available only when the university has failed to timely resolve the whistleblower complaint.
plaintiffs direct our attention to the legislative history of the whistleblower act.although we find no ambiguity in the statutory language of section,subdivision c,and therefore no reason to consult the legislative history,the legislative history actually supports our conclusion.
the statutory language that now appears in sections governing state employees and governing university of california employees actually predates the enactment of the reporting of improper governmental activities act,having its roots in two predecessor sections state employees and university of california employees.former section was enacted in and looked very much like section as enacted in.specifically,subdivision c of former section authorized a damages action for whistleblower retaliation against state employees but added the caveat that any action for damages shall not be available to the injured party unless the injured party has first filed a complaint with the state personnel board,and the board has failed to reach a decision regarding any hearing conducted pursuant to section.stats,ch.this caveat is,of course,identical to the caveat contained in section,subdivision c,as enacted in.
early drafts of the legislation authorized a damages action for whistleblower retaliation but did not include the caveat.the department of personnel administration dpa objected to those versions,expressing among other things the following concern this measure would seemingly permit an employe e to have his or her case investigated and heard by the state personnel board and then,if the findings and ruling are not to the employee liking,to file with the court for a new trial.this is a departure from current procedure which permits the court to simply determine whether the board decision for or against an employee is supported by substantial evidence in the existing record.no new court trial is held.of personnel,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.in other words,the dpa criticized the early versions of the bill precisely because it made the proceeding before the state personnel board into a mere exhaustion requirement.the dpa analysis further noted that this issue had been discussed at length with the author staff and that staff had indicated a willingness to take amendments.id.at.
less than six weeks after the dpa issued this analysis,the bill was revised.assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.among other things,this revision added the caveat restricting the availability of a damages action however,any action for damages shall not be available to the injured party unless the state personnel board has failed to reach a decision regarding any hearing conducted pursuant to section.it appears that this caveat was added specifically to address the dpa criticism that the damages action should not give complaining state employees a second bite at the apple after losing before the state personnel board.therefore,at least as of,the legislature expressly did not intend the state personnel board proceeding to be a mere exhaustion requirement.rather,it expressly sought to restrict damages actions to those cases in which the state personnel board failed to reach a timely decision in all other cases,the state personnel board proceeding was the employee exclusive remedy,subject only to substantial evidence review in the courts.notably,the dpa prepared a flowchart of the amended measure indicating only two possibilities for proceeding to court after bringing a complaint before the state personnel board.for damages if no timely spb decision or.for review of spb decision on merits.italics added.this flowchart was attached to,and referred to in,a bill analysis by a senate committee,indicating that it came to the attention of the legislature at least at the committee level.com.on public employment retirement,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,attachment.
two years later,the legislature enacted former section,addressing whistleblower retaliation against university of california employees.in language identical to that currently found in section subdivision c,former section subdivision c provided however,any action for damages shall not be available unless the injured party has first filed a complaint with the designated university officer,and the university has failed to reach a decision regarding that complaint within the time limits established for that purpose by the regents.stats,ch.the legislature appears to have adapted this language directly from former section,subdivision c,which pertained to whistleblower retaliation against state employees.it follows,therefore,that the legislature likewise did not intend the university internal proceeding to be a mere exhaustion requirement.rather,it expressly sought to restrict damages actions to those cases in which the university failed to reach a timely decision on the complaint in all other cases,the university proceeding was to be the employee exclusive remedy.
in describing this new statute governing university employees,the legislative counsel digest first summarizes the effect of former section,which governed state employees under existing law,a state employee who files a written complaint alleging acts of reprisal or intimidation due to disclosure of improper governmental activities may file a copy of the complaint with the state personnel board existing law provides that failure of the board to reach a decision on the complaint,as specified,is a condition precedent to filing a civil action for damages.legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.stats,summary,italics added.this summary confirms our reading of former section a damages action was available only when the state personnel board failed to reach a timely decision.the legislative counsel digest next explains the impact of the new statute that is,former section this bill would add provisions,applicable exclusively to university of california employees,similar to the provisions administered by the state personnel board,as described above,except the regents of the university of california would designate an officer to whom complaints could be filed and the regents would administer these provisions.ibid.this description indicates that the legislature both understood and intended that a damages action against the university would be available only when the university failed to reach a timely decision.it also indicates that the legislature intended the university to have autonomy in administering this process.nothing suggests that the legislature had a different intent in when it repealed former sections and stats,ch,and included substantially identical language in sections and stats,ch.
this interpretation of the legislature intent is confirmed by later amendments to section.as noted,sections,subdivision c,and,subdivision c,originally included parallel language limiting the damages remedy to situations in which either the state personnel board or the university,as the case may be,failed to reach a timely decision.in,however,the legislature enacted senate bill reg.sess.senate bill,amending section,subdivision c,to allow state employees to file a damages action if the state personnel board has issued,or failed to issue,findings,thereby arguably making the provision into a mere exhaustion requirement.as amended,a final decision at the administrative level or the failure of the administrative agency to reach a timely decision clears the way for the state employee to file a civil damages action.but see fn,ante.
the legislative counsel digest for senate bill explained the effect of the bill as follows existing law provides that any action for civil damages is only available to an injured party who has first filed a complaint with the state personnel board and the board has failed to reach a decision pursuant to specified procedures.this bill would provide instead that civil damages are available to an injured party only if the state personnel board has issued,or failed to issue,findings pursuant to the specified procedures.legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.as chaptered,italics added.then,in a new paragraph,the digest adds the bill would specify that its provisions shall apply to the california state university and the university of california.ibid.plaintiffs point to the latter sentence as indicative of a legislative intent to amend,not just section,but also sections and,making the requirement of administrative proceedings which is common to all three sections into mere exhaustion requirements in all three cases.we disagree.
the first part of the excerpt discusses the law as it was before enactment of senate bill.in other words,it discusses the statutory language that constituted the version of section,subdivision c language that remains in section,subdivision c.thus,the legislative counsel that a damages action is only available when the board has failed to reach a decision actually supports defendants view here that a damages action against the university is precluded so long as the internal administrative process reaches a timely decision,even one unfavorable to the employee.moreover,by using the phrase this bill would provide instead italics added,the legislative counsel digest makes clear that the legislature intended to change existing law,not merely to explain existing law.therefore,plaintiffs argument would require us to adopt the following implausible line of reasoning when two parallel statutes use nearly identical language,and when the legislature amends one but not the other,and when the amendment does not merely clarify existing law but actually changes the law,we should nevertheless continue to give the two statutes the same meaning,treating them as if the legislature had actually amended both,and we should do so because the legislative counsel digest tells us that the bill will so specify,though the actual text of the bill does not so specify.we reject this reasoning,relying instead on the text of the bill,which amends section,subdivision c,but not section,subdivision c.
moreover,the sentence from the legislative counsel digest on which plaintiffs rely can be readily explained in a way that does not give it the substantive significance plaintiffs wish it to bear.when first introduced,senate bill was limited to adding several new sections to the government code see et concerning the dissemination of information about the whistleblower act.bill,as introduced.later,provisions were added amending the whistleblower act.see bill,as amended,as amended june,as amended july.the specific provision we are considering here authorizing a damages action under section,subdivision c,when the state personnel board has issued,or failed to issue,findings was a relatively late addition to the bill.see bill,as amended.the early versions of the legislative counsel digest included the same sentence plaintiffs now t he bill would specify that its provisions shall apply to the california state university and the university of california see,legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.as amended,as amended june,as amended july,as introduced,in the digest early versions,however,this sentence necessarily referred to other changes senate bill would effect,not the specific change to section,subdivision c,at issue here,because the change at issue here was not then a part of the bill.
when the assembly amended senate bill to add the specific change to section,subdivision c,at issue here,the legislative counsel revised the digest for the bill to describe this new provision.legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.as amended.significantly,this new bit of descriptive material was inserted at the end of the paragraph immediately preceding the sentence on which plaintiffs are now relying,giving rise to the confusing circumstance that the sentence can be read as referring to the new provision,though the actual text of the bill makes clear the opposite is true.ibid.nevertheless,the fact that the sentence remains set off in its own separate paragraph tends to disassociate it from the new descriptive material and to associate it more generally with the other provisions of the bill which,by their terms,apply to the university.
plaintiffs further rely on a dialogue that took place during a hearing,held on february,before the senate select committee on governmental oversight.at the hearing,an attorney for the california state employees association complained that the original language of section,subdivision c,governing state employees,could be read to preclude a damages action whenever the agency has issued a timely decision,even a decision in its own of course is exactly what defendants now argue about section,subdivision c,governing university employees.the attorney said but i think if you read the plain language,it makes it sound that if the board has reached a decision n ot to act,then that it.that you can only bring a complaint if the state personnel board has failed to act.i think it reads as a bar to civil litigation,but i think it was meant as an exhaustion requirement.italics added.the committee chair then asked so shall we clarify that plaintiffs argue that to clarify statutory language means to explain its already existing meaning,not to change the law,and therefore they assert that section,subdivision c and,by parallel reasoning,section,subdivision c was always intended to be a mere exhaustion requirement,allowing the employee to file a damages action once the agency has reached its decision,regardless of what the decision might be.
this brief dialogue,however,can not support the substantive conclusions plaintiffs draw from it.first,the passing comment of a committee chair at a legislative hearing hardly establishes the intent of the legislature as a whole.moreover,the statement of the attorney for the california state employees association actually supports defendants argument that the original language of section,subdivision c language that remains in section,subdivision c is best read to preclude a damages action.as the attorney pointed out,if you read the plain language,it reads as a bar to civil litigation.italics added.therefore,the committee chair use of the word clarify is not strong evidence that the committee intended to explain existing law rather than to change the law.this conclusion finds further support in the legislative history already discussed,indicating that the predecessor statute to section section drafted to preclude the precise interpretation plaintiffs are now advocating.therefore,considered in this context,the word clarify meant only that the committee would address the issue.
moreover,in light of this dialogue,the committee was certainly made aware that the original language of section,subdivision c which remains in section,subdivision c,was subject to the restrictive interpretation defendants now urge.that the legislature chose to amend section subdivision c,which pertains to state employees,but not section subdivision c,which pertains to university employees,must be treated as substantively significant.see people athar cal th,d,w hen the legislature uses a critical word or phrase in one statute,the omission of that word or phrase in another statute dealing with the same general subject generally shows a different legislative intent.see also people licas cal th,d,in re young cal th,d.plaintiffs suggest that the legislature failure to amend section,subdivision c,when it amended section,subdivision c,was due simply to inadvertence or oversight,and that we therefore should fulfill the legislature intent by construing section as if the legislature had amended it.in other words,plaintiffs suggest that the legislature would certainly have amended section,subdivision c,at the same time that it amended section,subdivision c,if that section had been brought to its attention.
a serious problem with this argument is that the restrictive language of section subdivision c,which pertains to university of california employees,was brought to the legislature attention twice,but the legislature made no changes.the first such occasion was in,when the legislature was considering the bill that added section relating to the california state university to the whistleblower act.at that time,an organization called the university plaintiffs complained about several loopholes in the act and proposed among other things an amendment that would have authorized a damages action against the university of california whenever the university resolution of a whistleblower retaliation complaint was unsatisfactory to the injured party.the views of this organization were summarized in various legislative committee analyses,indicating that these committees gave consideration to the organization proposals.see assem.com.on public employees,retirement,and social security,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,assem.com.on consumer protection,governmental efficiency,and economic development,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.nevertheless,the legislature took no action at that time to amend the restrictive language in section,subdivision c.later,in,a bill was introduced that would have amended section,subdivision c,in virtually the same way the legislature amended section,subdivision c,in.bill reg.sess.as amended.that bill is currently inactive.ordinarily,we do not draw substantive conclusions based on legislative inaction quinn state of california cal d,legislative inaction is indeed a slim reed upon which to lean,but here we use this legislative history only to show that the restrictive language of section,subdivision c,was twice brought to the legislature attention and therefore that the legislature failure to amend that section in was not necessarily a matter of inadvertence or oversight.
plaintiffs argue that defendants interpretation of section,subdivision c,undermines the purpose of the whistleblower act,which as noted is to prevent retaliation against state employees who report waste,fraud,abuse of authority,violation of law,or threat to public health.plaintiffs assert that the availability of a civil remedy by which an employee could seek compensatory damages,punitive damages,and attorney fees would serve to deter whistleblower retaliation.that may well be true,but a statutory statement of purpose does not override the express limits the legislature has placed in the statutory text rather,the purpose is advanced only to the extent and in the manner the statutory text has specified.tenfold damages might also deter whistleblower retaliation,but the statutory text does not impose such damages,and they are not therefore awarded.
finally,plaintiffs point to the settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.younger superior court cal d,quoting people barksdale cal d,quoting bruce gregory cal d,see also commission on peace officer standards training superior court cal th,d,california school employees governing bd.of south orange county community college dist.th,d i n rare cases,the literal meaning of the words may be disregarded to avoid absurd results.plaintiffs find absurdity in a rule that distinguishes between state employees and university of california employees,denying only the latter the possibility of a damages action after exhausting administrative remedies.we conclude,however,that a rational,nonabsurd basis for the distinction may be found in the university unique status as a institution,and the legislature consequent desire to preserve the university autonomy.see campbell,supra,cal th at,d,see also d,ante.significantly,the grant of constitutional power to the university includes the grant of powers campbell,at,d,and t he regents may create a policy for handling whistleblower claims under their power to organize and govern the university.id.at,d.therefore,the legislature could reasonably have intended the university to resolve whistleblower retaliation claims by way of its own internal procedures,reserving the alternative remedy of a damages action for those instances when the university fails to complete its process in a timely manner 
we conclude that section,subdivision c,means what it says a civil action for damages against the university is available only when the plaintiff employee has first filed a complaint with the university and the university has failed to reach a timely decision on the complaint.
plaintiffs also assert common law claims of wrongful termination in violation of public policy.see tameny atlantic richfield cal d,tameny.in tameny,we stated w hen an employer discharge of an employee violates fundamental principles of public policy,the discharged employee may maintain a tort action and recover damages traditionally available in such actions.id.at.later,in gantt sentry insurance cal th,d,gantt,we clarified that a tameny cause of action must be carefully tethered to fundamental policies that are delineated in constitutional or statutory provisions.
here,plaintiffs base their tameny claims on the policy set forth in the whistleblower act,which declares that state employees should be free to report waste,fraud,abuse of authority,violation of law,or threat to public health without fear of retribution.plaintiffs also rely on labor code section,which prohibits the firing of an employee who complains to a governmental agency having responsibility for regulating safety in the relevant industry.plaintiffs argue that their tameny claims are expressly preserved by section,subdivision f,which provides nothing in this article shall be deemed to diminish the rights,privileges,or remedies of any employee under any other state law plaintiffs assert that the tort we recognized in tameny constitutes other state law under this provision.defendants respond,however,that a tameny action is unavailable against a public entity such as the university,and therefore the savings clause found in section,subdivision f,is of no help to plaintiffs.we agree.
the government claims act et establishes the limits of common law liability for public entities,stating except as otherwise provided by statute a a public entity is not liable for an injury,whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person,subd.a,italics added.the legislative committee comment to section states this section abolishes all common law or judicially declared forms of liability for public entities,except for such liability as may be required by the state or federal constitution,inverse condemnation legis.com,west ann,foll,italics added.moreover,our own decisions confirm that section abolishes common law tort liability for public entities.see eastburn regional fire protection authority cal th,d,zelig county of los angeles cal th,d,see also adkins state of california th,d michael los angeles county of adoptions d.
in palmer regents of university of california th,d,the court of appeal applied section in a context similar to that presented here a whistleblower retaliation claim against the university of california.the court observed the only statutory authorization for a civil damage action based on alleged retaliation against a university of california employee for reporting improper activity is section.accordingly,a university employee who believes she is the victim of retaliation is limited to a statutory claim for damages under section.palmer,supra,at,d.the court went on to affirm summary judgment against the plaintiff,who had asserted only a tameny cause of action because the classic tameny cause of action is a common law,judicially created tort and not authorized by statute,it is not properly asserted against the regents.palmer,supra,at,d,citations omitted.although the court of appeal discussion of section was dictum see palmer,supra,at fn,d,we agree with the palmer court that section bars tameny actions against public entities 
we are left,therefore,with plaintiffs tameny claims against the individual defendants.plaintiffs argue that irrespective of whether section abolishes common law liability for public entities,the individual employees are subject to common law liability,and under section,the university,as their employer,bears that liability in their place.section,subdivision a,codifies the doctrine of respondeat superior as it applies to public entities like the university,stating a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would,apart from this section,have given rise to a cause of action against that employee 
plaintiffs,however,overlook the fact that a tameny action for wrongful discharge can only be asserted against an employer.an individual who is not an employer can not commit the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy rather,he or she can only be the agent by which an employer commits that tort.this conclusion flows logically from our reasoning in tameny.
the tort we recognized in tameny,and reaffirmed in gantt,is premised on the wrongful termination of an employment relationship.if an employer terminates an employment relationship for a reason that contravenes some fundamental public policy,then the employer breaches a general duty imposed by law upon all employers and the employee remedy therefore sounds in tort.tameny,supra,cal d at.in that case,the various terms of the employment relationship are not the source of the employee legal rights rather,tort law is the source of the employee legal rights,and the employment relationship is merely the medium through which the tort is inflicted.ibid.nevertheless,the breach of the employment relationship is an indispensable element of the tort,because it serves factually as the instrument of injury.thus,there can be no tameny cause of action without the prior existence of an employment relationship between the parties.
this point was elaborated upon by the court of appeal in weinbaum goldfarb,whitman cohen th,d t he tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy arises when an employer conditions employment upon required participation in unlawful conduct by the employee.but the fact that an employee discharged in violation of public policy has a tort remedy wholly independent of his express or implied contractual relationship with his employer citation does not mean there exists a tort of wrongful termination in violation of public policy independent of the duty rising from the employment relationship.to the contrary,the duty on which the tort is based is a creature of the relationship,and the breach of that duty is the employer improper discharge of an employee otherwise terminable at the will or whim of the employer.citation.there is nothing in any case we have found to suggest that this tort imposes a duty of any kind on anyone other than the employer.certainly,there is no law we know of to support the notion that anyone other than the employer can discharge an employee.id.at,d,italics omitted and added.later cases have followed weinbaum in reaching the same conclusion.see khajavi feather river anesthesia medical group th,d phillips gemini moving specialists th,d jacobs universal development th,d.
plaintiffs rely on walrath sprinkel th,d,in which the court of appeal concluded that supervisory employees can be held personally liable under the fair employment and housing act feha for acts of retaliation.we recently rejected that conclusion jones v.the lodge at torrey pines partnership cal th,d,and in any case,the holding of walrath rested on the specific language of the retaliation provision of the feha,which applies to any employer,labor organization,employment agency,or person,subd.h,italics added.we see no analogous justification for imposing personal liability on supervisorial employees based on a common law tort that depends on the existence of an relationship between the tortfeasor and the victim.we conclude therefore that the common law tameny cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy lies only against an employer 
plaintiffs allege defendants engaged in outrageous conduct that was intended to,and did,cause plaintiffs severe emotional distress,giving rise to common law causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.the alleged wrongful conduct,however,occurred at the worksite,in the normal course of the relationship,and therefore workers compensation is plaintiffs exclusive remedy for any injury that may have resulted.livitsanos superior court cal th,d,shoemaker myers cal d,cole fair oaks fire protection dist.cal d.
shoemaker myers is of particular relevance here because it involved termination of a whistleblower employee.we said to the extent plaintiff purports to allege any distinct cause of action,not dependent upon the violation of an express statute or violation of fundamental public policy,but rather directed at the intentional,malicious aspects of defendants conduct,then plaintiff has alleged no more than the plaintiff in cole fair oaks fire protection dist.the kinds of conduct at issue,discipline or criticism are a normal part of the employment relationship.even if such conduct may be characterized as intentional,unfair or outrageous,it is nevertheless covered by the workers compensation exclusivity provisions.shoemaker myers,supra,cal d at.we reaffirmed this holding in livitsanos superior court,which also involved a terminated employee so long as the basic conditions of compensation are otherwise satisfied,and the employer conduct neither contravenes fundamental public policy tameny,supra,cal d,nor exceeds the risks inherent in the employment relationship cole fair oaks fire protection dist,supra,cal d,an employee emotional distress injuries are subsumed under the exclusive remedy provisions of workers compensation.livitsanos superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
these holdings apply equally here.nor are the exceptions stated in livitsanos superior court,supra,cal th at page,d,of any help to plaintiffs here.the exception for conduct that contravenes fundamental public policy is aimed at permitting a tameny action to proceed despite the workers compensation exclusive remedy rule.as already discussed,however,plaintiffs tameny action is barred by section.as to the exception for conduct that exceeds the risks inherent in the employment relationship,it might seem at first blush to apply on the argument that whistleblower retaliation is not a risk inherent in the employment we rejected this same argument in shoemaker myers,supra,cal d at page.like plaintiffs here,the plaintiff in shoemaker alleged whistleblower retaliation and also a tameny cause of action,and although he incorporated these allegations as part of his claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress,we held workers compensation to be his exclusive remedy and affirmed the trial court dismissal of that cause of action.shoemaker myers,supra,cal d at.the same holding applies here.
accordingly,we conclude that plaintiffs causes of action for intentional infliction of emotion distress are barred by the workers compensation exclusive remedy provisions.
we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
i agree with the majority that government code section,subdivision c must be read as precluding a whistleblower from bringing a damages action against the university of california university when that person has made an internal complaint to the university and the university has reached a timely adverse decision finding its own actions did not constitute retaliation for a protected disclosure in violation of government code section,ante,d at,at.like the majority,i reach this conclusion because the statute unambiguously states that a damages action following an internal complaint of retaliation for whistle blowing is not available unless the university has failed to reach a decision regarding that complaint within the time limits established for that purpose by the regents,subd.c.
i write separately because,unlike the majority,i do not find this result reasonable in light of the unique constitutional status of the university of california,ante,d at,at.to the contrary,this literal reading will act powerfully to defeat the purposes of the whistleblower protection act et the act with respect to university employees.as discussed below,i do not believe the same legislature that in section created a civil action for damages on behalf of a whistleblower subjected to retaliation by the university could reasonably have intended the university to resolve whistleblower retaliation claims by way of its own internal procedures,ante,at,at without any meaningful judicial review.
the decision we reach today,giving section its literal reading,will strongly undermine the purposes of the act,whose central purpose is explained in section the legislature finds and declares that state employees should be free to report waste,fraud,abuse of authority,violation of law,or threat to public health without fear of retribution.for whistle blowing employees to be confident they are protected against retaliation,they must have recourse to a fair and impartial decisionmaking process outside the line management of their employing agency or university.if the same government organization that has tried to silence the reporting employee also sits in final judgment of the employee retaliation claim,the law protection against retaliation is illusory.the legislature recognized and met the need for independent review by expressly authorizing civil claims for retaliation by state agencies,the university of california,and the california state university.yet today decision eliminates meaningful independent review for university of california employees as a result,a university employee,knowing that any complaint of retaliation will be decided by the university itself,will be unable to act without fear of retribution.the legislative goal will be defeated,as university employees will have less reason to be candid and honest without reservation in conducting the people business.ibid.
as noted,the majority finds this result consistent with legislative intent because of the university significant autonomy in running its internal affairs.had the legislature simply exempted the university from the act strictures,i might agree.but it did not.by bringing the university under the act prohibitions on retaliation and providing university employees,like employees with state agencies,a civil damages action for retaliation,the legislature made clear its view that waste,fraud,abuse of authority,violation of law,or threat to public health in public education,as in other areas of government,are matters of vital concern to all the people of when they occur at the university.the problems addressed by the act,the legislature manifestly believed,go beyond the internal affairs of the university and affect the public generally.consequently,the legislature intended its policy to protect university whistleblowers as well as those employed in other parts of state government.
the act does recognize the university administrative autonomy to the extent of permitting it to set its own procedures and timelines for the internal investigation of whistleblower complaints,subds.a,c.but at the same time the legislature expressly permitted a civil damages authorized criminal university managers and officials for their retaliation against whistleblowers,subds.b,c.the court reading of the act,making the university the judge of its own civil liability and leaving its employees vulnerable to retaliation for reporting abuses,thwarts the demonstrated legislative intent to protect those employees and thereby encourage candid reporting.
the literal reading of section we adopt today borders on the absurd,bringing into possible play the principle that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.commission on peace officer standards training superior court cal th,d.but when,as here,the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,to invoke this principle is to assert,in effect,that the language can be corrected on the ground it resulted from a drafting error.courts should use this power to rewrite statutes with great restraint,only where the error is clear and correction will best carry out the intent of the legislature.bonner county of san diego th,fn,d.in the present case,i can not be sure the language of section,subdivision c resulted from a drafting error.while the language is clearly contrary to the overall purposes of the act,its inclusion may have been the product of conceptual confusion or failure to fully consider the problem rather than an error in the drafting process itself.
as the majority explains,the legislative history of former section,the predecessor to section,can be read to
