the plaintiffs appeal the district court orders granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiffs equal protection claim,dismissing the plaintiffs title ix claim and denying the plaintiffs motion for class certification.we find that the plaintiffs wholly failed to state either an equal protection claim or a claim under title ix,and that the district court denial of the motion for class certification was within the court sound discretion.we will therefore affirm the judgment dismissing this action.
procedural history 
on november,the plaintiffs filed a complaint against the defendants claiming that the defendants elimination of the men wrestling,tennis and soccer programs at miami university hereinafter miami,a state university of the state of ohio and a recipient of federal funds,constituted gender discrimination in violation of et and violated their rights to equal protection under the fourteenth amendment.an amended complaint filed shortly thereafter named as plaintiffs a class consisting of all male students who had enrolled in miami with the expectation that they would be able to compete in wrestling,tennis or soccer and future male students at miami who wanted to compete in those sports.
the claims in both complaints were identical they alleged first,that by eliminating the men wrestling,tennis and soccer programs because of the gender of the participants,the defendants discriminated against the plaintiffs on the basis of sex,excluded them from participation in educational programs because of their sex,and denied them the benefits of educational programs because of their sex,in violation of title ix and its implementing regulations,et and second,that the individual defendants,while acting under color of state authority,denied the plaintiffs the equal protection of the laws in violation of the equal protection clause and by eliminating the sports programs on the basis of the gender of the participants.the plaintiffs requested declaratory and injunctive relief,compensatory damages and the reinstatement of those programs.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part,dismissing the title ix claim against all of the defendants and the equal protection claim against miami only,directing that it would proceed with the equal protection claims against the individual defendants for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to.
meanwhile,the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification and a second amended complaint,which was identical to the first amended complaint but for the addition of an alternative due process claim.the district court remanded the case to a magistrate judge for reevaluation of the parties discovery needs in light of the order for partial dismissal,but advised that it intended to hold the motion for class certification in abeyance until it had considered a motion for summary judgment to be filed by the individual defendants on the sole remaining equal protection claim.upon the completion of the limited discovery allowed by the magistrate judge,the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the order dismissing the title ix claim.
after the individual defendants filed the anticipated motion for summary judgment,the district court issued a memorandum and order granting the summary judgment motion and denying the motion for reconsideration.it also denied as moot all other pending motions,including the plaintiffs motion for class certification.this timely appeal followed.
statement of facts 
in,the office of civil rights ocr,which enforces title ix,conducted a comprehensive review of miami in response to a complaint filed with that office alleging that miami discriminated against women in the opportunity to receive coaching and in the accommodation of student interests and abilities.the ocr determined that the rates of participation in athletics did not correspond to the percentage of male and female students,but that the proposed addition of women sports such as cross country would address this problem.
in,miami conducted a title ix,and in,a task force issued a report and recommendation regarding intercollegiate athletics,which revealed that in,females constituted percent of the miami student body,while they contributed only percent of miami.while female athletic teams were added between and,female students,who comprised percent of miami undergraduate population in,contributed only percent of its.in years,miami had added only four female varsity teams,and there was unmet female interest in equestrian,crew,golf,lacrosse and water polo.moreover,miami spent proportionally more on male than female athlete recruiting and financial aid.
in light of those statistics and the lack of additional funds to increase athletic opportunities for female students,miami athletic policy committee concluded,with the assistance of lamar daniel,an independent consultant which conducted a study and formulated a compliance plan in,that in order to comply with title ix,the university would need to eliminate some athletic opportunities for male students.after rejecting all alternatives,miami president,james garland,and athletic director,joel maturi,recommended to the miami board of trustees hereinafter trustees the elimination the men golf,soccer,tennis and wrestling teams as of the end of the academic year.on april,the trustees,unable to identify other viable options,voted to eliminate the men soccer,tennis and wrestling teams.men golf ultimately was not cut because the participants and alumni raised sufficient funds to support the program without miami financial assistance.
the immediate effects of the trustees actions were the loss of athletic opportunities for the members of the men soccer,tennis and wrestling teams and an increase in the female percentage.during the academic year,females constituted percent of miami student body and percent of its student athletes.miami also increased the budget for financial aid to female students by.
