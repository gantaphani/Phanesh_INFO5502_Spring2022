ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over this case pursuant to i a and.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.we review the district court denial of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion.see clementon bd.of,cir.there is a n abuse of discretion when a district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.id.internal quotation marks omitted.however,if the district court denied the fees based on its conclusion on questions of law,our review is plenary.id.
iii.discussion 
the pardinis seek attorney fees pursuant to the idea,which provides that i n any action or proceeding brought under this section,the court,in its discretion,may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.i b.
in woodside school district of philadelphia board of education,cir,we addressed almost the same question that we now address,whether i b authorizes an award of attorney fees to an who represented his child in administrative proceedings under the idea.woodside,at.the only difference between this case and woodside is that in this case the application for attorney fees is for the representation of his child in both administrative and federal court proceedings.the plaintiff in woodside,a licensed pennsylvania attorney,was the father of a child who had a condition called klinefelter syndrome.id.the plaintiff requested an administrative due process hearing to determine whether the school district in which his son was enrolled was providing adequate services for the child disabilities as required by the idea.id.the plaintiff represented his son during the hearing,which lasted seven sessions over a period of three months.id.after the hearing,the school district was ordered to provide the relief which the plaintiff sought.id.the plaintiff then filed suit in the district court pursuant to the idea against the school district for attorney fees that he claimed to have earned in representing his son in proceedings under the idea.id.
on appeal,we addressed whether the idea provision for attorney fees applied to representing their children in administrative proceedings brought pursuant to the statute.id.in doing so,we discussed the court of appeals for the fourth circuit opinion in doe board of education of baltimore county,cir,and the supreme court opinion in kay ehrler,d.the court of appeals in doe denied attorney fees to in idea cases,reasoning that statutes are meant to encourage the effective prosecution of meritorious claims,they seek to achieve this purpose by encouraging parties to obtain independent representation,and l ike attorneys appearing pro se,are generally incapable of exercising sufficient independent judgment on behalf of their children to ensure that reason,rather than emotion will dictate the conduct of the litigation.woodside,at quoting doe,at internal quotation marks omitted.we also noted the supreme court statement in kay that t he statutory policy of furthering the successful prosecution of meritorious civil rights claims is better served by a rule that creates an incentive to retain independent counsel,rather than a rule that creates an incentive to represent one self.id.quoting kay,at.at.following the reasoning in both doe and kay,we concluded in woodside that an can not receive attorney fees for work representing his minor child in proceedings under the idea.id.
notwithstanding woodside the pardinis offer three arguments in support of their argument seeking reversal of the district court denial of attorney fees.first,they argue that in our earlier decision remanding this case to the district court,we instructed the court to determine the amount of reimbursement the pardinis are entitled to as well as the amount of any attorneys fees,pardini,at,and that our instruction constitutes a decision by this court that they are entitled to attorney fees.second,they argue that woodside should be distinguished from the present case because the in woodside sought attorney fees only for work performed during administrative proceedings whereas the pardinis seek fees for work performed during both administrative proceedings and in this federal court case.third,they argue that inasmuch as our earlier decision in this
