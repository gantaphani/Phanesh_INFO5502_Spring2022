on march,anthony soltero,annette prieto,and two other students walked out of de anza middle school with the intent to participate in protests in their neighborhood against immigration reform measures.two days later,they were disciplined for their absence from school by vice principal gene bennett bennett,who took away one of their activities and lectured them harshly regarding the possible legal consequences of truancy,including police involvement,a fine,and a juvenile hall sentence.tragically,anthony committed suicide after school that day.anthony parents and one of the other students brought this action against bennett,principal kathleen kinley kinley,and the school district,alleging violations of the students and parents civil rights under violations of california unruh act intentional infliction of emotional distress,and negligently causing anthony suicide.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants.because bennett did not violate the students constitutional rights,there is no evidence that bennett intended to harm the students,and because anthony death was not proximately caused by bennett actions,we affirm.
background 
on tuesday,march,anthony soltero,an,student at de anza middle school de anza,annette prieto,and one or two other middle school students walked out of school around or in the morning they did not have prior permission from the school or their parents.they left school to participate in protests against the impending passage of federal immigration legislation that would have made it a crime to assist or help undocumented immigrants.in addition to annette deposition,plaintiffs submitted annette handwritten account of the events of the week,which was written a few weeks after the incident at the direction of de anza principal.annette testified in her deposition that the students plan was to walk to nearby ontario high school and to participate with other students in a protest.she testified that mostly the whole schools,like,everybody in the schools were walking out and getting cited for it.everybody was missing a lot of school because of that.when they got to ontario high school however,no one was there.they noticed the school was on lockdown.eventually a few students from ontario high school arrived and they walked for to minutes to ontario middle school,but nobody was there.at that point,it was about am and de anza middle school had been let out for the day because of scheduled teacher conferences.the students decided to go home.while only four students left de anza to participate in walkouts,two other ontario middle schools had walkouts involving to students,and montclair police issued citations to students who had walked out of one of the middle schools.
bennett testified that on the morning of tuesday,march,a teacher told him a girl had come up and asked another girl to leave campus with her as they were entering the classroom bennett was able to identify the girl and discover the identities of anthony,annette,and two other students.he required the four students to meet with him at his office thursday morning when classes began.
annette met with the other students before they entered bennett office.they discussed the consequences they were likely to face in the meeting,including that they were going to have to pay a fine and lose one of their activities.annette testified that anthony told her he was scared of what was going to happen and nervous about just the consequences.annette,too,stated she was so sick with nervousness about the consequences of missing school that she had stayed home from school on wednesday as well.
the de anza parent handbook explains that the consequences for a unexcused absence can range from intervention presumably detention to saturday academy.students participating in any protest that involves nonattendance at school are specifically identified as truant in the school district regulations.ar prohibited activities.in early march,a supplemental policy letter was mailed to the homes of all students explaining that if any disciplinary issues arose,the student could lose one or more of their promotional activities,including a dance,a trip to disneyland,or the promotion ceremony itself.annette had been suspended several times previously during the school year for unrelated infractions.anthony had been placed on probation stemming from an incident the previous spring in which he carried a knife to school.bennett,in response to notification from a concerned parent,had discovered the knife and reported anthony to the police.anthony mother,in her declaration,indicated anthony could have been sent to jail for three years if he violated the terms of his probation.
though accounts of the meeting between bennett and the students differ substantially,annette testified in her deposition that 
me,two other students and anthony walked in,and he pointed at the three of us and said,you guys are all dumb,dumb,and dumber.he said,you guys are going to have to pay fine that he is going to get the cops involved,and we going to have to go to juvenile hall for,like,certain amount of years and that we stupid for doing it,and why did we think that we were going to get caught.
bennett also told the students that they were going to lose a activity,ultimately the disneyland trip for each student.the reason for the students absence was not discussed.after the meeting,the students returned to class for the day.
after school that day,anthony told annette that he was scared that his mother would be mad at him and he was worried about juvenile hall and having to pay a fine.anthony mother was running errands that day,but called home to check in after school and to get a telephone number from anthony.during the telephone call,anthony told his mother that bennett had caught him walking out,and that he was in trouble and going to lose one of his activities as a result.anthony mother testified that he did say anything to make her worry about his safety and that she was able to get the telephone number from anthony when she returned home about an hour later,she found anthony on the floor of his room,suffering from a gunshot wound in an apparent suicide attempt.anthony was pronounced dead later that evening.
anthony left a suicide note which states in pertinent part i just want to tell you that i love you guys and i miss you,and tell this to all my family.i killed myself because i have to o many problems.tell my teachers they the best and tell bennett he is a motherf ker.he also apologized to his father for making him mad.
none of the students were fined or sent to juvenile hall,and the police were never involved with the students truancies.
on august,louise corales and jaime soltero anthony soltero parents,the estate of anthony soltero,jane roe,mary roe,jane roe annette prieto,john roe all minors represented by their guardians ad litem,and guillermo prieto collectively plaintiffs filed suit in the federal district court for the central district of california against bennett the school district and kinley,the principal of de anza middle school at the time of the protests collectively defendants 
the complaint stated six causes of action alleging the following violations of civil rights under and against bennett and kinley in their individual capacities an unconstitutional policy,custom or practice causing constitutional violations against the school district failure to train and supervise,causing constitutional violations,against kinley civil rights violations under california unruh act,cal,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and general negligence resulting in anthony death.plaintiffs sought general,compensatory and punitive damages as well as injunctive and declaratory relief.
defendants filed a summary judgment motion on march.the district court granted the motion in full.as to the first amendment claim,the district court found that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether the students actions constituted expressive conduct.it then applied the supreme court test for expressive conduct in schools,set forth in tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d school officials must justify their disciplinary decision by showing facts which might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities.the district court relied on this court decision in lavine blaine school,cir,for the proposition that school officials may take action to protect the safety of individual students even if such action interferes with the student ability to express him or herself.the district court concluded that school officials are entitled and obligated to take appropriate action to ensure the safety of their students,including warning them however sternly regarding the students legal obligation to stay in school during school hours.having thus found that the school validly disciplined the students,the students actions,in this context,did not constitute protected first amendment activity.
the district court found no other constitutional violation,and,therefore,no supervisory liability or liability under california unruh act,which both require an underlying violation of plaintiffs constitutional rights.finally,the district court held that bennett actions in lecturing the students fell far short of the type of extreme and outrageous conduct required to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress,and that anthony act of committing suicide was both an extraordinary and unforeseeable consequence of the lecture.

iii.discussion 
first amendment retaliation claim 
although the students walkout was ostensibly to protest immigration reform legislation,there is no evidence that the students gave speeches,that they discussed matters of immigration reform,or that they carried placards or signs that conveyed their messages during the.rather,the evidence reveals that the students left their school to engage in a protest march,met up with individuals from a local high school,and walked together to a third school.in the absence of any identifiable speech,these activities,if they are to be protected by the first amendment,must fall within the definition of expressive conduct.
the first amendment protects conduct that is not speech but is nevertheless expressive in nature.see,tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d wearing of black armband to protest vietnam war united states,d.however,first amendment protection does not apply to all cases in which someone intends to convey a message by his or her conduct rather,first amendment protection applies only when it is intended to convey a particularized message and the likelihood is great that the message would be so understood.nunez davis,cir citing texas johnson,d.
here,the record is clear that the students intended to show their opposition to the proposed immigration reform by participating in a walkout.the record is less clear as to whether the walkout was likely to be perceived as such.though bennett admitted he knew of the walkouts taking place in the area,the reason for the students absence was not discussed in the meeting.likewise,while to students walked out of neighboring middle schools,only four students from de anza appeared to have missed school that day.still,because of warnings from school administrators about potential walkouts to protest the immigration reform,it is likely that an actual walkout of the four students would be perceived as a protest.thus,we agree with the district court that a reasonable jury,when presented with this evidence,could conclude that the students were engaging in expressive conduct.
we next consider whether the conduct was protected,and if the school violated the students first amendment rights by disciplining them for their participation in the walkout.plaintiffs concede that the school had a right to discipline the students for the actual act of leaving campus without permission.plaintiffs argue that the students were not disciplined for violating that rule,but rather for their expressive choice to participate in the immigration protests.as such,plaintiffs assert a first amendment retaliation claim.
to establish a first amendment retaliation claim in the student speech context,a plaintiff must show that he was engaged in a constitutionally protected activity,the defendant actions would chill a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in the protected activity and the protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor in the defendant conduct.pinard clatskanie sch.dist,cir.
as a threshold matter,we must first determine the scope of the discipline the students received before we can consider whether that discipline constituted retaliation for their activity.plaintiffs assert that the discipline imposed was comprised of both the loss of a activity and bennett threats of police involvement,a fine,and juvenile hall.plaintiffs argue this total discipline imposed exceeded the parent handbook stated maximum consequence of a saturday academy for a truancy.plaintiffs contest the district court characterization of bennett words as merely a harsh lecture about the possible consequences of truancy,and assert that they instead constituted a true threat of corporal punishment by bennett,and were reasonably interpreted by the students as such.the assumption that bennett words constituted not only a true threat,but punishment,is incorrect.
plaintiffs invocation of the true threat strand of first amendment case law is misplaced.the true threat analysis is employed to determine when speech that is an expression of an intention to inflict evil,injury,or damage on another does not receive first amendment protection.fogel collins,cir quoting planned parenthood of the,am.coal.of life activists,cir en banc.true threats encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.virginia black,d.whether an objective or subjective standard is applied to determine an intent to inflict bodily harm exists,the speech is examined in the light of its entire factual context,including the surrounding events and reaction of the listeners.fogel,at quoting united states,cir.
at issue here,however,is not whether bennett speech should be afforded first amendment protection.doe pulaski county special sch,cir.bennett did not express any intent to commit any act of unlawful violence or to inflict bodily harm upon the students.neither plaintiffs nor the government have filed any criminal or civil action for assault,where bennett actual or apparent ability to carry out the threat would be at issue.see,united states chapman,cir.
plaintiffs instead attempt to connect bennett words to violence by characterizing them as a form of corporal punishment.this argument fails because the definition of corporal punishment under california law requires the willful infliction of,or willfully caus ing the infliction of physical pain on a pupil.cal.a.bennett did not inflict,nor attempt to inflict,any physical pain on any of the students.we decline to expand the scope of actionable threatened harm to encompass the legal consequences of one actions.bennett perceived threats were not empty words to intimidate the students,but based on sections of the california education code,welfare and institutions code,penal code,and ontario municipal code.together,these provisions require compulsory education,prohibit truancy,permit habitually truant students to become wards of the juvenile court,make it a criminal violation for an adult to cause or facilitate the truancy of a minor,fine parents or guardians for the truancy of their children,permit arrest of truant students,and impose daytime loitering restrictions on minors.see cal,cal.welf.code a ontario municipal code.
because bennett statements can not be interpreted as intended to cause any unlawful injury to the students,they do not constitute a true threat of corporal punishment.we thus agree with the district court characterization of bennett statements as a stern lecture.moreover,plaintiffs cite no case law to support the proposition that threats of potential future consequences can alone constitute punishment even if bennett had the authority to impose a juvenile hall sentence as a form of retaliatory discipline,threatening an action is not the same as imposing discipline.
in gaut sunn,cir,this court analyzed a prisoner claims arising out of beatings by prison guards and threats of bodily harm if he attempted to report the beating.we concluded that it trivializes the eighth amendment to believe that a threat constitutes a constitutional wrong.id.at.we stated that we found no case that squarely holds a threat to do an act prohibited by the constitution is equivalent to doing the act itself.see also robinson solano county,cir holding that when the seizure itself is otherwise proper the mere threat of force can not be an excessive use of force within the meaning of the fourth amendment.under ninth circuit law,plaintiffs do not have a retaliation claim based on threats of discipline for first amendment activity if that threat is itself based upon lawful consequences and is not actually administered 
here,the only consequence actually suffered by the students was the loss of one extracurricular activity.plaintiffs contend that even the loss of a activity was a form of retaliation because the discipline did not comport with the consequences outlined in the parent handbook.the students were adequately warned,however,that they would not earn the privilege of attending the activities unless they met all academic and behavioral requirements.annette testified that the students realized they would likely lose their activities as a result of their truancy even before they met with bennett.
thus,any retaliation claim must be evaluated solely on bennett decision to discipline the students at all,when their act of leaving school was intended as expressive conduct.we now turn to the question of whether disciplining this act at all violated the students first amendment rights.
constitutionally protected activity 
the first prong of the retaliation claim is the determination of whether the students were disciplined for engaging in constitutionally protected activity.because this case involves school discipline for arguably expressive conduct,both parties and the district court have analyzed the facts under tinker.the tinker framework,however,is intended to apply to decisions by a school to punish a student speech or expressive conduct as such,because of its potentially disruptive impact on appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.see tinker des moines indep.cmty.sch,d.thus tinker contemplates a decision by a school whether student speech either on campus or at an event is disruptive and punishable under the general authority of the school to minimize disruptions.
here,the students expressive conduct,in seeking to participate in immigration protests,occurred entirely and was not.the students were punished not for any disruptive aspect of their expressive conduct,as expressive conduct,but for the disruption caused by the act of leaving campus without permission.unlike in tinker cases,the school was not exercising discretion when determining whether to discipline the student for their infraction of the general rule forbidding truancy.the disciplinary rules clearly specified both minimum and maximum sanctions for leaving campus without permission and missing school.in fact,district regulations specifically designated students participating in protests that involved nonattendance at school as truant,regardless of any parental approval of their act.admin.reg.the case is,therefore,better understood as questioning whether plaintiffs can be disciplined under the general rule that students are not allowed to leave campus without permission,when their purpose for leaving is to engage in expressive conduct.see jacobs clark county sch,cir holding tinker framework does not apply to rules governing conduct.
the test for whether an exemption should be granted from a rule of conduct to engage in expressive conduct was presented in clark community for creative ccnv,d 
symbolic expression of this kind may be forbidden or regulated if the conduct itself may constitutionally be regulated,if the regulation is narrowly drawn to further a substantial government interest,and if the interest is unrelated to the suppression of free speech.
citing united states,d 
in clark ccnv,the supreme court held that protestors were not entitled to an exemption to the national park general regulation limiting camping to designated areas simply because they were engaging in expressive conduct to protest homelessness.after determining that the rule was,the court went on to find that the interest in limiting wear and tear on parks was substantial and unrelated to the suppression of expression.id.at.the court further held that in determining whether the regulation was narrowly drawn,the regulation should not be judged merely by the plaintiffs at hand,but also by all those similarly situated who would also be entitled to an exemption under the rule.id.at.
similarly,the school policy is a rule that furthers an important interest unrelated to the suppression of expression.indeed,plaintiffs have repeatedly conceded that the school has a valid interest in forbidding students from leaving school without permission.the rule furthers several substantial government interests,including enforcing compulsory education,keeping minors safe from the influences of the street,maximizing school funding based on attendance cal,and limiting potential liability for negligent failure to supervise a truant student properly.see hoyem manhattan beach city sch,cal d,morse frederick,d noting that the rights of students must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.none of these justifications is related to the suppression of speech.the supreme court specifically upheld the compelling government interests in compulsory education and keeping minors safe from the dangers of the streets in prince massachusetts.see also jacobs,at finding increasing student achievement and enhancing safety important government interests lavine blaine sch,cir finding school interest in safety of its students compelling.
the rules which discipline truancies and leaving campus without permission support these goals and are narrowly tailored to the government interests.the narrowly tailored test was expressed in turner broad.fcc,d the means chosen must not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government legitimate interests.quoting ward rock against racism,d.the means chosen,however,need not be the least means of advancing the government interests so long as the interest would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.id.at.
in jacobs,this court upheld a school uniform policy under the brien analysis,finding that the policy left open ample alternative channels for student communication.jacobs,at.the policy in jacobs only restricted students speech during school hours and left the students free to continue to express themselves through other and traditional methods of communication throughout the school day.id.for example,students are still permitted if not encouraged to have verbal conversations with other students,publish articles in school newspapers,and join student clubs.id.here too,the policy only limits students expressive conduct during school hours.the students are free to participate in weekend or events.de anza was on a shortened schedule the week of the,leaving time available to participate in immigration reform efforts.the students are free to engage in speech relating to immigrant rights,as the record suggests they did here,both amongst each other and in the classroom.
in light of this analysis,the school policy of disciplining truancies and leaving campus without permission easily satisfies the intermediate scrutiny applied to rules of conduct.see also cox state of,d upholding reasonable time,place and manner restrictions on right to picket in front of a courthouse.as such,the incidental effect the rule has on the students expressive conduct is permissible,and the students first amendment rights have not been infringed by punishing the act of leaving campus.indeed,granting plaintiffs an exemption to the otherwise generally applicable rule would cast suspicion on the constitutionality of the rule itself,because it would no longer be in application.see carey brown,d striking down regulation that exempted labor picketing from general residential picketing ban as violating equal protection clark,at.noting propriety of evaluating all those similarly situated who would also seek an exemption to the rule see also jacobs,at.to hold otherwise would be to allow to year old students to leave school without the permission of their parents or school authorities to engage in any claimed first amendment activity,no matter the danger.
because the rule satisfies intermediate scrutiny under clark ccnv,the school was entitled to enforce the rule against truancy even when the students sought to leave for expressive purposes.in this context,the plaintiffs act of leaving campus was not a activity,and therefore,plaintiffs do not satisfy the first prong of a first amendment retaliation claim.pinard,at holding that students refusal to board a school bus was not protected by the first amendment,even if expressive conduct,because the discipline was upheld under tinker.
deterrence effect and retaliatory motive 
even assuming plaintiffs had shown they engaged in a constitutionally protected activity,their claim would fail nonetheless because they failed to show that bennett actions had a retaliatory motive.in the first amendment context,a plaintiff creates a genuine issue of material fact on the question of retaliatory motive when he or she produces,in addition to evidence that the defendant knew of the protected speech,at least evidence of proximity in time between the protected speech and the allegedly retaliatory decision,evidence that the defendant expressed opposition to the speech or evidence that the defendant proffered reason for the adverse action was false or pretextual.pinard,at emphasis added.
plaintiffs have not produced evidence of any of the three factors.plaintiffs reliance on sloman tadlock,cir,is misplaced.there,plaintiffs were able to demonstrate that the disciplining officer both disagreed with their message and that his claimed reasons for citing and warning plaintiffs were groundless.id.at.in contrast,plaintiffs here have only produced evidence that bennett may have known that the students skipped school to participate in the protest,but not that he was opposed to that protest.bennett imposed discipline two days after the expressive conduct occurred and not in the heat of the moment.compare morse.at principal immediately reacted to student display of banner at olympic torch relay,demanding that the banner be taken down and issuing suspension the same day.furthermore,plaintiffs evidence showing that bennett generally treated students harshly undermines any argument that his reason for disciplining the students was pretextual.plaintiffs have shown no difference in bennett treatment of them than any other student he disciplined.such conclusory allegations,standing alone,are insufficient to prevent summary judgment.sloman,at.accordingly,we conclude that the plaintiffs have failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to their first amendment claim.
substantive due process 
substantive due process forbids the government from depriving a person of life,liberty,or property in such a way that shocks the conscience or interferes with the rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.nunez city of los angeles,cir quoting united states salerno,d internal citations omitted.plaintiffs argue that bennett violated the students substantive due process rights by issuing a true threat harsh enough to constitute the crime of child abuse under code a or b which a reasonable jury could find conscience shocking.but as noted above,bennett lecture to the students regarding the legal consequences of their actions does not constitute a true threat or corporal punishment.moreover,plaintiffs have submitted no evidence showing bennett willfully inflicted any unjustifiable pain or mental suffering upon the students.construing the facts most favorably to plaintiffs,even if bennett called the students dumb,dumb,and dumber,told them they would have to pay a fine,that he was going to involve the police,and that they would go to juvenile hall,plaintiffs have not shown conduct egregious enough to shock the conscience.see county of sacramento lewis,d see also,brittain hansen,cir police officer condescending,hostile tone and threats of arrest directed at mother during dispute not.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs substantive due process claim 
equal protection claim 
plaintiffs also assert an equal protection claim,alleging the students were punished disproportionately based on their ethnicity.there is no evidence in the record,however,that suggests the students were disciplined on this basis or that their ethnicity motivated bennett decisions.see.e an opposing party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading.plaintiffs argue that this deficiency is due solely to the district court improper grant of summary judgment to defendants before they were provided notice and an opportunity to present triable issues of fact.this assertion is untenable.
the defendants motion before the district court sought summary judgment on all claims,on the basis that there was no genuine issue of material fact and plaintiffs had failed to establish all necessary elements of those claims,including plaintiffs cause of action for violation of civil rights under.plaintiffs equal protection claim arose under their cause of action.moreover,defendants noted in their motion that bennett treated this situation that of students who were found to be truant the same as any other similar situation,without regard to the students ethnicity.defendants met their burden for summary judgment.see celotex catrett,d burden on the moving party may be discharged by showing that is,pointing out to the district is an absence of evidence to support the party case.furthermore,even if the defendants had not explicitly moved for summary judgment on the equal protection claim,the district court has the authority to decide an issue on summary judgment sua sponte,if the losing party was on notice to come forward with its evidence.see celotex,at.the defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims,including those arising out of alleged violations of,plaintiffs attempted to respond to that motion,and defendants disclaimed any concession of the equal protection claim in the reply motion,all before argument on the motion before the district court.plaintiffs were on notice that the equal protection claim was at issue and the district court was within its discretion to grant summary judgment on the claim.we affirm.
supervisory liability 
supervisory liability is imposed against a supervisory official in his individual capacity for his own culpable action or inaction in the training,supervision,or control of his subordinates,for his acquiescence in the constitutional deprivations of which the complaint is made,or for conduct that showed a reckless or callous indifference to the rights of others.preschooler ii clark county sch.bd.of trustees,cir quoting menotti city of seattle,cir.in a section claim,a supervisor is liable for the acts of his subordinates if the supervisor participated in or directed the violations,or knew of the violations of subordinates and failed
