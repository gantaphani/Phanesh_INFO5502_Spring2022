this appeal stems from plaintiffs allegation that defendant mercer island school district district failed to provide with a free appropriate public education as required by the individuals with disabilities education act,the administrative law judge alj analyzed plaintiffs claims using the free appropriate public education educational benefit standard interpreted by the supreme court in board of education of the hendrick hudson central school district rowley,d,and concluded that the district provided a free appropriate public education.the district court concluded that congress superseded rowley in the individuals with disabilities education act amendment and held that was denied a free appropriate public education.the district appeals.
the district court exercised federal question jurisdiction over the instant case under.we have appellate jurisdiction under.we hold that rowley continues to set the free appropriate public education standard.we vacate the district court orders except to the extent that we reverse the district court conclusion that the district committed procedural violations of the individuals with disabilities education act that resulted in the denial of a free appropriate public education.we remand to the district court to review the alj determination that the district provided with educational benefit as required by rowley.
is a student of average intelligence that the district diagnosed with learning disabilities in first grade for second and third grades,the district educated in several general education classes upon determining that she would benefit from an education alongside her peers for social and academic purposes.to level the playing field in mainstreamed general education classes,the district provided with accommodations.the district also provided with specially designed instruction,special education in reading and writing in a resource room for special students.for fourth and fifth grades,parents paid for to attend a private school serving children with reading and writing difficulties.
returned to the district for her sixth grade education at islander middle school.the district reevaluated and determined that she was still eligible for special education.intelligence quotient iq revealed that she was in the average range at the low end.in accordance with individualized educational program,the district educated with specially designed instruction in reading,writing and mathematics.the district provided with accommodations in her general education classes including peers to help her read and take notes,use of spelling software,modified instructions,alternate exam methods,reduced assignments and extra time for assignments.ended her sixth grade year with an a in special education reading,an a in special education language arts,a b in special education mathematics,an a in special education structured study,an a in general education science,a pass in general education art and a pass in general education spanish.
in seventh grade,continued with largely the same individualized educational program that she followed in sixth grade after her individualized educational program team concluded that the program was effective.at the end of seventh grade,received an a in special education language arts,reading and writing,an a in special education mathematics,an a in special education structured study,a b in general education biology and an a in general education art.
in eighth grade,the district modified individualized educational program and provided minutes per week of specially designed instruction in reading,writing,mathematics and study skills.accommodations basically stayed the same.halfway through eighth grade,in january,mother contacted the district regarding frustrations with her language arts class.considered her language arts class boring,stupid and too hard.specifically,did not like being singled out to give an answer in front of her classmates.in response,language arts teacher changed her teaching style,thereby galvanizing to increase her classroom participation and.
took a standardized test of basic skills and scored in the second percentile of eighth graders.although made progress on all of her eighth grade individualized educational program objectives,she failed to meet all writing objectives,two reading objectives,one mathematics objective and one study skills objective.at the end of eighth grade,received a b in special education language arts,a b in special education mathematics,an a in special education structured study,an a in general education science,an a in general education social studies and a pass as a teacher assistant.
the district reevaluated after eighth grade in june.iq showed improvement in mathematics and regression in numerical operations.one of teachers observed that performed much better in class than her standardized test results showed.this was due to a combination of sporadic lack of motivation and propensity to get frustrated on tests and simply give up.individualized educational program team met shortly thereafter to discuss the district reevaluation.a few days later,individualized educational program team met and developed a ninth grade individualized educational program with lofty objectives.based on great progress in eighth grade mathematics,was placed in a ninth grade algebra class with a difficulty level between special education mathematics and general education algebra.
during first semester of ninth grade at mercer island high school,not only did earn good grades,such as an a in algebra,but she also participated in athletics and enjoyed an active and sometimes distractive social life.unfortunately,in march,missed three weeks of school due to an illness.one of teachers believed that was not the same student after she returned and that she was less motivated.turned in only half of her algebra homework and her quiz and test grades decreased as a result.at request,her individualized educational program team returned her to special education mathematics and provided her with another resource room period.parents hired a private educational consultant and began researching private schools for 
at the end of ninth grade,received a b in special education english foundations,an a in special education mathematics,a c in general education history,a b in general education chemistry and an a as a teacher assistant.grade point average was a,which was higher than both the median and mean grade point average for ninth graders in the district.by the end of ninth grade,met all of her mathematics and study skills individualized educational program objectives however,she did not meet two of her reading objectives or any of her writing objectives.nevertheless,individualized educational program team thought that had a very successful year,her grades have been high and though at times she is frustrated or afraid,she has managed to tackle the projects with support.unbeknownst to anyone at the district,mother completed much of ninth grade homework,sometimes even in absence.
shortly after ninth grade concluded,in june,the district held an individualized educational program meeting and presented a proposed tenth grade individualized educational program to parents.the proposed program provided minutes per week of specially designed instruction in reading,writing,mathematics,study skills and transitions.reading goal was to increase reading decoding and comprehension skills on materials.written language goal was to increase written expression skills in a more independent manner.the individualized educational program provided most of the same accommodations as ninth grade individualized educational program with the addition of access to books on tape.the individualized educational program transition statement indicated that programming is aimed at attending a community or technical college.parents told the district that they were displeased with ninth grade education and were looking at other options.this was the first time that parents had ever expressed dissatisfaction with education.
on the same day,parents applied to landmark school,a private residential school in massachusetts exclusively for students in her part of the application,indicated that she did not like attending mercer island high school because my resource room teacher does not let me relax and i do like the pressure to be an a student.generally thought that her peers were competitive academically and that if a student did not receive a grade point average,you were the odd one out and did fit in.
the day after the individualized educational program meeting,the district emailed parents to set up another individualized educational program meeting to address parents dissatisfaction with the proposed program.parents received the district email but chose not to respond.sometime thereafter,mother told case manager at the district that primary problem was with the teaching style utilized in english foundations.case manager asked mother if would be more comfortable in a class with either a or teacher to student ratio,although case manager personally believed that this environment would be too restrictive.mother declined this more reading intensive proposal.
later in june,parents sent the district a letter requesting an independent educational evaluation at the district expense to be performed by deborah hill.see b a.parents indicated that they disagreed with the district june reevaluation primarily because of inappropriate recommendations for instructional strategies and special education services.the district first rejected hill because she was not on the district approved list of evaluators however,the district approved hill shortly thereafter.
a few days later,the district sent a letter to parents seeking their consent for an independent educational evaluation to be conducted by children hospital regional medical center children hospital.see a.parents did not return the consent form.
hill evaluated in early july.hill found that was generally average and had an iq of.scored in the borderline or extremely low range in written comprehension and written language.hill concluded that special education at the district had been inadequate because needed an intensive approach to remedy her disability.ultimately,hill determined,no public school in washington could provide with an appropriate education.hill recommended landmark school because of its focus on improving phonological awareness skills.
in early august,parents informed the district that they were unilaterally enrolling in landmark school for tenth grade.they requested tuition reimbursement from the district.
a few days later,the district sent parents another consent form for children hospital to evaluate parents did not respond to the district before left to attend landmark school in massachusetts.
in late august,parents denied consent to the independent educational evaluation proposed by the district.parents indicated that they would only allow the district to review records,teacher reports and guidance team reviews.parents refused to allow any communication between the doctors that would be examining and the district.parents asserted that they could not provide knowledgeable consent until they received a written description of the evaluation procedures to be conducted,the purpose of any testing and each evaluation test,procedure,record or report used to formulate the district proposal to evaluate.parents stated that they wanted to make sure each evaluation was necessary and avoid duplicative tests.parents put the district on notice that they had an attorney.
in early september,the district sent parents a third consent form.the district also scheduled an individualized educational program meeting for,which was the earliest time the meeting could be scheduled due to the large number of participants.district staff held a meeting to develop an individualized educational program proposal and discuss the recommendations of parents and hill.at the actual individualized educational program meeting,the district presented a proposal with several changes that followed hill recommendations,including more intensive reading instruction.no representative from landmark school attended this meeting.the individualized educational program provided for minutes per week of specially designed instruction in reading,writing,mathematics and study skills.the program included transition objectives such as exploring career options,meeting successful dyslexic adults,developing and increasing skills.the individualized educational program provided the same accommodations as ninth grade program with the addition of spelling not counting against grades and the use of additional computer technology for spelling.the individualized educational program team rejected a landmark school placement as inappropriate for for various reasons,most notably because the landmark school curriculum did not target deficient areas and completely segregated her from her peers.at the conclusion of the meeting,parents informed the district that would not return to mercer island high school.
the district sent parents a fourth independent educational evaluation consent form at the end of september.in early october,parents finally consented.the independent educational evaluation took place in november when was home visiting her family on vacation.the independent educational evaluation reports from children hospital overwhelmingly agreed with the district proposed individualized educational program.the doctors agreed with the district that sixth to eighth grade was the appropriate instructional level for and that demonstrated phonological awareness skills.the doctors found that had made an average of at least one year progress per year at the district.the doctors concluded that should be educated with her peers as much as possible.one doctor even opined that there was no evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of landmark school teaching methodology.
after receiving the independent educational evaluation reports,the district conducted its own reevaluation and drafted a reevaluation report dated march.the reevaluation report concluded that exhibited phonological awareness skills,scored in the low range of expressive language skills and spelled poorly.the report recommended keeping most of ninth grade individualized educational program,which meant keeping her in several general education classes because the district continued to believe that mainstreaming was appropriate for 
the individualized educational program team convened later in march to discuss the district proposed program for eleventh grade.no representatives from landmark school attended but the team reviewed landmark school progress reports.the proposed program incorporated many recommendations suggested by hill and all made by children hospital.the individualized educational program provided previous accommodations as well as access to teacher notes,not being called on without warning,extra time to respond to questions,no penalty for spelling errors and homework limited to three hours per night.the district expressly rejected parents request to include the landmark school curriculum in the program.the district also declined to name a particular teaching methodology to be utilized by all teachers because its experts recommended several effective programs,not just a single right choice 
on june,plaintiffs filed a due process hearing request pursuant to f,seeking reimbursement for landmark school tuition and expenses.the district attempted once more,in august,to appease parents.the district sent parents a letter offering a program engineered by an expert in reading who works at children hospital.parents declined the district offer.
completed tenth,eleventh and twelfth grades at landmark school total expenses were for tenth grade,for eleventh grade and for twelfth grade.
the alj conducted the due process hearing over the course of eleven days in september and october.the alj concluded that the district provided a free appropriate public education to as required by rowley and denied tuition reimbursement.see a c i stating that a school district is not responsible for private school reimbursement if it offered a free appropriate public education.plaintiffs sought review from the united states district court for the western district of washington.see i a.
the district court reversed and remanded.after examining congressional findings added in the individuals with disabilities education act amendment and the definition of transition services,the district court concluded that congress sought to supersede the educational benefit standard set forth in rowley.the district court analysis yielded the following new free appropriate public education standard focused on transition services 
w hether the district approach to the student educational challenges met the idea standard of equality of opportunity,full participation,independent living,and economic for the minor and whether the programs developed for her conferred a meaningful educational benefit in light of the idea goals.
mercer island sch,no,wl,at.the district court instructed the alj that under the new standard,did not receive a free appropriate public education in eighth,ninth and tenth grades.see id.at parents are correct that the failure of the ieps to focus on progressing toward,independent living and her desired goal of education represents a failure to confer the benefit contemplated by the idea.the alj only tasks on remand were to determine whether landmark school was an appropriate placement and to fashion relief.
on remand,the alj concluded that placement at landmark school was appropriate.the alj awarded reimbursement for tuition and related expenses for tenth and eleventh grades based on the district court holding that did not receive a free appropriate public education in those grades.however,the alj equitably reduced tenth grade reimbursement by the cost of seven months of enrollment at landmark school after finding that parents unreasonably delayed the district reevaluation of prior to her tenth grade year.see jg douglas county sch,cir discussing equitable reductions.the alj awarded reimbursement for twelfth grade as compensatory education based on the district court holding that did not receive a free appropriate public education in eighth and ninth grades.see parents of student w puyallup sch,cir discussing compensatory education.both parties sought district court review of the alj second decision.
the district court mostly upheld the alj decision.the district court did not impose the alj equitable reduction.the district court ordered the district to pay for three years of landmark school and in attorneys fees.this appeal followed.

states satisfy the individuals with disabilities education act substantive requirements by providing a disabled child with a free appropriate public education.in,congress enacted the education for all handicapped children act,which contained the following definition of a free appropriate public education 
the term free appropriate public education means special education and related services which a have been provided at public expense,under public supervision and direction,and without charge,b meet the standards of the state educational agency,c include an appropriate preschool,elementary,or secondary school education in the state involved,and d are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under section a.
stat,codified as amended at d.
in,the supreme court rendered its seminal decision construing the act and the scope of a free appropriate public education in board of education of the hendrick hudson central school district rowley,d.the court noted that congress was rather sketchy in establishing substantive requirements.id.at.the court concluded that states must provide a basic floor of opportunity to disabled students,not a education.id.at.congress did not impose upon the states any greater substantive educational standard than would be necessary to make such access meaningful.id.at.phrased another way,states must confer some educational benefit upon the handicapped child.id.at.
to assist courts in this labyrinth of experts,educational policy and charged emotions,the court established a test to determine whether a state has provided a free appropriate public education.id.at.first,has the state complied with the procedures set forth in the act and second,is the individualized educational program developed through the act procedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits id.footnotes omitted.if these requirements are met,the state has complied with the obligations imposed by congress and the courts can require no more.id.at.
congress amended the act in.see,stat.congress did not alter the definition of a free appropriate public education,see id,stat.at,or indicate its disapproval with rowley,see generally,stat.congress introduced the concept of transition services by authorizing federal funding for states to assist in the transitional process to postsecondary education,vocational training,competitive employment,continuing education,or adult services.id,stat.at.congress did not require states to supply transition services.see id.
congress amended the act again in.see,stat.congress did not change the definition of a free appropriate public education,see id,stat.at,or indicate disapproval with rowley,see generally,stat.congress slightly changed the law regarding transition services to include supported employment as an acceptable form of competitive employment.id,stat.at.

the term transition services means a coordinated set of activities for a student,designed within an process,which promotes movement from school to activities,including postsecondary education,vocational training,integrated employment including supported employment,continuing and adult education,adult services,independent living,or community participation.the coordinated set of activities shall be based upon the individual student needs,taking into account the student preferences and interests,and shall include instruction,community experiences,the development of employment and other adult living objectives,and,when appropriate,acquisition of daily living skills and functional vocational evaluation.

congress amended the individuals with disabilities education act in,the effect of which is disputed in the present litigation see,stat.even though congress added numerous new findings,see id,stat.at,congress did not indicate disapproval with rowley,see generally,stat.congress enacted the same definition of a free appropriate public education for all intents and purposes see id,stat.at.congress newly required,beginning at age,and updated annually,a statement of the transition service needs of the child that focuses on the child courses of study such as participation in courses or a vocational education program.id.d a vii i,stat.at.
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,even when the district court based those findings on an administrative record.douglas county,at.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the evidence in the record supports the finding but the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.hellgate,at internal quotation marks omitted.questions of law and mixed questions of fact and law are reviewed de novo,unless the mixed question is primarily factual.id.

the district argues that the district court erred in concluding that congress sought to supersede rowley or otherwise change the free appropriate public education standard.to support its free appropriate public education standard requiring transition services targeted at equality of opportunity,full participation,independent living,and economic,the district court relied on three new congressional findings and the definition of transition services.
we first examine the district court reliance on congress definition of transition services,originally added in the individuals with disabilities education act amendment.the district court stated 
the idea is not simply about access it is focused on transition services,an process,which promotes movement from school to activities taking into account the student preferences and interests.this is such a significant departure from the previous legislative scheme that any citation to case law on special education is suspect.
mercer island,wl,at citations omitted.the district argues that the district court failed to appreciate that the education for all handicapped children act was amended in.the district suggests that this explains the district court omission of any discussion of the nexus between the amendment,amendment and the district court newfound standard.
although the district court order is ambiguous,the district is likely correct based on two of the district court remarks.first,the district court stated that i t is important to note that the law regarding disability education underwent a change about ten years ago.prior to that time,the statutory scheme was the education for sic handicapped children act of eha mercer island,wl,at emphasis added.of course,the education for all handicapped children act ceased to exist in when it was replaced by the individuals with disabilities education act,which was not about ten years ago.see,d,stat.the district court simply appears to have been unaware of the amendment.this explains the district court reliance on what it thought was a new definition of transition services in,about ten years before the district court order.the second remark demonstrating that the district court was not cognizant of the amendment was its footnote indicating a case.mercer island,wl,at.this footnote clearly shows that the district court did not realize that the individuals with disabilities education act existed before.
however,because of the equivocal nature of the district court order,it is also possible that the district court thought the individuals with disabilities education act evolved over time to eventually supercede rowley in.neither plaintiffs nor the district court have pointed to authority supporting the proposition that we should consider the legislative evolution of a statute when determining congress intent.plain meaning interpretation is a cardinal canon of statutory construction,and evolutionary arguments are by no means plain.see.bank germain,d rubin united states,d when we find the terms of a statute unambiguous,judicial inquiry is complete,except in rare and exceptional circumstances.internal quotation marks omitted.additionally,for legislation enacted pursuant to the spending clause,const.art.i,cl,such as the individuals with disabilities education act,it would seem that evolutionary theories by their very nature are foreclosed by the supreme court.see arlington cent.sch.dist.bd.of educ.murphy,d requiring congress to set out federal funding conditions unambiguously so that states can accept the funding voluntarily and knowingly.
regardless of the district court reasoning,we agree with the court of appeals for the first circuit that there is no plausible way to read the definition of transition services as changing the free appropriate public education standard 
it seems obvious to us that the word process denotes a praxis or procedure it does not imply a substantive standard or a particular measure of progress.the adjectival phrase is similarly agnostic with respect to ultimate results it specifies the perspective that participants in the process should strive to attain but does not establish a standard for evaluating the fruits of that process.
lessard wilton lyndeborough coop.sch,cir.
in addition to the transition services definition,the district court also relied on three new congressional findings to support its conclusion that the amendment dramatically changed the free appropriate public education standard.first,congress found that s ince the enactment and implementation of the education for all handicapped children act of,this act has been successful in ensuring children with disabilities and the families of such children access to a free appropriate public education and in improving educational results for children with disabilities,c,stat.second,congress found that the implementation of this act has been impeded by low expectations,and an insufficient focus on applying replicable research on proven methods of teaching and learning for children with disabilities.id.c,stat.at.third,congress found that i mproving educational results for children with disabilities is an essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity,full participation,independent living,and economic for individuals with disabilities.id.c,stat.at.
we conclude that the district court misinterpreted congress intent.had congress sought to change the free appropriate public education educational benefit standard that courts have followed rowley since would have expressed a clear intent to do so.instead,three omissions suggest that congress intended to keep rowley intact.first,congress did not change the definition of a free appropriate public education in any material respect.if congress desired to change the free appropriate public education standard,the most logical way to do so would have been to amend the free appropriate public education definition itself.second,congress did not indicate in its definition of transition services,or elsewhere,that a disabled student could not receive a free appropriate public education absent the attainment of transition goals.third,congress did not express disagreement with the educational benefit standard or indicate that it sought to supersede rowley.in fact,congress did not even mention rowley.
in the free appropriate public education definition in,as congress had done in the act three prior amendments,congress presumably was aware of rowley and its renowned educational benefit free appropriate public education standard.see forest grove sch.dist,d congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change.internal quotation marks omitted.these vague legislative findings cited by the district court are insufficient for us to conclude that congress sought to supersede the ubiquitous free appropriate public education standard set forth in rowley.see branch smith,d stating that absent a clearly expressed congressional intention,repeals by implication are not favored citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
we hold that the district court erred in declaring rowley superseded the proper standard to determine whether a disabled child has received a free appropriat
