nist is a bureau of the united states department of commerce whose purpose is to enhance the competitiveness of american industry while maintaining its traditional function as lead national laboratory for providing the measurements,calibrations,and quality assurance techniques which underpin united states commerce,technological progress,improved product reliability and manufacturing processes,and public safety.b.nist and the university were parties to an agreement establishing the professional research experience program prep,which awarded research fellowships to graduate and postgraduate students at the university.according to the agreement,the prep fellows were employees of the university.nist provided the funding to the university,which in turn paid the prep fellows and provided their worker compensation insurance.however,sizova work while a prep fellow was performed at the nist facility and her work was supervised by nist employees.
sizova is a native of russia and received her doctoral degree in mechanical engineering from the academy of press in moscow.she worked as a guest researcher for nist in and was awarded a prep fellowship in august.sizova alleged that she was told her fellowship would last for three years in the form of three contracts.at the time she was awarded the fellowship,she was pregnant with her second child and informed defendants of that fact.sizova began working at nist under her fellowship in september,gave birth to her child in november,and returned to work two weeks later.on or about december,she was told by christopher fortunko of nist,one of the scientists with whom she worked,that her fellowship would be terminated at the end of the month due to a lack of funds.two days later she was allegedly told by the chief of her nist division,harry mchenry,that she was being terminated because he thought she would not be productive having a baby.app.vol.i at.although sizova was only paid by the university for her work at nist until december,she continued to work on an unpaid basis for a number of weeks thereafter.
sizova efforts to exhaust her administrative remedies are the subject of some dispute between the parties.the regulations governing complaints of employment discrimination against federal agencies require that prior to filing a formal complaint,an aggrieved person must file an informal complaint with the eeo counselor of the employer agency within days of the alleged act of discrimination or of the effective date of the challenged personnel action.see a.sizova sent a letter to mchenry dated december,expressing her dismay over their previous conversation and his belief that her productivity would be affected by her motherhood.app.vol.i at.the record also contains an affidavit by sizova in which she recounted her attempt to file an informal complaint.id.at.she stated that on an unspecified date after her employment was terminated she contacted robin wolf,an eeo specialist with the nist office,informing her that she wanted to file an informal complaint.wolf said she would get back to sizova.after wolf spoke with her supervisor,she allegedly told sizova she could not file an informal eeo complaint with nist because she was a fellow.at a subsequent evidentiary hearing,although wolf denied refusing outright to accept the complaint,she testified she told sizova the day period for filing an informal complaint with nist had passed and directed sizova to pursue her administrative remedies as a university employee against the university.it is undisputed that sizova filed virtually identical administrative charges of discrimination with the eeoc against both nist and the university on may.the charge against nist was dismissed on june,by the eeoc on the ground that it was without jurisdiction over a claim against a federal agency.
nist moved for dismissal under.b,alleging that sizova failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and that the court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the title vii claim against nist.the district court held a hearing on the matter and granted nist motion.in so doing,the court found that sizova was required to contact an eeo counselor within days of february,or by march.the court found that sizova had been notified of the day limit by posters prominently displayed in her place of employment at nist and that she had failed to satisfy any of the grounds provided by the applicable regulation for extending this time limit.on appeal,sizova challenges the procedure used by the district court,and the court conclusion that the posters gave her notice under the circumstances.
we turn first to the procedure employed by the district court.sizova makes several challenges to the manner in which the district court dealt with nist motion to dismiss.she contends the court erred in failing to properly convert the motion to one for summary judgment for two reasons the jurisdictional question,if any,was intertwined with the merits of her claim and the exhaustion issue did not present a question of subject matter jurisdiction.she also maintains the court erred in ruling on the motion without giving notice that an evidentiary hearing would be held and without allowing discovery on the matter.we address these contentions in order.
when,as here,a party rule b motion challenges the facts upon which subject matter jurisdiction depends,a district court may not presume the truthfulness of the complaint factual allegations.a court has wide discretion to allow affidavits,other documents,and a limited evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed jurisdictional facts under rule b.holt united states,cir citations omitted.reliance on evidence outside the pleadings in addressing such a motion does not,as a general rule,convert the motion to one for summary judgment under.id.we have recognized an exception to this general rule,where the jurisdictional question is intertwined with the merits of the case.wheeler hurdman,cir see also pringle united states,cir united states ex rel.ramseyer century healthcare,cir.we have stated that subject matter jurisdiction and the merits are considered to be intertwined w hen subject matter jurisdiction is dependent upon the same statute which provides the substantive claim in the case.wheeler,at see also pringle,at.
sizova argues that subject matter jurisdiction and the merits are intertwined in this case and that she should have been given the procedural protections of rule before the district court converted the motion to one for summary judgment.she bases her argument on the fact that nist moved for dismissal under title vii,the same statute under which she asserts her cause of action.under wheeler,however,the focus of the inquiry is not merely on whether the merits and the jurisdictional issue arise under the same statute.rather,the underlying issue is whether resolution of the jurisdictional question requires resolution of an aspect of the substantive claim.pringle,at.here,the jurisdictional issue is whether sizova has exhausted her administrative remedies,a matter that is simply not an aspect of her substantive claim of discrimination 
nonetheless,the fact that nist alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not intertwined with the merits of sizova claim does not resolve her alternative argument that the exhaustion issue in this case simply does not present a question of subject matter jurisdiction at all.this is not an uncomplicated matter.we have held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit under title vii.see,woodman runyon,cir jones runyon,cir.however,we were careful to distinguish in jones between a failure to timely file an administrative charge,which is not jurisdictional,and a failure to file an administrative charge at all,which is a jurisdictional bar.see jones,at citing zipes twa,d timely filing before eeoc not jurisdictionally required to sue in district court 
as set out above,the regulations governing discrimination complaints against federal agencies require an aggrieved person to consult with an eeo counselor within days of the alleged discrimination.the regulations also provide that this day limit is to be extended under certain circumstances.
the agency or the commission shall extend the time limit in paragraph a of this section when the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them,that he or she did not know and reasonably should not have been sic known that the discriminatory matter or personnel action occurred,that despite due diligence he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from contacting the counselor within the time limits,or for other reasons considered sufficient by the agency or the commission.
a emphasis added the regulation thus provides that if the aggrieved person meets the circumstances set out therein,either the agency or the commission must extend the time limit,and vests both the agency and the commission with discretion to extend the limit for reasons other than those contained in the regulation itself.in keeping with our holding in jones,the regulation clearly indicates that compliance with the day time limit is not a matter of jurisdiction,but rather may be tolled in the appropriate circumstances.
the meager record before us indicates that sizova did contact a nist eeo specialist,albeit not within days of the alleged discrimination.the outcome of this contact is the subject of a factual dispute.sizova asserted in her affidavit that wolf refused to accept her informal complaint because she was a fellow with the university.wolf testified that while she did not refuse to take sizova complaint,she told her the day limit for doing so had passed and directed her to pursue her claim with the university.in any event,wolf admittedly did not inform ms sizova that under section a either the agency or the commission could extend the filing time,nor did she accept sizova untimely complaint so that those entities would have an opportunity to assess whether an extension would be appropriate in the end,sizova eeoc complaint against nist was dismissed because the eeoc has no jurisdiction over initial complaints against federal agencies,which must be filed with the agencies themselves.
in the unusual posture of this case,even if we assume for purposes of this appeal that the matter is one of subject matter jurisdiction to which the rule b procedures apply,as opposed to a issue over whether sizova untimely effort to file a complaint with nist should have been handled differently,we agree with sizova that the district court improperly decided the question without allowing limited discovery.
when a defendant moves to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,either party should be allowed discovery on the factual issues raised by that motion.budde vought,cir.although a district court has discretion in the manner by which it resolves an issue of subject matter jurisdiction under rule b,see holt,at,a refusal to grant discovery constitutes an abuse of discretion if the denial results in prejudice to a litigant,see first city,rafidain bank,cir filus lot polish airlines,cir georgiana cmty,cir canavan beneficial fin,cir.prejudice is present where pertinent facts bearing on the question of jurisdiction are controverted or where a more satisfactory showing of the facts is necessary.wells fargo wells fargo express,cir quotation and citation omitted.
the district court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss at which the court considered some evidentiary material and asked sua sponte for limited testimony from sizova and robin wolf,the nist eeo specialist,who was there as a representative of the government.neither party had requested an evidentiary hearing and the court gave no prior notice that the hearing would be an evidentiary one.moreover,no discovery had occurred at that point.sizova contended at the hearing that nist had never given her notice of her rights or told her that she was a nist employee.app.vol.i at.she also stated that she repeatedly requested written notice of the termination of her fellowship from both nist and the university,and did not receive it until may.wolf testified that posters explaining the need to contact an eeo counselor within days of the alleged discrimination were posted at sizova place of work.sizova and wolf presented differing versions of the conversations they had when sizova attempted to begin the administrative process by filing an untimely informal complaint.
the district court decided the matter by concluding that sizova was required to contact a nist eeo counselor within days of february,and that under section a sizova was entitled to an extension of this period only if she showed she was not given notice of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it.the court granted dismissal upon concluding that the nist posters provided the requisite notice.the posters which the district court held dispositive stated in large block letters if you feel you have been discriminated against on the job,contact a nist eeo counselor.app.vol.i at emphasis added.the poster stated in smaller print if you feel you have been discriminated against because of age,color,disability physical or mental,national origin,race,religion,sex including sexual harassment,reprisal or need additional information regarding discrimination issues,contact an eeo counselor within days of the alleged act of discrimination.id.
for several reasons,we disagree with the district court that these posters resolve the exhaustion issue.while the posters direct a nist employee to contact an eeo counselor within days,the posters do not state that the failure to do so will result in the loss of a claimant ability to pursue relief.moreover,the posters are directed to persons on the job they do not mention holders of fellowships.sizova asserts,with some evidentiary support,that she believed herself to be an employee of the university accordingly,it can not be held as a matter of law that posters directed to nist employees gave sizova,a prep fellow,the requisite notice.see johnson runyon,cir mere posting of notices not determinative issue is whether poster reasonably geared to give particular claimant notice of time requirements.t he day statute of limitations is not reasonable if agencies and courts do not liberally construe the a exceptions.id.at alterations in original citation and quotation omitted see also pauling sec y of the dep t of the interior,cir.
we are also troubled by the factual dispute regarding the circumstances of sizova untimely attempt to file an informal complaint with wolf.sizova has raised factual issues concerning whether wolf complied with her obligation as an eeo counselor to provide sizova with information on her ability to pursue her discrimination claim,particularly given the fact that wolf did not accept the complaint,even though untimely,and thereby allow either the agency or the commission to consider tolling the time limit as provided in section a.in this regard,eeo counselors are required to advise individuals in writing of their rights and responsibilities,see b,and,significantly,must not attempt in any way to restrain an aggrieved party from filing a complaint,id.g.
in addition,in objecting to the lack of discovery,sizova counsel pointed out the relevancy of evidence concerning the way the nist eeo counselors treated prep fellows and of any notes wolf may have taken of the conversations she had with sizova.in light of the factual disputes,further factual development might provide sizova with ad
