this appeal stems from westchester secondary charter school wscs request for classrooms and related space for the school year.los angeles unified school district the district offered wscs space at crenshaw high school crenshaw.wscs objected to this offer and filed a petition for writ of mandate in april.wscs sought a peremptory writ ordering the district to comply with its obligations under proposition as approved by voters,to make reasonable efforts to provide the charter school with facilities near to where the charter school wishes to locate,subd.b.the court rejected wscs arguments that the district had not complied with its obligations under proposition,and it denied the writ petition in this respect.we affirm.
background and procedural history 
charter schools act and proposition 
the legislature enacted the charter schools act of et eq.to provide opportunities for teachers,parents,pupils,and community members to establish and maintain schools that operate independently from the existing school district structure.charter schools are public schools free from most state laws pertaining uniquely to school districts.citation.the freedom granted to charter schools is intended to promote choice and innovation,and to stimulate competition within the public school system.california charter schools los angeles unified school dist.cal th,cal.charter schools.persons wishing to establish a charter school do so by submitting a petition for establishment to the governing board of a school district.the petition is signed by a specified percentage of either teachers or parents and provides detailed information about the school proposed operations,subds.a,g ridgecrest charter school sierra sands unified school dist.th,ridgecrest.after reviewing the petition and holding a public hearing on the matter,the governing board shall grant the petitioners a charter if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice,subd.b.if the governing board denies the petition,the petitioners may submit the petition to the county board of education,and if the county board denies the petition,the petitioners may submit it to the state board of education,subd.j.in reviewing petitions for the establishment of charter schools,the chartering authority shall be guided by the intent of the legislature that charter schools are and should become an integral part of the california educational system and that establishment of charter schools should be encouraged,subd.b.
once established,charter schools have limited means of getting public funds to cover the cost of facilities.cal.charter schools,supra,cal th at.if they do not have enough funds to rent or build their own facilities,charter schools must often rely on facilities controlled by the school districts with which they compete.ibid.before the adoption of proposition,a charter school was entitled to use,at no charge,facilities not currently being used by the school district for instructional or administrative purposes,or that have not been historically used for rental purposes.former,as added by stats,ch.in other words,charter schools had access only to public school facilities that districts were not using.ibid.

wscs request for f acilities for the school year 
the los angeles county office of education authorized wscs as a public charter school to serve students in sixth through grades.the school targets westchester students and students in other communities who have traditionally attended westchester schools.wscs first year in operation was the school year.that year,it had approximately students in grades six through.a church in westchester housed the wscs campus.
in november,wscs submitted a facilities request to the district for the school year.wscs projected ada of approximately students for the year.the facilities request stated that wscs preferred school sites are located in westchester,where it was then located.the request listed a number of school sites in order of priority.wscs first choice was orville wright middle school wright in westchester.its second choice was westchester enriched sciences magnet wesm,also in westchester.the facilities request further explained that the school chartering entity conditioned its approval on the basis that wscs site shall be in westchester or one of the target communities identified in the school petition for establishment.these target communities included view park windsor hills,ladera heights,playa del rey,and playa vista.
wscs third through ninth choices were located in either westchester,playa del rey,or playa vista.the school also would consider an alternative agreement for sites such as emerson manor emerson in westchester,which was a former elementary school that the district was using for adult education classes.assuming the district was unable to offer wscs space in westchester,the school was willing to consider marina del rey middle school,or any other campuses reasonably close to westchester.it noted,however,that to accept the marina del rey school,it would have to obtain a material revision of its charter from the los angeles county office of education because the area was not one of the target communities identified in its charter petition.
in january,the district sent wscs a preliminary proposal of facilities offering classrooms and an administrative room at crenshaw also known as crenshaw business,entrepreneurship,and technology magnet.wscs responded by letter in february that it had several concerns with the offer of space.first,the offer of space at crenshaw did not fulfill the district obligations under section to make reasonable efforts to place the school near to its desired location.wscs asserted crenshaw was miles from wright and miles from wesm,too far for many of its students to travel.wscs believed there was sufficient space at a number of the schools it identified in its facilities request.placing wscs at crenshaw put it outside the target communities of its charter and would prevent it from serving the students it was designed to serve.second,wscs was concerned that the district had not offered it sufficient classrooms and nonteaching space.
in march,the district manager for proposition implementation,sean jernigan,contacted the principal of wscs.according to the principal,jernigan said the superintendent of the district had agreed to give wscs space at one of its desired schools wesm in westchester.the principal requested classrooms at wesm.she understood jernigan was going to get back to her about the number of classrooms,but he never responded further.
instead,in april,the district sent wscs a final notification offering it space at crenshaw.the district argued crenshaw was near where wscs wished to locate,insofar as miles from wright or miles from wesm was near in the context of a school district that spans square miles.wscs accepted the offer solely for the purpose of ensuring that it had space to operate,in the event that it did not secure appropriate space in westchester for the school year in june,wscs learned that it could continue to lease the church space it was using for the school year,and it informed the district that it would not use the crenshaw space.
the writ petition and the court ruling 
the day after receiving the district final notification of space,wscs filed the writ petition for an order compelling the district to make reasonable efforts to provide the school with facilities near to where it wished to locate as well as an order to hereafter comply fully with proposition and the implementing regulations.besides the location of the facilities,the writ petition also addressed the number of classrooms allocated to wscs.the petition asserted that the district had failed to meet its obligation to allocate a sufficient number of classrooms to wscs.the court held a hearing on the petition in december.
in january,the court entered a judgment denying the petition in part and granting it in part,as follows.the court denied the petition as to wscs claim that the district had failed to make reasonable efforts to locate the school near to where it wished to be located.it also denied wscs related claim that the district decision not to offer the school facilities at wesm or emerson was arbitrary and capricious.the court granted the petition only as to the claim that wscs was afforded insufficient classroom space.the court ruling regarding the classroom space is not at issue on appeal.the district did not appeal from the judgment,and wscs has raised no issue with this aspect of the ruling on appeal.
as to location,the court noted that near is a flexible concept in the statutory and regulatory scheme.section itself does not define near,and the only regulatory guidance on location merely places limits on the allocation of facilities outside the school district boundaries,tit.the court explained that,as long as a district expends reasonable efforts to provide facilities near to where the charter school wishes to locate,citation,there does not appear to be a location that is so distant that the location alone would merit the issuance of a writ setting it aside.the court therefore held that the crenshaw location less than miles away from wscs requested facilities within a district measuring over square miles was insufficient alone to merit granting the petition.
but wscs principally argued that the district did not expend reasonable efforts.that is,reasonable efforts by the district would have resulted in placement at either wesm or emerson,and wscs was thus entitled to a writ compelling the district to place the school at one of these two locations.the court held this argument lacked merit.as to wesm,the school argument took issue with the number of rooms the district identified as available.wscs asserted that rooms identified as occupied were actually available and suggest ed ways in which the district could and should have worked to accommodate wscs by altering the operation of the programs in wesm.the court rejected this approach,saying the statutory obligation to expend reasonable efforts to place a charter school near its preferred location does not authorize wscs to the district physical organization of the programs operating at wesm reallocating spaces and room usage in order to find enough room for wscs.indeed,in many cases,wscs arguments regarding what the district should have done contradict the purposes of proposition by placing wscs in a privileged position with respect to both the district students and other charter students as well.the district opposition includes a reasoned declaration from wesm vice principal,discussing wscs proposals for finding space on campus,and indicating why such proposals are untenable citation.wscs contention that the district could have allocated its space in a manner more beneficial to wscs does not demonstrate that the district considerations and decisions were not reasonable efforts as required by section b or that they were arbitrary,capricious,without evidentiary support or otherwise contrary to law.
as to emerson,the court noted the location was an adult education facility with no current nonadult instruction.the court did not agree that the district was required to offer wscs space there when the district was not using the location to educate juvenile or adolescent students.wscs had not carried its burden of showing the district erred by failing to make emerson available.
the court entered a judgment consistent with its ruling in january.wscs filed a timely notice of appeal 
standard of review 
the court may issue a writ of mandate to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins,as a duty resulting from an office,trust,or station.code civ,subd.a.the availability of writ relief to compel a public agency to perform an act prescribed by law has long been recognized.bullis charter school,supra,th at.more specifically,courts have recognized that traditional mandamus proceedings are appropriate to enforce a school district obligations under proposition.bullis charter school,at.
courts exercise limited review in ordinary mandamus proceedings.they may not reweigh the evidence or substitute their judgment for that of the agency.they uphold an agency action unless it is arbitrary,capricious,lacking in evidentiary support,or was made without due regard for the petitioner rights.citations.however,courts must ensure that an agency has adequately considered all relevant factors,and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors,the choice made,and the purposes of the enabling statute.citation.because trial and appellate courts perform the same function in mandamus actions,an appellate court reviews the agency action de novo.bullis charter school,supra,th at.when the trial court resolves conflicting evidence in ruling on a traditional writ of mandate,we inquire whether the findings and judgment of the court are supported by substantial evidence.id.at.when the court resolved questions of law and applied the law to undisputed facts,our review is de novo.ibid.
discussion 
the crenshaw campus represents a location near to wscs desired location 
underlying all of wscs arguments is the notion that the district had to make reasonable efforts to place wscs at a location of its exact choosing.but section,subdivision b does not necessarily entitle wscs to facilities at the exact location that it desires.los angeles internat.charter high school los angeles unified school dist.th,international charter high school.n othing in this statute mandates that districts place charter schools where they want.id.at.s ection,subdivision b only directs school districts to make reasonable efforts,and then only to locate the charter school near where it wishes.ibid.wscs contends crenshaw is not even near its desired location.
we disagree.crenshaw is near to the locations identified in wscs facilities request.when wcsc submitted its facilities request,it was operating at a church in westchester,and it said its preferred locations were in westchester.its facilities request stated that it would also consider other campuses reasonably close to westchester.as the trial court noted,near is a flexible concept,and the statutory and regulatory scheme does not define the term.crenshaw is in the same geographic area as the westchester schools that wscs requested,educational service center west.further,the district presented undisputed evidence that the crenshaw campus is only miles from the perimeter of westchester.wscs contends the crenshaw campus is not near wscs desired location because it is miles from wright and miles from wesm,wscs first and second choice campuses.wscs argues it is the distance to the requested campuses that is relevant,not the distance to the border of westchester.this argument is unpersuasive.the facilities request stated that the preferred school sites are located in westchester,and wscs would consider any other campuses reasonably close to westchester.insofar as wscs expressed a preference for something in westchester or reasonably close to westchester,the distance to westchester in general is certainly relevant.
in determining that miles is near to the desired location,we are guided by the opinion of our colleagues in division three in international charter high school.in that case,los angeles international charter high school laichs requested space within the area served by franklin high school,which was situated in local district.international charter high school,supra,th at.after the district determined that it was unable to offer any space to laichs,the charter school filed a petition for writ of mandate.the trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the district to make an offer of facilities to laichs.id.at.the district filed a return on the writ stating that it had offered laichs space at belmont high school.the trial court ruled that the district offer of facilities at belmont high school complied with the writ and discharged the writ.ibid.on appeal,laichs contended the district abused its discretion in not offering laichs facilities at franklin high school,the school that most of laichs students would attend,were they not attending a charter school.id.at.the court held belmont high school was near to laichs preferred area in that it was located in local district,just as franklin high school was,and belmont high school was only three miles outside the geographic area identified by laichs in its facilities request.id.at.
if three miles outside the desired area is near,miles outside the desired area is also near.we reject the argument that the district abused its discretion because crenshaw is not near its desired location.section,subdivision b does not mandate that schools districts make reasonable efforts to place charter schools exactly where they wish.instead,the district was required to expend reasonable efforts to place wscs only near its desired location.the district did,indeed,offer wscs space near its desired location.
despite the offer of space near the desired location,wscs argues the district abused its discretion in failing to offer wscs space at two specific campuses wesm and emerson.we begin with the arguments and then move on to emerson.
the district did not abuse its discretion in placing the incubator school instead of wscs at wesm 
wscs contends the district abused its discretion by placing a district pilot program,the incubator school incubator,at wesm instead of wscs.wscs asserts the district acted arbitrarily and capriciously because the decision to place incubator at wesm violated the district own policies and improperly favored incubator.wscs further argues this failure to follow district policies violated the requirement to make reasonable efforts to place a charter school near its desired location.we are not so persuaded.
in addition to the pertinent statutory and regulatory mandates,the district uses matching guidelines to resolve the many competing facilities requests from charter schools.under these guidelines,the district makes every reasonable effort to locate space on a single site,or only if necessary on multiple sites,in the charter applicant geographic area of interest.in cases when more than one charter school requests the same space,the district examines whether the potential match would utilize all available classrooms and whether the match represents a full,single site offer.priority is given to those charters where these two goals can be achieved.
the district received requests for facilities from charter schools for the school year.it determined of those requests came from eligible charter schools and made offers of space to all of those applicants.of those,charter schools besides wscs requested space in educational service center west.the district,therefore,had to work with many competing requests for space,and sometimes competing requests for the exact same space.for instance,wscs and ocean charter school both requested space at wesm.ocean charter school was already at wesm for the previous school year.once the district places a charter school at a particular location,it shall not move the charter school unnecessarily,subd.b.thus,the district allocated the requested space at wesm to ocean charter school.
in september and october,the district had conducted a comprehensive capacity assessment roadshow to precisely assess the capacity of each school site in terms of the number of classrooms,the manner in which the schools used those classrooms,and the schools operating capacity.the district capacity assessment determined that,as of february,wesm had unassigned classrooms,after the district allocated space for ocean charter school there incubator required seven classrooms.wscs required classrooms plus an administrative office space.wscs contends the district acted arbitrarily and capriciously because wscs would have used more classrooms than incubator and thus would have maximized the use of available classrooms under the district policy.moreover,it argues because the district did not follow its policy of maximization,it did not follow its other policy of making reasonable efforts to place the charter school not just near its desired location,but in the charter applicant geographic area of interest.italics added.
we reject the contention that the district abused its discretion for failing to strictly comply with its internal guidelines.as jernigan,the district proposition manager,describes it,the district matching guidelines are just that guidelines.they can not be applied in a vacuum and without rationale.in allocating space to charter schools,the district must consider the impact on other public school students,both those attending district schools and those attending other charter schools requesting space.italics omitted.the district approach of balancing impacts is consistent with the law.we have already established section does not entitle a charter school to facilities in the exact location or locations it desires.this is especially the case if so doing would favor charter school students over other district students.proposition requires that facilities should be shared fairly among all public school pupils,including those in charter schools,subd.a,italics added.the implementing regulations state that i n evaluating and accommodating a charter school request for facilities pursuant to section,the charter school students must be given the same consideration as students in the schools,subject to the requirement that the facilities provided to the charter school must be contiguous.international charter high school,supra,th at.to put the charter school students needs over those of other school district students would not strike a fair balance between the needs of the charter school and those of the schools.ibid.
incubator was housed at playa vista elementary school during the prior school year.the district had to relocate incubator for the year because playa vista elementary school no longer had sufficient classroom space to accommodate incubator.the district chose wesm because it was close to playa vista elementary school and had sufficient space for incubator.thus,far from being arbitrary and capricious,the district decision to locate incubator at wesm had a reasonable basis.
if we follow wscs logic,the district should have put wscs at wesm and put incubator elsewhere.wscs argues b ecause incubator was not on the wesm campus previously,putting it on a campus other than wesm for the school year would have caused it no disruption or dislocation whatsoever.this argument assumes incubator students would not have suffered any dislocation or disruption in moving to a location farther from their previous playa vista location.if there was some other campus close to playa vista that could have housed incubator without any more disruption,wscs has not identified it.the process the district undertook to resolve all proposition requests was complex and involved a variety of stakeholders.jernigan described how the district did not just look at wscs needs,but at how to balance the needs of all the programs in the area.and like a rubik cube,if you only have one piece that does fit,you likely to scramble the whole thing before you fix that.the evidence demonstrated the district decision to place incubator at wesm was reasonable,not arbitrary and capricious as long as an agency decision is not arbitrary,capricious,or lacking in evidentiary support,we must uphold the agency determination even if reasonable minds may disagree as to the wisdom of the action.klajic castaic lake water agency th.
wscs relies on ridgecrest to suggest that the district was obligated to move incubator and accommodate wscs.ridgecrest is plainly distinguishable and does not provide the support for which wscs argues.in that case,sierra sands unified school district responded to a request for facilities from ridgecrest charter school by offering the charter school classrooms at five different school sites separated by a total of miles.ridgecrest,supra,th at.the charter school petitioned for a writ of mandate compelling the school district to provide contiguous school facilities at a single site or,if that was not possible,to provide facilities in such a way as to minimize student dislocation and maximize student safety.id.at the court observed that one of the implementing regulations mentioned accommodating a charter school might involve moving programs or changing attendance areas.id.at,italics omitted.thus,the regulations seemed to contemplate that some disruption and dislocation of the students and programs in a district may be necessary to fairly accommodate a charter school request for facilities.ibid.the court of appeal noted section mandate that public school facilities be shared fairly among charter and noncharter students and held that p roviding facilities,whether or not they are reasonably equivalent in other respects,at five different school sites does not strike a fair balance between the needs of the charter school and those of the schools.the district failed,in other words,to demonstrate either that it could not accommodate ridgecrest charter school at a single school site,or that it had minimized the number of sites in a manner consistent with the intent of the act.ridgecrest,supra,at.
accordingly,the school district in ridgecrest had not at all complied with the mandate of section to provide reasonably equivalent,contiguous facilities,and thus was required to consider some disruption and dislocation of the students and programs in a district to fairly accommodate a charter school request for facilities.ridgecrest,supra,th at.the ridgecrest school district offer of classrooms at five different sites separated by miles hardly compares to the district offer in this case for space at a single campus miles away from the desired area.when the district offer already fairly accommodates the charter school right to facilities near its desired location,the district is not compelled to consider even more disruption and dislocation to other students to provide the charter school with the exact location it desires.
in sum,the law requires the district to treat charter and noncharter students fairly,but not favor one group over the other.the district had a reasoned basis for placing incubator at wesm and offering wscs other facilities near its location.we decline to hold the district abused its discretion and disturb this decision.
the district did not abuse its discretion in failing to place both incubator and wscs at wesm 
wscs next contends the district abused its discretion by failing to put wscs at wesm even with incubator there.part of the district capacity assessment involved meeting with campus administrators and identifying set asides that is,classrooms used for purposes other than general education at each campus.one of the interrogatories wscs propounded asked the district to state all facts upon which it relied in determining what facilities to offer wscs.the district response described the process it used to administer all facilities requests generally.among other measures in the process,the district stated that it engaged in the materially disruptive measure of eliminating in order to achieve sharing space fairly amongst charter and students in the district.the eight programs operating at wesm for the school year,including incubator and others see footnote,ante,used all but three classrooms at the school.this was insufficient to house wscs,which required at least classrooms and one administrative space.but wscs contends some of the classrooms represented set asides that could have been eliminated to make room for wscs.wscs maintains that if the district had made reasonable efforts to eliminate set asides at wesm,there would have been sufficient space for incubator and wscs.we again disagree the district abused its discretion in this instance.
regardless of whether wesm or the district could have eliminated certain set asides and thereby freed up more classrooms,the district had a reasoned basis independent of set asides for not placing both incubator and wscs at wesm.wesm assistant principal,helene cameron,oversaw facilities at wesm and personally participated in the capacity assessment with district officials.according to cameron,the campus ha d no realistic ability to accommodate more than the eight programs already offered space there.cameron stated that having more programs would present significant safety,educational,scheduling,facilities and operational challenges.as examples of the scheduling difficulties,cameron explained that six of the eight programs on the campus regularly used common spaces such as the auditorium,practice fields and courts,eating areas,and the social hall.on one occasion,ocean charter school needed the social hall for a performance at the same time wesm needed it for testing.on another occasion,wesm needed the social hall for several days to set up a homecoming dance,while ocean charter school was scheduled to use the hall at the same time.problems of that nature had become common and routine and were taking significant time and effort to resolve.as an example of challenges,cameron cited among other things the verbal and physical altercations between students from different programs,the mixing of many different age groups and grade levels of children grades kindergarten through were represented on the campus,and the traffic control problems caused by so many cars and people moving in and out of the campus at the same time or at the time that other students are walking near the parking lot to places such as the gymnasium.cameron observed that the challenges posed by all the different programs on campus were distracting from the primary responsibility of providing a quality education to the students on campus.in light of cameron evidence,we can not say the district acted arbitrarily and capriciously by declining to place a ninth program on the wesm campus.
wscs claims the district can not rely on too many programs as a rationale because the district proposal for facilities did not expressly and specifically invoke this rationale.wscs cites ridgecrest for this purported rule,but ridgecrest does not so hold.instead,ridgecrest held that the district must offer some explanation for its decision regarding how the facilities will be allocated between the charter school and the schools.citation.while detailed findings are not necessarily required,the explanation should be thorough enough,and factual enough,to permit effective review by the courts.ridgecrest,supra,th at.the district page final offer of space to wscs addressed each of wscs objections to the preliminary proposal,including the objection to location.the district undoubtedly offered some explanation ibid.for its decision to offer facilities at crenshaw,and it cited student safety and welfare as paramount considerations in its location decision.we have not felt hampered in our review by the lack of more detail in the preliminary and final offers of space.to suggest that the district can not amplify on the reasons in these documents when litigation ensues,but must explain in detail all of its rationales or risk forfeiture,seems like an unworkable standard to impose.this is especially true when one considers that the district had a limited time frame to respond to requests for facilities from charter schools,some of which,like wscs,identified multiple campuses for assessments.
wscs further argues the district can not rely on the high number of programs at wesm because cameron declaration constituted undisclosed expert testimony.this argument also fails.as wesm assistant principal,cameron responsibilities included overseeing facilities.the facts stated in her declaration were observations based on personal knowledge and not opinions.even if they were opinions,a lay witness may testify to an opinion if it is r ationally based on the perception of the witness and h elpful to a clear understanding of his or her testimony.
wscs additionally argues the high number of programs at wesm can not justify the failure to place wscs there because crenshaw housed a similar number of programs,yet the district decided to place wscs at crenshaw.the district proffered evidence that,at the time the district was making its facilities decisions,crenshaw had many more available classrooms than wesm.moreover,it had a higher capacity for enrollment than wesm students versus students and a lower existing enrollment than wesm students versus students.in other words,there was reason to believe crenshaw was better able to house another program.
in short,even if wesm could have eliminated some of its set asides as unnecessary,there was evidence the school could not house a ninth program without significant negative impacts to the students already there.a holding that the district must provide facilities a charter school requests,on demand and without regard to overcrowding or the impact on other public school students,would tip the balance too far in favor of the charter school.international charter high school,supra,th at.it was not an abuse of discretion for the district to refuse a ninth program.
still,we will briefly address the particular set asides wscs disputes.wscs identifies set asides that purportedly could have been eliminated and made available,as follows 
continuing education set asides five rooms the capacity assessment,dated february,determined that five set asides had been allocated to central high c and one set aside to city of angels.but during the school year,wesm was using the five rooms allocated to central high c,and central high c was using three different rooms.cameron indicated that,even though central high c no longer used the five set asides,wesm used them for its own programs because incubator took over space the wesm programs previously occupied.
computer lab set asides one room the capacity assessment identified three computer lab set asides.wesm had only two computer labs for the school year,though.cameron indicated that wesm eliminated the third computer lab to make room for incubator.incubator took over that space,and wesm moved the computers to different rooms around the school.
music set asides two rooms the capacity assessment identified rooms wesm need ed for magnet enroll ment,separate from the rooms identified as set asides.two set asides were identified for music and two set asides for assembly.wscs argues the two performing arts teachers used two of these rooms full time,and as such they were included in the rooms used for general instructional purposes and should not have been double counted under set asides.the performing arts teachers taught a range of courses including guitar,general music,band,advanced band,introduction to theatre,theatre production,music technology,and web master.
remaining music set asides two rooms if each performing arts teacher had a room in the general instruction category,wscs argues the two remaining set asides for music and assembly were not necessary because the performing arts teachers needed only one classroom each.its evidence is that the performing arts teacher for prior years and taught all of his classes in one room,one of the current teachers sometimes taught his classes in a single room,and the other current teacher used two rooms that were identical except that one room had chairs and one had desks,and it was possible to use desks that convert into chairs in a single room.
office one room wesm identified one of the set asides as an office.in responding to interrogatories,the district stated that the set aside was a small room and had been inadvertently identified as a classroom in the count of total,classrooms at wesm.wscs suggests that if this room was not included in the count of total classrooms,it should not be deducted from the total count as a set aside.
culinary arts one room the capacity assessment identified two set asides for culinary arts.in a separate line item,the capacity assessment identified six classrooms used by non norm funded teaching positions.qeia is the quality education investment act of,codified at section et.as wesm principal explained it,the district normally funds teacher positions based on student enrollment.schools that receive grant money through qeia may fund additional teacher positions beyond the number justified by student enrollment.a,teaching position would thus mean a position funded by neither qeia nor according to the district normal funding formula.the culinary arts teacher held one of those,positions she was funded through the regional occupation program.because the culinary arts teacher had a,position,wscs argues one of the culinary arts set asides must have been double counted under the line item for,rooms.
science labs two rooms the capacity assessment identified two set asides as science labs.in response to a request for admission,the district admitted that these two rooms had essentially been double counted the district admits that rooms and were utilized as science labs in the school year.the district further admits that rooms and were included in the wesm capacity assessment summary standard size classroom count as needed and used by wesm and therefore did not need to also be identified therein as school set asides.wscs argues this admission conclusively established that the science labs should not have been included in the set asides.code civ,subd.a.accordingly,the number of set asides could be reduced by two,freeing up two more rooms.
the trial court looked at the disputed evidence concerning these set asides and determined the district did not act arbitrarily,capriciously or without evidentiary support in failing to eliminate the set asides we agree.wscs disputes many of these set asides on the ground that wesm must have double counted them,that is,counted them in both the set aside category and another category insofar as wesm teachers were using them for general instruction purposes.the only rooms as to which this is conclusively established are the two science labs that were the subject of the request for admission.otherwise,cameron declared that wesm had not double counted any classrooms.wscs disputes several of these other set asides because it essentially disagrees with how wesm was using them,the music rooms in particular.wscs speculation that the performing arts teachers did not need two rooms to teach their different types of theatre and music classes is not convincing.the idea that the teachers might require separate performance space and learning space with desks is sensible,and we can not characterize the failure to force the teachers to use one room as an abuse of discretion.
as jernigan explained,eliminating set asides was not just a matter of cutting the rooms themselves.the process was more accurately described as cutting programs,which would then result in set asides associated with those programs being eliminated.the district did look at the
