the california teachers association cta and tiffani curran curran filed a petition for a peremptory writ of mandate after curran was informed in a letter dated august,that she would not be employed as a teacher by the golden valley unified school district golden valley for the school year.the trial court denied the petition and ruled a teacher with only an emergency permit may not be classified as a probationary employee and,therefore,the statutory procedures of notice and a hearing do not apply to the dismissal of such a teacher.
curran appealed,contending she was a probationary employee during the school year who was not given a notice under education code section and,therefore,was automatically rehired for the following school year by virtue of her written contract with golden valley classifying her as a probationary employee,she was entitled to the statutory procedures applicable to the dismissal of probationary employees if,alternatively,she should have been classified as a temporary employee instead of a probationary employee,golden valley was required to follow the statutory procedures applicable to the dismissal of a temporary employee and golden valley was estopped from denying curran employment for the school year because she relied upon its written offer and contract.
we hold curran contract properly classified her as a probationary employee and she was entitled to prior written notice of dismissal and the right to a hearing.accordingly,we reverse and remand.
procedural background 
on march,cta and curran filed a petition for a peremptory writ of mandate against golden valley and its governing board requesting payment to curran of back pay and benefits for the school year,declaratory relief that curran was wrongfully terminated,and attorneys fees.curran filed declarations and points and authorities in support of her petition.golden valley filed an answer,as well as declarations and points and authorities in opposition to the petition.
on june,and july,counsel presented oral argument to the trial court no witnesses testified before the court.after the presentation of oral argument on july,the trial court stated on the record the reasons for its denial of the petition.cta and curran filed a notice of appeal from the trial court decision.
during the school year,curran was employed by the madera unified school district under a written contract that classified her as a probationary employee.her qualification to teach was based on an emergency long term multiple subject teaching permit issued by the commission on teacher credentialing of the state of california ctc,which was valid from august,to september.she was assigned to teach sixth grade math and science at webster elementary school.
during the school year,madera unified school district underwent reorganization and webster elementary school became a part of the newly created golden valley unified school district.golden valley began teaching operations as of july,the first day of the school year on may,golden valley presented curran with a letter and a certificated employee of employment relating to employment for the school year.curran saw the base salary in the offer was incorrect and told golden valley that she should have been placed in class,station,of the salary schedule.golden valley changed the salary amount and presented curran with a revised offer dated june.curran accepted the revised offer by signing and returning it to golden valley.
the contract formed by the parties listed curran status as probationary and contained the following provision 
contingent upon fulfilling the requirements to obtain a valid california teaching credential or evidence that i have fulfilled all requirements of my current credential and am enrolled in an approved ctc,college or university program,am enrolled in coursework that will qualify me for a multiple subjects credential,pass the msat prior to august.
in july,after curran returned from her summer vacation,she met with the principal of webster elementary school to begin preparing for the new school year.the principal told curran that she did not know if curran would be working there because curran had not fulfilled the contingencies in the contract.subsequently,curran received a letter from golden valley scheduling a meeting with the superintendent and the principal for july.the letter stated the purpose of the meeting was to establish if curran had met the requirements of the contract and requested her to bring to the meeting her test results from the multiple subject assessments for teachers msat of june,a copy of her spring coursework,her application for fall coursework at california state university at fresno,a receipt of tuition paid,and the name of her credential advisor at the university.
at the july,meeting,curran presented the requested documents and told the superintendent that she had not passed the msat test.the superintendent then stated curran had not fulfilled the requirements of the contract and that golden valley could not hire any teacher with an emergency permit until teachers with full credentials had been interviewed.when the superintendent was told the contract did not require curran to pass the msat,he asked for hours to think about it and talk to the governing board.
on august,golden valley sent curran a letter stating golden valley decided not to employ her for the school year,the district offer of employment to you was contingent upon your fulfilling the requirements to obtain a california teaching credential,curran did not complete many of the basic requirements to obtain a teaching credential,including student teaching,additional coursework,passage of the msat and passage of the reading initiative objective test rica,and golden valley concluded it would not be in the best interest of golden valley to continue curran employment on an emergency certificate in light of the availability of fully credentialed applicants.
an attorney representing curran sent a letter to golden valley expressing the view that curran had fulfilled the contingencies in the contract and,as a result,was entitled to employment for the school year.the dispute was not resolved and curran filed her petition for a writ of mandate in march.
discussion 
when school districts are reorganized,the employment rights of certificated employees are protected under section.when such employees are probationary,they shall be employed by the district which thereafter maintains the school where the employee worked prior to the reorganization and their classification by such district shall be the same as it would have been had the school continued to be maintained by the district that formerly maintained it.
in this case,the reorganization of madera unified school district and the creation of golden valley school district had progressed to the point where golden valley had entered into a written contract with curran and the school year had began.therefore,even if curran was a certificated employee within the meaning of the provisions of section,those provisions would no longer directly govern the relationship between curran and golden valley at the time of curran dismissal.by then,that relationship was defined by the written contract and the provisions of the education code generally applicable to the employment of teachers.therefore,the issue presented is whether the dismissal of curran violated her contractual or statutory rights.curran statutory claims center on section and whether it required or permitted golden valley to classify her as a probationary employee.

teachers with emergency permits may be classified by a school district as probationary employees.
as background on the importance of classification as a probationary employee,we observe it brings a teacher two primary benefits first,service as a probationary employee generally counts toward completing the probationary period required before an employee is classified as permanent,subd.b.second,districts are restricted in the ways they may end the employment of a probationary employee.
midyear dismissals of probationary employees generally must be for unsatisfactory performance or for cause and such a dismissal requires the district to give the employee days prior written notice and the right to a hearing,subd.a.the predecessors of this provision have protected probationary teachers for over years.former political code section gave school boards the power t o dismiss probationary teacher during the school year for cause only stats,ch,see stats,ch,stats,ch,former school code stats,ch,former stats,ch,former.
when ending the employment of a probationary employee at the close of the school year,school districts are subject to fewer restrictions.a district may choose not to reelect a probationary teacher for the ensuing school year without any showing of cause,without any statement of reasons,and without an administrative hearing or appeal,as long as the district gives notice to the teacher on or before march of the employee second year of employment.b grimsley board of trustees d.board of education round valley teachers cal th,d.similarly,under former political code section,subdivision i,a school district could notify a probationary teacher on or before the tenth of june that the teacher services would not be retained for the ensuing school year.stats,ch.
this case does not directly involve the first benefit of probationary status,counting service towards completion of the mandatory probationary period.that situation was addressed recently by the first district in summerfield windsor unified school dist.th,d summerfield.instead,curran seeks the benefit of the statutory provisions restricting dismissal.curran contends she was a probationary employee for purposes of dismissal from employment and,as a result,she was entitled to days notice and a right to a hearing under section,subdivision a.it is undisputed that golden valley did not give curran such notice or right to a hearing prior to her dismissal.
golden valley argues curran was not entitled to the notice and hearing given to probationary employees because that classification requires the teacher to be certificated,and never applies to a teacher holding an emergency permit from the ctc.in response,curran presents two theories as to why she was entitled to be treated as a probationary employee.first,curran asserts section required golden valley to classify her as a probationary employee.second,curran asserts the school districts chose to classify her as a probationary employee in the written contracts for the and school years,this classification was not prohibited by statute and,therefore,the classification fell within the freedom of contract allowed the parties by the education code.
the education code does not explicitly resolve this dispute.on one hand,the statutory provisions do not explicitly prohibit a teacher with an emergency permit from being classified as a probationary employee.on the other hand,no statutory provision explicitly delineates how teachers with emergency permits should be classified consequently,we must determine whether the general rule set forth in section concerning when a teacher should be classified as a probationary employee applies to a teacher with an emergency permit.
neither party has cited,nor are we aware of,any published appellate decision that explicitly holds whether or not the general rule of section applies to a teacher with an emergency permit.in one reported decision,a school district classified a teacher with an emergency permit as probationary and the court stated the classification was a mistake while she continued to work under an emergency permit.summerfield,supra,th at,fn,d.however,that statement was dicta.consequently,in construing the general rule for the classification of teachers set forth in section,we face an issue of first impression.
literal construction of section.
section states 
governing boards of school districts shall classify as probationary employees,those persons employed in positions requiring certification qualifications for the school year,who have not been classified as permanent employees or as substitute employees.
golden valley did not classify curran as a permanent or as a substitute employee.therefore,under the plain language of section,if curran was employed in a position requiring certification qualifications,then golden valley was required to classify her as a probationary employee 
the phrase position requiring certification qualifications is defined in section to include every type of service for which certification qualifications are established by or pursuant to section to,inclusive,section and the chapter on teacher credentialing,sections to.the chapter of the education code governing teacher credentialing sets forth the certification qualifications for service as a grade school or high school teacher.there is little doubt,and golden valley concedes,that the position of teaching sixth grade math and science is a position requiring certification qualifications as opposed to a position not requiring certification qualifications.consequently,under a literal construction of section,curran was employed in a position requiring certification qualifications and,thus,was entitled to be classified as a probationary employee.
construction of section in the context of the statutory framework.
golden valley asserts a literal interpretation is not appropriate because it is inconsistent with the way in which the legislature has treated teachers with emergency permits throughout the education code.golden valley assertion is based on two premises.first,in enacting section and its predecessors,the legislature presupposed it would only be applied to certificated employees.second,a certificated employee must have a credential listed in subdivision b of section,not the emergency permit referenced in subdivision c of section.see jones oxnard school dist.d,fn.parties refer to teachers holding provisional credentials as noncertificated teachers.
in considering whether to reject a literal construction of section,we examine the historical development of the provisions concerning classification of teachers,emergency and provisional credentials,counting teacher service towards attaining permanent classification,the dismissal of teachers,and minimum annual salaries for teachers.
historical development from to.
in,the legislature authorized school boards to classify teachers as substitute,probationary or permanent specified the manner in which teachers of each classification could be dismissed and required persons who had been successfully employed as teachers by the district for two consecutive school years to be classified as permanent teachers.stats,ch,enacting former pol.code,subds.c,d,e,h,i and j.at that time,emergency or provisional credentials were not authorized.
in,former political code section was amended and employment in positions requiring certification qualifications was required for an employee to be classified as substitute,probationary or permanent.stats,ch,amending former political code,subds.c,d and e.the same phrase is used in the current versions of section substitute employees,section probationary employees and section,subdivision b permanent employees.
world war ii created a shortage of qualified teachers for the public schools of california because of the entrance of men and women into the military service and war industry.stats,ch.the legislature responded by authorizing the issuance of emergency credentials.stats,ch,adding former school code.to prevent service under an emergency credential or war emergency credential from counting towards attaining classification as a permanent employee,a specific exclusion was enacted.stats,ch,enacting former,added as urgency measure by stats,ch.
the enactment of this exclusion was necessary only if the legislature believed that service under an emergency credential could include employment in position s requiring certification qualifications.no other exclusions affecting teachers with emergency credentials were enacted in particular,the legislature did not exclude teachers serving under an emergency credential from the provisions concerning classification as a probationary teacher and the dismissal of such a teacher stats,ch,adding former,or the minimum salary requirements for persons employed full time in a position requiring certification qualifications.stats,ch,adding former.the existence of the specific exclusion and the absence of an enactment excluding emergency credential holders from being classified as probationary employees implies the legislature intended teachers holding emergency credentials to be eligible for probationary classification and the benefits of that classification,except the benefit of counting that service towards attaining permanent status.
in,the legislature authorized the issuance of provisional credentials to give persons teaching under emergency credentials the opportunity to qualify for regular credentials.the minimum standard for a provisional general elementary credential was a valid emergency general elementary credential,two years successful experience as a teacher under an emergency general elementary credential,the completion of at least semester units of college work with a c or better average,and any other requirements prescribed by the state board of education.stats,ch,adding former.paralleling the provisions of former section then in effect governing emergency credentials,the legislature enacted former section which stated that service under a provisional credential did not count toward attaining permanent classification stats,ch,adding former.but the legislature did not exclude teachers serving under a provisional credential from the provisions governing the classification of teachers as probationary and protecting probationary teachers from unauthorized dismissal or the provisions governing minimum salary.stats,ch,adding former.as with the wording and structure of the provisions concerning emergency credentials,the wording and structure of the provisions concerning provisional credentials imply the holder of a provisional credential was eligible for probationary classification.
the foregoing implications of legislative intent were strengthened in when the legislature amended the minimum pay provisions and set a separate minimum annual salary for persons employed full time in a position requiring certification qualifications and serving under other than an emergency credential or provisional credential.stats,ch,adding former.these amendments are further recognition by the legislature that teachers serving under an emergency credential or provisional credential were subject to the rules generally applicable to teachers employed in positions requiring certification qualifications,unless a specific exclusion was enacted.again,no provision was enacted to exclude teachers serving under an emergency or provisional credential from classification as a probationary teacher or from benefiting from the restrictions on dismissal of probationary teachers.
in,the legislature repealed former sections,and concerning minimum standards for provisional and emergency credentials.stats,ch.in their place,the legislature enacted former sections,and.those sections only authorized the issuance of provisional credentials in accordance with regulations adopted by the state board of education and empowered it to prescribe the minimum standards for such credentials.stats,ch.no authorization was given for emergency credentials.
historical development of statutory framework after.
in,the legislature reenacted the education code.the sections authorizing the issuance of provisional credentials,former sections,and,became former sections,and.stats,ch,enacting former,and.the history of the legislation concerning provisional credentials and the change in nomenclature to emergency credentials and then emergency permits,which took place from through the enactment of section,is set forth in california teachers association commission on teacher credentialing th,d,and will not be detailed here.
the statutory language requiring school districts to classify as probationary employees,those persons employed in positions requiring certification qualifications for the school year,who have not been classified as permanent employees or as substitute employees was not altered by the legislation and remains intact today as section.see stats,ch,enacting former stats,ch,enacting former.
after,while the provisions concerning emergency credentials and provisional credentials were often the subject of legislative action and the language concerning the classification of employees as probationary was not changed,the exclusion of service by teachers holding provisional credentials from the general rule of counting service towards attaining a permanent classification was amended once.under the education code of,former section was repeated without change as former section.stats,ch,adding former.the language of former section became the first paragraph of section.a second paragraph was added in stats,ch,and section now reads in full 
service by a person under a provisional credential shall not be included in computing the service required as a prerequisite to attainment of,or eligibility to,classification as a permanent employee of a school district.
this section shall not be applicable to teachers granted a emergency credential under the conditions specified in subdivision b of section and subdivision h of section.
the term provisional credentials as used in section was construed recently to include emergency permits and,as a result,the first paragraph of section was held to exclude the service of a teacher holding an emergency permit from counting in computing the teacher progress towards permanent status.summerfield,supra,th at,d.as stated above,this exclusion in section would not be necessary unless service by teachers with emergency permits was otherwise eligible to be counted towards permanent status.because only service as a probationary employee counts towards permanent status,subd.b,the existence of the exclusion in section implies that teachers with emergency permits can be classified as probationary employees.
the enactment of the second paragraph of section also implies the legislature intended teachers with emergency permits to be eligible for classification as probationary employees.the second paragraph contains an exception to the exclusion set forth in the first paragraph of section.the first district concluded the exception applies only to service by teachers credentialed in another state who are serving under an emergency credential pending completion of a basic skills proficiency test.summerfield,supra,th at,d.the net effect of the exception to the exclusion is to place teachers within the scope of the exception back under the general rule of section concerning counting service towards attaining permanent status.the exception does not set forth a positive rule rather it is stated as an exclusion to the exclusion.thus,teachers within the scope of the ex
