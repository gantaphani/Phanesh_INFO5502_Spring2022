in this case of first impression,we are asked to decide if a student outstanding tuition balance at the university he was attending can be discharged in bankruptcy.rajesh mehta initiated a bankruptcy proceeding in which he attempted to discharge tuition and fees he owed to boston university.the university opposed discharge arguing that the outstanding balance of mehta tuition and fees constituted either a loan or a debt for an educational benefit under a,and was therefore not dischargeable in bankruptcy.the district court entered partial summary judgment for mehta and against the university,and this appeal followed for the reasons that follow,we will affirm 
background.
rajesh mehta attended boston university hereinafter referred to as bu from the fall semester through the end of the fall semester.he received federally guaranteed student loans for the fall and spring semesters.however,his loan application for the fall semester was denied,and he failed to secure any other financial assistance for that semester.nevertheless,bu allowed mehta to register and continue taking classes.mehta completed the semester,and received academic credit for three classes.as a result,he incurred charges for delinquent tuition and related costs totaling.that amount subsequently increased to when interest and late fees were added.mehta eventually filed a petition for voluntary bankruptcy under chapter without satisfying his obligation to bu,and his petition listed bu as a general unsecured creditor in the amount of he subsequently filed an adversary complaint with the bankruptcy court to determine the dischargeability of his obligation to bu.

ii.discussion.
provides in relevant part 
a a discharge under section,a,b or b of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt 
for an educational benefit overpayment or loan made,insured or guaranteed by a governmental unit,or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution,or for an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit,scholarship or stipend,unless excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph will impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents 
we look to the text of a statute to determine congressional intent,and look to legislative history only if the text is ambiguous.new rock asset partners,preferred entity advancements,cir.where statutory language is plain and unambiguous,the sole function of the court is to enforce it according to its terms.id.at quoting united states ron pair,d.plain meaning is therefore conclusive,except in the rare cases in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.id.
congress did not define loan in,and courts that have been called upon to interpret that provision have not agreed upon its meaning.bu urges us to broadly interpret the statute and thus declare that mehta debt constitutes a loan or a debt for an educational benefit that is not dischargeable in bankruptcy.mehta of course disagrees.he argues for a narrow interpretation consistent with the remedial purpose of bankruptcy.
courts have long recognized that bankruptcy is intended to relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness and permit him to start afresh.in re renshaw,cir quoting williams fidelity guar.however,bankruptcy is not only an ameliorative right of the debtor it is also a remedy of the creditor.matter of marchiando,cir.accordingly,although bankruptcy is concerned with giving honest debtors a new beginning,there are circumstances where giving a debtor a fresh start in life is not the paramount concern and protection of the creditor becomes more important.renshaw,at.thus,the law does not allow debtors to escape all financial obligations by declaring bankruptcy.however,in large part because of bankruptcy underlying concern for affording a new beginning,statutory exceptions to discharge are generally construed narrowly against the creditor and in favor of the debtor.in re pelkowski,cir.the creditor opposing discharge therefore has the burden of establishing that an obligation is not dischargeable.grogan garner,d.
these conflicting policy considerations have created a certain tension that is reflected in the exclusions contained in s and the legislative history of the bankruptcy code.that history has been detailed in in re johnson,cir,and outlined in renshaw.accordingly,we will only touch upon it here.

when congress established the guaranteed student loan program under the higher education act of,it sought to increase the availability of low interest,federally guaranteed loans in order to make higher education more affordable for a greater number of qualified students,reprinted in.however,the bankruptcy reform act of,a,placed restrictions on students ability to discharge these loans in bankruptcy because congress was concerned about reported abuses of students who obtained the benefits of higher education while avoiding repaying student loans by declaring bankruptcy shortly after graduation.subsequent amendments expanded the scope of the statute to its current form.
prior to the reform act of,loans were fully dischargeable in bankruptcy.the law provided as follows upon default by the student borrower on any loan covered by federal loan insurance the insurance beneficiary shall promptly notify the commissioner,and the commissioner shall pay to the beneficiary the amount of the loss sustained by the insured.higher education act of,a,stat,amended.thus,the statute required the federal government to repay the educational institution if the student defaulted.a congressional commission subsequently recommended prohibiting discharge of educational obligations for the first five years after graduation unless the student faced undue hardship.see report of the commission on the bankruptcy laws of the united states,doc,at pts.in,congress passed of the education amendments of,which added a limited nondischargeability provision.see education amendments of,a,stat,codified at repealed.section was repealed in,and a the current effect on october,
is mehta tuition debt a loan 
bu contends that mehta tuition debt arose from an extension of credit for educational services,and that it is therefore tantamount to an educational loan that is excluded from discharge in bankruptcy under a.the university rests this argument in large part upon various provisions of its student accounting services department handbook.that booklet is referred to as the guide,and it is apparently given to all bu students upon registration or enrollment.bu notes that the guide states that b y registering for any class in the university,each student accepts and agrees to be bound by certain university regulations and policies.brackets in original.appellant br.at.these regulations and policies include each student obligation to pay all applicable fees and charges,including tuition accordingly,bu argues when mehta registered for class at bu a contract was formed whereby mehta agreed to pay a defined quantity of money in exchange for a defined set of services,credits.appellant br.at.bu allowed mehta to attend classes during the fall semester without first paying tuition,and bu claims that the parties to the resulting agreement therefore clearly understood that bu was extending a loan to mehta in the amount of the fall tuition,and that both bu and mehta intended that result.however,the court of appeals for the second circuit rejected an analogous argument in renshaw,and we find that court analysis persuasive.
