this appeal concerns the constitutionality of a california statute that limits a physician from advertising that he or she is board certified in a medical speciality unless the certifying board or association meets certain requirements.the american academy of pain management the academy and two of its member doctors,arnold fox,and elliot cole,collectively the plaintiffs brought this action for injunctive relief under against ronald joseph in his official capacity as the executive director of the medical board of california the defendant.the plaintiffs contended that the statute and regulations implementing the statute constitute an impermissible regulation of commercial speech in violation of the first amendment that the statute and regulations are vague and over broad that the statute and the regulations deprive the members of the academy of their first amendment right to free association and that the action of the medical board of california in applying the statute denied the plaintiffs due process.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendant,and we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
california business and professions code generally proscribes false and misleading advertising by health care professionals licensed by the state.section h b specifically regulates the advertising of physicians and surgeons.it permits them to indicate fields of specialization,but prohibits them from representing that they are board certified unless the certifying organization is a member board of the american board of medical specialties abms,has requirements equivalent to those of the abms,as determined by the medical board of california,or has a postgraduate training program approved by the accreditation council for graduate medical education accreditation council that provides complete training in the designated specialty.see id.at h b.the statute specifies that a physician or surgeon licensed under chapter by the medical board of california who is certified by an organization other than a board or association in one of the three categories shall not use the term board certified in reference to that certification unless he or she is also licensed under chapter.id those physicians and surgeons allowed to advertise that they are board certified must state the full name of the certifying organization,giving it comparable prominence with the term board certified.id.
section h b authorized the medical board of california to adopt regulations to administer the section.see id.these regulations are contained in title of the california code of regulations.they specify both the criteria that the medical board of california will use to determine whether a certifying organization possesses requirements equivalent to those of the abms and the procedures that govern applications for an equivalency determination by the medical board of california.see regs.the regulations came into effect on february.see id.certifying organizations had three years from this effective date to demonstrate their equivalency.id.at b c.

the academy is a organization,incorporated in,involved in developing standards enhancing education and issuing credentials for pain practitioners.those disciplines include dentists,physicians,nurse anesthesiologists,psychologists,athletic trainers,chiropractors,counselors,social workers,physical therapists and practitioners of oriental medicine.on april,the academy filed an application with the medical board of california,as the licensing board for physicians and surgeons,for recognition of the academy right to advertise by using the words board certified.plaintiff er at.the medical board of california hired william hamilton as a consultant to review the academy application and issue a report comparing the academy standards for certification with those of the abms to determine if they were equivalent.
hamilton concluded that the academy fell far short of equivalency.the academy does not require its members to have any formal postgraduate training,but instead requires only two years of experience working with patients having pain.the academy examination consists of multiple choice questions and takes approximately two hours to complete.the medical board of california regulations require that the examinations of certifying organizations be a minimum of sixteen hours in length,which is the examination requirement of abms.see regs.b.moreover,hamilton found that,as of march of,more than eighty percent of the academy members had not taken the exam,but had been grandfathered into the academy.
on february,the medical board of california denied the academy application for equivalency status.by this time,the plaintiffs had filed a section suit in federal district court on december,alleging that section h b violated their first amendment rights.the complaint stated that the two individual plaintiffs,fox and cole,had advertised by way of letterhead that each is board certified by the academy.shortly before the end of the grace period provided by the regulations,the plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order barring the medical board of california from enforcing section h b.the district court issued the temporary restraining order after an expedited hearing conducted the day before the grace period ended.subsequently,the court dissolved the temporary restraining order and denied the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.the plaintiffs appealed the decision to this court,which held that the district court had not abused its discretion in denying the preliminary injunction.
both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the defendant summary judgment motion on the plaintiffs claim that section h b and its implementing regulations,on their face,violate the first amendment guarantee of free speech,section h b and its implementing regulations,as applied to them,violate their rights to free speech,and plaintiffs procedural due process rights were violated.subsequently,both parties moved for summary judgment on the plaintiffs remaining claims.the district court granted the defendant motion and denied the plaintiffs,ruling that section h b and its implementing regulations are not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague and do not violate the plaintiffs rights to free association.the district court then entered final judgment.the plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.the plaintiffs appeal all of the district court rulings except the court dismissal of their free speech claim.the district court had jurisdiction under and a.we have appellate jurisdiction under.this court reviews de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.delta savings bank united states,cir.the district court rulings on the constitutionality of the california statute and the implementing regulations are subject to de novo review.chamber of commerce argenbright,cir.
regulation of commercial speech.
the california statute in issue in this case is h b of the california business and professions code.this section regulates the permissible advertising of a physician or surgeon.it provides that 
a physician or surgeon may include a statement that he or she limits his or her practice to specific fields,but shall not include a statement that he or she is certified or eligible for certification by a private or public board or parent association,including but not limited to,a multidisciplinary board or association,unless that board or association is i an american board of medical specialities board member ii a board or association with equivalent requirements approved by that physician and surgeon licensing board or iii a board or association with an accreditation council for graduate medical education approved postgraduate training program that provides complete training in that specialty or subspecialty.a physician and surgeon who is certified by an organization other than a board or association referred to in clause i,ii,or iii shall not use the term board certified in reference to that certification a physician and surgeon who is certified by a board or association referred to in clause i,ii,or iii shall not use the term board certified unless the full name of the certifying board is also used and given comparable prominence with the term board certified in the statements for the purposes of the term board certified,as used in this subparagraph,the terms board and association mean an organization that is an american board of medical specialties member board,an organization with equivalent requirements approved by a physician and surgeon licensing board,or an organization with an accreditation council for graduate medical education approved postgraduate training program that provides complete training in a specialty or subspecialty 
the defendant in the district court and on appeal contends that the essence of the statute is to regulate the use of the term board certified or its equivalent.the defendant emphasizes throughout his brief on appeal that it is only the use of the term board certified or its equivalent that the medical board of california or the california attorney general office seeks to protect.it is apparent from the statute itself that the term board certified is what is sought to be protected.a physician or surgeon who is certified by an organization other than a board or association referred to in clause i,ii,or iii shall not use the term board certified in reference to that certification the statute also provides a physician and surgeon who is certified by a board or association referred to in clause i,ii,or iii shall not use the term board certified unless the full name of the certifying board is also used and given comparable prominence with the term board certified in the statement.
board certification is a term of art that the abms popularized among physicians and has come to designate a certain level of qualification.this specialized meaning was emphasized in numerous affidavits that were filed with the district court.this was also recognized by the supreme court in peel attorney registration disciplinary commission of illinois,d,where the court stated,
board certification of specialists in various branches of medicine,handled by the member boards of the american board of medical specialties is based on various requirements of education,residency,examinations and evaluations the average member of the public does not know or necessarily understand these requirements,but board certification nevertheless has come to be regarded as evidence of skill and proficiency of those to whom they have been issued.american board of medical specialties,evaluating the skills of medical specialities lloyd and langsley eds.
the term board certification is also given a recognized meaning by the national committee on quality assurance,which accredits health maintenance organizations in the united states.defendant er at.similarly,the term is given recognized meaning by the joint commission on accreditation of health care organizations,which accredits hospitals and other health care facilities in the united states.id.at.thus,the term that the medical board of california and the california attorney general seek to protect,board certified,is a term with an established meaning connoting a high level of specialized skill and proficiency as noted earlier,the application of the academy was to recognize its right to advertise by using the words board certified and advertisements of the individual plaintiffs was that they were board certified by the academy.
the staff of the medical board of california,after presenting its detailed analysis of the academy application,concluded that the action to be taken was one of the following 
vote to approve the academy as equivalent to an abms board,which will allow its members to advertise that they are board certified.
vote to disapprove the academy as equivalent to an abms board,which will prevent its members from advertising board certification.

as stated in the defendant brief 
business and professions code section h and the board regulation place no general restrictions on plaintiffs member right to advertise their membership in the academy.nor does it prohibit their opportunity to advertise that they specialize in the field of pain management,or that they hold any other status with the academy.plaintiffs members simply can not use the term board certified.
defendant brief at.
is this commercial speech 
the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in holding that section h b and its implementing regulations regulate only commercial speech.they further assert that as a result the district court considered the statute and regulations under an unduly deferential standard of review,the intermediate scrutiny governing commercial speech.
commercial speech represents expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience,central hudson gas pub.serv.comm n,d,and does no more than propose a commercial transaction.state bd.of pharmacy.citizens consumer council,d see also lorillard tobacco reilly,d applying the hudson analysis to tobacco advertising regulations.in bolger youngs drug products,d,the supreme court held that speech could properly be characterized as commercial when the speech is admittedly advertising,the speech references a specific product,and the speaker has an economic motive for engaging in the speech.bolger,at.see also ass of.advertisers,lungren,cir applying the bolger factors.
all three of the bolger factors are present in the speech that the california statute and regulations are designed to regulate.section h specifies what information licensed physicians and surgeons may include in their a dvertising.permissible advertising content includes the practitioner name,an office address and telephone number,hours of operation,foreign language ability,an approved board certification,insurance plans accepted,schools attended,publications authored,teaching positions held,hospital affiliations,fees charged,installment payments accepted,lawful images of the practitioner,the trade names of goods advertised,public health information,and other factual information that is not misleading.cal.bus.h.the statute thus identifies that the object of its regulation is advertising.the advertising regulated relates to a specific product,medical services.finally,the advertiser has an economic motive for engaging in this kind of speech,which is to solicit a patient base.accordingly,the district court correctly applied the standard of intermediate scrutiny that governs commercial speech.in re,d deeming a similar statute that specified ten permissible categories of information for lawyer advertisements was a regulation of commercial speech.
application of central hudson.
in regard to the permissible regulation of commercial speech,the supreme court in central hudson stated 
in commercial speech cases a analysis has developed.at the outset,we must determine whether the expression is protected by the first amendment.for commercial speech to come within that provision,it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.next,we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial.if both inquiries yield positive answers,we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted,and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.
central hudson,at.see also clear channel outdoor,city of los angeles,cir applying the hudson analysis.thus,the first inquiry is whether the speech is unlawful or misleading.if it is either,then the commercial speech is not protected at all by the first amendment.in refining the commercial speech doctrine,the supreme court has distinguished between inherently misleading speech and potentially misleading speech.see,at.when advertising is inherently likely to deceive or where the record indicates that a particular form or method of advertising has in fact been deceptive,the advertising enjoys no first amendment protection.id.the government may ban this type of commercial speech entirely without satisfying the remaining three central hudson factors.id.however,if the speech is only potentially misleading,in other words,if the information also may be presented in a way that is not deceptive,the speech regulation must satisfy the remaining three factors specified in central hudson.id.at.
unlawful or misleading.
the defendant contends that the commercial speech that section h b and its implementing regulations target is inherently misleading and may be restricted on that basis alone.the defendant further contends that because california has defined board certification,for the purposes of advertising,to mean a certification from an organization that satisfies particular standards,any advertisement of a board certification from an organization that does not meet the statutory criteria is inherently misleading.the defendant argument is that this advertising is inherently misleading because consumers will presume that the organization whose certification is advertised satisfies the california standards,when,in fact,it does not.
the plaintiffs disagree,relying principally on peel attorney registration disciplinary commission of,d.in peel,the supreme court held that an attorney advertisement that he was a certified civil trial specialist by the national board of trial advocacy was neither inherently nor actually misleading.id.at.the illinois supreme court had concluded that the attorney use of the term specialist was inherently misleading because it incorrectly implied that illinois had formally authorized certification of specialists in trial advocacy.id.at.the united states supreme court disagreed,concluding that it seems unlikely that petitioner statement about his certification as a specialist by an identified national organization necessarily would be confused with formal state recognition.id.at.in the peel case,however,the ban was absolute.the illinois bar rule did not allow an attorney to hold himself out as certified by any board as a specialist.it was an absolute ban.although the court held that this absolute ban was unconstitutional,it stated that 
to the extent that potentially misleading statements of private certification could confuse consumers,a state might consider screening certifying organizations or requiring a disclaimer about the certifying organization or the standards of speciality.
id.at.it was this screening process suggested in peel that the california legislature has adopted.this case differs from the situation addressed in peel,in that illinois completely banned any advertisement of certification by a board.california,on the other hand,permits advertising of board certification,provided that the certifying board meets the statutory qualifications.
the supreme court considered a similar case,ibanez florida department of business and professional regulation,d.the florida board of accountancy had disciplined a person who was practicing as a and an attorney for including on her stationery and in ads in the yellow pages cfp,the designation for certified financial planner.the florida board of accountancy disciplined her for violation of a board rule.the rule prohibited any advertisement that stated or implied that the licensee had received formal recognition as a specialist in any aspect of a practice of public accounting unless the recognizing agency was approved by the board of accountancy.the certified financial planner board of standards,which was the recognizing agency for the cfp designation,had not been approved by the board of accountancy.
the court held that the use of cfp was not actually or inherently misleading the ibanez case differs from the case at hand because the state had not set forth any statutory language establishing a screening process with specific standards as suggested in peel.furthermore,the discipline resulted from a board rule,not a statute,and the board had unguided discretion to ban any certifying organization 
the state of california has by statute given the term board certified a special and particular meaning.the use of that term in advertising by a board or individual physicians who do not meet the statutory requirements for doing so,is misleading.the advertisement represents to the physicians,hospitals,health care providers and the general public that the statutory standards have been met,when,in fact,they have not.
because the plaintiffs use of board certified is inherently misleading,it is not protected speech.but even if the plaintiffs use of board certified were merely potentially misleading,it would not change the result in this case,as consideration of the remaining three hudson factors confirms that the state may restrict the use of the term board certified in advertising.
does the defendant assert a substantial interest in restricting the speech 
the defendant states that section h b and its implementing regulations protect consumers.the defendant explains that advertisements of certifications from organizations are misleading because the public may assume that these organizations employ the same standards as abms member boards.based upon this erroneous assumption,consumers may mistakenly believe that the advertiser possesses the same level of training and qualification as physicians and surgeons.
there is no question that california has a substantial interest in protecting consumers from misleading advertising by medical professionals.see edenfield fane,d the state has a substantial interest in ensuring the accuracy of commercial information in the in re,at.the public comparative lack of knowledge,the limited ability of the professions to police themselves,and the absence of any standardization in the product renders advertising for professional services especially susceptible to abuses that the states have a legitimate interest in controlling.the supreme court has noted the special interest that states have in regulating professions 
we have little trouble crediting the bar interest as substantial.on various occasions we have accepted the proposition that states have a compelling interest in the practice of professions within their boundaries,and as part of their power to protect the public health,safety,and other valid interests they have broad power to establish standards for licensing practitioners and regulating the practice of professions.
bar went for it,d citations omitted.
does the defendant demonstrate that the regulation directly advances the asserted government interest 
the legislative history of section h b reveals that the intent of the legislation was to assure that the term board certified had a designated meaning upon which the medical community and the general public could rely.senator mccorquodale,who proposed the legislation,stated on the floor of the senate the objectives of the bill 
advertising one professional specialty has become a common means of promoting one medical practice in recent years.
while it would seem that a physician stated credentials would provide assurance to a prospective patient that this physician was trained and qualified to do the procedures stated in the ad,such is not the case.doctors who advertise as board certified can have authentic credentials,or they may claim credentials from a bogus board,and the unsuspecting consumer would have a very difficult time differentiating one from the other.a bogus board credential can be obtained by mail for a fee,or by taking a weekend course in the subject.
in order to provide more reliable assurance for the public,i have introduced sb.this bill would require truth in advertising regarding a physician specialty credentials.it would prohibit a physician from stating he or she is board certified unless the board certification is a board approved by the american board of medical specialties or a board with equivalent requirements approved by the medical board of california.this bill would serve to keep the public from being mislead,and would enhance the quality of care and safety afforded to patients.
sb is supported by ca medical,american college of emergency physicians,american society of maxillofacial surgeons,ca society of anesthesiologists,american board of nuclear medicine,american board of medical specialties,ca radiological society,california society of plastic surgeons.i ask for your aye vote.
defendant er at.
the adoption of the bill was contested and debated.the record contains a representative sample of the reasons advanced by the proponents of the bill.donald langsley,the executive of the abms wrote 
i write to support the february,senate bill introduced by senator mccorquodale and in particular,that section on page,lines through,which state that a physician and surgeon may state that he or she limits practice to specific fields but can only claim to be certified or eligible for certification by a specialty board if that board is either an abms member board or one with equivalent requirements approved by the state medical licensing board.
i hope that you will vote aye when the bill is heard in committee.this bill is important to the health and safety of all citizens.in this country,anyone can start a medical specialty board and there are of them which have not been accepted or approved by the american board of medical specialities or the american medical association.in other words,they are totally.the boards approved by the abms and ama have been authorized on the basis of the fact that they represent a recognized field of medical science and that post medical education of three to seven years plus passing a rigorous examination is required for certification.boards which can not meet these high standards can not be approved by the abms and ama.
at this time,of the nation physicians meet these high qualifications.unhappily,there are others who claim to be certified when in fact the certification is from one of the boards or totally lacking

joseph ross,president of the american board of nuclear medicine,wrote 
as president of the american board of nuclear medicine,one of the recognized certifying boards accredited by the american board of medical specialities and by the american medical association,i write to offer firm support for senator dan mccorquodale sb truth in advertising bill.i urge you to vote aye on this bill.
i am an emeritus professor of medicine at the ucla school of medicine and have worked for years attempting to provide adequate and excellent medical services to patients.at times i have experienced the great embarrassment of having seen patients grossly mismanaged and mishandled by physicians who are not properly qualified and who offer inadequate patient treatment 
it has become apparent that many physicians are attempting to influence prospective patients by indicating that they are board certified or board eligible.i emphasize that the boards which are honest and require of its physicians significant education,training,and evidence of qualifications,are limited to the boards which are recognized by the abms and the ama.it may interest you to know that there are boards.many of these merely require a fee payment and the filing of an application for certification.they in no way insure that the individual who then cites himself as board qualified or board certified has any competence to do what he is claiming to do.i can assure you that the requirements for the recognized and official certifying boards are the very highest.although they do not always guarantee that a physician can do everything that he claims,they are still the best indicator that a physician is properly qualified 
defendant er at.
the district court noted that 
the report by the assembly committee on health relative to sb describes the problem that the bill seeks to remedy.the report explains that,c urrently a physician who takes a weekend course can advertise themselves sic as board certified in that specialty.there is no quality control,and some patients have been severely hurt.they do not realize that sometimes a framed specialty certification could be the result of course.see weiner,exh.attached to mot.for separate trial,june.
the report also notes that,we have approximately a stack of articles,references,videos where patients have been fooled by a framed diploma board certification and seriously harmed by a physician performing a procedure that they were not certified to do.id.
after considering all the submissions and debates,the california bill was passed and it was signed into law by the governor it is apparent that in passing the bill the intent was to preserve the meaning of board certified by screening the standards of the boards that could issue the certification.the purpose was to enable the medical profession,health services,and the general public to rely on a term that represented a specified degree of postgraduate medical education and experience in evaluating the advertisements of physicians and surgeons.the legislation advances the governmental interest asserted.
is the restriction more extensive than necessary to serve the asserted governmental interest 
in considering the restriction imposed on commercial speech,we do not require that it be the least restrictive means available.bar,at.rather,what is required is a reasonable fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.id.the fit need not be perfect nor the single best to achieve those ends,but one whose scope is narrowly tailored to achieve the legislative objective.id.
in this case,the plaintiffs contend that the legislature could have chosen to require a disclaimer,the alternate suggestion in peel,as the least restrictive means.the court has generally said it is up to the legislature to choose between narrowly tailored means of regulating commercial speech.bd.of trs.fox,d.the legislation at issue in this case does not restrict a physician or surgeon from advertising that he or she had special training or continuing education with a board.instead,it restricts the use of the term board certified to signify certification by boards that meet the statutory qualifications.in the situation of the academy,a physician or surgeon can advertise his or her membership in the academy or special education received,but simply can not use the term board certified or its equivalent.
the academy stated the levels of certification it awards in its required application diplomate,which requires a doctorate degree in a related health care field and two years experience working with individuals suffering pain fellow,which requires a masters degree and the same two years of experience clinical associate,which requires a bachelors degree and five years of such experience.the defendant acknowledges that a physician or surgeon could advertise that he or she is a diplomate of the academy in pain management,but could not use the term board certified.the california legislation,even if not the least restrictive restriction,is a reasonable fit between the legislature ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends.
are the statute and its implementing regulations overbroad or vague 
although the supreme court has stated that the overbreadth doctrine does not apply to regulations of purely commercial speech,village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d,an overbreadth challenge to a statute or regulation that reaches beyond purely commercial speech to encompass fully protected speech is appropriate,county of clark,cir.
the plaintiffs argue that section h b and its implementing regulations reach fully protected speech.the statute and regulations,however,apply only to commercial speech.accordingly,the plaintiffs overbreadth challenge fails.see ohralik ohio state bar ass n,d stating that the could not raise a successful overbreadth challenge to a bar rule regulating commercial solicitation bates state bar of arizona,d declining to apply the overbreadth doctrine to a regulation of professional advertising.
with regard to vagueness,the statute and regulations are clear that in order to advertise the term board certified,the certifying organization must qualify by abms designation have standards equivalent to the abms or approval of the board required postgraduate education by the accrediting council for graduate medical education.these standards are and are not vague.
do the statute and implementing regulations deprive the academy
