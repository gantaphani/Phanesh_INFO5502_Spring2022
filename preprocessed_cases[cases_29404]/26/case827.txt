background 
wigg,currently a second and teacher at laura anderson elementary school anderson elementary,has worked in the school district at five different elementary schools since.the staff at anderson elementary maintains regular hours each school day from to.some teachers,including wigg,often arrive earlier than and stay later than throughout her employment,wigg has been active with children after school hours.for example,she has participated in girl scouts and has taught private guitar and reading lessons.
the good news club the club is an organization sponsored by child evangelism fellowship.to participate in the club,a child must provide a signed permission slip from a parent.according to the club literature,its purpose is to evangelize boys and girls with the gospel of the lord jesus christ and establish disciple them in the word of god and in the local church for christian living.
sfsd maintains two pertinent policy provisions.first,sfsd follows a community use of school facilities policy use policy that allows both and groups,as well as community organizations such as churches,organizations,and youth groups,to use its facilities.the purpose of the use policy is to foster community involvement.sfsd requires only that applicants verify that they are organizations and that they have liability insurance.second,sfsd maintains a religion in the schools and at school activities policy religion policy that prohibits all sfsd personnel from participating in religious activities on school grounds or at activities.the prohibition,however,does not apply when the organization has leased the facility according to the lease provision in the use policy.sfsd interprets this lease provision to apply only to temporary leases to a church seeking a permanent location.
in october,the club requested access to sfsd facilities to hold its meetings.sfsd granted the request,and the club currently meets at five elementary schools within sfsd,including anderson elementary.the club meets at anderson elementary from to at the end of the school day.wigg attended the club first meeting in anderson elementary library on december.nine students attended that meeting,including some from wigg combined class.at the meeting,the students played a game,learned a bible verse,and heard a christian story.
after the meeting,a staff member questioned whether wigg could teach religion in the building.noting staff use of the library at the end of the workday,the staff member expressed her concern to anderson elementary principal mary peterson over wigg teaching the club in the library.subsequently,peterson informed wigg that she could not participate in the club meetings which were held on school grounds because of sfsd concern that her participation in the organization might be perceived as an establishment of religion.since that time,wigg has not participated in the club meetings in any school within the district.
following her exchange with peterson,wigg sent a letter to keegan asking for permission to participate in the club.she informed keegan that the club requires every participating student to obtain a parental permission slip.the letter also suggested language for a disclaimer that would explain that any school district employees participating in the club were acting as private citizens and did not represent sfsd in any manner.on january,sfsd affirmed its decision not to permit wigg to participate because the school feared that allowing wigg to participate in the club would present establishment clause issues for sfsd.
wigg sent a second letter to sfsd on january,again asking that sfsd allow her to participate in the club meetings.she based her request on sfsd religion policy.she claimed in the letter that sfsd should allow her to participate in the meetings if the club leased its facilities in accordance with the use policy.sfsd again denied wigg request and explained that the religion policy addressed situations in which sfsd allowed a church to lease space in the event that the church was in the process of constructing or own facilities.sfsd noted that it included the provision in the religion policy to allow sfsd personnel to attend church services if their church leased facilities from sfsd.sfsd reaffirmed its position that wigg would violate the religion policy if she participated in the club meetings.
wigg filed her complaint on february,alleging that sfsd religion policy violated her constitutional rights.the district court denied wigg request for a preliminary injunction,and sfsd then filed a motion for summary judgment on wigg motion for permanent injunction and declaratory judgment.sfsd later filed motions to strike a demand for jury trial and to strike wigg errata sheet.
on july,the district court issued its decision granting in part and denying in part sfsd motion for summary judgment as well as wigg claims for permanent injunction and declaratory relief.the district court concluded that while sfsd could constitutionally prohibit wigg from participating in the club at anderson elementary,sfsd prohibition against wigg participation in the club at other schools was unconstitutional.the district court granted sfsd motions to strike wigg demand for a jury trial and wigg errata sheet.the district court denied sfsd motion to stay the permanent injunction on august.
sfsd timely appealed,arguing that while the district court correctly held that sfsd could prohibit wigg from participating in the club at anderson elementary,it erred in permanently enjoining sfsd from enforcing its policy prohibiting wigg from actively participating in the club at other schools within the district.wigg timely,arguing that the district court correctly determined that wigg could participate in the club at other schools within the district,but erred in ruling that sfsd could prevent wigg from participating in the club at anderson elementary 
ii.analysis 
both wigg and sfsd argue that the district court erred in deciding the substantive first amendment issues in this case.the arguments highlight the considerable tension among the clauses of the first when an issue arises in a public school setting.does a school concern for avoiding accusations of establishment of religion justify inhibiting the free speech and association rights of employees after work hours when the relevant activity takes place on school property in this case,we do not believe so.
