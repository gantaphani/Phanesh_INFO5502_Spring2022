appellants sonya renee,et,appeal the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of appellees department of education and arne duncan,secretary of education collectively,the secretary.appellants object to the secretary regulation permitting teachers participating in alternative route programs to be considered highly qualified under the no child left behind act nclb.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we vacate the district court order because appellants lack standing.
factual and procedural background 
overview of the no child left behind act 
since,nclb has served as the current version of the elementary and secondary education act,first enacted in,which provides the basis for federal education policy.the overarching goal of nclb is to ensure that all children have a fair,equal,and significant opportunity to obtain a education and reach,at a minimum,proficiency on challenging state academic achievement standards and state academic assessments.nclb also aims to close the achievement gap between high and children,especially the achievement gaps between minority and nonminority students,and between disadvantaged children and their more advantaged peers.id.although the standard of proficiency is determined by each state,nclb mandates that the state deliver to all of its children the resources to meet that standard.id.b a,b.the secretary is vested with the authority to enforce nclb and may withhold funds or take other enforcement action if a state fails to comply substantially with the act requirements.id.however,each state is responsible for ensuring the compliance of its local school districts.id,a.
nclb distributes funds to states and schools under two sections relevant to this appeal.title i funds are used to supplement the educational needs of students.id.et.title ii funds are used to increas e the number of highly qualified teachers in the classroom.id.
ii.nclb teacher qualifications 
the secretary has stated that an essential component of academic achievement and accountability is that students be taught by highly qualified teachers.letter from margaret spellings to chief state school officers,available at.t eacher quality is one of the most important factors in improving student achievement and eliminating these achievement gaps.id.
congress provided that,by the end of the academic year,only highly qualified teachers hqt would instruct core academic classes in states receiving federal funding the hqt requirement.a a to ensure that states and districts are on track to meet the hqt requirement,nclb also required that,beginning with the school year,new hires be highly qualified.id.a.it is undisputed that,to date,some of california school districts have not met the hqt requirement.
states and school districts must develop plans to meet these mandates.id.a,b c,a state plans id.b n,c i,a local plans.where states and districts do not meet the hqt requirement,nclb mandates that poor and minority children not be taught by inexperienced,unqualified,or teachers at higher rates than other children.id.b c.
nclb also contains several reporting requirements.states and school districts are required to report annually accurate information regarding their progress towards meeting the hqt requirement.id.h c viii,h,b a.states must also provide this information to the secretary,id.h g,b b,who then reports to congress the nationwide statistics on highly qualified teachers,id.h.additionally,schools receiving title i funds must inform a parent when a teaches his or her child for more than four weeks.id.h b ii.
nclb definition of highly qualified 
in addition to requiring that all hqts have a and competence in their subject matter,congress defined highly qualified to mean that 
i the teacher has obtained full state certification as a teacher including certification obtained through alternative routes to certification or passed the state teacher licensing examination,and holds a license to teach in such state,except that when used with respect to any teacher teaching in a public charter school,the term means that the teacher meets the requirements set forth in the state public charter school law and 
ii the teacher has not had certification or licensure requirements waived on an emergency,temporary,or provisional basis.
a emphasis added.nclb does not define the term full state certification.
b.the secretary regulation 
on december,the secretary issued final regulations defining the term highly qualified.the regulation at issue states that a teacher can be highly qualified under nclb if the teacher i s participating in an alternative route to certification program,id.a ii,and demonstrates satisfactory progress toward full certification as prescribed by the state,id.a ii the regulation.the regulation,like,has other requirements which are not at issue here.
iii.california education law 
credentials 
in california,a fully certified teacher may work in almost any school district for an extended period of time.california commission on teacher credentialing,multiple subject teaching credential,requirements for teachers prepared in california leaflet no,available at.gov credentials leaflets.html.there are two levels of full state certification depending on years of experience.see cal.a teacher who completes the preparation requirements initially receives a preliminary credential,cal.a,which is valid for five years,id.b.these preparation requirements include,inter alia,s atisfactory completion of a program of professional preparation,id.b,which includes i nternship programs,id.b c,or completion of a more traditional program where teaching,training,and education are combined,id.b a,b.a teacher receives the same preliminary credential regardless of the program of professional preparation.id.a.after two years of teaching with the preliminary credential,a teacher may receive the clear credential,id.c,which is valid for five years but may be renewed,id.b.
below the full credentials are a series of subordinate credentials.see,reg,at cal teachers in internships receive systematic support and training as they advance toward full certification,available at.pdf bakersfield teachers bakersfield city sch,th,d,observing that interns have something less than a regular credential.the intern credential,for example,permits individuals who have not completed their alternative teacher preparation program are participating in their programs to teach only in a single school district,cal,and only for a period of two years,id.b.indeed,california law requires that districts hire preliminary or clear credential holders whenever they are available ahead of intern credential holders.see cal.a,e.
california nclb implementing regulations 
california has promulgated highly qualified teacher regulations in order to implement nclb.under california law,a teacher who meets nclb requirements at the middle or secondary levels is one who i s currently enrolled in an approved intern program for less than three years or has a full credential.regs.tit,
iv.proceedings below 
in august of,california public school students and their parents,joined by two california community an administrative procedure act apa challenge in the district court for the northern district of california against the secretary,alleging that the regulation is inconsistent with nclb,and requesting declaratory and injunctive relief.appellants allege that they have been harmed by the regulation because,in the years since the regulation was issued,california and its school districts have hired thousands of alternative route participants,allowed these teachers to be concentrated in and minority areas,and treated the teachers as highly qualified for reporting and parental notification purposes.
both parties moved for summary judgment,and,on june,the district court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of the secretary.a timely appeal followed.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.ctr.for biological diversity fish wildlife,cir.the agency interpretation of a statute is a question of law reviewed de novo.forest conservation council rosboro lumber,cir.
for the first time on appeal,the secretary argues that appellants injury is not redressable,and therefore,appellants lack constitutional standing a challenge to constitutional standing,however,may be raised any time and must be considered.see laub dep t of interior,cir.
appellants argue that the secretary regulation of the states,in this case california,has harmed them.under of the apa,a person suffering legal wrong because of agency action,or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,is entitled to judicial review thereof.to establish standing to sue under the apa,appellants must first meet the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing which contains three elements injury in fact causation and likelihood that a favorable decision will redress the injury.iv.united states,cir quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.appellants,as the parties invoking federal jurisdiction,bear the burden of establishing these elements.lujan,at.
a plaintiff meets the redressability test if it is likely not certain that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.internal quotations omitted bonnichsen united states,cir.although a purely speculative favorable outcome will not suffice,rubin city of santa monica,cir internal quotation omitted,p laintiffs need not demonstrate that there is a guarantee that their injuries will be redressed by a favorable decision,graham fed.emergency mgmt.agency,cir see also utah evans,d redressability met where change in a legal status results in a significant increase in the likelihood that plaintiff would obtain relief.
if a plaintiff is an object of the challenged action or forgone action there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury,and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.lujan,at.when,however,as in this case,a plaintiff asserted injury arises from the government allegedly unlawful regulation or lack of regulation of someone else,much more is needed.id.at.as the supreme court has stated 
in that circumstance,causation and redressability ordinarily hinge on the response of the regulated or regulable third party to the government action or perhaps on the response of others as well.the existence of one or more of the essential elements of standing depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts can not presume either to control or to predict,and it becomes the burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing that those choices have been or will be made in such manner as to produce causation and permit redressability of injury.thus,when the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges,standing is not precluded,but it is ordinarily substantially more difficult to establish.
id.internal quotations and citation omitted.
appellants argue that a declaration stating that the alternative route regulation is unlawful and void,would likely cause california to cease treating alternative route participants as highly qualified.both parties agree that whether alternative route participants hold full state certification as a teacher including certification obtained through alternative routes to certification is a matter of state law.a i.thus,redressability turns on whether,absent the regulation,california would consider teachers participating in alternative routes to be fully certified 
although it seems likely that california treats interns and other alternative program participants differently from fully credentialed teachers,like those holding preliminary and clear credentials,this does not end the redressability inquiry.the problem here is that because the meaning of full certification is a matter of state law,california could still determine,as it has already,that teachers participating in alternative routes to certification were highly qualified even if the federal regulation was declared void.see bennett spear,d i t does not suffice if the injury complained of is the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.internal quotations omitted lujan,at.finding redressability lacking because even if the court ordered government to revise the challenged regulation,this would not remedy respondents alleged injury because the third parties affected by the regulation were unlikely to be bound by it.in other words,california could continue to adhere to regs.tit,which state that a teacher currently enrolled in an approved intern program meets nclb requirements.
we acknowledge that injury produced by determinative or coercive effect upon the action of someone else may be sufficient for standing.bennett,at.tozzi dep t of health and human,when the alleged injury flows not directly from the challenged agency action,but rather from independent actions of third parties,we have required only a showing that the agency action is at least a substantial factor motivating the third parties actions.internal quotations marks omitted.
appellants argue that if the regulation is voided,california will be obligated to change its regulations accordingly.in other words,alternative route participants may no longer be highly qualified under california law.as an initial matter,because california is not party to this suit,and has therefore not offered its views,this court may only speculate what,if anything,california would do 
it is true that,even after acknowledging the regulation effect of considering participants in alternative programs as highly qualified teachers,california maintains a distinction between participants and teachers with full credentials.see regs.tit.a teacher who meets nclb requirements is one who either is currently enrolled in an approved intern program for less than three years or has a full credential.emphasis added.it is also true that california changed its laws to comply with nclb and its implementing regulations so that interns could be considered highly qualified and meet nclb requirements.see id,cal.f requiring commission on teacher credentialing to ensure that each district internship program provides program elements to its interns as required by the federal nclb and the implementing regulations.appellants argue that because california changed its laws to comply with nclb and the secretary regulations once,it will do so again if the regulation is revoked.
however,appellants cite no other evidence that california will follow the secretary lead if the regulation is voided.beyond the fact that california changed its state regulation to adhere to the secretary regulation one time,there is simply no evidence that the revocation of the regulation would have a coercive effect upon california.although appellants state that california would be obligated to comply because it receives federal funding,congress has made it clear that the secretary may not tie federal funding to certification standards.see a n o funds available to the department or otherwise available under this chapter may be used for any purpose relating to a mandatory nationwide test or certification of teachers or education paraprofessionals.id.b the secretary is prohibited from withholding funds from any state educational agency or local educational agency if the state educational agency or local educational agency fails to adopt a specific method of teacher or paraprofessional certification.because it is undisputed that the interpretation of full state certification is a matter of state law,and that,therefore,a state can essentially decide what constitutes a highly qualified teacher,it is unlikely that the revocation of the regulation will have a coercive effect upon california.instead,appellants injury is likely the result of california independent action who is not before the court.bennett,at.internal quotations omitted.accordingly,appellants have failed to meet their burden of establishing redressability 
appellants rely heavily on bennett,but that case is inapposite.in bennett,plaintiffs challenged a biological opinion produced by the fish wildlife service fws and promulgated pursuant to the enda
