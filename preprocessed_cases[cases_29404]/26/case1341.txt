this appeal has been taken from the trial court ruling that sustained defendants demurrer to all the causes of action of plaintiffs complaint and dismissed the action.we find that plaintiffs can not properly state a cause of action for breach of contract,and defendants have public entity immunity from the remaining noncontractual causes of action.we therefore affirm the judgment.
statement of facts and procedural history 
plaintiffs in the present action are school districts that invested money in the san mateo pooled investment fund the pool,managed and operated by defendants san mateo county the county and former county treasurer lee buffington.a portion of the pool was invested by defendants in nine notes issued by lehman brothers holdings,lehman.when lehman declared bankruptcy in september of,the pool lost approximately million,plaintiffs share of which was approximately million.
after plaintiffs and defendants engaged in unsuccessful settlement discussions,and defendants rejected plaintiffs formal written notice of tort claim,plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants on january.defendants demurrer to the complaint was sustained with leave to amend.
plaintiffs subsequently filed the pleading at issue here,the first amended complaint the complaint,which included causes of action for breach of contract,statutory violations of the prudent investor standards,violations of the statutory maximum securities maturity limits,and violations of the county investment policies.defendants again demurred to the complaint on grounds that plaintiffs failed to timely file a tort claim,immunity from liability for alleged statutory violations,and failure to properly allege a cause of action for breach of contract.following a hearing the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court found that plaintiffs failed to plead a cause of action for breach of contract,and defendants were immune from liability pursuant to government code sections and.this appeal followed entry of judgment in favor of defendants.
discussion 
plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred by sustaining defendants demurrer without leave to amend.they claim that the county and buffington are not immune from liability for violations of the mandatory prudent investor standard or the statutory maturity limits requirements.plaintiffs also assert that they have properly pled a cause of action for breach of contract.
we review the trial court ruling that sustained the demurrer to each cause of action of the pleading in accordance with established standards.a demurrer tests the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter of law as such,it raises only a question of law.osornio weingarten th,d.the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.the judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.citations.citation.however,it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.citation.citation.bagatti department of rehabilitation th,d see also lee blue shield of california th,d.

i.the public entity tort liability of the county for statutory violation of the prudent investor standard.
plaintiffs second cause of action asserts that defendants violated sections and,which articulate the prudent investor standard governing investments by a county treasurer,in this case defendant buffington,who has been delegated investment authority by the county board of supervisors both statutes provide that the county treasurer shall serve as a fiduciary when investing or managing funds deposited with the county treasury,and shallact according to the prudent investor standard,with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing,to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of the county and the depositors italics added.the essence of the alleged statutory violation of the prudent investor standard is that defendants invested an excessive portion of the pool funds in lehman,failed to diversify the investment portfolio,and failed to recognize the foreseeable,impending collapse of lehman.
the liability of defendants for alleged acts that violated the prudent investor standard requires analysis of public entity immunity.public entities in california are not liable for tortious injury unless liability is imposed by statute.s overeign immunity is the rule in california governmental liability is limited to exceptions specifically set forth by statute.cochran herzog engraving d.see also guzman county of monterey th,d.section provides that public entity tort liability is exclusively statutory except as otherwise provided by statute a a public entity is not liable for an injury,whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.william hart union high school dist.cal th,d.this section abolishes all common law or judicially declared forms of liability for public entities,except for such liability as may be required by the state or federal constitution,inverse condemnation.in the absence of a constitutional requirement,public entities may be held liable only if a statute not including a charter provision,ordinance or regulation is found declaring them to be liable t here is no liability in the absence of a statute declaring such liability.legis.com,west ann.ed.foll.corona state of california th,d.
this means that the liability of public entities must be based on a specific statute declaring them to be liable,or at least creating some specific duty of care to the plaintiff.all angels county of merced th,d,quoting eastburn regional fire protection authority cal th,d,eastburn.the law clear purpose was not to expand the rights of plaintiffs in suits against governmental entities,but to confine potential governmental liability to rigidly delineated circumstances.citation.ellerbee county of los angeles th,d.
to impose liability on defendants for the claimed violation of the prudent investor standard,plaintiffs rely on section,which explicitly provides a statutory basis for direct liability of a public entity.eastburn,supra,cal th,d.section declares where a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury,the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.italics added.plaintiffs argue that use of the term shall in sections and imposes a mandatory duty to comply with the prudent investor standard for purposes of section liability.therefore,plaintiffs argument proceeds,the second cause of action has properly asserted liability for violation of a mandatory duty under section,and falls outside the scope of public entity immunity.
section has three discrete requirements which must be met before governmental entity liability may be imposed under government code section an enactment must impose a mandatory duty the enactment must be meant to protect against the kind of risk of injury suffered by the party asserting section as a basis for liability and breach of the mandatory duty must be a proximate cause of the injury suffered.ellerbee county of los angeles,supra,th,d.the first requirement,which is ultimately dispositive here,is that the enactment at issue be obligatory,rather than merely discretionary or permissive,in its directions to the public entity it must require,rather than merely authorize or permit,that a particular action be taken or not taken.haggis city of los angeles cal th,d,italics omitted see also california highway patrol superior court th,d.whether an enactment creates a mandatory duty is a question of law whether a particular statute is intended to impose a mandatory duty,rather than a mere obligation to perform a discretionary function,is a question of statutory interpretation for the courts.citation.citation.ellerbee,supra,at,d see also strong state of california th,d.
while the dividing line between a discretionary and mandatory duty is not always definitive,the california supreme court has articulated rigid requirements for imposition of governmental liability under government code section ellerbee county of los angeles,supra,th,d.an enactment creates a mandatory duty if it requires a public agency to take a particular action.citation.an enactment does not create a mandatory duty if it merely recites legislative goals and policies that must be implemented through a public agency exercise of discretion.citation.lockhart county of los angeles th,d.courts have construed this first prong rather strictly,finding a mandatory duty only if the enactment affirmatively imposes the duty and provides implementing guidelines.citations.guzman county of monterey cal th,d,see also department of corporations superior court th,d.
the court has also recognized that under section,inclusion of the term shall in an enactment does not necessarily create a mandatory duty there may be other factors that indicate that apparent obligatory language was not intended to foreclose a governmental entity or officer exercise of discretion.citations.guzman county of monterey,supra,cal th,d.in determining whether a mandatory duty actionable under section had been imposed,the legislature use of mandatory language while necessary is not the dispositive criteria.instead,the courts have focused on the particular action required by the statute,and have found the enactment created a mandatory duty under section only where the statutorily commanded act did not lend itself to a normative or qualitative debate over whether it was adequately fulfilled.de villers county of san diego th,d,fn.omitted.it is not enough,the california supreme court has declared,that the public entity or officer have been under an obligation to perform a function if the function itself involves the exercise of discretion.haggis city of los angeles,supra,cal th,d.
the basic compulsory obligation imposed on the county treasurer by sections and to act as a prudent investor,while stated in mandatory language,is quite general.the statutes do not command specific acts designed to achieve compliance with the prudent investor standard.de villers county of san diego,supra,th,d.the manner in which the required standard of the prudent investor is to be attained entails the exercise of extensive discretion that is not in the least specified by the statutes or any accompanying implementing measures see lockhart county of los angeles,supra,th,d wood county of san joaquin th,d macdonald state of california d.left to the expertise and judgment of the county treasurer are a myriad of investment evaluations,appraisals and choices that are the very essence of discretion.see guzman county of monterey,supra,cal th,d,braman state of california th,d.i n cases not involving a public entity citation,the inquiry should focus on whether the entity must render a considered decision citation,one requiring its expertise and judgment citations.guzman county of monterey,supra,at,d.the issue of defendants compliance with the prudent investor standard would also necessitate a complex qualitative analysis,rather than merely a straightforward determination that a specific ministerial directive has been ignored or violated.see ortega sacramento county of health human services th,d ortega ronald county of san diego th,d ronald.
in de villers county of san diego,supra,th,d de villers,the county was sued for breach of a mandatory duty specified in the code of federal regulations which stated a government agency,in that case the county office of the medical examiner ome,shall provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of controlled substances.a.id.at,d,fn.omitted.the court noted that the legislature use of mandatory language while necessary is not the dispositive criteria.instead,the courts have focused on the particular action required by the statute,and have found the enactment created a mandatory duty under section only where the statutorily commanded act did not lend itself to a normative or qualitative debate over whether it was adequately fulfilled.id.at,d.a ctionable mandatory duties were characterized as those in which the required action was clear and discrete and required no evaluation of whether it had in fact occurred.ibid.in contrast,the court declared,when the statutorily prescribed act involves debatable issues over whether the steps taken by the entity adequately fulfilled its obligation,we believe the act necessarily embodies discretionary determinations by the agency regarding how best to fulfill the mandate,and this discretion removes the duty from the type of activity that supports a claim under section.id.at,d.
the court in de villers concluded here,the mandated act to guard against theft with effective controls and procedures does not involve a discrete act over which there can be no debate,but instead involves actions that admit to a qualitative debate over whether ome actions were sufficient to fulfill its obligation.indeed,the code of federal regulations itself contemplates that s ubstantial compliance with the standards may be deemed sufficient by the administrator to satisfy the mandate b,which confirms that the qualitative judgments on the adequacy of the steps taken to fulfill the mandate have been vested in administrative agencies.we do not believe that code of federal regulations part imposes a duty that is mandatory for purposes of establishing damages liability under section,because the predicate enactment confers on government officials the discretion to evaluate and decide how best to implement the required security.de villers,supra,th,d.
similarly,sections and grant to the board of supervisors or county treasurer comprehensive discretion to evaluate and decide how best to comply with the command to act as a prudent investor.see also creason department of health services cal th,d,creason county of los angeles superior court th,d ronald,supra,th,d macdonald state of california,supra,d.this is not a case in which the plaintiff seeks to impose liability for clear breach of a mandatory ministerial or regulatory directive that leaves no choice other than to execute the enacted requirement.haggis city of los angeles,supra,cal th,d,alejo city of alhambra th,d davila county of los angeles th,d scott county of los angeles th,d.plaintiff does not claim failure to invest,but rather imprudent investment acts.ortega,supra,th,d.the claim demands inquiry into highly subjective and speculative investment decisions.the prudent investor standards set forth in sections and fall squarely within the scope of enactments that set forth the general policy goals acting with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the prevailing circumstances in the investment or management of funds deposited with the county treasury but do not specifically direct the manner in which the goals will be performed.lockhart county of los angeles,supra,th,d becerra county of santa cruz th,d.defendants are immune from liability for violation of the prudent investor standards as alleged in the second and fourth causes of action.
ii.the vicarious liability of defendants for the acts or omissions of a public employee.
plaintiff argues that even if defendants enjoy immunity under section,they would still be liable for buffington acts and omissions under section,which holds a government entity vicariously liable for the acts and omissions of government employees acting in the course and scope of their employment,subsection a.in addition to limited statutory liability for their own conduct and legal obligations,public entities may incur liability,based on respondeat superior principles,for the misconduct of their employees that occurred in the scope of their employment.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.section,subdivision a,provides a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would,apart from this section,have given rise to a cause of action against that employee see also scott county of los angeles,supra,th,d.thus,the general rule is that an employee of a public entity is liable for his torts to the same extent as a private person citation and the public entity is vicariously liable for any injury which its employee causes citation to the same extent as a private employer citation.citation.citation.barnhart cabrillo community college th,d.this v icarious liability is a primary basis for liability on the part of a public entity,and flows from the responsibility of such an entity for the acts of its employees under the principle of respondeat superior.citation.san diego city firefighters,local board of administration th,d.
however,a critical caveat is found in subdivision b of section,which states except as otherwise provided by statute,a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or omission of an employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from liability,subd.b stats,ch.jacqueline alameda county child protective services th,d.a public entity is not liable for any injury caused by the act or omission of the public entity or a public employee unless such liability is imposed by statute,subd.a also,any liability imposed upon a public entity by statute is subject to statutory immunity and any defenses that could be asserted by a private individual,subd.b.richardson tunnell schools ins.program for employees sipe th,d.
section provides that a public employee is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested in him,whether or not such discretion be abused.ae ex rel.hernandez county of tulare cir.section immunizes a public employee from liability for acts or omissions resulting from the exercise of the discretion vested in the public employee,despite abuse of discretion.scott county of los angeles,supra,th,d.the immunity for discretionary acts under section confers immunity only with respect to those basic policy decisions which have been committed to coordinate branches of government,and does not immunize government entities from liability for subsequent ministerial actions taken in the implementation of those basic policy decisions citation.this distinction is sometimes characterized as that between the planning and the operational levels of citation.citation.ortega,supra,th,d see also barner leeds cal th,d,johnson state of california cal d,wheeler county of san bernardino d.
in evaluating the immunity of buffington,and vicariously the county,under section,we engage in a fundamentally similar analysis and reach the same result as we did to determine whether the treasurer acts as an investor were mandatory or discretionary under section.buffington was not engaged in ministerial or operational level decisions.the discretion he exercised involved crucial investment policy decisions that assessed the risks and advantages of competing investment opportunities.see jacqueline alameda county child protective services,supra,th,d taylor buff d.his decisions as a public servant investor bear the hallmarks of discretionary activity which should not be the subject of scrutiny and by a coordinate branch of government.thompson county of alameda cal d,johnson state of california,supra,cal d,becerra county of santa cruz,supra,th,d masters san bernardino county employees retirement th,d ronald,supra,th,d.we therefore conclude that pursuant to section both buffington and the county have immunity from liability for the acts alleged in the second cause of action.ortega,supra,th,d.
iii.the third and fourth causes of action for violation of statutory maturity limits and the county investment policy.
plaintiffs also complain that defendants are not immune from liability for the acts alleged in the third and fourth causes of action.the third and fourth causes of action are each based on different claimed violations.the third cause of action alleges that defendants purchased two lehman notes in violation of the government code,which prohibited the county from purchasing corporate debt securities with a remaining maturity of more than five years,k.the fourth cause of action seeks to impose liability for buffington violation of the county investment policy,which was approved by the board of supervisors.plaintiffs argue that section requires compliance with stated maturity limits,and thus creates a mandatory duty from which the county is not immune.
invited error and forfeiture.
defendants sole response is that plaintiffs waived or actively invited the supposed error by failing to object to the trial court announced tentative decision to sustain the demurrer to all causes of action.we examine the issue of forfeiture and invited error in the context of the somewhat confusing record before us,which shows that defendants did not demur to the third and fourth causes of actions on the ground of public entity immunity.defendants asserted that immunity from liability existed for alleged violations of the prudent investor standard and the implementation of a higher concentration limit,and challenged the first cause of action for lack of a proper allegation of breach of contract,but did not specifically claim immunity as related to the third and fourth causes of action.the argument presented by defendants in support of the demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action of the first amended complaint and indeed,to all causes of action was that plaintiffs failed to timely file a government claim.in their opposition to the demurrer,plaintiffs understandably did not refer to the immunity issue in the specific context of the alleged violations of maturity limits and the investment policy.
two hearings on the demurrer took place.at the first hearing the parties discussed immunity as related to the claim that the county and buffington failed to comply with the prudent investor standard.at the second hearing the discussion primarily centered on the issue of plaintiffs compliance with the tort claims filing requirements,but defendants counsel also specifically argued that the immunity defense went to all of the four causes of action.when ruling on the demurrer to the first amended complaint,the court seemed to express agreement,and found,without explanation,that discretionary immunity applied to all four causes of action,including the maturity limits cause of action.counsel for plaintiffs expressed confusion that the trial court seemed to rule in the tentative decision and at the hearing that there was discretionary immunity for all of the other claims in the complaint,yet the court also talked about taking a writ,which was inappropriate if the entire complaint was thrown out.the court indicated that no causes of action remained to be litigated,so an appeal rather than a writ was the proper review mechanism.the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend as to each cause of action of the first amended complaint,and the action was dismissed with prejudice in its entirety.the ruling explicitly overruled defendants demurrer based on the requirements,on the ground that defendants waived deficiencies in the claim presented by plaintiffs.judgment was entered in favor of defendants.
on this record we can not conclude that plaintiffs invited any error with respect to the immunity ruling on the third and fourth causes of action.the doctrine of invited error is an application of the estoppel principle where a party by his conduct induces the commission of error,he is estopped from asserting it as a ground for reversal on appeal.citation.the purpose of the doctrine is to prevent a party from misleading the trial court and then profiting therefrom in the appellate court.citation.saxena goffney th,d.as we read the record,plaintiffs did not mislead the court or induce any error.plaintiffs counsel merely sought clarification of the court ruling on the scope and breadth of the immunity finding that is,whether it applied to defeat all of the causes of action.when the court explained that the second,third and fourth causes of action were all embraced within the immunity finding plaintiffs counsel expressed appreciation for the clarification and replied,okay.no invited error occurred.quantification settlement agreement cases th,d.
as for forfeiture,a reviewing court ordinarily will not consider a challenge to a ruling if an objection could have been but was not made in the trial court.citation.the purpose of this rule is to encourage parties to bring errors to the attention of the trial court,so that they may be corrected.citation.the critical point for preservation of claims on appeal is that the asserted error must have been brought to the attention of the trial court.citations.it is unfair to the trial judge and to the adverse party to take advantage of an alleged error on appeal where it could easily have been corrected at trial.citations.citation.citation.dipirro bondo th,d.however,even where a legal argument was not raised in the trial court,we have discretion to consider it when the theory raised for the first time on appeal is a pure question of law applied to undisputed facts.martorana marlin saltzman th,d rowe exline th,d.
while plaintiffs had no reason to focus on the immunity issue as related to the third and fourth causes of action when filing opposition to the demurrer,once the court indicated in the tentative decision and at the hearing that defendants were immune from all liability alleged in the first amended complaint,plaintiffs were aware of the precise issue and the need to object to the proposed ruling.had plaintiffs objected,defendants and the trial court would have been given the opportunity to address any error associated with the finding that discretionary acts immunity applied to the third and fourth causes of action.plaintiffs instead accepted the ruling without challenge or argument that defendants immunity did not extend to the third and fourth causes of action.nevertheless,given the belated claim of immunity to the third and fourth causes of action,the uncertainty that attended the argument,and the strictly legal nature of argument before us now on the sufficiency of the undisputed facts set forth in the pleading,we exercise our discretion to evaluate the merits of immunity issue as related to the third and fourth causes of action.
b.the third cause of action for violation of section.
plaintiffs make the rather perfunctory argument that defendants are not immune from the mandatory duties imposed by section and the investment policy.focusing first on the violation of section,subdivision k,alleged in the third cause of action,we agree with plaintiffs that the duty specified in the statute to invest in m notes,defined as all corporate and depository institution debt securities with a maximum remaining maturity of five years or less,is mandatory for purposes of section the statutorily commanded act to invest in securities with maximum maturity limits of five years or less is specific and does not lend itself to a normative or qualitative debate.
by its terms,however,section only applies to a local agency that is a city,a district,or other local agency that does not pool money in deposits or investments with other local agencies,other than local agencies that have the same governing body.however,section shall apply to all local agencies that pool money in deposits or investments with other local agencies that have separate governing bodies.italics added.section,subdivision a,in turn,provides in part this section shall apply to a local agency that is a county,a city and county,or other local agency that pools money in deposits or investments with other local agencies,including local agencies that have the same governing body.however,section shall apply to all local agencies that pool money in deposits or investments exclusively with local agencies that have the same governing body.italics added.no provision in section prohibits investment in securities with maturity limits of greater than five years.in fact,section,subdivision a,adds this section shall be interpreted in a manner that recognizes the distinct characteristics of investment pools and the distinct administrative burdens on managing and investing funds on a pooled basis pursuant to article commencing with section of chapter of division of title.plaintiffs third cause of action alleges an investment pool,and fails to allege that the local agencies have the same governing body.on the face of the pleading,the requirements of section,including the maturity limit requirement set forth in subdivision k,do not apply to create a cause of action for statutory violation.
c.the fourth cause of action for violation of the investment policy.
we turn to the fourth cause of action,which alleges that buffington violated the investment policy approved by the county board of supervisors,as set forth in paragraphs through.the allegations of violation of the investment policy are thus based on the same failure to adhere to the prudent investor standard,as described by government code sections and.those duties are discretionary within the meaning of sections and.therefore,public entity immunity attaches,and the fourth cause of action was properly dismissed.
iv.the first cause of action for breach of contract.
plaintiffs final contention is that the first cause of action of the complaint properly pled a breach of contract,which,according to settled law,is not defeated by any statutory immunity the essential inquiry,then,is whether a cause of action for breach of contract has been properly stated by plaintiffs.
plaintiffs alleged in the first cause of action that the parties entered into a contract,implied by the conduct of the parties.the alleged terms of the contract are enumerated in the pleading plaintiffs transferred money into the pool defendants agreed to manage the pool and make investment decisions in compliance with california law and its own investment policies,as periodically amended,including the prudent investor standard mandated by the government code in consideration,plaintiffs paid the county fees charged for management of the pool.the allegations of breach of the contract essentially parrot the claims of statutory violations lack of compliance with california law that governed investments by the pool,particularly the prudent investor standard excessive investment of the pool funds in lehman and other companies in the financial sector failure to recognize the impending collapse of lehman stock,and violations of statutory maturity limits in the purchase of lehman notes.
we recognize that a county may be bound by an implied contract under california law if there is no legislative prohibition against such arrangements,such as a s
