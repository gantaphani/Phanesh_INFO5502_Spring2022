in these cases consolidated on appeal,we address whether payments made to public school teachers,who relinquished their statutory tenure rights and resigned from their positions upon accepting the payments,constitute wages taxable under the federal insurance contribution act fica.appoloni united states was filed in the united states district court for the western district of michigan klender united states was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.in each case,both parties filed for summary judgment.in appoloni,the district court granted summary judgment for the government in klender,the court granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs.for the following reasons,we hold that the payments made in exchange for the relinquishment of statutorily granted tenure rights constitute wages taxable under fica.thus,we reverse the district court judgment in klender,and we affirm the court judgment in appoloni.
background 
on march,three taxpayers filed suit in the eastern district of michigan.on november,three taxpayers brought suit in the western district of michigan.both lawsuits were certified as class actions and differ only in minor respects not relevant here.in general,the class encompasses all former employees of michigan school districts and public education institutions,residing in the eastern klender and western appoloni districts of michigan who received early retirement incentive payments from their respective school districts and who unsuccessfully applied to the internal revenue service irs for refunds of fica taxes withheld from those payments.
plaintiffs,donald appoloni,william bergemann,and sandra engle,were tenured public school teachers employed by the dowagiac union public school district the school district.all three had been granted tenure by the school district pursuant to the michigan teachers act tenure act.comp.laws.in michigan,a teacher automatically earns tenure by successfully completing a probationary period.see.comp.laws.as tenured teachers,plaintiffs were entitled to continued employment with their respective school districts absent reasonable and just cause and subject to the procedural protections set forth in the tenure act.
during the school year,the school district offered an early employee severance plan esp to its most senior teachers.teachers who had at least ten years of service with the school district and were at a high step in the pay scale,were eligible to participate in the plan.participation in the plan was voluntary,and the plan provided that if more than eligible teachers applied,eligibility to participate would be determined on the basis of seniority.the purpose of this plan was to help prevent teacher layoffs and to lessen the board economic responsibility in the area of staffing.at.
participants in the esp were required to resign as of june,and to agree to a waiver providing that the teacher waived all claims arising out of employment with the district,including claims under the tenure act.additionally,participating teachers agreed to waive all entitlement to future wage and benefit increases,all rights to participate in any district sponsored benefit plans and agreed to not apply for reemployment without the school district consent.at.participating teachers received the equivalent of their annual base salary but not more than in monthly payments over a period.at.
the school district withheld fica taxes from the installment payments.relying on the eighth circuit decision in north dakota state united states,cir,the taxpayers filed claims for refunds of the fica taxes withheld,and when the irs denied those claims,the taxpayers filed suit in the western district of michigan.
both the plaintiffs and the government filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted the government motion and denied the plaintiffs motion.plaintiffs filed this timely appeal.
ii.klender 
the klender litigation similarly involves tenured teachers who were offered an employee severance plan designed to induce tenured teachers to retire.in klender,all three klender,roger petri,william employed as michigan public school teachers and also had been granted tenure pursuant to the tenure act.
plaintiff klender accepted a buyout that the pinconning area school district offered her during the school year.the buyout was offered to teachers with or more years of service with the district.any eligible teacher who agreed to retire as of june,would receive a payment of made in monthly installments over six years.in exchange,teachers were required to waive all future employment rights,to agree not to apply for in the district without the district consent,and to waive and release the district forever from rights to and from any claims based,inter alia,on her tenure rights.at.
plaintiff petri accepted a voluntary teacher severance incentive program offered by the pinconning area school district to teachers with ten or more years of service.if an eligible teacher agreed to voluntarily resign his or her employment with pinconning area schools and forfeit all seniority rights,the teacher would receive a minimum guaranteed payment of.that payment increased to a total of if ten or more eligible teachers opted to participate in the program.plaintiff petri accepted the buyout offer on february.
plaintiff rase also accepted a buyout that was offered pursuant to an early retirement provision in a collective bargaining agreement between the west city area school district and the west city education association.teachers with a minimum of years service in the district and years credit under the michigan public school employees retirement plan qualified for an early retirement incentive.incentive payments began at for teachers with years and decreased by for each additional year of retirement credits up to.on january,plaintiff rase announced his retirement.
in making these buyout payments to plaintiffs klender,petri,and rase,the school districts withheld fica taxes from the amount paid.between august and october of,all three plaintiffs filed claims for refunds with the irs.the irs denied the claims.plaintiffs then filed this action in the eastern district of michigan.both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court denied the government motion and granted the plaintiffs.this appeal followed.

this case presents an issue of first impression in this circuit are payments made by school districts to public school teachers in exchange for the relinquishment of those teachers statutorily granted tenure rights considered wages taxable under fica 
fica,codified in chapter of the internal revenue code,sections through,imposes a tax upon the wages of employees to fund social security and medicare benefits.this tax is collected by the employer by deducting the tax from wages at the time of payment.section imposes a matching tax on the employer with respect to wages paid to the employee.
plaintiffs argue that the payments in this case should not be considered wages for purposes of fica,and therefore,fica taxes were wrongly withheld from those payments.plaintiffs rely on an eighth circuit decision,north dakota state united states,cir,for this proposition.in north dakota,payments were made to tenured university professors pursuant to an early retirement program.that court held that those payments were not wages for fica purposes.
the government argues that north dakota is distinguishable and that the payments at issue in this case easily fit within the statutory definition of wages,and thus,the taxes were properly withheld.
we begin by examining the definition of wages for purposes of fica.section a of the internal revenue code defines wages as all remuneration for employment,including the cash value of all remuneration including benefits paid in any medium other than cash.section a lists exceptions to this expansive definition but none apply here.employment is defined,in b,as any service,of whatever nature,performed a by an employee for the person employing him.remuneration for employment,unless specifically excepted,constitutes wages even though at the time paid the relationship of employer and employee no longer exists between the person in whose employ the services were performed and the individual who performed them.reg.a i.as explained in reg.a c,t he name by which the remuneration for employment is designated is immaterial salaries,fees,bonuses,and commissions are wages if paid as compensation for employment.congress,by enacting fica,intended to impose fica taxes on a broad range of remuneration in order to accomplish the remedial purposes of the social security act.see,at describing the aims of the social security act.
both the supreme court and this circuit have emphasized the broad,inclusive nature of this definition.for example,in soc.sec.bd.nierotko,the supreme court held that back pay awarded to wrongfully discharged employees under the national labor relations act constituted wages for purposes of the social security act of.the court specifically rejected the argument that service as used in the act should be limited to only productive activity and emphasized the broad nature of the definition of fica wages 
the very words any service performed for his employer,with the purpose of the social security act in mind import breadth of coverage.they admonish us against holding that service can be only productive activity.we think that service as used by congress in this definitive phrase means not only work actually done but the entire relationship for which compensation is paid to the employee by the employer.
id.emphasis added quoting a.
in this circuit,we have followed the reasoning of nierotko and have also emphasized that the phrase remuneration for employment as it appears in should be interpreted broadly.gerbec united states,cir.in gerbec,employees were laid off just before qualifying for pension benefits and they sued under the employment retirement income and security act of.the parties settled and the employees received payments pursuant to a settlement agreement.while we found that some of those payments constituted damages for a personal injury claim and thus were exempt from fica taxes,we held that damages compensating the plaintiffs for lost back wages or future subject to income and fica taxes.we reasoned 
the holding in nierotko clearly supports the conclusion that awards representing a loss in wages,both back wages and future wages,that otherwise would have been paid,reflect compensation paid to the employee because of the relationship,regardless of whether the employee actually worked during the time period in question.
id.thus,under the holding in gerbec,had the plaintiffs been terminated without cause and thus wrongfully denied the right they gave up in this right to continued for cause front pay wages would have been subject to fica taxation.see id.this is in contrast to the erroneous conclusion by the district court in klender,t he illegal deprivation of plaintiffs rights would have given rise to a cause of action for damages,and those damages recovered would not be taxable under the sixth circuit reasoning in gerbec.klender united states,d.
both nierotko and gerbec demonstrate the way in which courts have broadly interpreted the definition of wages for purposes of fica the dissent indicates that our result is largely ordained by our choice to define this statute broadly.while we maintain such a construction of this statute is proper,we find a broad construction is not necessary,as we hold the facts presented easily fit within the definition of wages,for the following reasons.
first,the eligibility requirements for qualifying for a a teacher served a minimum number of the payments were for services performed rather than for the relinquishment of tenure rights.in determining whether a payment constitutes wages,courts have looked to eligibility requirements,specifically longevity,as an important factor.see sheet metal workers local supplemental unemployment benefit trust fund united states,cir associated,united states,abrahamsen united states.we have consistently held that where a payment arises out of the employment relationship,and is conditioned on a minimum number of years of service,such a payment constitutes fica wages.
for example,in sheet metal,we addressed whether distributions to employees from a supplemental unemployment benefit fund were wages for fica purposes.sheet metal,at.the distributions were derived solely from employer contributions,and eligibility for those distributions was contingent on an employee length of service.we evaluated whether those payments were remuneration for employment and stated that eligibility requirements provide the most accurate test to determine whether a payment is truly in consideration for services.id.at emphasis added see also associated,at noting that while the method of computing severance payments,including the length of service and pay rate,were not dispositive,the method is a relevant factor in determining whether the payments constitute wages abrahamsen,at finding that severance payments constituted fica wages based in part on the fact that the employer used a formula based on the departing employee salary and years of service cohen united states,d,finding that the severance payment was subject to fica tax where it was only available to employees with twenty or more years of continuous service and noting that courts look to the eligibility requirements for determining whether the payments are compensation for services hemelt united states,cir k ey factors in determining the amounts of each award were the length of each employee tenure with continental and the salary he received from continental b ecause the payments from continental to taxpayers and other class members arose out of their employment relationship,they fit within the statutory and regulatory definition of wages,and fica taxes were properly withheld from the awards.
in this case,the severance payments were conditioned upon a teacher having served a certain number of that of obtaining tenure under michigan the school district.in appoloni,the school district offered a severance payment to teachers who had at least ten years of service with the school district and who were at a high step in the pay scale.similarly,in klender,the severance payments were only offered to those teachers who had served for a certain number of years in excess of that required to achieve tenure klender accepted a buyout requiring or more years of service with the district petri accepted a severance package requiring ten or more years of service and rase accepted a buyout that was offered to teachers with a minimum of years of service.
plaintiffs necessarily had to have tenure to be eligible for the buyout.however,the key factor for determining eligibility because these early retirement payments were offered to encourage teachers at a high pay rate to retire.thus,the payments at issue in this case,like those in sheet metal,arose out of the employment relationship,and were conditioned on a minimum number of years of service.
plaintiffs make much of the fact that they gave up their rights as tenured teachers to continued employment absent just cause for termination.they argue that because the payments were in exchange for the relinquishment of that right,the payments are not wages taxable under fica.this leads us to our next point just because a teacher relinquishes a right when accepting early retirement does not convert what would be fica wages into something else.
plaintiffs maintain that the school districts were buying their tenure rights.this point also greatly influences the dissent.yet,a court must not look simply at what is being relinquished at the point a severance payment is offered,but rather,how the right relinquished was earned.thus,we can not understate the importance of the fact that a teacher earns tenure by successfully completing a probationary period.comp.laws.in other words,a teacher does not obtain tenure at the onset of employment it is a right that is earned like any other job benefit.admittedly,the grant of this right is guaranteed and protected by statute.but we fail to see how the fact that this right is protected by statute takes away from the point that it still must be earned through services to the employer 
in any event,the payments at issue were not in exchange solely for the tenure rights they were in exchange for the teachers early retirement,and,as such,were essentially severance payments.we fail to see how this is different from other severance packages just because a tenure right was exchanged.in almost all severance packages an employee gives up something,and we have a hard time distinguishing this case from similar cases where an employee,pursuant to a severance package,gives up rights in exchange.courts have consistently held that severance payments for the relinquishment of rights in the course of an employment relationship are fica wages.in fact,we are at a loss to find a case,other than the eighth circuit decision,to hold otherwise.
for example,in abrahamsen,severance payments were conditioned on employees waiving all future claims against the employer.abrahamsen.the court noted that the payments were intended both to induce employees to leave and to settle any claims the employees may have had against ibm.id.at.however,the court found that even though the plaintiffs were relinquishing this right and even though the employer offered this payment,in part,because plaintiffs waived this right,this did not change the character of the severance payments and those payments were subject to the fica tax.see also cohen,d at finding severance payments subject to fica tax where plaintiffs voluntarily accepted severance package and,in doing so,waived all rights against the defendant to future employment.
similarly,in associated electric,the argued their severance payments were not wages because the payments were made to union employees in exchange for valuable rights,the union promise not to strike,and thus were not for services performed.associated electric,at.like the court in abrahamsen,the court found that because the employer motivations were not solely to avoid labor unrest,the payments constituted fica wages.id.
in this case,the school district motivation was not to buy tenure motivation was to induce those teachers at the highest pay scales to retire early relinquishment of tenure rights was simply a necessary and incidental part of accepting the buyout.in other words,in order to offer the teachers a buyout,the school districts had to ask that they give up their right to future same as with any severance package thus,especially in light of the school district purpose in offering these severance payments,we see no reason to differentiate the relinquishment of tenure rights from the relinquishment of other benefits earned during the course of employment,like the right to bring suit,or rights associated with seniority.
finally,we agree with the government position that the most applicable revenue ruling indicates the severance payments are fica wages.revenue rulings are not entitled to the same degree of deference accorded a statute however,some degree of deference is appropriate depending upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.skidmore swift,comm r,cir finding revenue rulings receive skidmore deference but ammex,united states,cir finding revenue rulings get the same deference as treasury regulations.consideration of all of these factors leads us to conclude that some deference is due to revenue ruling and revenue ruling.
plaintiffs argue this case is most analogous to revenue ruling the revenue ruling relied on by the eighth circuit in north dakota.in revenue ruling,an employee with a contract right to employment agreed to relinquish that right during the second year in exchange for a lump sum payment.the irs concluded that payments for relinquishment of rights under a contract are not wages under fica.
the government contends this case presents an issue more closely related to revenue ruling,where an employee,under a general contract,acquired both the rights to security in his employment and to additional pay or other recognition for longevity based on his years of service to the employer.rul.emphasis added.in exchange for the employee agreement to refrain from asserting either his seniority rights or job security rights,the employee received a lump sum payment.the irs held that because the employee had acquired his relinquished employment rights through his previous performance of services,the payment constituted remuneration for services under the railroad retirement act the counterpart of fica for railroad employees.id.we agree with the government and find revenue ruling to be the most analogous revenue ruling.
in revenue ruling,the employee was granted,at the time of employment,a contractual right to employment for five years.in contrast,the plaintiffs received their tenure rights after a certain requisite number of years of service.as previously emphasized,in michigan,tenure is automatically granted,pursuant to a statute,after a teacher completes a probationary period.we see this case as one where the teacher earned tenure through previous performance of services.rul.thus,the most analogous revenue ruling,revenue ruling,also indicates that the severance payments at issue are fica wages.
we recognize our holding,and our reliance on revenue ruling,differs from what the eighth circuit held in north dakota however we believe that we have reached the correct result as stated in csx.united states,where the united states court of federal claims disagreed with the holding in north dakota 
r ights to vacation pay,sick pay,layoff pay,and part of the employee total compensation package and,hence,constituted wages.therefore,when these benefits are relinquished in favor of a payment,the transaction simply amounts to a redemption,paid in cash,of wage amounts previously paid in kind.because a separation payment is simply an exchange of equivalent values,what were wages at the start remain wages at the end.
id.at emphasis added.for the reasons previously discussed,we agree with the reasoning of the court in csx.in doing so we give effect to congress definition of wages as all remuneration for employment,including the cash value of all remuneration including benefits paid in any medium other than cash.a emphasis added.tenure rights were previously paid in now are being paid in cash.
to summarize,we find of it of great significance that the tenure rights at issue were earned through service to the employer.this is for two reasons.first,we see no reason to differentiate tenure rights from any other right an employee earns through service to any employer.as discussed,courts have found the relinquishment of seniority rights,rights to bring suit,and other types of rights in exchange for a severance payment constitute fica wages.see abrahamsen,severance payments conditioned upon employees waiving all future claims against the employer associated,at severance payments were not wages because the payments were made to union employees in exchange for the union promise not to strike cohen,d at court found severance payments subject to fica tax where plaintiffs voluntarily accepted severance payments and,in doing so,waived all rights against the defendant to future employment.secondly,because these rights were earned through service rather than contracted for at the time of employment,this suggests rul.is more on point than rul.
we also want to again emphasize the importance of the school district principal purpose in offering these severance payments.the school district purpose here was not to buy tenure rights.it was to induce those at the highest pay scales to voluntarily retire early.relinquishment of tenure rights was incidental to the acceptance of the severance payment.a school district could not offer an early retirement payment and permit the teacher to keep tenure and remain employed.the relinquishment of these tenure the relinquishment of the rights in abrahamsen and associated necessary to accepting the severance payment.
thus,we find that the severance payments at issue easily fall within the definition of fica wages as all remuneration for employment.a.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district court judgment in appoloni and we reverse the district court judgment in klender and remand with instructions to enter summary judgment for the government.
i concur in the result regarding plaintiff william rase.however,i respectfully dissent as to the other plaintiffs plaintiffs.on this significant tax question for which u niformity among the circuits is especially important in tax cases to ensure equal and certain administration of the tax system,nickell comm r,cir,i would follow the persuasive authority of north dakota state university united states,cir.in doing so,i would hold that the payments at issue,with the exception of the payments to plaintiff william rase,do not constitute wages for purposes of the federal insurance contributions act fica.accordingly,i would affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs in klender and reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of the united states in appoloni.
both cases are certified class actions encompassing former employees of michigan school districts and public educational institutions residing in the western appoloni and eastern klender districts of michigan who received early retirement incentive payments from their employers and unsuccessfully applied to the internal revenue service irs for refunds of fica taxes withheld on such payments during the previous two years.the facts in each of the cases are not in dispute.because key facts affect my disagreement with the majority analysis and conclusion,i will briefly recite the facts crucial to my resolution.
appoloni united states 
the representative plaintiffs,donald appoloni,william bergemann,and sandra engle,are former public school teachers in the dowagiac union school district dowagiac who possessed tenure rights pursuant to the michigan teachers tenure act the tenure act.comp.laws to.a public school teacher obtains tenure after satisfactorily completing a formerly probationary period of employment.comp.laws,and thereafter may be discharged or demoted only for reasonable and just cause and only as provided in the tenure act.comp.laws.tenure status also entitles a teacher to a shorter probationary period in any other michigan school district.comp.laws.appoloni obtained tenure in,bergemann obtained tenure in,and engle obtained tenure in.
appoloni,bergemann,and engle all opted to participate in the employee severance plan esp.the plan is described by plaintiffs as follows 
under the plan,teachers who a had at least ten years service with the school district,and b were at the highest step of the applicable pay scale,were eligible to elect to participate in the plan by indicating their intent during a window period from november,to january,the plan provided that if more than eligible teachers applied,participation would be determined on the basis of seniority,and that if fewer than applied the plan would be cancelled.id.
participants in the buyout plan were required to resign from employment with the school district as of june,to waive all future employment rights,all entitlement to future wage and benefits increases,all rights to participate in any benefit plans,and to agree not to apply for reemployment without the school district consent in consideration for giving up these rights to future employment,participating teachers were to receive the equivalent of their annual base salary but no more than,in monthly payments over a period.teachers participation in the plan was entirely voluntary.
klender united states 
the material facts of klender are substantially similar to the facts of appoloni.plaintiffs phyllis klender and roger petri were both employed by the pinconning area school district pinconning,although they retired at slightly different times and therefore participated in different severance plans.plaintiff william rase was employed by the west city area school district west.the features of the applicable severance plans are outlined below.
phyllis klender 
like dowagiac,pinconning also created an employee severance plan esp designed to induce employees to leave their jobs.the plan was available to teachers who had twenty or more years of service with pinconning as of june.all teachers who accepted the esp were paid the same amount if retired by june,and if retired by june.the uniform esp payment amount was arbitrary in the sense that it bore no relationship to an individual teacher loss of actual wages.the pinconning employees also agreed to give up all future employment rights,including any and all claims existing in equity or law under federal and state law or board policy pertaining to any right to reappointment or tenure rights by virtue of any expressed agreements or oral understandings.the employees further relinquished any right to bring suit against the school district under title vii of the civil rights act of or any other statute,constitutional provision or common law theory related to employment,employment discrimination or separation from employment and under the age discrimination in employment act of and the older workers protection act of.
phyllis klender,a tenured teacher eligible for the plan,agreed to participate and retired effective june,after signing the requisite releases.after pinconning deducted fica taxes from subsequent severance plan payments distributed to klender,klender timely filed a claim for a refund with the irs.on january,the irs denied klender claim for a refund.
roger petri 
pinconning offered roger petri a similar plan in.all teachers with a minimum service of ten years were eligible to receive the uniform sum of,irrespective of an individual loss of actual wages.like klender plan,petri esp plan required him to relinquish rights to continued employment.although the agreement did not specifically list tenure rights,participating employees agreed 
to fully and completely waive,discharge,release and hold pinconning area schools and the pinconning area education association harmless from any and all liability,claims,charges,demands causes of action of any kind whatsoever including,but not limited to,claims for breach of contract,deprivation of constitutional rights,claims of wrongful discharge claims of discrimination 
the agreement further acknowledge d that the program benefit constitutes compensation which the teacher would not otherwise be entitled to.
having obtained tenure in,roger petri qualified for the severance program and,accordingly,accepted the offer,which included the release document,in february of.as with klender,pinconning deducted fica taxes from the esp payments petri received.on august,petri filed a claim for a refund with the irs for fica taxes withheld on the payments he received,and,on october,the irs denied petri claim for a refund.
william rase 
william rase worked in the west school district.like the other districts,west devised a plan to give qualified teachers a fixed sum in exchange for the teachers agreement to retire early.the west plan differed,however,because it was included in the master agreement that is,the contract between the school district and the chapter of the teacher union that represented the district teachers,including rase.the actual sum an employee received was dependent upon the number of years the teacher was involved in a michigan public employees retirement plan and varied between and.unlike the other esps,there was no admissible evidence presented that the teachers who chose to participate in the early retirement plan were contractually required to release statutory rights to receive the severance payments.nevertheless,rase claims,by way of affidavit,that the payments were contingent upon the relinquishment of his tenure rights in exchange for the esp payments.rase qualified for the early retirement plan because he was employed by west as a teacher since and achieved tenure in.after rase committed to the plan in early,west subsequently deducted fica taxes from the payments to rase.like the other plaintiffs,rase unsuccessfully filed a claim for a refund with the irs.
i concur in the result reached by the majority with respect to william rase.i would hold that the claim by rase fails when confronted by the government motion for summary judgment because there was no obligation by rase to relinquish his statutory tenure rights.although rase proffered his subjective opinion,by affidavit,that the payment was contingent upon his relinquishment of claims pursuant to the michigan tenure act,no factual evidence supports this conclusory assertion.fed.civ.e.accordingly,i concur with the majority that rase esp payments were subject to fica taxes.
these cases present an issue of statutory construction.in this regard,the inquiry begins with the fundamental purpose of judicial construction of statutes,which is to ascertain and give effect to the original meaning of the words used by congress 
w e begin with the understanding that congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there,connecticut nat.bank germain,d.as we have previously noted in construing another provision of,when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd is to enforce it according to its terms.united states ron pair enterprises,d quoting caminetti united states.
hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d.
as justice scalia has further elaborated 
the text is the law,and it is the text that must be observed.i agree with justice holmes remark,quoted approvingly by justice frankfurter in his article on the construction of statutes only a day or two counsel talked of the intention of a legislature,i was indiscreet enough to say i do care what their intention was.i only want to know what the words mean.and i agree with holmes other remark,quoted approvingly by justice jackson we do not inquire what the legislature meant we ask only what the statute means.
antonin scalia,a matter of interpretation federal courts and the law.
the fica defines wages as all remuneration for employment,including the cash value of all remuneration including benefits paid in any medium other than cash a emphasis added.employment is further defined as any service,of whatever nature,performed by an employee for the person employing him id.at b emphasis added.thus,the statute plain language raises the issue of whether the plaintiffs received their esp remuneration for any service performed by them for their employer.
where,as here,no statutory definitions exist,courts may refer to dictionary definitions for guidance in discerning the plain meaning of a statute language.united states edward rose sons,cir cleveland city of,cir see mci telecomm.am,d using dictionary definitions to interpret the word modify.
the ordinary,common meaning of the word services is a n act or a variety of work done for others,especially for pay.american heritage dictionary of the english language ed.other major english language dictionaries are to the same effect

after my review of these common definitions and social security board nierotko,which held that the term service is not limited to productive activity,but includes compensation for the loss of actual wages,i conclude,consistent with the eighth circuit,the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania,and the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,that the esp payments were made in exchange for the relinquishment of plaintiffs statutory and tenure rights,rather than remuneration for services to the school districts.similar to the payment of meals and lodging in rowan companies,united states,d,and the release of tort claim damages in gerbec united states,cir,the esp payments,although arising in the employment setting,were not remuneration for any service performed by plaintiffs.rather,the esp payments were a clear,separate,and adequate consideration exchanged for the relinquishment of plaintiffs vested and bona fide statutory rights to tenure.
prior to rowan,a plausible argument could be made that the term wages as used in the fica should be broadly construed.see nierotko,at.relying on nierotko and obiter dictum from our decision in gerbec.at remuneration for employment as it appears in should be interpreted broadly,the majority reaches a result which is largely ordained by its choice of a rule of statutory construction.
in my view,the statute at issue,like all statutes,should not be construed broadly,narrowly,strictly,or liberally,but rather fairly and reasonably.in this regard,i agree with justice scalia that a text should not be construed strictly,and it should not be construed leniently it should be construed reasonably,to contain all that it fairly means.scalia,a matter of interpretation at.
furthermore,any notion that should be interpreted broadly,rather than fairly and reasonably,was rejected by the supreme court in rowan,at.in rowan,the government unsuccessfully argued that the holding of central illinois should not apply to the term wages as contained in the fica.id.at.the government contended that the definition of wages for purposes of the fica should be given a broader and more expansive interpretation.id.the government position was rejected by the supreme court,and the treasury regulation at issue was declared invalid.id.at.the court summarized its holding as follows 
we conclude that reg.a f and b f fail to implement the statutory definition of wages in a consistent or reasonable manner.the plain language and legislative histories of the relevant acts indicate that congress intended its definition to be interpreted in the same manner for fica and futa as for withholding.the treasury regulations on which the government relies fail to do so,and their inconsistent and unexplained application undermine the contention that congress nonetheless endorsed them.as congress did intend a consistent interpretation of its definition,these treasury regulations also are inconsistent with the court reasoning in central illinois.
we therefore hold that the regulations are invalid,and that the service erred in relying upon them to include in the computation of wages the value of the meals and lodging that petitioner provided for its own convenience to its employees on offshore oil rigs.the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.
although congress amended a in response to rowan,thus allowing differing regulatory treatment of wages for purposes of income tax withholding and the fica,the broad interpretation of the definition of wages for fica purposes has not been restored.
after construing the statute at issue in a fair and reasonable manner,consistent with the words used by congress,i would hold that,with the exception of plaintiff william rase,the esp payments were made in exchange for the relinquish
