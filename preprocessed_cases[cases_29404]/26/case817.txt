background 
rachel and lauren,members of the holt high school varsity cheerleading squad squad,drank vodka at another student house after school on august,before attending a cheerleading photograph session.after the photo session,the two returned to their friend house and finished drinking their vodka drinks.at approximately,rachel and lauren left the house to attend a football jamboree at holt high school,where the squad performed until.during the performance,some squad members suspected others on the squad had consumed alcohol before the jamboree.one squad member testified rachel,during warmups before the game,confided,do tell anyone,me and lauren are drunk.during the game,diane moran moran,the varsity cheerleading advisor,was informed of one squad member suspicions.after the jamboree,moran met briefly with the squad to discuss the evening performance,after which the individual members left the football field.moran also talked with lauren and the third cheerleader about rumors they had consumed alcohol before the jamboree.later that night,moran received telephone calls at her home from various cheerleaders,who informed moran they were quitting the squad.after moran learned five squad members were gathered at a cheerleader home,moran went to that home to rectify the situation.when moran arrived,these squad members declared they could not cheer with girls who had been drinking before the game.moran decided the squad should not talk about rachel and lauren without them present to defend themselves,so moran drove to rachel and lauren homes,picked them up,and brought them to the meeting.rachel and lauren attended the meeting from approximately to or,after which moran drove them home.at the meeting,neither rachel nor lauren admitted consuming alcohol before the jamboree.
the next day,moran spoke to rachel parents,steve and elizabeth elizabeth jennings,and to lauren mother,nadine schwaigert nadine,about the events from the previous night.both rachel and lauren admitted to their mothers that they consumed alcohol before the jamboree.on monday,september,moran told school activities director david gerdeman gerdeman about the possibility rachel and lauren drank alcohol on august,and about the meeting moran had with the cheerleaders that night.on september,gerdeman told principal john waters waters about the allegations of alcohol consumption and about the meeting.waters met with district superintendent thomas byrnes byrnes and assistant principals richard fohey fohey and frank barro barro.byrnes told school administrators to investigate the allegations against rachel and lauren,but to do so from scratch without using information obtained during the meeting moran conducted.waters met with the varsity cheerleading squad after school on september and,without mentioning rachel or lauren names,informed them the district would not use information obtained during the meeting.on september,waters and byrnes removed moran from her cheerleading advisor position,based on their belief moran exhibited poor judgment in conducting such a meeting.
the same day,waters interviewed rachel and invited elizabeth to attend,which she did.elizabeth informed waters they would not answer any questions about alcohol consumption on august,although rachel denied being under the influence of alcohol on august.waters also attempted to meet with lauren that day,but after waters invited nadine to attend,she withdrew lauren from school.on september,rachel and lauren parents filed the present lawsuit under,and pursuant to missouri state law 
in response to the lawsuit,the district attorney advised the administration to obtain written statements from students about the events involved in this case.several students informed waters they saw rachel and lauren consume alcohol before the jamboree.on september,based on overwhelming evidence,waters decided to impose a,suspension on rachel and lauren for being under the influence of alcohol at a school function,in violation of school policy.when waters called to inform elizabeth about the suspension,elizabeth abruptly ended the conversation and told waters any further communication would be through her attorney.waters attempted unsuccessfully to contact nadine and her husband,fred,eventually leaving a message on their answering machine informing them of the decision to suspend lauren and inviting them to contact him if they had any questions.on september,fohey and barro sent written confirmations to the parents of the suspensions for alcohol use,which letters also informed the parents they could seek review of the suspensions in accordance with school board policy by request of the principal and superintendent.neither rachel parents nor lauren parents ever contacted any school administrator regarding this matter.
under the student code of conduct,as set out in the district discipline code,a first offense for alcohol use or possession is punishable by a,suspension.rachel knew consuming alcohol before a school event violates the policy,and lauren was aware the policy called for a suspension for alcohol use.
when moran joined the district staff in,she attended a orientation program designed to familiarize new teachers with the district discipline code and the high school student code of conduct.three times each school year the district also provides training for coaches regarding disciplinary measures when responding to student misconduct.moran,who became involved in the cheerleading program in,had not yet attended this training,but had received a folder regarding the regulations of the missouri state high school activity association mshsaa.

failure to train 
the parents first claim rachel and lauren constitutionally protected liberty rights were violated because the district patently fail ed to train,educate,warn and instruct its employees in the proper manner of conducting investigations into allegations of student misconduct.to establish the district liability under section for failure to train employees adequately,the parents must prove the failure to train in a relevant respect demonstrated a deliberate indifference to the students constitutional rights.city of canton harris,d larson miller,cir en banc.to show deliberate indifference,the parents must prove the district had notice that its procedures were inadequate and likely to result in a violation of constitutional rights.larson,at citation omitted.notice to the district may be implied when the failure to train is so likely to result in a constitutional violation that the need for training is patently obvious,or a pattern of misconduct indicates that the school district responses to a regularly recurring situation are insufficient to protect the students constitutional rights.sch.dist.of kansas city,cir.the parents rely on the first implication,claiming it was patently obvious the district failure to train moran adequately would result in violation of constitutional rights.
