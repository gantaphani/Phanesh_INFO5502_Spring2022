addie stover stover appeals the final judgment entered pursuant to a jury verdict in favor of hattiesburg public school district school district,the denial of a motion for a new trial,and the district court grant of attorney fees to the school district.on appeal,stover argues that the district court made evidentiary errors during the trial,the district court erroneously permitted the same actor jury instruction,the jury verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence,and the district court erroneously awarded attorney fees to the school district.for the following reasons,we affirm in part,reverse and vacate in part,and render in part.
factual and procedural background 
in early,stover,an african american female,began working as a temporary secretary to jimmy hopkins in the personnel department at the school district.hopkins,an african american,was the associate superintendent and head of the personnel department.stover holds a bachelor degree in english with a minor in paralegal studies.in june,stover began working as a secretary to hopkins,and stover beginning salary was.for the term,stover was assigned to work for gordon walker,a white male,instead of hopkins.gordon walker was the superintendent at the time stover was his secretary.walker resigned in,and james davis,an african american,became superintendent.in june,davis retired,and annie wimbish an african american female,became superintendent.stover salary at the time she resigned in was.stover is not a licensed educator,and she did not have an employment contract with the school district.
during his tenure as superintendent,davis had a cabinet of administrators,including perrin lowery,tressie harper,penny wallin,and jimmy hopkins stover was not a member of the cabinet.perrin,harper,and wallin held doctorate degrees in education,and hopkins held a master degree and was working on his doctorate degree.in,harper resigned to become a superintendent for another district.the school district did not immediately replace harper because of budget considerations.stover contends that she assumed many of the responsibilities of harper when harper resigned davis testified that he assumed most of harper responsibilities,and the other responsibilities were spread out among others.
approximately two years after harper resigned,the school district decided to fill the vacuum created by harper resignation.this action arose from the school district decision to hire alan oubre,a white male,as the central office administrative coordinator in august.the school district concedes that it did not advertise the available position.oubre starting salary was for the partial school year and for the full school year.oubre holds a bachelor degree in secondary school english and a master degree in educational administration.oubre has a contract of employment with the school district.
upon learning of oubre salary,stover argued that both oubre and she were administrative assistants who performed substantially equal work,and therefore,they should be paid the same.in august,stover filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that the school district discriminated against her on the basis of race and violated the equal pay act epa,d.on june,stover filed a complaint in federal district court for claims of race discrimination under title vii and violation of the epa.on june,she filed another charge with the eeoc,adding allegations of gender discrimination and retaliation.stover amended the complaint twice,and on january,stover filed her second amended complaint alleging race and sex discrimination under title vii,retaliation under title vii,and violation of the epa.
the school district moved for summary judgment on all claims.on february,the district court found no direct evidence of discrimination and applied the mcdonnell douglas framework to determine whether stover made out a prima facie case of discrimination under title vii.the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence in the record to withstand a motion for summary judgment as to the title vii race and sex discrimination claims.specifically,the district court stated the following 
there is evidence in the record that stover and oubre performed similar duties and that their job functions overlapped and that oubre assumed some of stover duties during her employment at the school district.there is also evidence in the record demonstrating differences between oubre and stover jobs.at certain times oubre and stover apparently shared the same title of administrative assistant.
the district court denied the school district motion for summary judgment as to the race and sex discrimination claims under title vii.citing the same evidence,the district court similarly denied the school district motion as to the claim under the epa.
the district court also held that there was sufficient evidence to support stover retaliation claim and denied the school district motion as to that claim.the court pointed to evidence that there had been no performance problems on stover part until oubre was hired,and that in,and,there were increasing issues with stover performance being raised by davis and hopkins.the court granted the school district motion as to stover claim of constructive discharge,holding that the alleged conduct did not rise to the level of constructive discharge 
the case proceeded to a jury trial on february.the district court precluded certain evidence,including evidence of the school district pattern and practice not to advertise positions of employment.citing frank xerox,cir,the district court held that pattern and practice evidence should be excluded.
during the jury trial,the school district moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.the district court took the motion under advisement and permitted the case to go to the jury.the jury returned a unanimous special verdict in favor of the school district on all claims,and the district court entered final judgment in favor of the school district on february.stover filed a motion for a new trial,which the district court denied.
the school district moved for an award of attorney fees and costs,which stover opposed.the district court awarded attorney fees to the school district in the amount of and taxed costs against stover in the amount of.in deciding the attorney fees issue,the district court stated that there were n umerous examples of the diverseness of stover and oubre jobs brought out during the testimony.
while at trial it was obvious that the case was baseless,frivolous and without merit,the plaintiff and her attorney did not have the benefit of all of the information learned in discovery at the time of filing suit.however,the court finds that the latest time that the plaintiff should have realized that her suit was frivolous and baseless was by the conclusion of discovery.she certainly should have recognized this at that time.therefore,the court does hereby find that from the end of discovery forward the plaintiff should be required to reimburse the defendant attorney s fees.
stover filed a timely notice of appeal,assigning the following errors by the district court not permitting alleged admissions of discrimination and discriminatory intent to be considered as direct evidence of discrimination at the trial permitting evidence of oubre qualifications during the trial permitting evidence during the trial that attacked stover character excluding evidence of the school district pattern and practice precluding evidence regarding constructive discharge submitting the same actor jury instruction to the jury the jury verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence and awarding attorney fees to the school district.we now turn to a discussion of these assigned errors.
ii.discussion 
stover eight assignments of error fall into five broad categories the summary judgment ruling on the constructive discharge claim,evidentiary rulings during the trial proceedings,objections to the jury instructions,the jury verdict,and the award of attorney fees.we will discuss each category in turn.
constructive discharge claim 
the district court granted the school district motion for summary judgment on stover claim for constructive discharge.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.lemaire.dep t of transp,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.a genuine issue of material fact exists if the summary judgment evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the.anderson liberty lobby,d.all the facts and evidence must be taken in the light most favorable to the.lemaire,at.
to establish a constructive discharge claim,an employee must offer evidence that the employer made the employee working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable employee would feel compelled to resign.brown bunge,cir quoting barrow new orleans steamship ass n,cir.this objective test has been referred to as the reasonable employee test.see haley alliance compressor llc,cir.the evidence must demonstrate a greater severity or pervasiveness of harassment than the minimum required to prove a hostile working environment.landgraf usi film,cir citation omitted.we have considered the relevancy of the following events in determining whether a reasonable employee would feel compelled to resign 
demotion reduction in salary reduction in job responsibilities reassignment to menial or degrading work badgering,harassment,or humiliation by the employer calculated to encourage the employee resignation or offers of early retirement that would make the employee worse off whether the offer were accepted or not.
aryain stores.lp,cir quoting hunt rapides healthcare,llc,cir.
stover contends that she was not paid appropriately,but she does not present any evidence that she received a reduction in salary.rather,stover received increases in her salary.also,she does not argue that she received a demotion,reassignment to menial or degrading work,or offers of early retirement,so neither of these factors supports stover assertion that she felt compelled to resign.as to the reduction of job responsibilities,stover actually testified,that her plate was full and she was happy for the help.it is therefore inconsistent to assert that she felt compelled to resign based in part on a reduction in job responsibilities.
the only factor stover can rely on to meet the reasonable employee test is badgering,harassment,or humiliation by the employer calculated to encourage the employee resignation.aryain,at.stover contends that she was not provided the same career development opportunities as oubre her complaints of discrimination were not investigated she was not allowed comp time while oubre and others were allowed comp time hopkins exhibited anger,violence,shouting,and waved his arms at stover and she was excluded from prestigious retreats.the evidence that stover cites in support of her constructive discharge claim does not amount to conditions or an environment so intolerable that a reasonable employee would feel compelled to resign.at best,the evidence shows that stover was disgruntled that oubre,a administrator,was provided greater benefits while employed with the school district than she was provided and that she encountered difficulty in dealing with her supervisor,hopkins.
even assuming arguendo that stover was subjected to a hostile working environment,none of the evidence increases the severity or pervasiveness of any harassment to the level required to support a constructive discharge claim.see brown,at affirming grant of summary judgment even where employee was demoted and given fewer job responsibilities.we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in the school district favor on the constructive discharge claim.
evidentiary rulings 
stover challenges several evidentiary rulings.we review evidentiary rulings under the deferential abuse of discretion standard.kelly boeing petroleum,cir.we will reverse a judgment for an evidentiary ruling only if it affected the substantial rights of the parties.eeoc manville sales,cir citation omitted.
direct evidence 
stover argues that evidence that the school district admitted discriminatory conduct and violation of the epa should have been considered as direct evidence of discrimination,and stover should have been allowed to argue to the jury the impact and importance of direct evidence.notably,the only evidence of the alleged admissions was stover testimony.she contends that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing the direct evidence mode of evidentiary production,and if it would have been permitted,the mcdonnell douglas framework could have been avoided.the school district argues that the district court allowed stover to present the statements she contends were direct evidence,and therefore,the jury had the benefit of weighing stover testimony and credibility in reaching its jury verdict.
stover discrimination claims survived summary judgment and proceeded to trial.stover does not argue that the evidence was excluded at trial,but rather,she concedes that her proof was there.at trial,stover testified to many statements that she contends were the school district admissions that it was violating the epa and laws.for example,stover testified to the following at trial 
when i spoke with hopkins in august of after davis notified us that he was hiring alan oubre,hopkins made indication to davis in my presence that davis could not employ alan oubre as administrative assistant as it was a violation of the equal pay act and other laws.davis said,well,we just call him something else.
i asked hopkins if there was a job announcement or any posting indicating that a second position was being created.and hopkins said there was none.that they just wanted to hire a white male.
hopkins said oubre got the job because he was white.
when a full trial on the merits has been conducted,as in this case,our focus is on whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support the jury finding of no race or sex on the plaintiff prima facie case or the mcdonnell douglas framework.raggs mississippi power light,cir accord dilworth cont l const,cir unpublished.
at trial,davis testified that it would have been highly inappropriate to have stover part of the cabinet.she did bring to the table the skills and knowledge,and she was part of the decision making team davis also testified that while stover did attend board meetings,she attended the meetings to take the minutes.according to davis,stover did not create agenda items,but rather,she typed and organized information that was provided to her.davis also testified that stover was not qualified for the position which oubre filled.there was sufficient evidence presented at trial for the jury to conclude that the school district did not discriminate against stover on the basis of race or sex.therefore,stover can not prevail on this assignment of error.
comparison of qualifications 
next,stover argues that the jury should not have been permitted to consider oubre qualifications.stover argues in her brief,however,that an issue at trial was whether stover and oubre were similarly situated.the district court properly instructed the jury that to prevail on the title vii discrimination claim,stover had to show by a preponderance of the evidence that,inter alia,others similarly situated were treated more favorably because of their race or gender.further,stover claim under the epa required a comparison of stover and oubre skill,effort,and responsibility for the performance of their jobs.the epa requires that an employer not discriminate between employees on the basis of sex for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill,effort,and responsibility,and which are performed under similar working conditions.d.to determine whether an epa violation occurred,the district court properly permitted evidence demonstrating the skill,effort,and responsibility required of the jobs performed by oubre and stover.the district court did not abuse its discretion by permitting this evidence at trial.
character evidence 
stover also contends that the district court erroneously permitted evidence that stover destroyed or deleted computer information.the school district argues that it was entitled to defend itself against stover allegations of retaliation.stover argued that she did not have one blight on her record until she complained of discrimination when oubre was hired.the school district contends that it countered against stover claim of retaliation with evidence of a pattern of stover conduct that showed a deteriorating professional attitude and work ethic,and the deletion of the files on the day stover resigned was the final demonstration of her unprofessional conduct.
one of the issues at trial was stover claim of retaliation.in overruling the objection to the evidence at trial,the district court stated that stover had portrayed herself to be a victim and work attitude was at issue.the court permitted the evidence for purposes of impeachment.the court also ruled that it was more probative than prejudicial.having fully reviewed the record,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion on this issue.
systematic practices of the school district 
stover argues that the district court erroneously refused to permit evidence of the school district business habit and practice of not advertising positions or allowing competition for positions.stover contends that it was plainly discriminatory not to advertise the position.she also states that pattern and practice evidence should have been allowed to prove intent pretext.further,stover argues that the school district hiring system allowed complete racial and gender discrimination.
the school district argues that regardless of the district court exclusion of this evidence by granting the school district motion in limine,the jury heard the evidence,and therefore,the issue is moot at trial,stover testified that the district was culpable for failing to advertise th e position.davis testified to the following 
q.did oubre have any competition for the job 
q.did you place any advertisement for the position 
the jury,therefore,heard evidence that the school district did not advertise the position for which oubre was hired.
the school district also contends that failure to have a policy requiring employment positions to be advertised does not mean its hiring practices are discriminatory.we agree that the lack of a policy requiring advertisement under these circumstances is not evidence of discrimination.stover provides no mississippi law or school board policy requiring the school district to advertise the position for which oubre was hired or any other position in the district.also,stover contention that the school district systematic practice of not advertising positions allowed complete racial and gender discrimination is unsupported by any evidence in the trial record.we find no reversible error on this issue.
jury instructions 
stover argues that the district court erroneously permitted the same actor jury instruction.specifically,stover states that the district court instructed the jury that it could infer that discrimination was not the motive behind the challenged employment action if hopkins hired her.we will reverse a jury verdict based on the jury charge only if the charge as a whole leaves us with substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations.mccullough beech aircraft,cir citation omitted.
the referenced jury instruction provided as follows 
if you find that the same person who hired the plaintiff is also one of the people who allegedly discriminated against her,you may consider it inherently inconsistent that an individual who is willing to hire or promote a person who is a member of a protected class will discriminate against that same individual because she is a member of that class.
this instruction is not a misstatement of the law.compare haun ideal,cir stating that such evidence is relevant but declining to establish a rule that no inference of discrimination could arise under the same actor circumstances,with brown csc logic,cir noting acceptance of same actor inference by several other circuits and expressing approval of the inference.this assignment of error is without merit.
jury verdict 
stover contends that the jury verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence,and therefore,we should reverse.the school district argues that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict.challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence must be raised in a federal rule of civil procedure a motion for judgment as a matter of law before submission of the case to the jury.united states ex rel.wallace flintco,cir.during the trial,stover did not raise a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law before the case went to the jury only the school district raised such a motion.where stover failed to raise a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law,we consider the sufficiency of the evidence under a plain error standard reversing only if the judgment complained of results in a manifest miscarriage of justice.flintco,at.
on plain error review the question before this court is not whether there was substantial evidence to support the jury verdict,but whether there was any evidence to support the jury verdict.mccann texas city refining,cir.if any evidence supports the jury verdict,the verdict will be upheld.flintco,at citing polanco city of austin,cir accord dilworth.at we have reviewed the record and confirmed that dilworth indeed failed to move for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence before the case was submitted to the jury.we must therefore consider dilworth current challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence under the plain error standard.
in this case,there clearly exists some evidence to support the jury determination.when davis was questioned about the allegation of race discrimination,he testified that 
i never in my whole career based any decision on race.that just simply was not a part of the way i did business or functioned as a leader i t was disconcerting because it was just so farfetched.it was just totally fictitious that any decision was made in that central office based on race.it just did happen.
there was also evidence from which the jury could conclude that stover and oubre were not similarly situated.while oubre and stover at some time carried the same title of administrative assistant,davis explained that 
there are different degrees of assistance.some assistance takes a highly qualified person with some kind of administrative certification like harper then there might be someone else who might be called administrative assistant who does have to be nearly as highly qualified and may not do the kind of heavy lifting that another person who may have that title.
there was also evidence from which the jury could conclude that stover and oubre positions were not substantially equal.davis testified that there were vast,vast differences in what oubre and stover would do.davis also testified that stover attended meetings to take the minutes and was part of the decision making team.oubre,on the other hand,was a member of the cabinet.according to davis,oubre supervised the technology department,helped to supervise the department of building and grounds and the department of transportation,and he managed grants.evidence supports the jury verdict,and this assignment of error is also without merit.
award of attorney fees 
finally,we turn to stover argument that the district court erroneously awarded attorney fees to the school district.the parties are not clear as to the designation of attorney fees and costs.the school district states in its brief that the district court taxed costs against stover in the amount of.the docket in the court below indicates that costs were actually taxed against stover in the amount of.the district court order provides that attorney fees in the amount of and costs of are assessed to plaintiff addie stover.the district court separately considered an exhibit seeking costs in the amount of and other exhibits pertaining to
