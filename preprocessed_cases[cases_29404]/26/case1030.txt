the false claims act makes liable anyone who knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government.a.in this case,relators have raised allegations that the university of phoenix knowingly made false statements,and caused false statements to be made,that resulted in the payment by the federal department of education of hundreds of millions of dollars.despite this axiomatic fit between the operative statute and the allegations made,respondent claims that relators legal theory holds no water.the district court agreed,dismissing the suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.we reverse.
when an educational institution wishes to receive federal subsidies under title iv and the higher education act,it must enter into a program participation agreement with the department of education doe,in which it agrees to abide by a panoply of statutory,regulatory,and contractual requirements.one of these requirements is a ban on incentive compensation a ban on the institution paying recruiters on a basis.the ban prohibits schools from provid ing any commission,bonus,or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance.a.this requirement is meant to curb the risk that recruiters will sign up poorly qualified students who will derive little benefit from the subsidy and may be unable or unwilling to repay federally guaranteed loans.united states ex rel.main oakland city,cir,cert.denied,d.the ban was enacted based on evidence of serious program abuses.see,at abuses in federal student aid programs noting testimony that contests were held whereby sales representatives earned incentive awards for enrolling the highest number of student s for a given period,at,reprinted in,noting that the new provisions include prohibiting the use of commissioned sales persons and recruiters.
this case involves allegations under the false claims act that the university of phoenix the university knowingly made false promises to comply with the incentive compensation ban in order to become eligible to receive title iv funds.appellants,mary hendow and julie albertson relators,two former enrollment counselors at the university,allege that the university falsely certifies each year that it is in compliance with the incentive compensation ban while intentionally and knowingly violating that requirement.relators allege that these false representations,coupled with later claims for payment of title iv funds,constitute false claims under a a.
first,relators allege that the university,with full knowledge,flagrantly violates the incentive compensation ban.they claim that the university compensates enrollment counselors based directly upon enrollment activities,ranking counselors according to their number of enrollments and giving the counselors not only higher salaries but also benefits,incentives,and gifts.relators allege that the university also urges enrollment counselors to enroll students without reviewing their transcripts to determine their academic qualifications to attend the university,thus encouraging counselors to enroll students based on numbers alone.relator albertson,in particular,alleges that she was given a specific target number of students to recruit,and that upon reaching that benchmark her salary increased by more than.relator hendow specifically alleges that she won trips and home electronics as a result of enrolling large numbers of students.
second,relators allege considerable fraud on the part of the university to mask its violation of the incentive compensation ban.they claim that the university head of enrollment openly brags that i t all about the numbers.it will always be about the numbers.but we need to show the department of education what they want to see.to deceive the doe,relators allege,the university creates two separate employment files for its enrollment real file containing performance reviews based on improper quantitative factors,and one fake file containing performance reviews based on legitimate qualitative factors.the fake file is what the doe allegedly sees.relators further allege a series of university policy changes deliberately designed to obscure the fact that enrollment counselors are compensated on a basis,such as altering pay scales to make it less obvious that they are adjusted based on the number of students enrolled.
third and finally,relators allege that the university submits false claims to the government.claims for payment of title iv funds can be made in a number of ways,once a school signs its program participation agreement and thus becomes eligible.for instance,in the pell grant context,students submit funding requests directly or with school assistance to the doe.in contrast,under the federal family education loan program,which includes stafford loans,students and schools jointly submit an application to a private lender on behalf of the student,and a guaranty agency makes the eventual claim for payment to the united states only in the event of default.relators allege that the university submits false claims in both of these ways.they claim that the university,with full knowledge that it is ineligible for pell grant funds because of its violation of the incentive compensation ban,submits requests for those funds directly to the doe,resulting in a direct transfer of the funds into a university account.they further claim that the university,again with knowledge that it has intentionally violated the incentive compensation ban,submits requests to private lenders for loans.
on may,the district court dismissed the relators complaint with prejudice under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.relators appealed on june.the united states department of justice submitted a brief as amicus curiae supporting the reversal of the district court.because this case comes to us on a motion to dismiss,we assume that the facts as alleged are true,and examine only whether relators allegations support a cause of action under the false claims act under either of two possible theories.see zimmerman city of oakland,cir we review dismissals under rule b de novo,accepting as true all allegations of fact in the complaint and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.we hold that they do,and that either theory is viable.
the district court below rejected both of relators theories for why they have validly alleged that the university submitted false or fraudulent claims to the government in violation of the false claims act.first,the court rejected relators claim under the false certification theory,as treated by this court in united states ex rel.hopper anton,cir,because the operative statute here only requires that the university enter into an agreement,and does not require a certification.second,the district court rejected relators claim under the promissory fraud theory,because they did not identif y any certification which is a prerequisite for the university to receive federal funds.these rulings conflated the proper analysis of false claims act liability,and so we will discuss the relevant theories in more detail.
in an archetypal qui tam false claims action,such as where a private company overcharges under a government contract,the claim for payment is itself literally false or fraudulent.see anton,at.the false claims act,however,is not limited to such facially false or fraudulent claims for payment.see id.rather,the false claims act is intended to reach all types of fraud,without qualification,that might result in financial loss to the government.united states,d.more specifically,in amending the false claims act in,congress emphasized that the scope of false or fraudulent claims should be broadly construed 
e ach and every claim submitted under a contract,loan guarantee,or other agreement which was originally obtained by means of false statements or other corrupt or fraudulent conduct,or in violation of any statute or applicable regulation,constitutes a false claim.

the principles embodied in this broad construction of a false or fraudulent claim have given rise to two doctrines that attach potential false claims act liability to claims for payment that are not explicitly independently false false certification either express or implied and promissory fraud.see harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir.
false certification 
many different courts have held that a claim under the false claims act can be false where a party merely falsely certifies compliance with a statute or regulation as a condition to government payment.see,id.at mikes straus,cir united states ex rel.quinn omnicare,cir.the leading case on false certification in the ninth circuit is united states ex rel.hopper anton.
in anton,a brought a false claims act suit against the los angeles unified school district lausd for allegedly submitting false claims for federal funds while in knowing violation of an underlying statute granting funds for special education programs the individuals with disabilities education act,idea.at.in particular,the relator alleged that lausd method of evaluating potential student eligibility for the program violated the idea.id.lausd allegedly submitted forms stating the number of eligible students in the district cashed checks that were partially comprised of federal funds and submitted triennial certifications averring that lausd will meet all applicable requirements of state and federal law and regulations,including general compliance with the idea.id.at.we held that false claims act liability can attach under the theory of false certification,although the relators had not presented sufficient evidence of fraud.id.
in anton,we explained the theory of false certification,identifying two major considerations whether the false statement is the cause of the government providing the benefit and whether any relation exists between the subject matter of the false statement and the event triggering government sic loss.id.at quoting john boese,civil false claims and qui tam actions to.we also held that m ere regulatory violations do not give rise to a viable fca action,but rather,i t is the false certification of compliance which creates liability when certification is a prerequisite to obtaining a government benefit.id.at emphasis in original.from the principles underlying these two statements,we created four conditions necessary to succeed on the false certification theory of false claims act liability.
first,we emphasized the necessity of a false claim,rather than a mere unintentional violation.we did not hold in anton that regulatory violations will go unchecked by the false claims act,but we did agree with the lower court reasoning that for a breach of contract,or violation of regulations or law,or receipt of money from the government to give rise to an action under the false claims act,i t requires a false claim.at.we went on to note that the fatal defect in anton was not that the claimed infraction was a regulatory violation,but that there was a lack of a false claim.id.at.thus,we established that to succeed on a false certification theory,some falsity must be alleged.
second,we emphasized the central importance of the scienter element to liability under the false claims act,holding that false claims must in fact be false when made.id.citing united states shah,cir.in fact,we held,f or a certified statement to be false under the act,it must be an intentional,palpable lie.id.citing hagood sonoma county water agency,cir.we also noted that some request for payment containing falsities made with scienter,with knowledge of the falsity and with intent to deceive must exist.id.at.in short,we made clear that a palpably false statement,known to be a lie when it is made,is required for a party to be found liable under the false claims act.
we note that the university and the district court below have taken our holdings to mean that the word certification has some paramount and talismanic significance,apparently believing that a palpably false statement does not bring with it false claims liability,while a palpably false certification will.this facile distinction would make it all too easy for claimants to evade the law.the fourth circuit rightly noted that false claims liability attaches because of the fraud surrounding the efforts to obtain the contract or benefit status,or the payments thereunder.harrison,at emphasis added.that the theory of liability is commonly called false certification is no indication that certification is being used with technical precision,or as a term of art the theory could just as easily be called the false statement of compliance with a government regulation that is a precursor to government funding theory,but that is not as succinct.furthermore,because the word certification does not appear in a or a,there is no sense in parsing it with the close attention typically attending an exercise in statutory interpretation.so long as the statement in question is knowingly false when made,it matters not whether it is a certification,assertion,statement,or secret handshake false claims liability can attach.
third,we held that the false statement or course of conduct must be material to the government decision to pay out moneys to the claimant.this is plain from our focus on whether the false statement is the cause of the government providing the benefit and whether any relation exists between the subject matter of the false statement and the event triggering government sic loss.anton,at.we also stated that the relevant certification of compliance must be both a prerequisite to obtaining a government benefit,and a sine qua non of receipt of government funding,id.at.we further held that the government funding must be conditioned upon certifications of compliance.id.
this approach has been followed by a number of other circuits to adopt the false certification theory of false claims liability see mikes,at holding that false certification theory applies when governing federal rules are a precondition to payment united states ex rel.thompson healthcare,cir holding that false claims liability attaches only where the government has conditioned payment of a claim upon a claimant certification of compliance with a statute or regulation,united states,holding that false statement of compliance must be critical to the decision to pay,aff.once again,we note that there is no special significance to the term certification in determining materiality the question is merely whether the false assertion,or relevant to the government decision to confer a benefit.
fourth and most obviously,for a false statement or course of action to be actionable under the false certification theory of false claims liability,it is necessary that it involve an actual claim,which is to say,a call on the government fisc.this is from the statutory language,of course,which requires a claim paid or approved by the government.a.in anton,the case involved direct receipt of federal funding,but we agree with the fourth circuit that a claim arises whenever the government is asked to pay out money or to forfeit moneys due.harrison,at.
promissory fraud 
another approach to finding false claims act liability in the absence of an explicitly false claim is the promissory fraud or theory.this theory,rather than specifically requiring a false statement of compliance with government regulations,is somewhat broader.it holds that liability will attach to each claim submitted to the government under a contract,when the contract or extension of government benefit was originally obtained through false statements or fraudulent conduct.see,at united states ex rel.marcus hess.in hess,the supreme court found contractors liable under the false claims act for claims submitted under government contracts that the defendants obtained via collusive bidding.id.the court determined that t his fraud did not spend itself with the execution of the contract,and so each claim submitted under the contracts constituted a false or fraudulent claim.id.at.in other words,subseque
