this case presents the question whether an elementary teacher for the los angeles unified school district was entitled to classification as a permanent employee,or whether she was a probationary employee whom the district could,in its discretion,choose not to reemploy for the ensuing school year.the answer to the question turns on whether the teacher status as a probationary employee began on the validity date of her preliminary teaching credential,or on the date stated in her contract with the district,which was executed shortly after she actually received the credential and presented it to the district.we conclude that the education code does not require the district to classify the teacher as probationary retroactive to the validity date of her teaching credential.accordingly,the teacher probationary status began on the date stated in her contract she was not entitled to classification as a permanent employee and the district timely notified her of its decision not to reemploy her.
factual,legal and procedural background 
marsha fine began working as a teacher at the broadous avenue elementary school in.at that time,she served under an emergency permit.the permit is a provisional credential under which persons with a baccalaureate degree who have passed the state basic skills proficiency test may be hired to teach.see.fine was offered and accepted several successive contracts with the los angeles unified school district as a provisional teacher under emergency permits.
on june,fine signed her fourth successive contract with the district,for employment as a provisional teacher for the school year.the contract showed an emergency permit effective july.the contract,like her previous contracts,specified a starting date and an ending date,stated it could be terminated at any time without cause at the discretion of the district,and stated fine understanding that service under an emergency permit did not count toward permanent status tenure with the district.
on september,the college of education at the california state university csu at northridge sent fine a letter entitled credential recommendation.the letter verified that fine had completed all requirements necessary for the recommendation for the following credential or certificate multiple subject exam preliminary.the letter stated the credential will be issued effective august,and provided a telephone number for further information regarding the recommendation or issuance of the credential.fine showed the university recommendation letter to the school secretary,but did not take it or send it to anyone downtown.
in late february,fine received her credential,duly issued by the state of california commission on teacher credentialing.see.the credential stated it was valid august,to september.fine sent a copy of the credential to the personnel division of the district in downtown los angeles.on march,fine received a note from the district credentials assistant stating that the original credential was required for registration purposes a few days later,fine brought the original credential to the district 
on march,upon receiving fine credential,the district offered and fine accepted a new contract.the contract was for employment as a probationary teacher.on the same date,fine signed a verification of seniority date for teachers,verifying that her first day of paid service as a probationary teacher was march.
unlike a contract for a provisional teacher,a contract for a probationary teacher automatically continues in effect for each succeeding school year thereafter,until terminated by resignation or by action of the board of education.fine continued to teach under the march,contract for the remainder of the school year,during the full school year,and during the school year.
on march,the district notified fine that she would not be reemployed during the next succeeding school year.the district letter stated that its decision was made under education code section.section has several pertinent provisions 
an employee who,after employment for two complete consecutive school years in a position requiring certification qualifications,such as fine,is reelected for the next succeeding school year to a position requiring certification qualifications,shall,at the commencement of the succeeding school year be classified as and become a permanent employee of the district,subd.b.
the governing board must notify the employee,on or before march of the employee second complete consecutive school year of employment by the district,of its decision to reelect or not to reelect the employee for the succeeding school year.if notice is not given by march,the employee is deemed reelected,and becomes a permanent employee,subd.b.
section applies only to probationary employees.another provision of the education code,section,specifies that service by a person under a provisional as fine emergency not counted in computing the service required as a prerequisite for classification as a permanent employee.
when fine received the district notice of its decision not to reelect her to her position for the next school year,she consulted counsel,and on may,demanded retraction of the notice as untimely.her position was that 
the teaching credential she received in late february and registered with the district in march was valid from august.therefore,as of august,and for the complete school year,her proper status by law should have been probationary not provisional.her status was corrected in march,when the district classified her as a probationary teacher.
the following school year,which she served as a probationary teacher,was therefore her second complete consecutive school year as a probationary employee.
she received no notice by march,of a decision not to reelect her for the school year.therefore,under section,at the beginning of the school year she was a permanent employee of the district,and could not be terminated except under provisions applicable to permanent employees.in short,the district notice of on march,was one year too late.
the district refused to retract its notice.
on july,fine filed a petition for writ of mandate.the trial court denied the writ,concluding the district had no mandatory duty to classify fine as a probationary employee earlier than march.the court observed 
when a provisional teacher presents a preliminary or clear credential to the district,which fine did in february,the employee may be offered a probationary contract.the district has discretion over whether to offer the contract or not.petitioner cites nothing requiring the district to offer a probationary contract upon being informed that a teacher is being recommended for a credential.
here,the district employed fine as a probationary teacher effective,when she presented the credential.her probationary period did not start until her provisional period ended upon signing her probationary contract and verification on.just because she was recommended for a credential effective a retroactive date does not mean that fine was working under the credential after that date.
judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate was entered on january,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
this case turns on the question whether the district was legally required to classify fine as a probationary employee as of the validity date stated in her teaching credential,august.if so,she acquired permanent status,known as tenure,when the district continued her employment for the school year,because she had been employed by the district as a probationary employee for two complete consecutive school years.if not,the district was free to decide,as it did,not to employ her for the school year.
we conclude fine had no statutory right to probationary status as of august,and,ipso facto,no right to permanent status based on that date part a,post.we also reject fine alternate theory that she was a temporary employee during the school year,and as a consequence was deemed a probationary employee for that year by operation of education code section part b,post.
fine contention that she was serving under her preliminary credential as of its validity date,and therefore was entitled to probationary status has of that date,is without merit.
the education code contains no express guidance on the question we are required to decide whether the district,when it offered fine a probationary contract on march,was required to classify her as probationary retroactively,to the validity date of her teaching credential.at its core,the question involves the construction of section,which provides 
service by a person under a provisional credential shall not be included in computing the service required as a prerequisite to attainment of,or eligibility to,classification as a permanent employee of a school district.
under section,if fine was serving under her emergency permit until she received and presented her teaching credential to the district in march,her service before march does not count toward tenure.on the other hand,if as of august,fine was serving under her subsequently issued credential,rather than under her emergency permit,she would be entitled to probationary classification for tenure purposes as of that date thus,the issue is placed in sharp relief was fine service between august,and march,service under a provisional credential,as the district contends,or was it service under the teaching credential that was issued in february with a retroactive validity date 
neither party briefing squarely addresses this issue.fine merely contends i t is clear she was no longer serving under an emergency permit as of august,the validity date of the teaching credential she received in late february.the district contends it had no obligation to recognize fine teaching credential until it knew she had the credential.consequently,fine was working under her emergency permit until that time 
we conclude that a teacher serving under an emergency permit continues to serve under that permit,and under the contract to which she agreed,until the teacher is issued a credential and registers it with the district.otherwise stated,the district has no duty to classify a teacher as probationary retroactive to the validity date of her credential.no statutory provision suggests a contrary conclusion,and precedent confirms that contract terms to which a teacher has agreed should not be abrogated unless the statutory mandate is clear.moreover,our conclusion comports with related statutory provisions,as well as considerations of practicality and common sense.and,in fine case,it comports with equitable considerations as well.
first,the education code does not explicitly or by implication tie the effective date of a teaching credential to a teacher classification.to the extent the statute suggests anything,the implication is to the contrary.
section governs the classification of probationary employees,and the subsequent section governs the time of classification 
the classification shall be made at the time of employment and thereafter in the month of july of each school year.
section does not require classification at any time other than at the time of employment and in july of each subsequent school year,and section does not authorize retroactive classification.in fine case,the district offered her a contract in the summer of as a provisional teacher under an emergency permit,the only credential then existing.when she received her preliminary teaching credential and presented it to the district in march,the district,in accord with its regular practice,immediately offered fine employment as a probationary teacher.the district classified fine as probationary at the time of employment on march,which was the earliest time it could possibly have done so.
another relevant provision appears in the education code chapter on teacher credentialing.section governs the e ffect of registration of a teaching credential,and strongly suggests the registration of a credential operates to authorize the teacher service under that credential,rather than the validity date of the credential.section authorizes a county board of education to provide for the registration of any certification or other document authorizing its holder to serve in a position requiring certification qualifications,such as fine.it also states 
such registration shall authorize the service of the holder as an employee in the capacity in which and for the period of time for which the certification or other document is valid.
therefore,registration is,by statute,the sine qua non for a teacher service under a credential.without registration of the credential,service is not authorized.fine contends that registration authorizes her service retroactively,since section states authorization is for the period of time for which the certification is valid.we decline to read the statute in that manner.the ordinary meaning of the sentence,when considered in its entirety,is that registration of a credential authorizes service from the date of the registration and for as long thereafter as the credential is valid.
in short,the statute does not compel classification retroactive to the validity date of a teaching credential.section suggests otherwise,as does section.absent a clear statutory mandate,we are not at liberty to abrogate the clear terms of the contract between fine and the district.see santa barbara federation of teachers santa barbara high sch.dist.d.persons who accepted contracts as temporary teachers were not estopped to claim probationary status if the statutory scheme compels the latter classification however,t he statutory mandate must be clear before the terms of the contracts may be abrogated.
second,considerations of practicality and common sense support the conclusion that fine was not serving under a credential that was not physically issued to or received by her until february,or registered with the district until march.the only documentation either party had until fine received her credential was fine emergency permit and the provisional contract to which both parties agreed we can only conclude,as a matter of contract,that she was serving under those documents and subject to their terms until march,when fine presented her credential to the district and both parties agreed to new terms.the statute does not compel a different conclusion,and we therefore can not ignore the terms of the parties contracts.santa barbara federation of teachers santa barbara high sch,supra,d at.
third,no inequity to fine flows from our construction of the statute.in addition to the contract to which fine agreed,she executed a verification of her seniority date of march.the document stated fine understanding that it would be used to verify her first day of paid service as a probationary teacher it stated fine understanding that,if she thought an error had been made,she must bring it to the immediate attention of district personnel.the trial court found that fine read and understood the contract and did not find the date was in error.an annual evaluation of her performance,which fine signed in may,showed her classification as,a probationary teacher.fine took no action challenging the march,date until the district chose not to reelect her for the school year.in short,this is not a case of the district manipulation of the classification system to fine detriment if anything,the reverse is the case.american federation of teachers board of education d.teacher who knew when she entered into her employment contract that she was a temporary employee was guilty of laches and was estopped from claiming probationary status teacher had duty to raise the issue of her employment status in a timely manner,rather than waiting until the board could no longer comply with the probationary notice requirements.
in sum,the statute imposed no duty on the district to backdate fine probationary status to the validity date of her teaching credential.we turn now to fine second theory.
fine alternative contention,that she became a probationary employee by virtue of statutory provisions governing temporary employees,is without merit.
fine contends that sections,and mandate a nunc pro tunc change in her status for the entire school year.we disagree.those sections expressly apply to temporary employees,not to employees serving under provision
