article xiii b,section of the california constitution requires the state to bear the costs of new mandates on local government.however,if a local government entity voluntarily undertakes the costs,they do not constitute a reimbursable state mandate.see,san diego unified school dist.commission on state mandates cal th,d,san diego unified school dist.department of finance commission on state mandates kern high school dist.cal th,d,kern high school dist.the public safety officers procedural bill of rights act pobra initially enacted in stats,ch,requires state and local government agencies that employ peace officers to provide them with procedural rights and protections when they are subjected to investigation,interrogation or discipline,et.
in this case plaintiff state department of finance finance petitioned for a writ of administrative mandamus to overturn the decision of defendant commission on state mandates the commission that pobra constitutes a program for school districts and special districts that employ peace officers.the superior court denied the petition.we decide pobra is not a reimbursable mandate as to school districts and special districts that are permitted by statute,but not required,to employ peace officers who supplement the general law enforcement units of cities and counties.the judgment denying finance petition for writ of administrative mandamus is reversed.
factual and procedural background 
in,the city of sacramento filed a test claim with the commission pursuant to the versions of government code sections and then in effect,seeking reimbursement under article xiii b,section,of the costs incurred in complying with the pobra procedural requirements.in,pursuant to the version of government code section then in effect,the commission held a public hearing on the test claim and issued a statement of decision determining that certain pobra procedural protections exceeded federal and state constitutional due process requirements and imposed reimbursable costs upon cities,counties,school districts and special districts under article xiii b,section.in,pursuant to government code section,the commission adopted parameters and guidelines for the reimbursement of the costs incurred by those local government entities in providing the pobra procedural protections determined to be.
in,the legislature enacted government code section,directing the commission to review its statement of decision regarding the pobra test claim and make any modifications necessary to this decision to clarify whether the subject legislation imposed a mandate consistent with the california supreme court decision in san diego unified school dist.commission of state mandates cal th,d,and other applicable court decisions,added by stat,ch,eff.july.
pursuant to government code section,on april,the commission held a public hearing.the only pertinent factual testimony at the hearing was an assertion that most school districts do not employ peace officers of the approximately local educational agencies receiving state school safety grant funding,only approximately of those reported using the funding for hiring peace officers.after the matter was submitted,the commission adopted a statement of decision reconsidering its statement of decision.the commission decided that pobra imposes,consistent with san diego unified school,supra,cal th,d,a partial,reimbursable program on cities,counties,school districts,and special districts identified in government code section that employ peace officers.as to the school districts and special districts,the commission reasoned as follows 
for the reasons below,the commission finds that the pobra legislation constitutes a program for school districts and the special districts identified in government code section that employ peace officers.
under a strict application of the city of merced state of california d.case,the requirements of the pobra legislation would not constitute a program within the meaning of article xiii b,section for school districts and the special districts that employ peace officers for the simple reason that the ability of the school district or special district to decide whether to employ peace officers could control or perhaps even avoid the extra costs of the pobra legislation.but here,the legislature has declared that,as a matter of statewide concern,it is necessary for pobra to apply to all public safety officers,as defined in the legislation.as previously indicated,the california supreme court in baggett gates cal d,concluded that the peace officers identified in government code section of the pobra legislation provide an essential service to the public and that the consequences of a breakdown in employment relations between peace officers and their employers would create a clear and present threat to the health,safety,and welfare of the citizens of the state.
in addition,in,the supreme court in in re randy cal th,d,determined that school districts,apart from education,have an obligation to protect pupils from other children,and also to protect teachers themselves from violence by the few students whose conduct in recent years has prompted national concern.the court further held that california fulfills its obligations under the safe schools provision of the constitution cal,art.i,subd.c by permitting local school districts to establish a police or security department to enforce rules governing student conduct and discipline.the arguments by the school districts regarding the safe schools provision of the constitution caused the supreme court in san diego unified school dist.to question the application of the city of merced case.
thus,as indicated by the supreme court in san diego unified school,supra,cal th,d,a finding that the pobra legislation does not constitute a program for school districts and special districts identified in government code section would conflict with past decisions like carmel valley fire protection dist.state d,where the court found a mandated program for providing protective clothing and safety equipment to firefighters and made it clear that p olice and fire protection are two of the most essential and basic functions of local government.the constitutional definition of local government for purposes of article xiii b,section includes school districts and special districts.cal,art.xiii b,subd.d.
accordingly,the commission finds that pobra constitutes a program for school districts that employ peace officers.the commission further finds that pobra constitutes a program for the special districts identified in government code section.these districts include police protection districts,harbor or port police,transit police,peace officers employed by airport districts,peace officers employed by a housing authority,and peace officers employed by fire protection districts.fns.omitted.
in january,finance petitioned for a writ of administrative mandamus to overturn the decision of the commission as to school districts and special districts permitted but not required to hire peace officers.the commission answered,opposing the petition.after oral argument the matter was submitted.thereafter,on july,the trial court issued its ruling,denying the petition on the following essential reasoning 
as a practical matter,the establishment of a police department and the employment of peace officers by school districts,community college districts and other local agencies is not an optional program when the districts and agencies decide to exercise their statutory authority to employ peace officers,they do not have a genuine choice of alternative measures that meet their needs for security and law enforcement,such as a large urban school district need for security and police officers to supplement city police or a municipal water district need for park rangers with the authority and powers conferred upon peace officers to issue citations and make arrests in district recreational facilities.pen.code,subd.d subd.d added by,added by stats,ch,see com.on public safety,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.granting essential authority to municipal water districts to employ park rangers with the powers conferred on peace officers by,subd.d,italics added.rather,the specific security and law enforcement needs of the districts and agencies compel their decisions to employ peace officers and prevent them from controlling or avoiding the costs of providing pobra procedural protections,much as student misconduct that jeopardizes the safe,secure and peaceful learning environment for other students may provide the practical compulsion for a school district to pursue discretionary expulsion proceedings and subject the district to the costs of mandated hearing procedures.see san diego unified school,supra,cal th at,fn,d.in marked contrast,the city in city of merced had options to acquire property by eminent domain,by purchase or by other means and was not forced to proceed by eminent domain with its required payment for business goodwill,while the school districts in kern high school dist.could continue to operate and educate their students without participating in specified educational grant programs and without incurring the mandatory notice and agenda costs associated with the grant programs.
to the extent that school districts,community college districts and other local government agencies do exercise discretion in deciding to employ peace officers identified in government code section,the decisions do not involve the type of discretion that would or should preclude reimbursement of program costs under article xiii b,section.when the districts and agencies decide to use their specific statutory authorities and powers to employ peace officers,they determine how to use the authorities and powers to fulfill their existing obligations and functions,not to undertake new program activities.if such discretionary decisions by the districts and agencies are found to foreclose the districts and agencies from obtaining reimbursement of the pobra costs triggered by their employment of peace officers,the state would be able to shift financial responsibility for carrying out new program activities to the districts and agencies,in contravention of the intent underlying article xiii b,section and government code section.san diego unified school,supra,cal th at,d.similarly,as the california supreme court observed in san diego unified school,the court of appeal in carmel valley fire protection dist.state,supra,d,apparently did not contemplate that discretionary decisions by local fire protection agencies regarding the number of firefighters the agencies needed to employ to fulfill their essential functions would foreclose reimbursement of the costs incurred by the agencies for protective clothing and safety equipment such foreclosure of reimbursement,based on the agencies discretion to limit the number of firefighters they employed and thereby control or even avoid the mandated costs,would contravene the intent underlying article xiii b,section and government code section.san diego unified school,supra,cal th at,d.fn.omitted.
finance appeals from the judgment denying the petition.
discussion 
finance contends that the trial court erred in upholding the commission determination that,as to districts not compelled by statute to employ peace officers,the pobra requirements are a reimbursable state mandate finance argues that the judgment rests on the insupportable legal conclusion that these districts are,as a practical matter,compelled to exercise their authority to hire peace officers we agree.
case law on incurring costs voluntarily 
the issue here principally turns on three leading opinions,commencing with city of merced state of california d.city of merced.city of merced holds that an amendment of the eminent domain law requiring compensation for business goodwill is not a reimbursable mandate under former revenue and taxation code section,the antecedent of article xiii b,section.city of merced,supra,d at.the city of merced rationale is that because the city was not required to obtain property by eminent domain,the program permitting use of that power was voluntary,and the requirement of compensation for business goodwill accordingly was not a mandate.w hether a city or county decides to exercise eminent domain is,essentially,an option of the city or county,rather than a mandate of the state.the fundamental concept is that the city or county is not required to exercise eminent domain.if,however,the power of eminent domain is exercised,then the city will be required to pay for loss of goodwill.thus,payment for loss of goodwill is not a cost.ibid.
city of merced is critiqued in the second case of the triad,kern high school,supra,cal th at pages,d.in kern high school,the commission decided that two statutes requiring school site councils and advisory committees for certain educational programs to provide notice of meetings and to post agendas for those meetings constituted a reimbursable state mandate under article xiii b,section.the supreme court held that the statutes do not constitute a reimbursable state mandate,as districts were neither legally compelled nor as a practical matter compelled to participate in the programs.id.at,d.
in kern high school,the department of finance asserted in its brief that based upon the language of article xiii b,section,and on the city of merced,a reimbursable state mandate arises only if a local entity is required or commanded that is,legally participate in a program or to provide a service that,in turn,leads unavoidably to increasing the costs incurred by the entity.kern high school,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court said,t he core point articulated by the court in city of merced is that activities undertaken at the option or discretion of a local government entity that is,actions undertaken without any legal compulsion or threat of penalty for nonparticipation do not trigger a state mandate id.at,d.the high court decided that,with one possible exception,the programs in issue were not legally compelled and that the possible exception was not a mandate because the state supplied sufficient funding to cover the additional costs.id.at,d.
the reimbursable mandate proponents argued that the legal compulsion standard was too narrow and that they should also be reimbursed because they had been compelled as a practical matter to participate in the programs.kern high school,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court summarized its response to that claim as follows although we do not foreclose the possibility that a reimbursable state mandate might be found in circumstances short of legal example,if the state were to impose a substantial penalty independent of the program funds at issue upon any local entity that declined to participate in a given here faced no such practical compulsion.instead,although claimants argue that they have had no true option or choice other than to participate in the underlying funded educational programs,the asserted compulsion in this case stems only from the circumstance that claimants have found the benefits of various funded programs too good to refuse even though,as a condition of program participation,they have been forced to incur some costs.on the facts presented,the cost of compliance with conditions of participation in these funded programs does not amount to a reimbursable state mandate.ibid.
in sum,the circumstances presented in the case before us do not constitute the type of nonlegal compulsion that reasonably could constitute,in claimants phrasing,a de facto reimbursable state mandate.contrary to the situation that we described in city of sacramento state of california cal d,a claimant that elects to discontinue participation in one of the programs here at issue does not face certain and severe penalties such as double taxation or other draconian consequences id.at,but simply must adjust to the withdrawal of grant money along with the lifting of program obligations.such circumstances do not constitute a reimbursable state mandate for purposes of article xiii b,section.kern high school,supra,cal th at,d.
the last case of the triad that governs this case is san diego unified school,supra,cal th,d.in san diego unified school,the key issue was whether state requirements for expulsion hearings,not compelled by s
