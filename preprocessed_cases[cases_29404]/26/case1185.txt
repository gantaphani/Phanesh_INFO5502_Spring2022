this is the second appeal involving the detention and handcuffing of a student,laquarius gray,during her physical education class.the first time,we reversed the district court rule b dismissal of this action.gray bostic,wl cir.this time,the defendants appeal the district court denial of their motions for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.after review,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
a.the incident 
coach lattuce greer williams believed that gray was not doing jumping jacks along with the rest of the physical education class.coach williams told gray she needed to do her exercises.when gray failed to comply,coach williams told gray to c ome to the wall of the gym.williams testified that as gray walked to the wall,s he told me that she would punch me or hit me,hit me in the face.a nearby teacher,coach tara horton,witnessed the disagreement with coach williams.coach horton testified that gray said,i bust you in the head,which coach horton explained meant that she was going to hit him in the head.although coach williams and coach horton attribute slightly different language to gray,the gist of their testimony is that gray threatened to hit coach williams.
in contrast,gray testified that she did not threaten to bust coach williams in the head.although gray could not remember what she said,she agreed that she threatened to do something to coach williams and that what she said was disrespectful,as follows 
q then,coach williams told me that,at that point,you told him that you were going to bust him in his head is that right 
q you did say that 
q is coach williams lying to me 
liveoak objection 
q by wisdom you can answer.is coach williams telling me a lie 
a i guess he did.i do remember what i said,but i did say that.
q you do remember what you said 
a witness shakes head.
q you do have any idea what you said 
liveoak is that no 
q by wisdom so,you do know if you said that you might punch him is that right did you say something to him that was disrespectful 
q what was that 
a i do remember.
q did you tell him that you might do something to him 
q what did you tell him that you were going to do to him 
a i do remember 
because of the summary judgment posture of the case,we construe gray testimony as denying the coaches version of what she said.however,gray does not dispute that she threatened to do something physically to coach williams.thus the precise nature of her physical it was to hit him in the face,poke him in the eye or kick him in the not change our analysis.
after hearing gray threat to coach williams,coach horton instructed gray to come over to her.coach williams then turned his attention back to his class.
deputy antonio bostic also witnessed the exchange between gray and coach williams.deputy bostic was employed as a tuscaloosa county sheriff deputy and served as a school resource officer sro for several schools,including holt elementary.before gray reached coach horton,deputy bostic intervened and told coach horton that he would talk to gray.coach horton insisted that she would handle the matter.however,deputy bostic insisted that he would handle gray and escorted gray out the gym door into a lobby area.
deputy bostic told gray to turn around,pulled her hands behind her back and put gray in handcuffs.deputy bostic tightened the handcuffs to the point that they caused gray pain.deputy bostic told gray,t his is how it feels when you break the law,and t his is how it feels to be in jail.gray began to cry.gray stood with the handcuffs on for not less than five minutes,with deputy bostic standing behind her 
in discovery responses,deputy bostic averred that he detained and handcuffed gray to impress upon her the serious nature of committing crimes that can lead to arrest,detention or incarceration and to help persuade her to rid herself of her disrespectful attitude.deputy bostic discovery responses also stated that he did not feel the need to apologize to laquarius gray for telling her that she committed a misdemeanor in my presence and showing her what would happen if a less generous officer than i were to arrest her for her actions.after deputy bostic took the handcuffs off,gray went to the coaches office until her next class.
neither coach horton nor coach williams was afraid of gray or believed that gray would actually carry out her threat.when asked whether he was ever afraid that gray would commit an act of violence towards him or horton,coach williams replied,no,sir.similarly,coach horton replied no,when asked if she was ever afraid that gray would physically assault you or another student when asked,w hen gray told coach williams that she was going to bust him in the head she not actually physically capable of doing that,is she,coach horton agreed.coach horton planned to talk with gray about the incident and give her a warning.coach horton testified that she would not have been required to write gray up,give gray detention,or send her to the principal office because it was that major.
court proceedings 
on november,by and through her mother,gray filed suit against deputy bostic and tuscaloosa county sheriff,edmund sexton in their official and individual capacities gray complaint contained eight counts,including claims under for violations of gray first,fourth,fifth,eighth and fourteenth amendment rights count under for race discrimination count and under state law for invasion of privacy,assault and battery,false imprisonment,defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress counts through.gray also sought declaratory and injunctive relief count.the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,which the district court granted.
gray appealed to this court,challenging only the district court dismissal of her fourth amendment claims against deputy bostic and sheriff sexton individually and the denial of her motion for leave to amend her complaint we reversed,stating that on remand gray was entitled to pursue her fourth amendment claims against defendants deputy bostic and sheriff sexton individually and to file an amended complaint.gray.the district court ordered gray to file an amended complaint asserting only the fourth amendment claims that remained following her appeal.gray then amended her complaint,asserting claims of excessive use of force and unreasonable seizure against defendants bostic and sexton individually.
following discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion,prompting this interlocutory appeal.
ii.standard of review 
although the denial of summary judgment generally is not a final appealable order subject to immediate appeal,an interlocutory appeal may be taken where the district court denies the defense of qualified immunity and the appeal involves a question of law.mcmillian johnson,amended on other grounds,cir.we review de novo a district court denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the opposing party.williams consol.city of jacksonville,cir.
iii.discussion 
qualified immunity principles 
qualified immunity offers a complete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities if their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.vinyard wilson,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.to be entitled to qualified immunity,the defendant must prove that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority.id.once the defendants establish that they were acting within their discretionary authority,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that qualified immunity is not appropriate.lumley city of dade city,cir.
the supreme court has established a test to evaluate whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity.first,as a threshold inquiry,we address whether the facts presented,taken in a light most favorable to the party,establish a constitutional violation.saucier katz,d.if we answer this question in the affirmative,then we ask whether the right was clearly established.id.
deputy bostic discretionary authority 
gray argues that deputy bostic was not acting within the scope of his discretionary authority when he detained and handcuffed gray.to establish that the challenged actions were within the scope of his discretionary authority,a defendant must show that those actions were undertaken pursuant to the performance of his duties,and within the scope of his authority.harbert int l james,cir.to that end,a court must ask whether the act complained of,if done for a proper purpose,would be within,or reasonably related to,the outer perimeter of an official discretionary duties.id.quotation marks omitted.
although our prior opinion concluding that deputy bostic was acting within his discretionary authority was at the rule b stage and was based on merely the allegations in the complaint,there is no evidence at the summary judgment stage that changes our conclusion.deputy bostic as an sro,was charged with the responsibility to investigate criminal activity that might be taking place at holt elementary school.as part of that responsibility,deputy bostic duties included,under the right circumstances,detaining and questioning students and possibly arresting and handcuffing them.the fact that the right circumstances for detention or handcuffing may not have been present in this case is irrelevant to our inquiry.see id.explaining that the inquiry is not whether it was within the defendant authority to commit the allegedly illegal act because f ramed that way,the inquiry is no more than an untenable tautology.
gray stresses that sros were not supposed to discipline students and that deputy bostic admitted in his interrogatory responses that his reasons for detaining and handcuffing gray were to impress upon her the serious nature of committing crimes that can lead to arrest,detention or incarceration and to help persuade her to rid herself of her disrespectful attitude.we note,however,that it is also clear from deputy bostic interrogatory responses that he believed gray had committed a misdemeanor when she threatened her teacher and that deputy bostic detained her to discuss the incident with her.therefore,we conclude that deputy bostic actions were within his discretionary duties and turn to whether his actions were unconstitutional.
constitutional violations 
gray argues that deputy bostic used excessive force in detaining her because he lacked a right to detain her at all.therefore,her excessive force claim is not an independent claim,but rather is subsumed in her illegal seizure claim.see bashir rockdale county,cir stating that u nder this circuit law a claim that any force in an illegal stop or arrest is excessive is subsumed in the illegal stop or arrest claim and is not a discrete excessive force claim quotation marks omitted thus,our inquiry focuses on deputy bostic seizure of gray.
as stated in gray earlier appeal,we apply the reasonableness standard articulated in new jersey,d,to school seizures by law enforcement officers.see gray,slip op.at,wl.in,the supreme court recognized that the substantial need to maintain discipline in the classroom and foster a positive learning environment requires some modification of the level of suspicion of illicit activity needed to justify a search in the public school setting.at.at.to that end,the supreme court concluded that the accommodation of the privacy interests of schoolchildren with the substantial need of teachers and administrators for freedom to maintain order in the schools does not require strict adherence to the requirement that searches be based on probable cause.id.at.at.instead,under reasonableness standard,the legality of a search of a student should depend simply on the reasonableness,under all the circumstances,of the search.id.under the standard,the reasonableness of the search is evaluated using a inquiry first,one must consider whether the action was justified at its inception second,one must determine whether the search as actually conducted was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified interference in the first place.id.at.at citations omitted.the standard mirrors the standard announced in terry ohio governing the reasonableness of investigatory stops.see terry ohio,d.
under first prong,we examine whether deputy bostic has a reasonable basis for calling gray over to him,stopping her,and asking her questions.it is undisputed that deputy bostic witnessed gray threaten to do something physically to her teacher.under alabama code,a verbal threat,made with the intent to carry out the threat,that would cause a reasonable person who is the target of the threat to fear for his or her safety,constitutes the crime of harassment,which is a class c misdemeanor.see a.gray stresses neither coach williams nor coach horton feared for their safety and that deputy bostic had no probable cause or arguable probable cause to arrest her.however,under,the level of suspicion in a school setting needed to justify a search or an investigatory stop is only reasonableness under the circumstances.given his having witnessed gray threat in a school setting,deputy bostic stopping gray to question her about her conduct was reasonable 
turning to second prong,we must consider whether deputy bostic subsequent handcuffing of gray was reasonably related to the scope of the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.at.at quotation marks omitted and emphasis supplied.a seizure will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the seizure and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction.id.at.at.after stopping gray,deputy bostic not only questioned her,but also handcuffed her for not less than five minutes.thus,the question under the second prong is whether the handcuffing of gray was reasonably related to the scope of the circumstances which justified deputy bostic initial interference and was not excessively intrusive.
by his own admission,deputy bostic did not handcuff gray to effect an arrest of gray.rather,his handcuffing of gray was during an investigatory stop.nonetheless,during an investigatory stop,an officer can still handcuff a detainee when the officer reasonably believes that the detainee presents a potential threat to safety.see united states hastamorir,cir united states blackman,cir united states kapperman,cir.
the problem in this case for deputy bostic is that,at the time deputy bostic handcuffed gray,there was no indication of a potential threat to anyone safety.the incident was over,and gray,after making the comment,had promptly complied with her teachers instructions,coming to the gym wall and then to coach horton when told to do so.there is no evidence that gray was gesturing or engaging in any further disruptive behavior.rather,gray had cooperated with her teachers and did not pose a threat to anyone safety.in fact,coach horton had insisted that she would handle the matter,but deputy bostic still intervened.deputy bostic does not even claim that he handcuffed gray to protect his or anyone safety.rather,deputy bostic candidly admitted that he handcuffed gray to persuade her to get rid of her disrespectful attitude and to impress upon her the serious nature of committing crimes.in effect,deputy bostic handcuffing of gray was his attempt to punish gray in order to change her behavior in the future.
thus,deputy bostic handcuffing gray was not reasonably related to the scope of the circumstances that justified the initial investigatory stop.rather,the handcuffing was excessively intrusive given gray young age and the fact that it was not done to protect anyone safety.therefore,the handcuffing of gray violated gray fourth amendment rights.
clearly established law 
whether a constitutional right was clearly established at the time of the violation turns on whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.bashir,at quoting saucier,at.at.we focus on the status of the law in march when deputy bostic detained and handcuffed gray.
it is well settled that,under the fourth amendment,t he scope of a detention must be carefully tailo
