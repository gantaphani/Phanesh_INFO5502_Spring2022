roxane rodrigo appellant was injured while participating in a tae kwon do class conducted by koryo martial arts respondent in san bruno.appellant sued respondent on a negligence theory,alleging that her injury resulted from insufficient supervision and control when she was kicked by a student.respondent moved for summary judgment,based on the theory that it owed no duty of care to appellant under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk set forth in knight jewett cal th,d,knight.the trial court granted the motion and entered judgment in respondent favor.this appeal ensued.
as set forth in detail in part,post,we conclude that an instructor duty to a student under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk is limited to acting in a fashion that does not increase the risks inherent in learning a sport.applying that standard to the undisputed facts in the case before us,we find that respondent did nothing to increase the risks associated with learning tae kwon do.thus,the doctrine of primary assumption of risk applies and bars any potential recovery by appellant.accordingly,we affirm.
in support of its motion for summary judgment,respondent presented facts it contended were undisputed.appellant did not dispute of those proposed facts.we summarize the relevant undisputed facts in the following two paragraphs.
appellant enrolled in respondent school on july.she had been taking classes for approximately four months before she was injured.at the time she enrolled,appellant was aware that any sport carried a risk of injury.indeed,before she signed up for classes,appellant knew that,if she were involved in an active sport that involved kicking and jumping,she might be injured.tae kwon do is a martial art that seeks to integrate mental acuity and emotional discipline with strenuous physical activity and interpersonal combat with both kicking and punching.personal discipline and respect for the teaching master and other students are essential elements of the sport.
on november,the day appellant was injured,she was attending a class conducted by master ki bok kim,a fourth degree black belt,certified as a master by the world governing body for tae kwon do.six adults were involved in the class being conducted by master kim.a class of children was being conducted simultaneously with the adult class that class was under the control of an assistant to master kim.the adult students were practicing a kick in which they were aiming at a cushioned leather pad held by master kim.the adults were lined up,waiting for a turn to kick the target,when appellant injury occurred.
in opposition to respondent motion,appellant presented excerpts from her deposition in which she testified that,while standing in line,she saw another student complete his kick.as appellant was preparing to initiate her kick,she felt something on her leg.she believes someone kicked her,but she does not know who.the apparent kick caused a rupture of the achilles tendon in appellant leg.
ii.standard of review 
summary judgment must be granted if the moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law.citation.regents of university of california superior court th,d regents.a defendant may meet the burden of demonstrating that a cause of action has no merit by showing that one of the necessary elements of the cause of action does not exist or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.bushnell religious cultural center th,d bushnell.once a defendant meets that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or the defense.regents,supra,th at,d.whether or not the doctrine of primary assumption of risk applies presents a question of legal duty because duty is an issue of law to be decided by the court,the applicability of that doctrine is amenable to resolution by summary judgment.citation.bushnell,supra,th at,d.as a reviewing court,we consider the evidence and the parties arguments de novo.ibid.
iii.analysis 
primary and secondary assumption of risk 
in knight,a plurality of the supreme court addressed the proper application of the assumption of risk doctrine in light of its adoption of comparative fault principles in li yellow cab cal d.knight,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded that the doctrine survived li in two and secondary assumption of risk.the former doctrine embodies a legal conclusion that there is no duty on the part of the defendant to protect the plaintiff from a particular risk.in secondary assumption of risk,the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff,but the plaintiff knowingly encounters a risk of injury caused by the defendant breach of that duty.knight,supra,cal th at,d.where secondary assumption of risk applies,liability is apportioned under principles of comparative fault.id.at,d.however,where primary assumption of risk applies,the doctrine acts as a complete bar to the plaintiff recovery.ibid.
the supreme court provided some guidance for resolving the duty issue involved in application of the doctrine of primary assumption of risk.after pointing out that,generally,persons have a duty to use due care to avoid injuries to others,the court noted that in a sports setting,however,conditions or conduct that otherwise might be viewed as dangerous are an integral part of the sport itself.thus,although moguls on a ski run pose a risk of harm to skiers that might not exist were these configurations removed,the challenge and risks posed by the moguls are part of the sport of skiing,and a ski resort has no duty to eliminate them.citation.in this respect,the nature of a sport is highly relevant in defining the duty of care owed by the particular defendant.although defendants generally have no legal duty to eliminate or protect a plaintiff against risks inherent in the sport itself,it is well established that defendants generally do have a duty to use due care not to increase the risks to a participant over and above those inherent in the sport.thus,although a ski resort has no duty to remove moguls from a ski run,it clearly does have a duty to use care to maintain its towropes in a safe,working condition so as not to expose skiers to an increased risk of harm.the cases establish that the latter type of risk,posed by a ski resort negligence,clearly is not a risk inherent in the sport that is assumed by a participant.citation.knight,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the court added rather than being dependent on the knowledge or consent of the particular plaintiff,resolution of the question of the defendant liability turns on whether the defendant had a legal duty to avoid conduct leading to injury or to protect the plaintiff against a particular risk of harm.as already noted,the nature of a defendant duty in the sports context depends heavily on the nature of the sport itself.additionally,the scope of the duty owed by a defendant frequently will also depend on the defendant role in,or relationship to,the sport.id.at,d,italics added.
the court then reviewed case authority addressing the potential liability of different classes of defendants in a context,such as owners of baseball stadiums and ski resorts,manufacturers of sporting goods and coaches and instructors.the court stated that those cases demonstrate that in the sports setting,as elsewhere,the nature of the applicable duty or standard of care frequently varies with the role of the defendant whose conduct is at issue in a given case.id.at,d.
knight involved an injury that occurred during an informal touch football game,when the defendant allegedly ran into the plaintiff,knocking her to the ground and stepping on her hand.knight,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,the supreme court focused its attention on the role of primary assumption of risk in suits between participants in athletic events.again,the court reviewed relevant authority and found the reasoning of the cases sound.id.at,d.based on that authority and its analysis of principles underlying primary assumption of risk,the court concluded that a participant in an active sport breaches a legal duty of care to other,engages in conduct that properly may subject him or her to financial if the participant intentionally injures another player or engages in conduct that is so reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in the sport,fn.omitted.because the defendant conduct did not fall totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in touch football,the court found that primary assumption of risk applied and that the defendant owed no duty to the plaintiff.thus,the court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeal,upholding the summary judgment entered by the trial court in the defendant favor.id.at,d.
left unresolved by knight was the role played by primary assumption of risk in cases involving injured students and their coaches or instructors.the first two appellate courts to consider that issue found the doctrine inapplicable in cases involving riding injuries.in tan goddard th,d tan,division four of the second appellate district considered a case in which tan was enrolled in a jockey school owned by goddard.one of goddard instructors,davis,told tan that faraway falcon,one of the horses tan had been riding,had injured its foot and that he should ride the horse easily to see how it was doing.tan found the horse off because it did not walk or behave normally.davis told tan that the horse was safe to ride and gave tan precise instructions on how to do so.some days later,davis told tan to exercise faraway falcon again tan found that the horse was still off and told davis.nonetheless,davis told tan to ride the to ride it in the opposite direction from the one usually used,on an area of the track with a high concentration of rocks.while tan was riding as instructed by davis,the horse stepped on something and went down,injuring tan.tan sued goddard,and the trial court entered summary judgment in goddard favor based on principles of assumption of risk.id.at,d.the court of appeal first noted that knight had not resolved the question of the duty owed by instructors or coaches to their charges.id.at,d.the court then reviewed cases and secondary authorities and concluded that,generally,coaches and instructors,while not insurers,owe a duty of care to their charges.id.at,d.the court noted that in the case under review tan followed the directions of an instructor who knew that the horse in question was off and who knew or should have known about the dangerous condition of the track.the court concluded that under the circumstances,davis role as riding instructor to tan was such that he owed tan a duty of ordinary care to see to it that the horse he assigned tan to ride was safe to ride under the conditions he prescribed for that activity.id.at,d.accordingly,the court of appeal found that the doctrine of primary assumption of risk did not apply and reversed the summary judgment entered in goddard favor.id.at,d.
in galardi seahorse riding club th,d galardi,division two of the second appellate district addressed a case in which an accomplished equestrian was injured when her horse failed to clear jumps set up by a riding instructor at the seahorse riding club.galardi claimed that the instructor twice raised the height of the jumps without lengthening the distance between them and then asked galardi to ride through the jumps in the opposite direction from which she had previously jumped them.galardi,supra,th at,d.the trial court granted summary judgment,based on assumption of risk.id.at,d.the court of appeal focused on the language in knight that the existence of a duty in a sports context depends on the nature of the sport and the relationship of the defendant and the plaintiff to that sport.id.at,d.the court determined that,given the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants the riding club and the instructor,the latter certainly had a duty to avoid an unreasonable risk of injury to plaintiff and to take care that the jumping array was not beyond the capability of horse and rider.id.at,d.the court also considered tan,supra,th,d,concluded that tan was properly decided and agreed that the general rule is that coaches and instructors owe a duty of care to their charges.thus,a complaint raising the issue of coach or instructor negligence during training involves secondary assumption of risk which is not a complete bar to recovery accordingly,the court concluded that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in the defendants favor.galardi,supra,th at,d.
in regents,division one of this appellate district considered a case in which a student rock climber was killed after a fall allegedly caused by his instructors improper placement of rope anchors in a single crack system on a rock face he and the instructors were climbing.the defendants moved for summary judgment based on the doctrine of primary assumption of risk.the trial court denied the motion.the court of appeal issued a writ of mandate,compelling the trial court to enter summary judgment in the defendants favor.regents,supra,th at,d.the court rejected the plaintiff widow claim that,as instructors,the defendants owed her deceased husband a duty of care simply because he was enrolled as a student in defendant commercial venture.the determination of duty in the or commercial recreational operator cases turns not on the labels given to the sporting participants,but instead on the facts surrounding their levels of experience their relationships to one another in the activity resulting in the plaintiff injury.galardi seahorse riding club,supra,th,d duty owed by coach to refrain from raising jumps beyond rider experience absent warning tan goddard,supra,th,d duty owed by instructor who directed jockey trainee to exercise a lame horse in reverse direction on rocky track additional citations.regents,supra,th at,d.applying those principles,the court of appeal found that the defendants had met their burden of demonstrating that the decedent had not been taken beyond his level of experience and capability in the activity culminating in his fall,and that the risk to him was not beyond that inherent in any top rope climbing activity.id.at,d.the court concluded that f alling,whether because of one own slip,a coclimber stumble,or an anchor system giving way,is the very risk inherent in the sport of mountain climbing and can not be completely eliminated without destroying the sport itself.citation.id.at,d.
in bushnell,division one of this district went a step further in discussing tan and galardi in the context of a case in which a student was injured while practicing throws with an instructor at a judo club.the court of appeal affirmed summary judgment entered in favor of the defendant club.bushnell,supra,th at,d.the court noted in all cases in which the doctrine of primary assumption of risk is asserted as a bar to recovery the nature of the activity,the relationship of the defendant to the activity and the relationship of the defendant to the plaintiff must be examined.it must then be determined,in light of the activity and these relationships,whether the defendant conduct at issue is an inherent risk of the activity such that liability does not attach as a matter of law.general rules of liability attach when the defendant conduct is not an inherent risk of the activity or when the defendant conduct increased the inherent risks in the activity.id.at,d.the court went on to state that the doctrine of primary assumption of risk can apply even if the defendant was in some manner in control of the situation and thus in a better position than the plaintiff to prevent the plaintiff injury.id.at,d.in support of that proposition,the court of appeal cited ford gouin cal th,d,the companion case to knight,in which the supreme court applied the doctrine to find that a ski boat driver did not have a duty to avoid an overhanging branch and consequent injury to someone skiing backwards and barefoot behind his boat.bushnell,supra,th at,d.the court then revisited tan and galardi and indicated that it believed that both were consistent with knight and ford,if they were read as finding liability on the defendants part based on their having increased the inherent risks of the activity in question.id.at,d.however,the bushnell court disagreed with tan and galardi to the extent that they might be read as establishing a broad rule that instructors owe a general duty of care to their students,finding such a rule inconsistent with both the language set forth in,and the policies underlying,knight and ford.bushnell,supra,th at,d.
in fortier los rios community college dist.th,d fortier,the third appellate district affirmed a summary judgment entered in favor of a community college district that conducted an advanced football training class.the defendant was sued for negligence by a young man who was injured in a collision with another player while the plaintiff was attempting to catch,and the other player was attempting to intercept,a pass during a noncontact passing drill.ibid.the court of appeal found that the doctrine of primary assumption of risk applied because the injury resulted from a risk inherent in football,and the defendant did nothing to increase that risk.in addition,the court read tan and galardi as standing for the proposition that when an instructor acts so as to increase the risk of harm inherent in a particular sport,the instructor may not thereafter rely on primary assumption of the risk.fortier,th at,d.
in parsons crown disposal cal th,d,parsons,the supreme court reexamined the doctrine of primary assumption of risk in a case in which the plaintiff was injured when a horse he was riding on a bridal path was frightened by noise from a garbage truck that was operating nearby in its normal manner.the court found that the disposal company owed a very limited duty of care to the plaintiff rider and that the company did not breach that duty.accordingly,the supreme court found that summary judgment had properly been entered in favor of the defendant.id.at,d.in reaching that conclusion,the court reviewed its decision in knight,then moved to a discussion of court of appeal decisions that had followed knight in different contexts as illustrated by court of appeal cases decided since knight,supra,cal th,d,there are circumstances in which the relationship between defendant and plaintiff gives rise to a duty on the part of the defendant to use due care not to increase the risks inherent in the plaintiff activity.for example,a purveyor of recreational activities owes a duty to a patron not to increase the risks inherent in the activity in which the patron has paid to engage.citations.likewise,a coach or sport instructor owes a duty to a student not to increase the risks inherent in the learning process undertaken by the student.see,tan,galardi,fortier and regents.parsons,supra,cal th at,d.
as reflected above,although tan and galardi both stated that instructors owe a general duty of care to those in their charge,fortier and regents suggested that those cases should be read more is,finding a duty of care only when an instructor increases the risk of injury inherent in the sport in which instruction is being offered.the supreme court citation of all four cases,coupled with its statement that a coach owes a duty not to increase the risks inherent in the student learning process,leads us to conclude that the supreme court reads tan and galardi in the limited fashion suggested by fortier and regents.further,it appears that the supreme court has implicitly endorsed the rule that instructors and coaches owe a limited duty to their is,not to increase the risks inherent in the learning process of the sport or activity in which instruction is being offered.parsons,supra,cal th at,d.we concur with the approach taken to tan and galardi by fortier,regents,bushnell,and snow summit,as tacitly endorsed by the supreme court in parsons.accordingly,we will now proceed to analyze the case before us to determine whether appellant raised a triable issue of fact regarding respondent having increased the risk of learning tae kwon do.
respondent is insulated from liability under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk 
respondent did not increase the risks inherent in learning tae kwon do 
as reflected above,under knight,a determination of whether the doctrine of primary assumption of risk applies in a given case involves an analysis of both the risks inherent in the sport under consideration and the defendant role in,or relationship to,the sport.knight,supra,cal th at,d.here,because respondent filled the role of instructor,we must consider whether evidence was presented raising a triable issue of fact regarding respondent having increased the risks inherent in learning tae kwon do.parsons,supra,cal th at,d.
as noted in part,ante,respondent presented uncontroverted evidence that tae kwon do is a martial art,involving strenuous physical activity and interpersonal combat with both kicking and punching.it is that a sport that involves interpersonal combat with both kicking and punching carries not just the inherent arguably the a participant will not only kick and punch other participants but will also be kicked and punched by others.likewise,learning how to kick and punch in a class in which other students are also learning the same skills involves the same risks.
our next point of inquiry is whether any evidence was presented from which it may be inferred that respondent increased the risk of injury inherent in learning the sport.here,master kim organized a practice drill in which students were to take turns kicking a leather pad.appellant presented no we see no basis for such a drill increases the risks inherent in learning the sport.moreover,appellant presented no we see no basis for having individual class participants line up and wait their turn increases the risks inherent in learning tae kwon do.in sum,undisputed facts support the conclusion that being injured as a result of being kicked,punched or otherwise contacted by other students is an inherent risk of participating in,and learning the discipline of,tae kwon do and that respondent engaged in no actions that increased the risk of appellant being kicked or punched.
appellant expectation that she would not be injured is irrelevant to application of the doctrine of primary assumption of risk 
appellant offered two points in opposition to respondent motion that merit discussion.appellant first point was presented in response to a proposed undisputed fact offered by physical injury is an inherent,risk in any tae kwon do activity,including practice sessions of the type in which appellant was involved when her injury supposedly occurred.appellant contended that there should be no risk of physical injury when one is waiting in a line to do a tae kwon do activity.appellant supported her contention by citing a portion of her deposition in which she testified that when the injury occurred,she was not involved in sparring or fighting she was merely standing in a line without doing anything.
appellant first point reflects a misunderstanding of the doctrine of primary assumption of risk.as applicable here,the doctrine of primary assumption of risk involves a determination of the duty owed by a to a.the scope of that duty is not determined by the student expectations or understanding of the risks involved in the activity in which an injury occurs rather,the scope of the duty is determined,as a matter of law,by the courts,based on the nature of the sport and the parties relationship to each other and the sport.knight,supra,cal th at,d.thus,appellant assertion that she did not believe she was at that she should not have been at being injured while she was merely standing in line is irrelevant to a determination of the duty owed by respondent under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk.id.at,d.
knight and staten superior court th,d staten provide illustrations of the error in appellant approach.in knight,the plaintiff submitted evidence in opposition to the defendant motion for summary judgment in an effort to demonstrate that she had no reasonable expectation of injury in the informal,coed touch football game in which she participated.for example,she submitted her own declaration,as well as declarations and deposition testimony from other game participants,in an effort to establish that the game was to be a mellow one,in w
