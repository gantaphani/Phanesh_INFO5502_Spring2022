order modifying opinion and denying petition for rehearing no change in judgment 
it is ordered that the opinion filed herein on september,be modified as follows 
after the fourth paragraph,which starts on page and continues to page,beginning section,subdivision a requires a board,add the following new paragraph 
in a petition for rehearing,argues our conclusion rewards and incentivizes government entities for not acting on applications for leave to present a late claim.section,subdivision a reflects the legislature choice to require written notice only when the government entity acts on an application for leave to present a late claim and affirmatively denies it.an application for leave to present a late claim is deemed denied by inaction days after the application is presented to the governing board.c.that date can be determined easily.if,within that timeframe,the claimant receives no notice of a board action,then the claimant can conclude the application was denied by operation of law and can calculate the last day for filing a petition to the superior court under section.
this modification does not effect a change in judgment.the petition for rehearing is denied.

the plain,unambiguous language of sections and compels us to affirm.application to present a late claim was made under section,subdivision b on the ground that he was a minor at the time he was required to present a claim.because the district did not act,under the plain language of section c,application was deemed denied by operation of law on the day after it was presented.section c states if the board fails or refuses to act on an application within the time prescribed by this section,the application shall be deemed to have been denied on the day 
when an application is denied by operation of law under section c,a claimant can challenge that denial only by petition to the superior court under section for relief from the claim requirement.section,subdivision b section b states in unambiguous terms the petition shall be filed within six months after the application to the board is denied or deemed to be denied pursuant to section.filed his petition to the superior court more than six months after his application to present a late claim was deemed denied by operation of law.petition therefore was untimely,and the superior court did not err by denying it.

part of division of title of the government code sets forth procedures for presenting claims against public entities.part of the same title and division et sets forth procedures for actions against public entities and public employees.
section requires a party to present a written claim to the public entity before the claimant may bring a lawsuit against that public entity.except as provided in sections and,a timely claim must be acted upon or deemed rejected by the board of the public entity before the claimant may file a lawsuit.compliance with the claims statute is mandatory and failure to file a claim is fatal to a cause of action.mcmartin county of los angeles,supra,d at.section provides that,once the claim requirement is satisfied,any lawsuit by the claimant must be commenced within six months of receiving written notice or,if no written notice is given,within two years from the accrual of the cause of action,subd.a.

when a claim required by section is untimely,the injured party may present a written application to the board for leave to present a late claim,subd.a.the application for leave to present a late claim,including a copy of the proposed claim,must be presented to the board within a reasonable time not to exceed one year after the accrual of the cause of action and must state the reason for the delay in presenting the claim,subd.b.
section recognizes that the board may grant,deny,or fail or refuse to act on,an application for leave to present a late claim.subdivision a of section provides the board shall grant or deny the application within days after it is presented to the board section,subdivision b section b identifies four circumstances in which the application to present a late claim shall be grant ed by the board relevant here is the second circumstance the person who sustained the alleged injury,damage or loss was a minor during all of the time specified in section b.
section c states if the board fails or refuses to act on an application within the time prescribed by this section,the application shall be deemed to have been denied on the day 
section,subdivision a provides that w ritten notice of the board action upon the application must be given in the prescribed manner.if the board denies the application,the notice must include a warning substantially in the form set forth in section,subdivision b.section does not require notice when the board fails or refuses to act on an application.
if the board denies a timely application for leave to present a late claim,or if the application is deemed denied under section c,the injured party may petition the superior court for an order relieving him or her from the claim requirement of section,subds.a b.the injured party must file the petition in the superior court within six months after the application to the board is denied or deemed to be denied pursuant to section.b,italics added.failure to comply with time limitations set forth in section bars an action on the government claim.see lineaweaver southern california rapid transit dist.d,lineaweaver holding the limitation period during which a person may petition the superior court after the board denial of an application to present a late claim is mandatory todd county of los angeles d,minor action was when the complaint failed to comply with section,subdivision f because it was filed more than days after the superior court granted minor petition for relief.
section,subdivision c section c provides that the superior court shall relieve the petitioner from the requirements of section if the application for leave to present a late claim was made within a reasonable time not to exceed that specified in subdivision b of section,the application was denied or deemed denied under section,and at least one of four circumstances is applicable.the four circumstances listed in section c are nearly identical to those listed in section b.if the superior court grants the petition,the injured party has days in which to file a lawsuit,subd.f.
application for leave to present a late claim was deemed denied by operation of law when the district did not act within days.section b and section c 
contends section b and section c contradict each other and are irreconcilable because section b states the board shall grant the application when the applicant was a minor,while section c states the application shall be deemed to have been denied if the board fails to act within the prescribed time period.according to,the contradiction should be resolved by concluding section b controls so that his timely application to present a late claim was never deemed to have been denied under section c.
there is no conflict or contradiction between section b and section c.section anticipates that a board may act on an application by granting or denying it,or that a board may do nothing at all.section,subdivision a states the board shall grant or deny an application for leave to present a late claim within days after it is presented to the board.section b states t he board shall grant the application when the claimant was a minor during the claim period,which is the situation here.if the board fails or refuses to act within the day period,then section c controls and the application is deemed denied by operation of law.section c makes no exception when the application presents any of the circumstances listed in section b.in this case,because the district did not act on application to present a late claim,section c controls,and the application is deemed denied by operation of law.
focuses on the words shall grant in section b as establishing that a board failure to act on an application within days means,contrary to section c,that the application is not deemed denied by operation of law.although use of the word shall indicates a mandatory act tarrant bell property,llc superior court cal th,it is possible that a board may,albeit incorrectly,deny outright an application brought under section b,subd.a see,hernandez county of los angeles cal d,defendant public entity denied a minor application to present a late claim,informing plaintiff that if he wished to challenge the denial he was required to file a petition in court pursuant to section within six months tammen county of san diego cal d,minor plaintiff application for leave to present a late claim was denied by the public entity and plaintiff thereafter challenged the denial by petitioning the superior court.when the board takes action and expressly denies an application brought under section b,the injured party must bring a petition under section to challenge the board decision.
in either case express denial under section,subdivision a or denial by operation of law under section c the claimant recourse is to bring a petition under section to challenge the denial of the application for leave to present a late claim.the language of section c therefore anticipates the board may mistakenly or consciously disregard the mandatory provisions set forth in section,subdivisions a and b.if the board denial,either by action or inaction,is inconsistent with the statutory provisions,it is incumbent upon the claimant to challenge that denial by petition to the superior court under section.
kendrick city of la mirada d,kendrick supports the proposition that an application for leave to present a late claim may be denied by operation of law notwithstanding the language of section b.in kendrick,supra,d at pages,the public entity denied the plaintiff otherwise valid claim as untimely.the plaintiff brought an application for leave to present a late claim under section b on the ground of mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.kendrick,supra,at.the application was denied by operation of law when the public entity failed to act within the required statutory time period.id.at.the plaintiff did not petition the superior court for relief from the claim requirement and instead filed a lawsuit.ibid.the court of appeal upheld the trial court judgment to dismiss the plaintiff lawsuit.id.at.the court of appeal concluded the plaintiff was required by the government claims act to file a petition in the superior court for relief from the claim requirement before filing a lawsuit.kendrick,supra,at.
in kendrick,supra,d at pages,the plaintiff application to present a late claim was deemed denied by operation of law,notwithstanding the fact the plaintiff had a valid claim under section b based on mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.the court of appeal concluded the plaintiff had to obtain relief in the superior court before filing a lawsuit.kendrick,supra,at.
although kendrick dealt with section b rather than section b,its reasoning would apply to all subparts under section b.section b states a board shall grant an application based on any of the four circumstances in subparts through and makes no distinction in treatment among them.here,application to present a late claim was deemed denied by operation of law,notwithstanding the fact he brought his application under section b,like the plaintiff in kendrick,had to obtain relief in the superior court under section.did not obtain relief in the superior court because his petition was untimely filed.
argues the mention by the kendrick court of the deemed denial principle was not necessary to the decision.we disagree.the kendrick court concluded that the plaintiff was required by the government claims act to file a petition in the superior court for relief from the claim requirement before filing a lawsuit.in kendrick,the board of the public entity did not act on the plaintiff application kendrick,supra,d at.thus,for the kendrick court to have reached the issue whether the plaintiff needed to obtain relief in the superior court before filing a lawsuit,the court would have had to determine the plaintiff application was deemed denied by operation of law.
also contends kendrick is distinguishable because the plaintiff in that case never filed a petition for relief in the superior court,let alone an untimely one.the important point in kendrick,which is fully applicable here,is that a plaintiff must obtain relief from the superior court before filing a lawsuit.kendrick,supra,d at.did not obtain relief from the superior court.
does not explain what the status of his application for leave to present a late claim would be if it were not denied by operation of law under section c.the application can not be said to have been granted because the district did not act on it.inasmuch as filed a petition under section,he does not take that position.yet,argues his application was not denied by operation of law.suggests his application exists in a government claims act limbo,neither granted nor denied,awaiting some future action by the district to save it.section does not permit that situation when a board fails to act on an application brought under section b within days,then the application is deemed denied by operation of law under section c.
b.the language of section supports our interpretation.
interpretation of section ignores and would nullify the procedure set forth in section when a board fails to act on an application brought under section b.an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation each sentence must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme citation and if a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations,the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed.lungren deukmejian cal d.
section c requires the superior court to grant a petition for relief if the application presented under section was timely,denied or deemed denied,and at least one of four circumstances is met.the four circumstances set forth in section c are nearly identical to those in which an application to present a late claim must be granted by the board under section b.section c is identical to section b t he person who sustained the alleged injury,damage or loss was a minor during all of the time specified in section for the presentation of the claim.c,italics added see b.section c thus recognizes a board might deny,either expressly or by operation of law,an application to present a late claim brought on a ground set forth in section b even though section b states such application shall be granted.
section c requires the superior court to grant a timely section petition when an application for leave to present a late claim filed by a minor meets the requirements of section b and the application is deemed denied by operation of law under section c.if,as contends,an application under section b could not be deemed denied by operation of law when a board fails to act,then section c would serve no purpose.
request for judicial notice 
has requested we take judicial notice of documents comprising the legislative history of section.judicial notice of these materials is appropriate,subds.a c ennabe manosa cal th,fn.el attar hollywood presbyterian medical center cal th.we grant the request for judicial notice however,consideration of extrinsic sources to determine the legislature intent is unnecessary because the legislature expressed its purpose in the unambiguous language of section itself.see smith superior court,supra,cal th at kavanaugh,supra,cal th at.
we observe that the legislative history of section,if considered,is consistent with our reading of section.emphasizes two points from the legislative history.first,the government claims act should be liberally construed.see viles state of california cal d.construction of section,no matter how liberal,can not remove the plain language of section c that an application to present a late claim is deemed denied if the board does not act within days.
second,emphasizes,the legislature intended to treat minors with more leniency than other claimants.such intent to treat minors with more leniency is built into both section b and section c.as argues,section b does not require a minor to show that the public entity would be prejudiced by a late claim.see recommendation relating to sovereign immunity cal.law revision com.the legislature also showed leniency to minors when amending the government claims act in by giving them one year,instead of days,in which to present an application to present a late claim.recommendation relating to sovereign immunity,supra,cal.law revision com.at.the legislature did not otherwise exempt minors from the requirements and time limits of the government claims act.has identified nothing in the legislative history materials that suggests the legislature did not intend for section c to apply to applications brought under section b.
petition is because it was not filed within the limitations period set forth in section.compliance with section b is a prerequisite to filing suit.
to challenge the denial of an application to present a late claim,a claimant must file a petition in the superior court within six months after the application to the board is denied or deemed to be denied pursuant to section.b.a claimant may file a lawsuit only once the superior court grants a section petition for relief from the claim requirement,subd.f.
section b operates as a statute of limitations,and its limitations period is mandatory,not discretionary.oakdale joint unified school dist.th,citing lineaweaver,supra,d at.in lineaweaver,the plaintiff failed to present a timely claim and instead presented an application for leave to present a late claim,which was deemed denied by operation of law when the public entity did not act within days.lineaweaver,supra,at.the plaintiff later filed a complaint and two amended complaints,the last of which the trial court deemed to be a petition for relief from the claims requirement under section.lineaweaver,supra,at.the trial court denied the plaintiff section petition as untimely because it was not filed within six months of the date on which the plaintiff application to present a late claim was denied or deemed denied.ibid.the court of appeal affirmed the trial court denial of the petition as untimely and emphasized the limitations period of section b acts as a statute of limitations.lineaweaver,supra,at.
the district did not act on application for leave to present a late claim therefore,it was deemed denied on december,the day after it was presented.counsel filed a petition under section on o
