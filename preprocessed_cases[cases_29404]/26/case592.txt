charles kincaid and capri coffer appeal the district court grant of summary judgment upholding confiscation and ban on distribution of a college yearbook edited by coffer.upon en banc review,we determine that the ksu officials violated the first amendment rights of kincaid and coffer.accordingly,we reverse the order of the district court and remand the case with instructions to enter judgment in favor of kincaid and coffer and to determine the relief to which they are entitled.see,leila hosp.and health ctr.bowen,cir.
background 
factual background 
at the times relevant to this case,both kincaid and coffer were registered students at kentucky state university ksu,a public,university.betty gibson was ksu vice president for student affairs.ksu funded production and distribution of the thorobred,the student yearbook ksu students composed and produced the thorobred,with limited advice from the university student publications advisor,as discussed infra.
coffer served as the editor of the yearbook during the academic year.although a and at least one other student assisted her at one point,coffer organized and put together the yearbook herself after her staff members lost interest in the project.coffer endeavored to do something different with the yearbook in order to bring kentucky state university into the nineties she also sought to present a yearbook to the student population that was what they had never seen before.to these ends,coffer created a purple cover using a material known as rain shower foil stamp,and,for the first time,gave the yearbook a theme.the theme,destination unknown,described the atmosphere of uncertainty that coffer believed characterized the time coffer found evidence of this uncertainty in students wondering where are we going in our lives,in high unemployment rates,and in a current controversy regarding whether ksu was going to become a community college.coffer included pictures in the yearbook depicting events at ksu and in its surrounding community,and political and current events in the nation and world at large.the yearbook covered both the and academic years because the students working on the yearbook had fallen behind schedule.although the yearbook was originally projected to contain pages,coffer testified that the final product contained only pages,because she did not have enough pictures to fill pages and because the university administration took no interest in the publication.coffer completed the yearbook several thousand dollars under budget,and sent the yearbook to the printer in may or june of.
when the yearbook came back from the printer in november,gibson objected to several aspects of it,finding the publication to be of poor quality and inappropriate.in particular,gibson objected to the yearbook purple cover ksu school colors are green and gold,its destination unknown theme,the lack of captions under many of the photos,and the inclusion of current events ostensibly unrelated to ksu.after consulting with ksu president mary smith and other unnamed university officials,gibson and smith decided to confiscate the yearbooks and to withhold them from the ksu community.gibson contacted leslie thomas,ksu director of student life,and instructed her to secure the yearbooks so that they would not be distributed.thomas contacted ksu director for service management,who ensured that the yearbooks were secured.although gibson intention was perhaps to discard the yearbooks,gibson counsel indicated at oral argument that the yearbooks remain hidden away on ksu campus.
procedural background 
in november,kincaid and coffer sued gibson,smith,and individual members of the ksu board of regents under,alleging that the university confiscation of and failure to distribute the ksu student yearbook violated their rights under the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution kincaid and coffer sought damages and injunctive relief.
both parties moved for summary judgment on the yearbook claim.the district court applied a forum analysis to the students first amendment claim,and found that the ksu yearbook was a nonpublic forum.see perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.the district court reasoned that kincaid and coffer had put forth no evidence that the thorobred was intended to reach or communicate with anybody but ksu students,and held that the yearbook was not intended to be a journal of expression and communication in a public forum sense,but instead was intended to be a journal of the goings on in a particular year at ksu.having found that the yearbook was not a public forum,the court held that the university officials refusal to distribute the yearbook on the grounds that the yearbook was not of proper quality and did not represent the school a s it should,was reasonable.accordingly,the court granted the ksu officials motion for summary judgment and denied the students motion.both in finding that the ksu yearbook was a nonpublic forum and in finding that the ksu officials actions were reasonable,the district court relied in part upon hazelwood sch.dist.kuhlmeier,d 
a divided panel of this court affirmed the district court opinion.see kincaid gibson.we granted en banc review to determine whether the panel and the district court erred in applying case that deals exclusively with the first amendment rights of students in a high school setting to the university setting,and to examine whether the district court erred in finding that the failed as a matter of law to submit sufficient evidence to prove that the ksu yearbook is a limited public forum rather than a nonpublic forum for the reasons that follow,we hold that the ksu yearbook is a limited public forum,and that kincaid and coffer have presented sufficient evidence that the university officials violated their first amendment rights to prevail as a matter of law.see.c.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see greer united states,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.there is no dispute regarding the material facts of this case indeed,each party insists that the facts as presented to the district court require summary judgment in his or her favor.we recognize that t he fact that both parties make motions for summary judgment,and each contends in support of his respective motion that no genuine issue of fact exists,does not require the court to rule that no fact issue exists.begnaud white,cir accord greer,at.nonetheless,cross motions for summary judgment do authorize the court to assume that there is no evidence which needs to be considered other than that which has been filed by the parties.greer,at citing harrison western gulf oil,cir.there is a substantial amount of testimony and documentary evidence in the record before us.thus,we agree with the parties that the facts as developed in this case are sufficient to decide the case in accordance with clearly established first amendment law,and we find no material facts in dispute that prevent the district court from granting summary judgment in favor of kincaid and coffer.
iii.discussion 
the issue before us is whether the university officials violated the first amendment rights of kincaid and coffer by confiscating and failing to distribute the ksu student yearbook.for the reasons that follow,we apply a forum analysis to the question and hold that the ksu yearbook constitutes a limited or designated public forum.accordingly,we analyze the actions taken by the university officials with respect to the yearbook under strict scrutiny,and conclude that the officials confiscation of the yearbooks violated kincaid and coffer first amendment rights.
application of public forum doctrine 
we begin with the fundamental principle that there can be no doubt that the first amendment rights of speech and association extend to the campuses of state universities.widmar vincent,d.ksu is a,public university.see.ann.as such,the actions ksu officials take in their official capacities constitute state actions for purposes of first amendment analysis.further,the funds and materials that ksu allocates toward production of the thorobred constitute state property.see united food commercial workers union ufcwu,local southwest ohio regional transit,cir.by confiscating the yearbooks at issue in this case,the ksu officials have restricted access to state property used for expressive purposes.the supreme court has adopted a forum analysis for use in determining whether a restriction on access to public property is constitutionally permissible.id.accordingly,we find that forum analysis is appropriate in this case.
although kincaid and coffer argue their case under the forum doctrine,they argue in the alternative that forum analysis does not apply to the ksu yearbooks because forum analysis is only appropriate when the issue concerns the access sought by the proposed speaker,and that access is not at issue in this case.appellants supp.br.at.we disagree.it is true that a speaker must seek access to public property or to private property dedicated to public use to evoke first amendment concerns.see cornelius naacp legal defense and educ.fund,d.although neither kincaid nor coffer seeks to add words or photographs to the yearbook at this point,university officials have cut off ksu students access to read and possess it.further,the supreme court has often applied a forum analysis to expressive activity within educational settings.see,rosenberger rector and visitors of of virginia,d applying forum analysis to university student activities fund perry,d applying forum analysis to school district internal mail system hazelwood,d applying forum analysis to high school newspaper widmar,d applying forum analysis to university meeting fora.thus,we find that forum analysis is the appropriate framework under which to proceed in this case 
type of forum 
there is no real dispute in this case that the forum in question is the thorobred itself.the parties dispute strenuously,however,the appropriate characterization of the thorobred under forum analysis.kincaid and coffer contend that the yearbook is a limited public forum,subject only to reasonable time,place,and manner regulations,and to only those regulations that are narrowly crafted to serve a compelling state interest.see perry,at.the ksu officials respond that the yearbook is a nonpublic forum,subject to all reasonable regulations that preserve the yearbook purpose.see id.
the supreme court has recognized three types of fora.the first type is a traditional public forum.a traditional public forum is a place which by long tradition or by government fiat ha s been devoted to assembly and debate,such as a street or park.see id.at.in traditional public fora,the rights of the state to limit expressive activity are sharply circumscribed the government may enforce restrictions only if they are narrowly drawn to serve a compelling interest,and may enforce time,place,and manner regulations only if they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest,and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.id.the second type of forum has been alternatively described as a limited public forum,see rosenberger,at,and as a designated public forum,see arkansas educ.television comm forbes,d.the government may open a limited public forum for use by the public at large for assembly and speech,for use by certain speakers,or for the discussion of certain subjects.cornelius,at.although the government need not retain the open nature of a limited public forum,as long as it does so it is bound by the same standards as apply in a traditional public forum.perry,at.the third and final type of forum is a nonpublic forum.the government may control access to a nonpublic forum based on subject matter and speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral.cornelius,at.see also perry,at.
the parties agree that the thorobred is not a traditional public forum.to determine whether the yearbook is a limited public forum,the touchstone of our analysis is whether the government intended to open the forum at issue.see cornelius,at.accord forbes,at.hazelwood,at.to determine whether the government intended to create a limited public forum,we look to the government policy and practice with respect to the forum,as well as to the nature of the property at issue and its compatibility with expressive activity.cornelius,at.further,the context within which the forum is found is relevant to determining whether the government has created a limited public forum.see,forbes,at.stating that the public forum doctrine should not be extended in a mechanical way to the very different context of public television broadcasting.cornelius,at.stating that court will not ignore the special nature and function of the federal workplace in evaluating the limits that may be imposed on an organization right to participate in fundraising forum.evaluating these policy and practice,the nature of the thorobred and its compatibility with expressive activity,and the context in which the yearbook is find clear evidence of ksu intent to make the yearbook a limited public forum.
ksu written policy toward the thorobred is found in a section of the student handbook entitled student publications.in addition to stating ksu policy toward the yearbook,the handbook describes the university structure for oversight of the publication.the yearbook along with the student newspaper is under the management of the student publications board.the student publications board spb,in turn,is composed of students,faculty members,and university officials both the university written policy and the structure it created to oversee the yearbook evidence ksu intention that the yearbook serve as a limited public forum.
first and foremost,the policy places editorial control of the yearbook in the hands of a student editor or editors.although the policy provides for the establishment of minimum qualifications for student editors once a student is appointed editor,editorial control of the yearbook content belongs to her.this is made clear by the policy description of the student publications advisor,a university employee.the policy directs that the spb shall require the use of an experienced advisor,but limits the advisor role to assur ing that the yearbook is not overwhelmed by ineptitude and inexperience.indeed,the policy expressly limits the types of changes that the advisor may make to the yearbook 
in order to meet the responsible standards of journalism,an advisor may require changes in the form of materials submitted by students,but such changes must deal only with the form or the time and manner of expressions rather than alteration of content.
see app.i emphasis added.this language is revealing not only does it direct the university chosen advisor to refrain from editing the content of the yearbook,it also tracks the supreme court description of the limitations on government regulation of expressive activity in a limited public forum.see perry,at.reasonable time,place and manner regulations are permissible,and a prohibition must be narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest.ksu intent to limit its own oversight to time,place,and manner aspects of the yearbook is also seen in the policy treatment of the spb.the policy declares that one of the duties of the spb is to a pprove the written publications policy of each student publication,including such items as purpose,size,quantity controls,and time,place and manner of distribution.this language reiterates the university intent to limit its oversight of the yearbook to general and administrative matters,and to cede authority over the yearbook content to the students who published it.finally,the publications policy opens with language that indicates that the expressive activity contained in student publications is to be largely unrestrained the board of regents respects the integrity of student publications and the press,and the rights to exist in an atmosphere of free and responsible discussion and of intellectual exploration.such restraint is strong evidence of ksu intent to create a limited public forum,rather than to reserve to itself the right to edit or determine the thorobred content.
the ksu officials argue that the handbook policy shows the university intent to retain,rather than relinquish,control over the yearbook content.they point in particular to the fact that the policy requires a disclaimer to be placed on the student not on the evidence of the university intent to retain control over the content of the yearbook such reasoning relies upon a negative inference in other words,the fact that the policy fails to require a disclaimer to be placed upon the yearbook purportedly implies that the yearbook is an official organ of the university,because the university requires a disclaimer on the newspaper,and the newspaper is not such an official organ.this is hardly persuasive.were we to follow the logic behind this conclusion,we must also conclude that the university has forgone all standards of quality control with relation to the yearbook.after all,the publications policy states minimum standards of quality control for the newspaper,but none for the yearbook yet to concede that would require the university officials to concede their entire argues on appeal that the basis for confiscating the yearbooks is their allegedly poor quality.rather than engage in such inferential gymnastics,we read the university policy in a straightforward manner.for the reasons discussed,supra,ksu policy leaves room for only one conclusion that the university intended to open the yearbook as a limited public forum.
in addition to examining ksu stated policy,we must examine the university actual practice to determine whether it truly intended to create a limited public forum in the thorobred.indeed,we have noted that actual practice speaks louder than words in determining whether the government intended to create a limited public forum.see ufcwu,at quoting grace bible fellowship,maine school admin.dist,cir.the record before us contains substantial evidence from varied sources that the spb followed its stated hands off policy in actual practice.coffer testified without contradiction that vice president coffer described as a friend with whom she was on excellent terms never expressed any concern about what the content might be in the yearbook prior to its publication,but rather limited her concerns to the yearbook release date.nor did the spb exercise oversight of the yearbook content.laura jo cullen,the university publications advisor to the yearbook and an ex officio member of the spb,testified that the spb limited its oversight of the yearbook to issues such as advertising rates and selection of editors,and that in the time during which she had been associated with the yearbook the board had never attempted to control the content of the yearbook.leslie thomas,ksu director of student life and another member of the spb,testified that the spb exercised minimal oversight of the yearbook in actual practice we just always dealt with the newspaper so i guess that was the major focus.thomas also testified that it was the student editor rather than the spb who determined the content of the yearbook.thus,the record before us is clear that,in actual practice,student ksu officials,not the student publications advisor,and not the the content of ksu student yearbook.
nature of the property and compatibility with expressive activity 
in addition to the university policy and practice,an examination of the nature of the forum at issue and its compatibility with expressive activity further indicates that ksu intended to open the thorobred to the student editors as a limited public forum.the ksu yearbook is a student publication that,by its very nature,exists for the purpose of expressive activity.there can be no serious argument about the fact that,in its most basic form,the yearbook serves as a forum in which student editors present pictures,captions,and other written material,and that these materials constitute expression for purposes of the first amendment.as a creative publication,the yearbook is easily distinguished from other government fora whose natures are not so compatible with free expression.see,cornelius,at.finding that nature of government property at issue indicates that fundraising forum in federal workplace is nonpublic forum jones north carolina prisoners labor union,d finding that prison is a nonpublic forum greer spock,d holding that military installation is not a public forum.nor is the thorobred a classroom activity in which an instructor assigns student editors a grade,or in which a university official edits content.see hazelwood,at.the student handbook itself describes the yearbook as a student publication that should exist in an atmosphere of free and responsible discussion and of intellectual exploration.it is difficult to conceive of a forum whose nature is more compatible with expression.
we are also persuaded that the context within which this case arises indicates that the thorobred constitutes a limited public forum.the university is a special place for purposes of first amendment jurisprudence.the danger of chilling individual thought and expression is especially real in the university setting,where the state acts against a background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition.rosenberger,at.citing cases see also widmar,at.this court has recognized that the campus of a public university,at least for its students,possesses many of the characteristics of a public forum.the university environment is the quintessential marketplace of ideas,which merits full,or indeed heightened,first amendment protection.see healy james,d stating that the vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of american schools quotation marks and citation omitted.in addition to the nature of the university setting,we find it relevant that the editors of the thorobred and its readers are likely to be young himself was at the time of his march deposition.thus,there can be no justification for suppressing the yearbook on the grounds that it might be unsuitable for immature audiences.compare hazelwood,at.footnote omitted,with widmar,at.university students are,of course,young adults.they are less impressionable than younger students.accordingly,we find that the fact that the forum at issue arises in the university context mitigates in favor of finding that the yearbook is a limited public forum.
ksu officials arguments 
the ksu officials dispute this substantial evidence of the university intent to create a limited public forum in the student yearbook.they argue that a limited public forum can not exist unless the government has opened the forum at issue for indiscriminate use by the general public.the district court agreed,concluding that the yearbook was a nonpublic forum by reasoning that kincaid and coffer had put forth no evidence that the thorobred was intended to reach or communicate with anybody but ksu students.this reasoning badly distorts a basic tenet of public forum law.it is true that one of the ways in which the government may create or designate a public forum is by opening the forum for indiscriminate use by the general public.see perry,at.but the government may create a limited public forum in other ways as well a public forum may be created by government designation of a place or channel of communication for use by the public at large for assembly and speech,for use by certain speakers,or for the discussion of certain subjects.cornelius,at.emphasis added see also hazelwood,at.high school facilities may be deemed to be public forums only if school authorities have by policy or by practice opened the facilities for indiscriminate use by the general public,or by some segment of the public,such as student organizations.citations omitted and emphasis added.thus,the proposition put forth by the university officials and relied upon by the district,that the government must open a forum for indiscriminate use by the general public in order to create a designated public erroneous.
the ksu officials further argue that only select individuals had access to the thorobred,and that a designated public forum is not created when the government allows selective access for individual speakers rather than general access for a class of speakers.see forbes,at.in an attempt to bring the thorobred under this rule,the officials point out that ksu limited access to the yearbook to the yearbook staff,which,in this case,was comprised of only coffer.the officials note additionally that ksu student handbook imposes certain minimum as a minimum grade point average or successful completion of a journalism members of the yearbook board of editors,and that there is no evidence that the student body as a whole may contribute to the yearbook.the ksu officials again misinterpret first amendment forum law.there is a distinction between general access,which indicates that the property is a designated public forum,and selective access,which indicates that the property is a nonpublic forum.forbes,at.citations omitted.general access is defined as the situation in which the government makes its property generally available to a certain class of speakers.id.emphasis added.selective access occurs when the government does no more than reserve eligibility for access to the forum to a particular class of speakers,whose members must then,as individuals,obtain permission to use it.id.emphasis added and citation omitted.in the instant case,ksu policy and practice indicate that the university intended to designate the yearbook as a public forum for those students who became editors of the other words,the student editors composed the class of speakers for which the university designated the yearbook as a limited public forum.these editors were under no obligation to obtain permission each time they sought to access the,the policy and practice of the university was to give the student editors exclusive control over the content of the thorobred.thus,the student editors had general access to the yearbook.see forbes,at.this is consistent with our finding that the yearbook constitutes a limited public forum for that particular class 
in sum,our review of ksu policy and practice with regard to the thorobred,the nature of the yearbook and its compatibility with expressive activity,and the university context in which the yearbook is created and distributed,all provide strong evidence of the university intent to designate the yearbook as a limited public forum.accordingly,we must determine whether the university officials actions with respect to the yearbook were constitutional.
constitutionality of university officials actions 
as discussed,supra,the government may impose only reasonable time,place,and manner regulations,and regulations that are narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest,on expressive activity in a limited public forum.see perry,at.in addition,as with all manner of fora,the government may not suppress expression on the basis that state officials oppose a speaker view.see id.for the following reasons,we hold that the actions taken by the ksu officials ran afoul of these restrictions on government action.
upon their return from the printer,the yearbooks were delivered to the office of laura cullen,the student publications advisor.before they could be distributed to kincaid and other ksu students,gibson ordered leslie thomas to have them secured thomas complied,and,without any notification or explanation to cullen,the yearbooks were spirited away.to this six years after the yearbooks returned from the university refuses to distribute them.this is not a reasonable time,place,or manner regulation of expressive activity.see perry,at.see also papish board of curators of the of missouri,d holding that university expulsion of graduate student for distributing on campus a newspaper containing indecent speech violated first amendment because she was expelled because of the disapproved content of the newspaper rather than the time,place,or manner of its distribution.italics in original footnote omitted.nor is it a narrowly crafted regulation designed to preserve a compelling state interest.see perry,at.rather,wholesale confiscation of printed materials which the state feels reflect poorly on its institutions is as broadly sweeping a regulation as the state might muster.further,the university officials action leaves open no alternative grounds for similar expressive activity.see id.at.the record contains no other student forum for recording words and pictures to reflect the experience of ksu students during the through school years.indeed,the likelihood of the existence of any such alternative forum at this late date,when virtually all of the students who were at ksu in the early will have surely moved on,is extraordinarily slim.accordingly,the ksu officials confiscation of the yearbooks violates the first amendment,and the university has no constitutionally valid reason to withhold distribution of the thorobred from ksu students from that era.
the ksu officials argue that withholding the yearbooks is excusable because they were regulating the style and form of the yearbooks rather than their content.at oral argument,counsel for the officials argued that the record contains no evidence that the officials withheld distribution of the yearbooks based on content,or that they altered the content of the yearbooks.this argument is simply not credible.first,the record makes clear that gibson sought to regulate the content of the yearbook in addition to complaining about the yearbook color,lack of captions,and overall quality,gibson withheld the yearbooks because she found the yearbook theme of destination unknown inappropriate.gibson also disapproved of the inclusion of pictures of current events,and testified that t here were a lot of pictures in the back of the book that to me,looked like a life magazine.gibson further stated that the inclusion of pictures of current events was not exactly what i thought it should have been,and it was what other people who viewed it thought it should have been.and after the yearbooks came back from the printer,gibson complained to cullen that s everal persons have received the book,and are thoroughly disappointed at the quality and content.thus,it is quite clear that gibson attempted to regulate the content of the thorobred once it was printed.
the officials argument also fails because they have,in effect,altered the thorobred.confiscation ranks with forced government speech as amongst the purest forms of content alteration.there is little if any difference between hiding from public view the words and pictures students use to portray their college experience,and forcing students to publish a script.in either case,the government alters student expression by obliterating it.we will not sanction a reading of the first amendment that permits government officials to censor expression in a limited public forum in order to coerce speech that pleases the government.the ksu officials present no compelling reason to nullify coffer expression or to shield it from kincaid view and,accordingly,the officials actions violate the constitution.see perry,at.
even were we to assume,as the ksu officials argue,that the yearbook was a nonpublic forum,confiscation of the yearbook would still violate kincaid and coffer free speech rights.although the government may act to preserve a nonpublic forum for its intended purposes,its regulation of speech must nonetheless be reasonable,and it must not attempt to suppress expression based on the speaker viewpoint.see perry,at.the actions taken by the ksu officials fail under even this relaxed standard.
in arguing that their confiscation of the yearbook was reasonable to preserve the forum purpose,see,the officials adopt a portion of coffer testimony as a statement of the yearbook purpose it something that the university provides as a record for that year,a pictorial record for that year.the officials then argue that because the yearbook was only half its intended contained pictures that lacked captions,it failed to fulfill its purpose.because the yearbook failed to fulfill its intended purpose,the argument goes,the university confiscation of the yearbooks was reasonable.the university officials acknowledge,however,that coffer explained elsewhere in her testimony that the yearbook was intended to be a collection of pictures that depicted what went on at kentucky state university,around the community that kentucky state university set in,the state and the world.there is no dispute that the yearbook included pictures of a wide range of individuals and events.indeed,one of gibson main gripes with the yearbook was that it included pictures of current events and celebrities,and n umerous pictures of ross perot,bill clinton,the pope,and lots of people.thus,the yearbook appears to have fulfilled the purpose expressed by its editor.
more important,the ksu officials actions were not reasonable because they were arbitrary and conflicted with the university own stated policy.the university publications policy states that the thorobred yearbook shall be under the management of the student publications board.yet thomas testified that neither gibson nor any other ksu administrators discussed with the spb the drastic act of confiscating the yearbooks.further,the university policy gave to cullen the power to require changes in the form of materials submitted by students that deal with the form or the time and manner of expressions.yet,the ksu officials never even consulted cullen,the student publications advisor,before they seized the yearbooks.in fact,coffer testified that cullen had helped her come up with the yearbook apparently contentious theme and pick out its allegedly scandalous cover.finally,the university released the subsequent,yearbook,despite the fact that it was,in gibson own estimation,only a tad better than the previous one,the yearbook at issue in this case these facts show without doubt that the university confiscation of the yearbooks was anything but reasonable rather,it was a rash,arbitrary act,wholly out of proportion to the situation it was allegedly intended to address.
we note that ksu suppression of the yearbook smacks of viewpoint discrimination as well.the university officials based their confiscation of the yearbook in part upon the particular theme chosen by coffer,destination unknown.coffer characterized that theme,which she described in the yearbook itself,as my opinion as a student regarding the overall student population.coffer choice of theme is a classic illustration of what we mean when we refer to a speaker viewpoint.the university officials also based their confiscation of the yearbooks on the fact that the some of its pictures captured particular,individuals whom they deemed to be out of place in a student yearbook.kincaid summarized the basic premise of first amendment viewpoint jurisprudence when he testified,a picture that may be relevant to me may be something that would be garbage to you.we might add that in a traditional,limited,or nonpublic forum,state officials may not expunge even garbage if it represents a speaker viewpoint.see perry,at.finally,the yearbook contained written segments which coffer described as stating her opinions on various matters.because the government may not regulate even a nonpublic forum based upon the speaker viewpoint,see,and because an editor choice of theme,selection of particular pictures,and expression of opinions are clear examples of the editor viewpoint,the ksu officials actions violated the first amendment under a nonpublic forum analysis as well as a limited public forum analysis.see rosenberger,at.the government must abstain from regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.
iv.conclusion 
the district court erred by granting summary judgment to the university officials and denying it to kincaid and coffer because the record clearly shows ksu intent to designate the thorobred as a limited public forum.specifically,the district court erred in concluding that the yearbook was a nonpublic forum on the basis that kincaid and coffer put forth no evidence that the thorobred was intended to reach or communicate with anybody but ksu students.this reasoning simply misapplies public forum law.the district court further erred in concluding that the yearbook was not intended to be a journal of expression and communication in a public forum sense,but instead to be a journal of the goings on in a particular year at ksu.given ksu stated policy and practice with regard to the yearbook,the nature of the yearbook and its compatibility with expressive activity,and the university context in which the yearbook is published,there can be no question that the thorobred is a journal of expression and communication in the public forum sense.the university confiscation of this journal of expression was arbitrary and unreasonable.as such,it violated kincaid and coffer first amendment rights.
in light of the clearly established contours of the public forum doctrine and the substantially developed factual record in this case,the district court should have denied the ksu officials motion for summary judgment and granted kincaid and coffer summary judgment motion.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case with instructions to enter judgment in favor of kincaid and coffer,and to determine the relief to which they are entitled.
