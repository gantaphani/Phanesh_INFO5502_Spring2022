was a high school student who was entitled to certain services pursuant to the individuals with disabilities education act idea,et.his education program was part of an individualized educational plan iep under which independent school district number provided with a free and appropriate public education fape.see d.appeals the denial of a due process hearing on the failure of the school district to provide the procedural safeguards required by the idea.we find that neither we nor the district court have jurisdiction over this appeal,and we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court.
the idea guarantees that children with disabilities have access to a free and appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs c.to meet this goal,the idea provides federal funding to state and local agencies and requires them to provide each child with an iep.an iep is a written statement that includes such matters as the child level of educational performance,annual goals,services to be provided to the child and the like.see d.a school district satisfies its obligation to provide a fape by providing personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from that instruction.board of educ.rowley,d.parents have the right to seek review of any decisions affecting their child education through a due process hearing conducted by the state educational agency.see f honig doe,d.
at the beginning of his senior year at stroud high school,requested a due process hearing from the oklahoma state department of education on the grounds that the school district had denied him a fape.the matter was assigned to a hearing officer,mark reed.at the hearing,alleged that the school district had denied him a fape because his iep did not identify a weakness in his typing skills and did not address his preferred modifications for his english and horticulture classes.reed found in favor of the school district,and appealed.in april,the appeal officer affirmed reed decision.he held that iep was appropriate,needed no modification and exceeded the school district obligations under the idea.although he had a right to do so,see i a,did not appeal this decision to the federal district court.
that same month,a team meeting regarding iep was held.this was apparently the second team meeting of that year,but it was not an exit iep meeting and,argues,it did not focus on the issue of transition services for his life.
the school in regular course concluded that had successfully completed all of his academic requirements to allow him to graduate.yet on may,the last day of school,delivered a request for a due process hearing to the school district.he also sent the school district a letter,dated may,claiming that his iep was insufficient and that,therefore,the april team meeting had been improperly conducted.the school district concluded that had graduated before the request for a due process hearing was received and thus he was due no further relief under the idea.the hearing officer agreed with this position,and concluded that he lacked jurisdiction to hold a due process hearing on the issue.again appealed,and the appeals officer affirmed that decision.then asked the district court to order a due process hearing,and that request was denied.the court concluded that the administrative decisions to deny requests for a due process hearing were proper.now appeals.
our first task is to determine whether we have jurisdiction over this case.if a student has graduated from high school and does not contest his graduation,the case is moot.see board of educ.nathan,cir.once a student has graduated,he is no longer entitled to a fape thus any claim that a fape was deficient becomes moot upon a valid graduation.see see also neshaminy sch.dist.karla.this rule applies,of course,only where a student does not contest his graduation,and where he is seeking only than.
we therefore only consider claims in light of the remote possibility that they could be construed as a challenge to graduation from stroud high school,and the chance that they seek compensatory educational services.the difficulty here is the murkiness of claims.while we doubt that he seriously challenges his graduation,and we also question that he seriously seeks some sort of compensatory relief,there is an inkling of those possibilities lurking in various arguments.however,it is just an that is hardly enough to overcome the apparent mootness of his claim.for was apparently prepared for,actually sought and was properly deemed eligible for graduation from high school at the end of his senior year.this conclusion is bolstered by the school district noting that was attending college after his high school graduation and that he achieved a grade point average during his first college does not contest.
only clear request here is for a due process hearing,and,at least in connection with a suggestion of an improper graduation,we have jurisdiction to consider such a purely procedural only if it is connected with substantive relief.for a claim based on deprivation of a due process hearing other procedures,to be cognizable,must be linked with a consequent loss of substantive benefits.here,these deprivations must involve loss of qualification for graduation.this loss would import defects in the educational program such that had yet to meet certain requirements for graduation from the district.thus,would have to argue that his graduation was invalid.it is difficult to find any such contentions in submissions on this appeal.
nevertheless,we shall examine arguments to determine whether they arguably call for the invalidation of his graduation and for compensatory relief.we review the decision of the district court de novo,applying the same standard of review to the hearing officer determination as did the district court.murray montrose cy.sch,cir.thus,we actually apply a modified de novo review,which entails an independent review of the evidence,and a decision based on the preponderance of the evidence,while giving due weight to the administrative proceedings below.id.quoting doe board of,cir,cert.denied,d.
the crux of argument is that graduation constitutes a change in placement under the idea,and that therefore the school district was required to give him formal notification of the impending graduation,an exit iep meeting and notice of his available options related to the proposed change in placement.see a iii.also argues that local educational agencies must,before determining that a child is no longer a child with a disability eligible for services,evaluate or reevaluate the child.see c.gone from his claims are the allegations in his initial due process hearing requests,and his main chance of contending that he contests the propriety of his graduation 
first,argues that notice of his impending graduation should have been given.see a iii graduation from high school with a regular diploma constitutes a change in placement,requiring written prior notice.however,does not claim that this lack of notice rendered his graduation invalid.by failing to directly challenge the validity of his graduation,essentially concedes both that the claimed procedural defect was harmless and that the appeals officer had no jurisdiction to hear his claim.see nathan,at finding that a student idea claim became moot once he graduated and was no longer entitled to services 
also contends that there was a requirement for an exit meeting,of which he was deprived.if there were such a requirement,that requirement was not met and graduation,as a result,might not have been authorized arguably he might thereby allege a substantive deprivation.but,as will appear,argument does not really add up to such a claim.for argues that,at the allegedly required exit meeting,the student education program must be reviewed to ensure that graduation is appropriate.see policies and procedures for special education in oklahoma.but there is no such requirement under the idea.he cites c,which states that a local educational agency shall evaluate a child with a disability in accordance with this
