this appeal concerns plaintiffs who sought and received an injunction and nominal damages in an action brought against a school district.despite their status as prevailing parties,the plaintiffs appeal from the district court judgment in their favor alleging,among other things,that the district court improperly failed to rule on the merits of their constitutional claim.we conclude that the plaintiffs lack standing to appeal from the judgment in their favor and,also,that the claims for which they have standing lack merit.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in,this court determined,in doe santa fe independ.school,cir,that a santa fe independent school district school district policy that invited and encouraged students to read religious messages from the stage at graduation ceremonies and over the public address system at football games violated the establishment clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution.the school district filed a petition for certiorari in the united states supreme court pending a decision on the petition,the school district adopted a policy prohibiting students from including prayer or reference to a deity in messages.
following the adoption of the new policy,plaintiff marian ward was selected as student speaker for the football season.school officials informed marian of the speaker policy and cautioned her to follow it.on september,before the first football game,marian ward parents,robert and marjorie ward,individually and as next friends of their daughter,brought an action alleging that the new policy violated marian ward constitutional rights to free speech and free exercise of religion as guaranteed by the first and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.the also alleged violations of the establishment clause of the first amendment,certain provisions of the texas state constitution and the texas religious freedoms restoration act.the plaintiffs sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief,declaratory relief,nominal damages and attorneys fees.
on september,the district court held a hearing on the plaintiffs request for a temporary restraining order.at the hearing,the school board stated that it agreed with the arguments presented by the plaintiffs and wanted to allow its students to deliver unrestricted messages over the public address system.the school board,however,felt constrained by this court decision in doe,a decision the board was seeking to reverse.the district court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the school board from effectuating the policy or otherwise preventing marian ward from praying or invoking a deity over the public address system.subsequently,the parties agreed to a preliminary injunction to the same effect.thus,marian ward was allowed to deliver unrestricted messages at each home football game.after the football season ended,marian ward graduated,and she and her parents moved from the school district.
in july,the school board rescinded the enjoined speaker policy challenged by the plaintiffs and discontinued the practice of having student messages of any kind delivered at football games.on august,at an initial scheduling conference with the parties,the district court pronounced the plaintiffs case moot and denied motions to amend the complaint to add a plea for actual damages and to add additional parties.the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion for a new trial.the district court issued a memorandum and order on march,upholding its prior rulings denying the motions,and dismissing ward parents as parties.
the plaintiffs appealed.a different panel of this court decided that marian ward claims were moot.see ward santa fe independent school district.cir.that panel further concluded that the district court properly dismissed the claims of ward parents because,regardless of their standing,their individual claims were also mooted by the school board recision of the policy.finally,the panel concluded that the district court correctly denied the plaintiffs request for leave to amend the pleadings to include a claim for actual damages because there had been undue delay in filing the request,and the complaint,as amended,failed to state a claim for actual damages.
the plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing before the appellate panel arguing that the case was not moot because they sought the recovery of nominal damages.on rehearing,the panel agreed that there remained a cognizable claim for nominal damages,again affirmed the district court ruling denying leave to amend the complaint and remanded the case to the district court without reaching the issue of whether ward parents were properly dismissed as parties.see ward santa fe independent school district.cir.
following the remand,the district court ordered counsel for the parties to file,within two weeks,an agreed final judgment awarding nominal damages.alternatively,if the parties could not agree upon the form of the final judgment and the amount of nominal damages,the court ordered,counsel must file instead,within two weeks,a memorandum of law,of five pages or less,stating their positions and attaching a proposed final judgment.the plaintiffs responded by filing a motion to reconvene the initial scheduling conference,to schedule discovery and other matters,and to proceed to a trial on the merits.the plaintiffs also sought reconsideration of the individual standing of robert and marjorie ward.thereafter,the plaintiffs filed a page proposed final judgment.in a memorandum of law filed with the proposed final judgment,the plaintiffs urged the court to proceed with discovery and stated their intent to file another motion to amend the complaint to allege actual damages.
the defendant filed a response to the court order offering to pay one dollar in nominal damages as well as reasonable attorney fees.subsequently,the defendant made a rule offer of judgment,offering to pay the plaintiffs dollars in nominal damages,with each plaintiff receiving,and reasonable attorney fees in an amount to be decided by the court.the plaintiffs did not accept the offer.
the district court denied the plaintiffs motions.the plaintiffs filed further motions including two to amend the pleadings,a motion to compel the defendant to provide rule disclosures and a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law to be included in the final judgment.on may,the district court issued a memorandum and order denying all of the plaintiffs motions and rendering judgment awarding plaintiff marian ward one dollar in nominal damages and in attorneys fees and costs.the memorandum and order of the district court included an excerpt from its september,oral ruling on the plaintiffs request for a temporary restraining order stating because the court found that the school district had violated marian ward first amendment rights,marian ward is entitled to an award of nominal damages.the district court specifically declined to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law and no other discussion of the merits of the plaintiffs constitutional claims appears in the memorandum and order.
on appeal,the plaintiffs argue that the district court erroneously failed to address the merits of the plaintiffs constitutional claims and failed to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law denied the plaintiffs motions for a scheduling order,disclosures and discovery denied the plaintiffs motion for leave to amend the complaint to include a claim for actual damages dismissed robert and marjorie ward as parties without notice or opportunity for discovery failed to address or to allow trial or judgment on the plaintiffs pendent state claim and miscalculated attorney fees.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the plaintiffs present two arguments regarding the substance of the district court decision the district court erroneously entered judgment without making findings of fact and conclusions of law,and the district court erroneously concluded that the defendant offer to pay nominal damages prevented a ruling on the merits.we sua sponte conclude that the plaintiffs lack standing to appeal the judgment in their favor.see forex asset management llc,cir this court may consider standing to appeal sua sponte.
it is a central tenet of appellate jurisdiction that a party who is not aggrieved by a judgment of the district court has no standing to appeal it.matter of sims,cir it is more than that a party can not appeal from a judgment unless aggrieved by it.thus,a prevailing party generally may not appeal a judgment in its favor.lindheimer illinois bell.the company was successful in the district court and has no right of appeal from the decree in its favor see also in re des,cir ordinarily,a prevailing party can not appeal from a district court judgment in its favor armotek,employers,cir dismissing defendant appeal because defendant was not aggrieved by the district court judgment in its favor cochran transp,cir concluding that it is well settled that a plaintiff can not appeal from a judgment that grants him the full relief requested.rather,a prevailing party has standing to appeal only if it can demonstrate an adverse effect resulting from the judgment in its favor.see aetna cas.sur.cunningham,cir prevailing party had standing to appeal where grounds for district court judgment rendered it dischargeable in bankruptcy in re des,supra,at a prevailing party may appeal if aggrieved by the collateral estoppel effects of the district court opinion.
in the present case,the plaintiffs received all of the relief they requested and can not demonstrate any adverse effect resulting from the judgment.thus,the plaintiffs lack standing to appeal insofar as their claims concern the district court award of nominal damages.
the plaintiffs complain that the district court did not render an opinion on the issues they raised.federal appellate courts review judgments,however,not opinions.see california rooney,d refusing to review pronouncement that search of trash was unconstitutional,where state,which sought to appeal,had won judgment that its search warrant nonetheless was valid texas hopwood,d ginsburg,concurring in denial of certiorari explaining denial of petition for writ of certiorari by noting that petitioner did not challenge lower court judgment that university admissions procedure was unconstitutional petition challenged only rationale relied on by court of appeals see also chathas local ibew,cir stating that j udgments are appealable opinions are not in re,cir holding that disagreement with reasons for a judgment in the party favor is insufficient to confer standing to appeal united states accra pac,cir observing that one who seeks an alteration in the language of the opinion but not the judgment may not appeal.thus,because the plaintiffs are not seeking a modification of the judgment but only a modification of the opinion,they have no standing to appeal.
although the plaintiffs do not specifically brief the matter of their standing to appeal,their argument suggests that they are aggrieved by the district court judgment because they have not received all of the relief they requested.see forney apfel,d general rule that prevailing party lacks standing to appeal is inapplicable where judgment grants only partial relief.according to the plaintiffs,the nominal damages construct is a fictional vehicle created by the supreme court to allow the merits to be reached so that constitutional issues can be decided.thus,they implicitly argue,plaintiffs who so plead necessarily are aggrieved by a judgment in their favor if it does not articulate the court reasons and conclusions with respect to the constitutional issues raised.the cases on which the plaintiffs rely,however,do not support the position they argue and we are unable to find any authority for it either 
as the seventh circuit stated in chathas local ibew,cir,a winning party can not appeal merely because the court that gave him his victory did not say things that he would have liked to hear,such as that his opponent is a lawbreaker.the court noted that a defendant is always free to default and have judgment entered against him.id.in such a case,the court would not review the merits of the plaintiff claims and declare the defendant actions illegal because such a ruling would be merely advisory.id.the ruling that the plaintiffs seek on appeal would similarly have no affect on the rights of the parties.we can not render such an advisory opinion,nor can we direct the district court to do so.john doe veneman,cir federal courts do not have the power to render advisory opinions nor to decide questions that can not affect the rights of the litigants.
the plaintiffs brief further suggests that,without an express ruling on the constitutionality of the speaker policy,marian ward constitutional rights have not been vindicated.in a similar vein,the plaintiffs suggest that the civil rights acts would be rendered ineffective if a person could not appeal from the rationale of a judgment in his favor.according to the plaintiffs,pursuant to such a holding,school districts could have won the battle against integration by purchasing the constitutional deprivations one dollar at a time.of course,the plaintiffs neglect to note that an award of nominal damages satisfies only a claim for nominal damages.such a judgment would not satisfy meritorious claims for injunctive,compensatory or other relief.the plaintiffs further neglect to note that as a result of their litigation they received,in addition to nominal damages,a temporary restraining order,a preliminary injunction,a rescission of the speaker policy,attorney fees and a judgment in their favor.although,arguably,the district court decision does not specifically state how the plaintiffs constitutional rights were violated,marian ward exercised her constitutional rights and won her case.thus,by any standard,her rights have been thoroughly vindicated.concluding that the plaintiffs are not aggrieved by a failure of the district court to state the reasons for its entry of judgment in their favor does not weaken civil rights jurisprudence.
the plaintiffs make several claims relating to discovery and other procedural rulings and orders.this court will reverse a district court discovery or procedural ruling if the appellant demonstrates both that the district court abused its discretion and that the appellant was prejudiced by the ruling.see hc gun knife shows,city of houston,cir citing hastings north east indep.school,cir.as the plaintiffs received all the relief they requested in their complaint,they can not establish that they suffered any prejudice as a result of the district court rulings.in other words,assuming,arguendo,that the district court abused its discretion in any of the challenged rulings or orders,the plaintiffs were not prejudiced because they prevailed in spite of the erroneous rulings.
the plaintiffs also contend that the district court improperly denied leave to amend the complaint to add a claim for actual damages.in the plaintiffs previous appeal in this case,a different panel of this court affirmed the district court denial of leave to amend due to undue delay and because the complaint,as amended,did not state a claim.after the case was remanded,the plaintiffs again moved for leave to amend and the district court again denied their motion.
in the present appeal,the plaintiffs argue,inter alia,that the district court erred in finding that their delay in seeking leave was unreasonable.because this court has already affirmed that particular finding by the district court,we will not revisit the matter.under the law of the case doctrine,an issue of fact or law decided on appeal may not be reexamined by the appellate court on a subsequent appeal.united states matthews,cir quoting tollett city of kemah,cir.
the plaintiffs further contend that the district court improperly dismissed marjorie and robert ward the wards as parties without warning and without discovery.according to the plaintiffs,the district court dismissed the wards for a failure to develop facts supporting standing while simultaneously denying the plaintiffs the opportunity to do so.we are not persuaded.
