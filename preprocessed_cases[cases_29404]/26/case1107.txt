introduction 
professors oscar somoza and miriam,brought an action against the,university of denver and several others,under title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and,for disparate treatment,hostile work environment and retaliation on the basis of their origin.also brought various state law claims against the university of denver.the parties consented to have the case decided by a magistrate judge under c.the magistrate judge granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed action.
appellants appeal one issue from the magistrate ruling.that issue is whether the magistrate judge committed reversible error in dismissing the appellants retaliation claims by failing to apply the new standard adopted by the united states supreme court in burlington northern santa fe ry.white,d.thus,the state law claims,disparate treatment claims,and hostile work environment claims are not at issue in this appeal.furthermore,at oral argument and in a later letter to this court,appellants counsel stated that appellants have waived two issues originally asserted in this appeal,those dealing with salary and workload.
ii.background 
appellants are and are faculty members of the spanish section of the department of languages and literature at the university of denver.appellants claim to have engaged in over twenty acts of protected conduct during the period of february through february,with retaliatory actions following the conduct.the magistrate provided a thorough synopsis of appellants claims and the factual elements therein therefore we reproduce the instances spelled out by the appellants in the brief as relevant conduct for establishing a prima facie case for employment retaliation.
in appellants brief,they detail fourteen scenarios in which the professors allegedly engaged in protected activity,after which retaliatory conduct allegedly followed.they are as follows 
appellants complained to susan lee,director of equal employment opportunity at the university of denver,and department chair luc beaudoin about their unfavorable and biased treatment during the assistant professor search in february and also about their perception of the sexist treatment of a teaching candidate,joseph mcclanahan.appellants were allegedly subjected to public humiliation at a february meeting.
on february,appellants met with dean kvistad,chair beaudoin and professor difranco,who explained that they had elected to postpone the search for an assistant professor.chair beaudoin convened a department meeting to vote on a decision regarding the search.
dean kvistad allegedly takes a lecturer position away from the spanish section.
on april,chair beaudoin allegedly precluded appellants from selecting a spanish section lecturer.
chair beaudoin allegedly prevented them from participating in the search process for a new spanish section lecturer.
appellants met with dean kvistad and susan lee where they raised issues of a hostile working environment and discriminatory,disparate treatment.on june,miriam asked dean kvistad for compensation as section coordinator.
chair beaudoin allegedly allowed javier torre,a junior spanish faculty member,to harass appellants.
appellants filed their discrimination complaints with susan lee against chair beaudoin and javier torre.
appellants wrote to provost coombe,dean kvistad and chair beaudoin about torre harassing and retaliatory behavior.
chair beaudoin allegedly abolished the spanish section.
appellant sent another memo to javier torre outlining the ongoing harassment by torre which was copied to provost coombe,dean kvistad and chair beaudoin.
on december,appellants filed their first equal employment opportunity commission complaint.
appellant miriam was allegedly precluded from participating in the selection of the basic language coordinator for the spanish program.
in october,appellants filed their second equal employment opportunity commission complaints,and on february,they filed their lawsuit.department chair jennifer pap allegedly made alterations to the spanish section.
appellants only contention is that granting summary judgment in favor of the was inappropriate in light of the evidence supplied when analyzed under the broader retaliation claim standard set forth in burlington northern santa fe ry.white,d.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.simms ex rel.of mental health substance abuse,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we examine the factual record and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.simms,at.
retaliation claims under title vii and 
the test for establishing a prima facie case for retaliation is the same under both title vii and.see roberts roadway,cir thomas denny,cir.in analyzing retaliation claims,we apply the test established in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see penry fed.home loan bank,cir.this structure requires the plaintiff to first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.mcdonnell douglas,at.should the plaintiff succeed in proving a prima facie case,the employer must provide a legitimate and facially reason for its decision.id.finally,if the employer satisfies this burden,the plaintiff must establish that the defendant reasons were a pretext for discrimination.id.at.
in order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,plaintiffs must show that that he engaged in protected opposition to discrimination,that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,and that a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the materially adverse action.argo blue cross blue shield of,cir 
burlington northern santa fe ry.white 
the sole issue in this appeal is whether the magistrate judge applied the wrong standard in evaluating plaintiffs case,thereby improperly granting the defendants motion for summary judgment.specifically,plaintiffs contend that burlington northern broadened the scope of actions that could be considered adverse employment actions,which necessarily alters the second prong of the mcdonnell douglas test.
in burlington northern,the court dealt with the scope of conduct considered forbidden by title vii provision.specifically,the court compared the provisions found in section a of title vii,a,with the provision found in section a of title vii,a.
the court rejected the argument of the solicitor general that the two provisions should be read in pari materia,thereby limiting the conduct sufficient to sustain an claim to the conduct sufficient to meet the standard defined in the provision.the court determined that the differences in language between the two provisions were intentional and that these distinctions effectuate important differing objectives carried out by the two individual provisions.burlington northern.at.the court stated this purpose reinforces what language already indicates,namely that the provision is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment.id.at.after finding that the two provisions are not coterminous,the court stated that the scope of the provision extends beyond or retaliatory acts and harm and is thereby not limited to ultimate employment decisions.id.at.
significantly,the court endeavored to define the contours of this expansion by qualifying what type of retaliatory action rises to the level of being unlawful.in order to be unlawful,the retaliation must produce an injury or harm,the court stated.id.adopting the tests used by the seventh and district of columbia circuits,the court stated that a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.id.at quoting rochon gonzales.
the court focused on the term materially adverse in order to separate trivial harms from actionable injuries because title vii does not establish a general civility code for the american workplace.oncale sundowner offshore,d.furthermore,the court adopted a reasonable employee standard because a n objective standard is judicially administrable.it avoids the uncertainties and unfair discrepancies that can plague a judicial effort to determine a plaintiff unusual subjective feelings.burlington northern.at.
finally,the court touched on an important component of this formulation context matters.id.to explain the importance of context,the court quoted from oncale,explaining that t he real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances,expectations,and relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed.oncale,at.
burlington northern necessarily impacts the instant case by altering the second prong of the prima facie case requirement.we discussed the impact of burlington northern in pvnf,cir,where we noted that the second prong of the prima facie case requirement is replaced with the requirement that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially is,that the action might dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination at quoting burlington northern.at.no longer must a plaintiff prove that subsequent adverse employment action was taken against her,as that phrase has been construed in title vii discrimination cases.rather the plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the action materially adverse such that they might be dissuaded from making a charge of discrimination.even more recently,we again discussed the thorny issue of the impact of burlington northern on employment retaliation claim analysis in williams sports,cir.consistent with our analysis of burlington northern here,and that in pvnf,we stated in williams that 
before burlington northern white,some circuits held that a claim for retaliation lies only when the employer effects an adverse action within the workplace.that is,the employee needed not only to suffer a materially adverse action,but the consequence of that action had to come in the employment context itself,in the form of a termination,demotion,or the like.by contrast,other circuits allowed claims to proceed when the employer adverse action had consequences befalling the plaintiff outside the employment environment.seeking to resolve this circuit split,the court in burlington northern white sided with the latter school of thought,recognizing that a n employer can effectively retaliate against an employee for exercising his or her protected rights by taking actions not directly related to his or her employment or by causing him or her harm outside the workplace.
at internal citations omitted.also,in williams sports,we noted the direction from the supreme court in burlington northern that the test for determining whether an action would have been considered material by an employee is an objective test,asking how a reasonable employee would have interpreted or responded to the action.id.at 
engagement in protected activity 
appellants clearly engaged in various acts of protected activity by voicing their concerns and complaints to their supervisors and superiors within the university of denver.as the magistrate judge correctly noted,informal complaints to superiors constitute protected activity.see hertz luzenac america,cir.one example of the appellants protected activity can be found in their may,meeting with dean kvistad and susan lee,director of the office of diversity equal opportunity.at this meeting,the appellants made clear their concerns about the environment of the workplace and their perceived disparate treatment by others in that workplace.this,along with other various instances of informal complaints to supervisors,satisfies prong one,the protected activity requirement.hertz,at informal complaints about perceived unlawful discrimination constitute protected activity.
objective standard of materially adverse action 
appellants primary argument comes into play regarding the second prong.the second element,altered by burlington northern,requires that the subsequent or contemporaneous actions taken against the individuals who engaged in the protected activity would be considered by a reasonable employee to be material and adverse,thereby dissuading them from making a complaint about discrimination.
it is clear from the record that these appellants were not dissuaded by the alleged material and adverse retaliatory conduct by the defendants.they did not cease attempting to remedy what they perceived to be acts of discrimination.thus,the alleged retaliation attempted has apparently been unsuccessful.
the supreme court made clear that the test for the second prong of a retaliation claim is an objective one.burlington northern.at.the court stated 
in our view,a plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse,which in this context means it might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.we speak of material adversity because we believe it is important to separate significant from trivial harms.title vii,we have said,does not set forth a general civility code for the american workplace.
burlington northern.at emphasis in original and internal citations and quotation marks omitted.this reading is confirmed by our precedent in williams sports,where we rejected the argument that a plaintiff alleging a retaliation claim must show some tangible,subjective psychological or monetary injury.such a requirement would make no sense of burlington northern white emphasis on the need for an objective test at.we again reiterated that the focus of the question is on whether a reasonable employee would have found the defendant conduct sufficiently adverse that he or she well might have been dissuaded by such conduct from making or supporting a charge of discrimination id.
moreover,the fact that an employee continues to be undeterred in his or her pursuit of a remedy,as here was the case,may shed light as to whether the actions are sufficiently material and adverse to be actionable.we now apply these principles as spelled out in burlington northern to the instant case 
incivility in the department meeting 
appellants indicate that they were both offended by comments and actions of various individuals at a department meeting in late february.appellants claim that they were subjected to extreme public humiliation.aplt.br.at.this meeting concerned hiring decisions within the department.appellant described the humiliation in her deposition as individuals rolling their eyes and laughing at her opinion on the proper standards for making decisions.appellant somoza testified similarly,indicating that he was laughed at,snickered at,and individuals made comments to one another while he spoke at the meeting.appellants also contend that they endured continued hostility by other individuals.
conduct such as this,if pervasive enough,may in fact rise to the level of a materially adverse action.medina income support,new mexico,cir citing gunnell utah valley state college,cir.however,our precedent tempers this by holding that unruly behavior during a meeting and derogatory are unlikely to deter a reasonable employee from making a charge of discrimination.mickelson new york life ins,cir citing burlington northern.moreover,the supreme court cited the eeoc manual in burlington northern when it reasoned that a lack of good manners will not create such deterrence necessary to constitute material adverse action capable of dissuading a reasonable employee from making a complaint about discrimination.burlington northern.at citing eeoc manual,internal quotation marks omitted 
therefore,without more,appellants have not thereby met the standard of the second prong to this point.
ii.authority 
appellants also indicate that they have been stripped of various powers within the department.they claim that their initial recommendation regarding the suspension of the search committee suggestion,which ultimately led to the hiring of susan walter,was reversed.the search began in and the committee evaluating the qualifications of the candidates consisted of appellant somoza,professor,and chair beaudoin.in appellants brief,they claim that chair beaudoin allowed another junior professor,javier torre,to be disrespectful towards them.also,appellants claim that roughly days after they expressed their position on the lack of qualifications of applicants,a lecturer position was taken away and their recommendation was reversed by a department vote.
the initial search committee,which recommended suspension of the search,included one of the appellants,professor somoza.the decision,at the departmental meeting which both appellants attended,was overturned by a majority vote,and the vote reversed the recommendation of the search committee,not that of the appellants individually or together.thus,since the department vote reversed the decision of the committee,and not that of the appellants,this particular action is insufficient to meet the standard of burlington northern because the appellants were not specifically and individually entire search committee decision was reversed.there are no facts produced that indicate appellants were targeted specifically.moreover,the subjective injuries,like a bruised ego,allegedly sustained by appellant somoza do not rise to the level of dissuading a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.see also mitchell vanderbilt,cir professor bruised ego due to revocation of his mentor status is not an adverse action 
after the departmental vote,the search committee reconvened,including the same members of the committee,and was instructed to either vote for one of the two candidates or vote for neither.ultimately,the reconvened search committee voted unanimously to hire susan walter.again,this unanimous vote was an action taken by the search committee as a whole rather than a decision made by the appellants individually.further,professor somoza sat on both search committees and exercised a vote which both times corresponded to the ultimate decision of the committee.it is difficult to see how appellants were singled out or targeted in these instances appellants have produced no evidence indicating that they were individually targeted in some fashion on these committees,nor have they explained how serving on both committees and exercising a vote represents a diminution of their powers.
appellants take issue with the search process initiated in.they claim that chair beaudoin convened no search committee,thereby denying them a right to participate in the selection of a spanish lecturer.however,appellant somoza testified that t here was a meeting at some point,and we were asked if we would accept wendy for the position.i said yes.professor testified that there was no committee but that she was asked if she would accept mendez for the position she also said that the hiring decision was one of consensus and that a meeting took place.regardless of whether the presence or absence of a formal or informal search committee violates departmental procedure or,any action did not target appellants specifically as affected them as members of the spanish section.furthermore,the appellants testified that their opinions were considered.thus,appellants have failed to provide facts that satisfy the second prong of the prima facie test relating to their treatment while on the search committees.
appellants also allege that dean kvistad removed a lecturer position from the spanish section on february.this claim,appellants argue,impacts both their workload and their power.while touching on workload,this claim is not waived by the appellants because their argument centers on whether they might have been deterred due to the fear of an increased workload.primarily,this claim involves the hiring of wendy mendez into the temporary lecturer position formerly held by susan walters.specifically,the appellants contend that the funding for the position,previously occupied by wendy mendez,was eliminated by dean kvistad.the record indicates that at various times there was some confusion as to the character of mendez position.indeed,it seems as though she was hired at three different times.however,the basis of appellants claim is the elimination of funding.
as depositions from both somoza and make clear,mendez was shuffled through various temporary and positions well after the alleged removal date of february.there are two issues whether appellants have shown that the funding was lost and whether the funding lost was for a temporary or position.this is because,as the record shows,temporary position funding is lost by attrition whereas position funding is lost by a departmental decision.if the funding lost was due to mendez being hired into a new position,rather than a departmental decision,then appellants claim fails.furthermore,even if the funding lost stemmed from a position,appellants would have to show that they were targeted specifically by this action.on its face,a departmental decision to remove a lecturer position would affect the entire spanish section as a whole,not just the appellants.thus,appellants would have to show that this conduct sought them out individually.
from various statements made by and by chair beaudoin,the record bears out that the position in question was temporary and may not have been lost at all.appellants provide no clear evidence indicating that the position was lost in february of nor do they show that it was.thus,since the position allegedly lost was a temporary one it therefore occurred due to attrition and consequently,appellants claim fails.
finally,with regard to allegations of intentionally diminishing appellants authority,appellants argue that professor was precluded from selecting the basic language coordinator for the spanish section.zulema lópez was selected as the temporary coordinator when susan walter was on parental leave.appellants contend that practice in the department mandates that the section coordinator,a position held by appellant at this time,be consulted in making these decisions.it is clear from the record that professor did not have the determinative opinion on who should fill the basic language coordinator position.in her testimony,she stated that it was correct that her voice would have been one of several in the department taken into consideration.furthermore,in an referencing the decision concerning a language coordinator,appellant put forward three possible solutions for assigning the duties of the coordinator.one of these possibilities was zulema lópez,and professor said in the same that she was not advocating any particular person but was most interested in maintaining a quality program.thus,it would seem did in fact offer her opinion in accordance with departmental practice.however,the fact that her suggestion was not ultimately followed does not establish that she suffered a diminution of her powers that might well dissuade a reasonable faculty member from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.
iii.work environment 
appellants argue that professor javier torre,an untenured junior colleague,harassed them in retaliation for their protected activities.appellants cite an affidavit provided by another colleague,professor ralph difranco.professor difranco states that professor torre displayed an air of superiority,associated with faculty other than appellants,wrote critical,was rude and failed to interact collegially at meetings or even greet them in the department.also,appellants provide confirmatory accounts of professor torre unprofessional behavior in an affidavit from wendy mendez.she referred to professor torre behavior as disrespectful,defensive and disregarding and said that he was uncooperative at spanish section meetings and in other situations.
appellants may have had to withstand colleagues that do not like them,are rude,and may be generally disagreeable people.however,this court obligation is not to mandate that certain individuals work on their interpersonal skills and cease engagin
