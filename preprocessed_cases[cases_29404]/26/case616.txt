background 
the hamilton southeastern school corporation serves students in a number of schools in central indiana,including two senior high schools.hssc has an established application process for hiring new teachers.an applicant must submit an application,resume,references,and transcripts.the school district central office screens the applications,verifies references,and ensures that a criminal background and sexual offender check have been completed.hssc officials review the applications and select a pool of potential candidates,who then interview with the principal of the school that has the vacancy.from the pool of candidates,the principal recommends a candidate to hssc assistant superintendent.the assistant superintendent then conducts a final interview,in which he evaluates the prospective teacher methodology and judgment.if the assistant superintendent is comfortable with the applicant,he makes a hiring recommendation to the school board,which makes the final hiring decision.
in addition to its hiring policies and procedures,hssc has general policies prohibiting discrimination and sexual harassment,and it provides regular sexual harassment training to all of its teachers.hssc also maintains guidelines on proper behavior between teachers and students,which are recorded in a handbook available to both teachers and students.
dmitri alano graduated with a bachelor degree in music education from butler university in.after graduating,alano served as the director of instrumental music and the band director at waldron high school from to.in,hssc hired alano as a teacher and assistant band director at hse.
while a student at butler and after graduating,alano participated in a music ensemble that performed around the state.during a visit to hse,alano met michael niemiec,the school band director.in,after the ensemble lost its trombone player,niemiec auditioned and joined the group.alano and niemiec became better acquainted,and in the summer of,alano volunteered to assist niemiec with the hse marching band.alano assisted niemiec in this capacity during the next four summers.
in,due to the school growth,hse sought to employ an assistant band director.niemiec encouraged alano to apply for the position.alano applied according to hssc normal application procedure.he submitted the required application materials,including his resume,transcripts,references,and recommendations.among his materials,alano submitted a positive recommendation from the principal at waldron high school,his previous supervisor.the principal strongly recommended alano and expressed no reservation about his ability to perform the job.alano also submitted a completed questionnaire that asked whether he had ever been investigated for,charged with,or resigned because of any misconduct,including sexual abuse or misconduct.alano replied no to all questions and signed the form.
hssc confirmed that alano had a valid indiana teacher license,which meant that he had passed a criminal background check.the school district also confirmed that alano was not on the sex offender registry.
alano interviewed with the principal at hse,glen nelson.nelson checked alano references by calling an assistant principal at waldron,and he spoke with niemiec about alano.following the interview,nelson recommended to the assistant superintendent,richard hogue,that hssc hire alano.hogue contacted nelson about alano and the particular needs for the open position.due to the importance of the position,hogue also called niemiec personally.niemiec again expressed no reservations about alano,having known him for some time both professionally and socially.hogue had worked with niemiec since hiring him in,and niemiec opinion was important to his decision.last,hogue personally interviewed alano.following the interview,hogue agreed to recommend alano for employment and sent the recommendation to the school board for final approval.the school district hired alano,effective july.from to,alano served as the assistant band director and taught classes at hse without incident.
during the school year,alano began a sexual relationship with,a student enrolled in band and one of his classes.was born in,and she attended hse from to.during her freshman and sophomore years,and alano engaged in sexual banter,which progressed to sexual contact on multiple occasions.the sexual encounters occurred in the school band room,music practice rooms,or band offices.according to,alano provided her passing grades in exchange for the relationship.did not disclose the relationship to anyone at or around the time it occurred,and she admittedly concealed the relationship from school officials,teachers,her parents,and her boyfriend.in,at the end of her sophomore year,quit band and had no further sexual contact with alano.
nearly two years later,in january,the hansens hospitalized for substance abuse treatment.on january,admitted to a therapist that she engaged in a sexual relationship with a teacher.this was the first time she revealed the relationship to anyone.the hospital informed her parents,and local police began a criminal investigation.police notified hssc officials of the allegations,which was the first time the school learned of alano misconduct.the school district promptly suspended alano,and he ultimately resigned from the school after pleading guilty to sexual battery.
during the investigation of alano misconduct toward,investigators learned that he had engaged in two prior relationships with former students.the first was with julie harker,who is now alano wife.harker had been alano student at waldron high school,but the two began their romantic relationship after harker graduated.both alano and harker denied that anything inappropriate occurred while she was his student,and the hansens have produced no evidence to the contrary.the hansens noted that niemiec knew that alano married a former student because he was acquainted with alano and attended their wedding.they also asserted that it was common knowledge around hse that alano married a former student.
alano second relationship with a former student was with alicia rhoades,which began while she was a student at waldron high school.the two engaged in a physical relationship while rhoades was a student,which led to sexual intercourse after she graduated.no one at hse or waldron knew about this relationship until investigators learned of it after alano arrest in.
the hansens brought two federal claims,under title ix and,and five claims under indiana state law,naming both alano and hssc as defendants in each.both defendants filed motions for summary judgment.on october,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of hssc on all seven counts.the district court granted summary judgment in alano favor on the title ix count and the state law claim for negligent hiring,retention,and supervision.the remaining five claims against alano remain pending in the district court,including the federal claim under.on december,the district court granted the hansens motion for issuance of final order under federal rule of civil procedure b,allowing the present appeal.the district court stayed the proceedings against alano,pending the outcome of this appeal.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court decision to grant summary judgment in favor of hssc de novo,and we draw all reasonable inferences in the party favor.see lucas pyramax bank,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.c.to survive a motion for summary judgment,the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.keri bd.of trs.of purdue,cir.
the hansens argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against them on their title ix claim against the school district.after dismissing their title ix claim,the district court exercised jurisdiction over their state law claims and granted summary judgment against the hansens on those claims as well.the hansens argue that the district court erred by exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims.if jurisdiction was proper,the hansens assert that the court erred by granting summary judgment against them.we address each issue below.
title ix prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs or activities that are supported by federal financial assistance.a.congress authorized an administrative enforcement scheme for title ix,but the supreme court has recognized an implied private right of action for the victim of illegal discrimination to enforce the statute,cannon of,d,as well as the ability to recover monetary damages,franklin gwinnett county pub,d.
in enacting title ix,congress sought to hold educational institutions liable for their own misconduct,not for the misconduct of an employee.see,gebser lago vista indep.sch,d smith metro.sch.dist.perry,cir.that said,a teacher sexual harassment of a student may render a school district liable for sex discrimination under title ix.franklin,at.see also metro.sch.dist.perry,at.the hansens argue that the district court should have applied a knew or should have known standard to their title ix claim,meaning that if hse or hssc knew or should have known of alano improper conduct and failed to respond appropriately,the school district may be liable for sex discrimination.
the standard the hansens assert is incorrect.the supreme court has flatly rejected applying a knew or should have known standard to title ix claims.gebser,at.when a title ix claim for damages against the educational institution is based on a teacher conduct,the plaintiff must prove that an official of the school district who at a minimum has authority to institute corrective measures has actual notice of,and is deliberately indifferent to,the teacher misconduct.id.emphasis added see also delgado stegall,cir.
in gebser,the supreme court considered the limits of a school district liability under title ix,thoroughly analyzed the statute history and purpose,and expressly refused to impose liability on a school district unless it had actual knowledge of a teacher sexual harassment and acted with deliberate indifference to the misconduct.at.the court rejected the use of both vicarious liability and constructive notice principles in title ix cases.id.at.the court reasoned that a school district liability under title ix arose from an official decision by the recipient not to remedy the violation,id.at,that is,where the school district own actions effectively cause d the discrimination,id.at.
as such,a school district is subject to a private damages action only where it is deliberately indifferent to known acts of discrimination or harassment.id.at.see also davis ex rel.lashonda monroe county bd.of,d discussing gebser and stating that a school district could be liable under title ix by remaining deliberately indifferent to acts of harassment of which it had actual knowledge gabrielle park.heights.sch.dist,cir.
the hansens cited our decision in delgado to support their position that something less than actual knowledge of a teacher misconduct will suffice as a predicate to title ix liability.their reliance on our opinion in that case is misplaced.in delgado,we specifically stated that,under gebser,a plaintiff in a title ix damages suit based on a teacher behavior must prove both actual knowledge of misconduct,not just actual knowledge of the risk of misconduct,and that the officials having that knowledge decided not to act on it.at.we noted that a school district need not possess actual knowledge of a teacher acts directed at a particular plaintiff,but it must still have actual knowledge of misconduct that would create risks so great that they are almost certain to materialize if nothing is done.id.thus,if a teacher had been known to be a serial harasser,a school district might be found to have actual knowledge of that teacher misconduct and that students may be at great risk.id.
therefore,in order to survive summary judgment,the hansens must establish a genuine issue of fact as to whether an appropriate official at hssc or hse had actual knowledge of misconduct by alano that created a serious risk to its students,and responded with deliberate indifference to the misconduct.they fail to do so.
the hansens have presented no evidence from which a reasonable juror could infer that an official at hssc or hse who had authority to institute corrective measures had actual knowledge of alano misconduct against or any other former student.admitted that she concealed the relationship from school officials,her parents,and her boyfriend.the first time she told anyone of the relationship was to her therapist in january,and the hansens presented no evidence that anyone at the school knew of the misconduct until that time.upon learning of the allegations,the school district promptly suspended alano.
the hansens also argued that hssc knew of alano relationships with former students rhoades and harker,and that alano therefore presented a serious risk of harm to other students.the record,however,reveals nothing to indicate that hssc knew of alano relationship with rhoades until after disclosed her relationship with alano in,a fact the parties do not dispute.and while niemiec and other faculty at hse may have known that harker was alano former student before marrying him,nothing in the record suggests that the two engaged in a sexual or otherwise improper relationship while she was his student.simply knowing that a teacher married a woman formerly his student,without actual knowledge of misconduct,does not suffice to hold a school district liable under title ix.the hansens even state in their brief that w hile hse may not have had actual knowledge of the relationships,the information that it did have should have been enough to elicit some concern over their students and therefore sufficient for a title ix claim.petr.br.
it is not enough.the hansens produced no evidence from which a reasonable juror could infer that the school district had actual knowledge of any misconduct by alano.accordingly,hssc is entitled to summary judgment on the title ix claim.
supplemental jurisdiction 
after the district court granted summary judgment against the hansens on their title ix claim,it addressed their state claims on the merits and granted summary judgment against them.even though the hansens chose to bring this suit in federal court,they assert that the court should have declined to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state claims.thus,before we reach the substance of the hansens state law claims against hssc,we first consider whether the district court erred in retaining jurisdiction over them.we review a district court decision to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under for an abuse of discretion.groce eli lilly,cir.
a district court has original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.a district court also has supplemental jurisdiction over any claim that is so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy.a.congress enacted to codify principles of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction,city of chi.int l coll.of surgeons,d,whereby federal courts may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state claim if the state and federal claims derive from a common nucleus of operative fact,united mine workers gibbs,d.
as an initial matter,the district court properly exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the hansens state claims under a at the outset of this litigation.the district court original jurisdiction derived from the hansens federal claims against alano and hssc under title ix and.neither party disputes that the federal and state claims against both defendants form part of the same case or controversy.all claims arose out of the same facts alano sexual misconduct against a student.
the question the hansens raise is whether the district court should have declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims,pursuant to c,after it granted summary judgment in hssc favor on the title ix claim.according to c,a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim if 
the claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law,
the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction,
the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction,or 
in exceptional circumstances,there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.
c.the hansens have argued only that the court should have relinquished jurisdiction pursuant to c.
when all federal claims have been dismissed prior to trial,the principle of comity encourages federal courts to relinquish supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to c.see groce,at wright associated ins,cir.but while a district court may relinquish its supplemental jurisdiction if one of the conditions of c is satisfied,it is not required to do so.see williams elecs.games,garrity,cir discussing whether a district court erred by relinquishing supplemental jurisdiction after dismissing all federal claims.supplemental jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion,and its justification lies in considerations of judicial economy,convenience and fairness to litigants.gibbs,at.
the hansens argument that the district court erred by reaching the merits of their state claims fails for two reasons the district court still had original jurisdiction over pending federal claims against hssc,alano,and even if no federal claims remained against either defendant,the district court did not abuse its discretion by exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the hansens state claims.
first,contrary to the hansens argument,the district court had not dismissed all federal claims over which it had original jurisdiction.the district court original jurisdiction derived from claims against both alano and hssc under and title ix.after granting summary judgment on the title ix claim,the district court retained original jurisdiction over the claims against alano,including the claim under,and the court stayed those proceedings pending the results of this appeal.
therefore,the district court discretion to relinquish jurisdiction under c was never triggered,because the court did not dismiss all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.see c.indeed,even if the hansens had not brought a single federal claim against the school district,the district court would have had supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims against hssc because they constituted the same case or controversy as the federal claim against codefendant alano.see a.thus,the district court did not err by exercising jurisdiction over the hansens state claims against hssc after granting summary judgment on the title ix claim.
second,even if the district court could have relinquished the hansens state law claims against hssc under c,it did not abuse its discretion by retaining jurisdiction.while a district court may relinquish its supplemental jurisdiction if one of the conditions of c is satisfied,it is not required to do so.see garrity,at groce,at noting that our case law makes clear that a district court does not automatically lose supplemental subject matter jurisdiction once it grants summary judgment on the federal claim.the district court has broad discretion in deciding whether to retain supplemental claims.van harken city of,cir.
a district court deciding whether to retain jurisdiction pursuant to the factors set forth in c should consider and weigh in each case,and at every stage of the litigation,the values of judicial economy,convenience,fairness,and comity.int l coll.of surgeons,at.quotations omitted see also timm mead,cir.that the jurisdictional hook is eliminated before trial at best only preliminarily informs the balance the nature of the state law claims at issue,their ease of resolution,and the actual,and avoidable,expenditure of judicial resources can and should make the difference in a particular case.timm,at.so long as an arguable balance of these factors favors the district court determination to exercise jurisdiction,that decision should not be disturbed.id.
a balance of the factors listed above favors the district court decision to exercise jurisdiction over the hansens state claims against hssc.the district court and the parties in this case have already expended substantial judicial began in may,and the parties have completed discovery.wright,at noting that judicial economy is rarely a good reason to retain jurisdiction when a case is dismissed on the pleadings,before discovery even begins.the state claims against hssc are based on alano misconduct,and to litigate alano liability in federal court and the school district liability in state court would duplicate effort,time,and expense.the claims are intertwined and judicial economy is served by treating them in one forum.furthermore,the correct disposition of the state claims against hssc is clear and does not entangle the federal courts in difficult issues of state law.see khan state oil,cir noting that if the correct disposition of the supplemental claims is clear,considerations of economy favor retaining jurisdiction,vacated on other grounds,d see also van harken,at.therefore,even if c applied,the district court did not abuse its discretion by retaining jurisdiction of the state claims.
summary judgment on the state claims 
having determined that the district court properly exercised jurisdiction,we consider whether the district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the school district on the hansens state claims.the claims can be separated into two categories claims directly against hssc for its own negligence in hiring,supervising,or retaining alano,and assorted tort claims for which hssc would be vicariously liable for alano wrongful conduct under the doctrine of respondeat superior.as stated above,we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo and consider all inferences in the light most favorable to the party.see lucas,at.the hansens must present evidence showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.keri,at.
negligent hiring,supervision,and retention 
the hansens allege that hssc acted negligently in hiring,supervising,and retaining alano.the district court granted summary judgment in hssc favor because it found there to be no evidence that the school district knew that alano had engaged in inappropriate conduct with or any of his prior students.the hansens assert that the district court erred by requiring them to demonstrate that hssc had actual knowledge of alano misconduct.they argue that they produced sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact under what they claim is the correct standard whether hssc should have known that alano had engaged in a habit of misconduct.
indiana recognizes a cause of action against an employer for negligent hiring,supervision,or retention of an employee.levinson citizens bank of evansville.indiana has adopted the restatement second of torts as the standard with regard to this tort,under which a court must determine if the employer exercised reasonable care in hiring,supervising,or retaining an employee.konkle henson.
indiana courts are somewhat unclear on the applicable standard for holding an employer liable for negligent hiring,retention,or supervision.some decisions state that to be liable an employer must have actual knowledge of an employee habit of misconduct and fail to respond reasonably.see,levinson,at in order to prevail on this theory,the plaintiff must show that the defendant employer negligently retained an employee who the defendant knew was in the habit of misconducting himself.emphasis added briggs finley,stating that an employer may be liable for negligent retention only if he knows the employee is in the habit of misconducting himself in a manner dangerous to others emphasis added.other decisions,however,state that an employer may be liable if it merely should have known or had reason to know of the misconduct.see,grzan charter hosp.of nw,holding that a defendant must have known or had reason to know of the misconduct and failed to take appropriate action konkle,at citing levinson,which states an actual knowledge standard,but then stating that t o prevail on her claim of negligent hiring,supervision,and retention,plaintiff must show that the church defendants knew or had reason to know of defendant misconduct and failed to take appropriate action emphasis added frye am.painting,noting that in an action for negligent retention of an employee,evidence of prior similar actions committed by an employee are often admissible to establish the employer actual or constructive knowledge of the employee propensity to commit a later act of violence emphasis added.
based on our review of the record in this case,the hansens presented no evidence that hssc either knew,should have known,or had reason to know that alano was in the habit of misconducting himself.levinson,at.thus,the hansens failed to satisfy even the lesser standard,and we need not anticipate how the indiana supreme court would resolve the question of whether actual knowledge of misconduct is required to hold an employer liable for negligent hiring,supervision,or retention.
the hansens base their negligent hiring claim on the fact that alano allegedly engaged in relationships with two former students prior to his employment at hse,one of whom had become alano wife by the time hssc hired him.they further assert that,while the school district may not have acquired knowledge about the prior relationships directly,it should have inquired whether alano ever had a sexual or physical relationship with a student,and it chose to ignore red flags.however,the hansens produced no evidence that hssc failed to exercise reasonable care in hiring alano or that it knew or should have known of any negative employment information when it hired alano.
as detailed above,and taking the facts in the light most favorable to the hansens,hssc followed its established hiring procedure when it hired alano.this required him to submit an application and related materials,provide references,and undergo a series of interviews with school officials.along with the application,alano completed a questionnaire stating that he had never been investigated,charged with,or resigned because of any misconduct,including sexual abuse or contact.he received positive recommendations from the principal and an assistant principal at his previous school,and from michael niemiec,hse band director.the school ensured that alano possessed a valid teaching license,which the state issues only after completing a criminal background check,and also confirmed that alano name was not on a list of known sex offenders.hse principal,glen nelson,recommended alano for employment after interviewing him,checking his references,and discussing his application with niemiec.the assistant superintendent,hogue,also interviewed alano,contacted niemiec,and agreed to recommend alano for employment.
during this process,hssc received no information that alano had a history of improper conduct with his students.rather,the hansens acknowledge that hssc may not have had actual knowledge of the relationships with rhoades and harker,but they assert that it should have inquired about past sexual relationships.as noted above,no one at hse or waldron knew about alano improper conduct with alicia rhoades,his former student at waldron,nor do the hansens point to anything indicating that either school should have known.the hansens presented no evidence that alano relationship with harker was improper while they were in a relationship.the hansens seek to impute knowledge to hssc because niemiec knew that alano married a former student.but even if hssc knew or should have known that harker was alano former student,the hansens fail to demonstrate that this knowledge alone would put the school district on notice that alano relationship with harker was improper,that he was in a habit of misconducting himself,or that he otherwise represented a threat to his students.
the hansens also argue that hssc should have asked alano directly whether he ever had a sexual or physical relationship with a former student,citing interim healthcare of fort wayne,moyer ex rel.moyer.in moyer,the plaintiffs alleged that a health care agency negligently hired a home health aide,who later injured a child patient.id.at.because there was no evidence that the employer actually contacted any of the aide previous employers,the court found an issue of fact for the jury that precluded the defendant motion for summary judgment.id.at.a concurring opinion added that to survive summary judgment,the plaintiffs also must demonstrate proximate cause,that had the employer contacted the aide former employers,it would have discovered negative employment information.id.at baker,concurring.
unlike the plaintiffs in moyer,the hansens have presented no evidence that hssc acted unreasonably in contacting alano references or former employers,nor have they presented evidence that any additional references would have revealed negative employment information had hssc contacted them.quite the opposite,all of the references that alano provided spoke highly of him.the hansens suggest that had the school officials asked alano directly,he would have divulged his previous relationships,and alano himself stated this to be true.hssc,however,required alano to complete a questionnaire that asked whether he had ever been investigated,charged with,or resigned because of any misconduct,including sexual abuse or contact.he responded that he had not,and he signed the statement.the failure to ask the specific question of whether he engaged in any prior relationships with a student was not unreasonable,particularly in light of the school district thorough hiring procedures and the information available.
in sum,nothing in the record creates an inference that hssc knew or should have known of any negative employment information regarding alano at the time it hired him.furthermore,given the school district hiring process,no evidence indicates that it acted unreasonably in hiring him.
the hansens claim that hssc negligently retained or supervised alano fails for similar reasons.the hansens rely on evidence of the same two prior relationships with former students,discussed above,to create an inference that alano had a habit of misconduct and represented a risk of harm to his current students.for the same reasons,these two relationships do not establish that hssc knew or should have known of any misconduct by alano.the hansens point to no additional evidence that suggests that school officials knew or should have known of misconduct during alano tenure at the school or that he presented a risk of harm to his students after he began his employment.nothing in the record demonstrates that hssc was aware of alano relationship with while she was a student,a fact to which both parties agree.nor is there any evidence that the school district acted unreasonably in supervising or retaining alano in light of any information it may have had.in fact,hssc promptly suspended alano upon learning of the allegations.thus,taking all inferences in the hansens favor,no genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether hssc negligently hired,retained,or supervised alano,and summary judgment in the school district favor was proper.
respondeat superior 
the hansens also attempted to hold the school district vicariously liable for alano tortious conduct under the doctrine of respondeat superior,alleging that the trial court erred in determining that alano acts wer
