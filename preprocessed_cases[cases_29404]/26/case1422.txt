in the instant case,the trial court denied the application for preliminary injunction solely on the ground the balance of hardships favored lausd.the trial court erroneously declined to consider the potential merit of the coalition claims,believing it was unnecessary to address that factor.therefore,the order is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
earlier proceedings.
by way of background,in october,lausd approved a mitigated negative declaration mnd for the subject project,a new school on a acre site in echo park,bounded by north alvarado on the east,santa ynez street on the south and mohawk street on the west 
the coalition successfully challenged the adoption of the mnd the trial court entered judgment directing the issuance of a writ of mandate requiring lausd to prepare an environmental impact report eir for the project.
in compliance with the judgment,lausd prepared an eir,which was certified by lausd board on june.
the instant action to invalidate the approval of the eir.
on july,the coalition filed a challenge under the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et to the certification of the eir.the coalition alleged,inter alia,the eir was merely a post hoc rationalization for a decision that already had been made,the eir failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives and failed to evaluate properly the project significant impacts on air quality,traffic,pedestrian safety,public services,land use,cultural and historic resources,population and housing,and its cumulative impacts.
on august,the coalition applied ex parte for a temporary restraining order tro and an order to show cause re preliminary injunction,seeking to prevent lausd from demolishing nearly two city blocks with units of residential housing in order to maintain the status quo pending a hearing on the preliminary injunction.
on august,the trial court granted a tro and scheduled a hearing for august,on the application for preliminary injunction.
in seeking a preliminary injunction,the coalition asserted it had a reasonable probability of success on the merits of its ceqa petition,arguing,inter alia,lausd had violated the requirement of a finite project description,the eir population and housing analyses were fatally flawed,as were the population and housing cumulative impacts analyses and the traffic and pedestrian safety analyses,and lausd had violated ceqa by committing itself to the project.in addition,the coalition claimed the balance of harm weighed in the coalition favor because denial of the preliminary injunction would lead to demolition of affordable housing units,resulting in irreparable harm.
on august,the matter came on for hearing.in opposing the issuance of a preliminary injunction,lausd argued,inter alia,t his is existing housing stock to begin with because these units have been unoccupied for over a year now.they are not housing,and,regardless of what the coalition may want,it is extremely unlikely they will ever be utilized as housing again regardless of the outcome of this case.
lausd also asserted any delay would result in increased construction costs of per week,based on a construction cost escalation factor of percent per year and a total construction cost of million.in addition,a delay would require lausd to incur additional costs of per week for property management and site security.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial court denied the coalition motion for issuance of a preliminary injunction,stating i just ca see the harm in this situation.in other words,the trial court ruled the balance of hardships favored lausd.despite the coalition arguments,the trial court refused to consider the likelihood of the coalition success on the merits of its ceqa petition,stating i do think it necessary.
the trial court stayed the demolition until september,to allow the coalition the opportunity to file an emergency writ.
proceedings in this court.
on september,the coalition filed a petition for writ of mandate,seeking to set aside the trial court order denying a preliminary injunction,as well as a stay of demolition activity.that same day,this court denied the petition without prejudice to filing an appeal and a petition for writ of supersedeas.
on september,the coalition filed notice of appeal from the august,order denying its motion for preliminary injunction.
on september,the coalition filed a petition for a writ of supersedeas,seeking to stay the august,order and reinstate the tro pending resolution of the appeal.that same day,this court issued a temporary stay.
on october,this court granted the petition for writ of supersedeas conditioned upon an accelerated schedule for filing the record and the briefs on appeal,and set oral argument on the appeal for january.
contentions 
the coalition contends the trial court erred in denying the motion for preliminary injunction without considering the likelihood the coalition will prevail on the merits of its case at trial the coalition made a strong showing of irreparable harm lausd harm arguments are illusory the coalition made a strong showing of probable success on the merits of its ceqa petition the project is also unlikely to succeed because of the city opposition to the site and no bond should be required as a condition of granting the preliminary injunction.
discussion 
general principles.
in exercising its discretion whether to issue a preliminary injunction,the trial court must consider two interrelated factors,specifically,the likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail on the merits at trial,and the comparative harm to be suffered by plaintiffs if the injunction does not issue against the harm to be suffered by defendants if it does.king meese,supra,cal d at,italics added accord butt state of california cal th,d.
the likelihood of plaintiffs ultimate success on the merits does affect the showing necessary to a analysis.that is,the more likely it is that plaintiffs will ultimately prevail,the less severe must be the harm that they allege will occur if the injunction does not issue.this is especially true when the requested injunction maintains,rather than alters,the status quo.citation.i t is the mix of these factors that guides the trial court in its exercise of discretion.king meese,supra,cal d at,italics added accord butt state of california,supra,cal th at,d.the presence or absence of these interrelated factors is usually a matter of degree,and if the party seeking the injunction can make a sufficiently strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits,the trial court has discretion to issue the injunction notwithstanding that party inability to show that the balance of harms tips in his favor.citation.common cause board of supervisors,supra,cal d at,italics added.
trial court erred in refusing to consider the likelihood of the coalition success on the merits.
