melanie stallings williams and demosthenes andrew halcoussis are professors at california state university,northridge csun and are members of the faculty bargaining unit.the california faculty association cfa is the exclusive representative of the faculty bargaining unit pursuant to the higher education employer employee relations act heera,et the public employment relations board perb is the agency charged with interpreting and administering heera.
appellants filed claims with perb alleging that their federal and state constitutional rights were violated when cfa denied them,and other represented employees,the right to vote on a proposed furlough program.appellants contend the superior court erred in denying their petition for a writ of mandamus because their constitutional rights were violated by cfa action and by perb refusal to issue an unfair labor practice ulp complaint for that action.in addition,appellants contend that perb improperly interpreted heera when it refused to issue a ulp complaint based on cfa action.we affirm.
factual and procedural synopsis 
factual background 
cfa and csu are parties to a collective bargaining agreement cba which governs the terms and conditions of employment for all employees included in the faculty bargaining unit.as was their right,appellants elected not to join cfa as union members instead,they paid an agency fee to cfa as a condition of employment.see chicago teachers union,local,aft,afl cio hudson.the agency fee amount is equal to the full amount of dues paid by union members,reduced by an amount representing the percentage of fees cfa spends on political activities.see abood detroit board of education.
in june,facing budget cuts,csu approached cfa to discuss implementing furloughs reduced hours for reduced pay for members of the faculty bargaining unit in order to avoid layoffs.following discussions with csu in person and on the phone,cfa sought feedback from all bargaining unit members regarding a tentative proposal that faculty employees take two unpaid furlough days per month.on its main website,cfa solicited input regarding the proposed furlough plan from all bargaining unit members.cfa explained that employees must be union members to vote on the proposal and advised employees that they could sign up to become union members.on its web page specific to csun employees,cfa invited all faculty to attend a meeting on june,to discuss furloughs and layoffs.cfa also notified faculty members that issue updates could be followed,and they could post messages about the proposed program,on.
from july to july,cfa conducted an internal vote on whether to agree to furloughs.only union members were permitted to vote such as appellants were not.on july,williams wrote to cfa asking to be allowed to vote despite not being a union member,referring to the union duty of fair representation and stating that p ermitting only union members to vote on matters relating to topics under the sole representation of the union constitutes unlawful discrimination.on july,cfa responded,denying her request and citing perb precedent,but inviting her to provide her views on the furlough issue and stating cfa would carefully consider any views she provided.following the membership vote,cfa and csu exchanged further proposals on the matter and reached an agreement on july.the furlough plan agreed on was slightly more favorable to employees than the furlough plan voted upon and approved by union members.
ii.procedural background 
in july,appellants filed with perb substantively identical ulp charges against cfa.the charges alleged cfa violated its duty of fair representation pursuant to section by not allowing appellants to vote on the furlough proposal based on the fact they were not union members and also violated members rights to freely associate under the federal constitution.on december,following her investigation,a perb agent sent warning letters to appellants advising them that their allegations did not state a prima facie case.the agent explained that perb had previously addressed the issue and held that unions might exclude from voting so long as the union provided nonmembers an opportunity to communicate their views and that perb did not have jurisdiction to enforce the constitution.the agent gave appellants an opportunity to amend or withdraw the charges.see of regs tit.on december,appellants advised the agent that they would not amend the charges.on december,the agent dismissed the charges.see ccr,subd.b.
on december,appellants appealed the dismissal of their charges to the board itself.see ccr.on june,perb issued board decision h and h,which adopted the warning and dismissal letters as the final decisions of the board and dismissed the charges without leave to amend.see ccr.
superior court 
on august,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,appellants filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate with the court.the court reviewed the petition as a traditional mandamus petition under code of civil procedure section.on april,the court denied the petition and adopted its page tentative decision.the court entered judgment against appellants,and appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
introduction 
a union has a duty to represent all employees in a bargaining unit fairly and impartially.it is a ulp for a union to fail to represent fairly and impartially all the employees in the unit for which it is the exclusive representative,subd.e.a breach of that duty occurs if the union conduct is arbitrary,discriminatory or in bad faith.
an employee who complains a union has breached its duty of fair representation may file a ulp charge with perb.perb processes the charge and has the exclusive authority to make the initial determination of whether a ulp complaint is justified.the charge is initially assigned to a perb agent.ccr,subd.a.the entity against whom the charge is filed is given an opportunity to submit a position statement.ccr,subd.c.if the agent determines that the charge fails to state a prima facie case the charging party is given an opportunity to amend or withdraw the charge.ccr,subd.d.if an amended charge does not cure the deficiencies identified in the warning letter or the charge is not amended,the charge is dismissed.ccr,subd.b.if the agent refuses to issue a complaint and dismisses the charge the agent decision may be challenged to perb five member board.ccr,subd.a.
standard of review 
section,subdivision b provides any charging party,respondent,or intervenor aggrieved by a final decision or order of the board in an unfair practice case,except a decision of the board not to issue a complaint in such a case,may petition for a writ of extraordinary relief from such decision or order.emphasis added.
in,the california supreme court carved out three narrow exceptions to the general rule that a perb decision not to issue a complaint was not subject to judicial review.w hen perb refuses to issue a complaint under the mmba,a superior court may exercise mandamus jurisdiction to determine whether perb decision violates a constitutional right,exceeds a specific grant of authority,or is based on an erroneous statutory construction.we stress,however,that it remains true that a refusal by perb to issue a complaint under the mmba is not subject to judicial review for ordinary error,including insufficiency of the evidence to support the agency factual findings and misapplication of the law to the facts,or for abuse of discretion.also,to avoid undue interference with the discretion that the legislature has intended perb to exercise,courts must narrowly construe and cautiously apply the exceptions we here recognize.international of fire fighters,local,afl cio public employment relations bd.cal th,fire fighters.
appellants invoke the first and third exceptions and ask this court to exercise its independent judgment to resolve the legal questions of whether cfa and perb violated appellants federal and state constitutional rights cfa and perb incorrectly construed their statutory duties and the court erred in reviewing the action as a p
