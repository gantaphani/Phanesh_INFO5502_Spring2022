christopher thompson plaintiff,a minor,was injured during an argument in school when he was punched by another student.the injury occurred the day after it appeared that the assailant had threatened to hit another student and was suspected of having set fire to a poster on a school bulletin board.
plaintiff and his parents appeal from the judgment entered in favor of the sacramento city unified school district defendant after the trial court granted defendant summary judgment motion in this personal injury action.appellants contend that they have demonstrated a triable issue of material fact regarding defendant liability for negligence due to its failure to suspend the assailant from school before plaintiff was injured and its failure to exercise reasonable care in supervising students in its charge.appellants also argue that the court erred in excluding declarations of their experts.we shall affirm the judgment.
as we will explain,defendant did not owe a duty to plaintiff to suspend the assailant on the day before he injured plaintiff and,in any event,on the facts of this case,a properly instructed jury could not find that defendant acted unreasonably in failing to do so before completing an investigation of the allegations.as to defendant alleged breach of its general duty to supervise students in its charge,appellants failed to present competent evidence to show the alleged negligence was the proximate cause of plaintiff injury.the expert witness declarations in this regard were properly excluded because they were speculative and conjectural.
plaintiff,a high school student,was injured on january,during the lunch period at defendant kennedy high school.
immediately before lunch,plaintiff and another student,demario,were in a physical education class.someone told demario that plaintiff was selling marijuana and was carrying a substantial amount of it.demario related this information to his friend,demarcus,during lunch.
demarcus and demario quickly formed a plan to rob plaintiff of the marijuana they believed he was carrying.they decided that demarcus would wait in the bathroom while demario lured plaintiff inside with the prospect of a marijuana sale.in accordance with the plan,demario approached plaintiff and whispered that he knew someone in the bathroom who wanted to buy some sacks meaning marijuana.plaintiff then followed demario to the bathroom 
inside the bathroom,demarcus told plaintiff to come out of your pockets,indicating he was being robbed.when plaintiff refused to hand over anything,a scuffle ensued.plaintiff broke free and left the bathroom.however,a few feet outside of the bathroom,he stopped and turned to confront demarcus a fight ensued,and demarcus hit plaintiff three or four times in the face,causing him to fall backwards and strike his head on the ground.plaintiff suffered significant injury for which he seeks compensation from defendant.
much of the evidence submitted on the summary judgment motion concerned demarcus.it appears that he had a number of suspensions in primary school and middle school,some of which were related to fighting.in,he was expelled from sam brannan middle school for an assault on a student and apparently on the campus monitor who broke up the fight.the expulsion order imposed a number of requirements that demarcus would have to meet before requesting readmission.demarcus attended a continuation school for the next year.in the spring of,a district hearing was held at which the hearing officer was satisfied that demarcus should be readmitted to public school.
demarcus was assigned to kennedy high school commencing in the fall of.he performed adequately during his first year and a half of attendance there.for the most part he maintained passing grades.he was voted most inspirational player on the freshman football team and was elevated to the varsity in his second year.during this period,demarcus was not involved in any fights or physical altercations.however,he had a few minor disciplinary actions,such as suspensions or detentions and saturday school sessions.these were for such things as failing to suit up for physical education,not writing sentences,being late to class,refusing to give up a walkman,and disrupting class.there was no evidence that he engaged in any threatening or violent behavior during that time.
on january,a female student attached a poster to an outdoor bulletin board,announcing her birthday.during the lunch period,someone deliberately set fire to the poster.the fire was quickly extinguished,and arson investigators were assigned to the case.on january,three students told mcclymonds that demarcus had started the fire.mcclymonds contacted the arson investigators to give them the names of the students.mcclymonds was advised that the arson investigators would pursue the matter and that he should defer to them so he would not muddy up their investigation 
near the end of the school day on january,demarcus got into an argument with another student,yvonne j.it appears that yvonne disputed demarcus comment that his former girlfriend was going to do his hair.when demarcus said he would hit his former girlfriend or beat her ass if she did not do his hair,yvonne replied he was helly messed up,and she may have threatened to hit him.demarcus then threatened to hit yvonne,but she retorted that she would get her dad if demarcus tried to hit her.continuing this scintillating colloquy,demarcus said f your dad.at that point,the teacher removed demarcus from the classroom and called the campus monitors.the students were taken to the office and were told that they would have to go to conflict management demarcus said he would refuse to do so,and was told that refusal would result in suspension for three days.he said he did not care.no formal action was taken before lunch period of the following day,when demarcus injured plaintiff.
in january,security at kennedy high school was provided by one campus police officer,seven campus monitors,and volunteers from a group called.security personnel and volunteers roam the campus with radios that can be used to call in problems.
the restroom,where the fight occurred,was in the overlapping patrol areas of campus monitors guzman and conrad.guzman patrolled past the restroom just before the fight started.he looked into the restroom and saw nothing amiss.after guzman walked down the hallway,he noticed students going toward the restroom.so he returned and found plaintiff on the ground.guzman estimated that only a minute and a half to two minutes had passed since he was at the restroom.
discussion 
in reviewing an order granting a summary judgment motion,we independently review the record to determine whether there are triable issues of material fact.saelzler advanced group cal th,d.we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff as the losing party.id.at,d.summary judgment will be upheld when,viewed in such a light,the evidentiary submissions conclusively negate a necessary element of plaintiff cause of action,or show that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact requiring the process of a trial,thus defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.guz bechtel national,cal th,d.
appellants suggest that demarcus should not have been readmitted to the district public schools after his expulsion from middle school.
upon expelling a student,the district governing board must recommend a plan of rehabilitation for the pupil,subd.b.an expelled student is entitled to apply for readmission after he or she has served an appropriate period of expulsion,subd.a.upon completion of the readmission process,the governing board shall readmit the pupil,unless the governing board makes a finding that the pupil has not met the conditions of the rehabilitation plan or continues to pose a danger to campus safety or to other pupils or employees of the school district,subd.c.
here,the record reflects that,after a year of expulsion,demarcus applied for readmittance and,at an administrative proceeding,he satisfied the district hearing officer that he should be readmitted to school.
the decision to readmit a student to school is a matter for which there is statutory immunity.pursuant to government code section,subdivision b,a public entity is not liable for the act or omission of an employee if the employee is immune from liability.and government code section provides except as otherwise provided by statute,a public employee is not liable for an injury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested in him,whether or not such discretion be abused.
a school district exercise of authority to expel readmit a pupil involves the type of decision that entails the resolution of policy considerations,entrusted by statute to a coordinate branch of government,that compels immunity from judicial reexamination.skinner vacaville unified school dist.th,d,quoting johnson state of california cal d,see also thompson county of alameda cal d,becerra county of santa cruz th,d.
thus,defendant can not be held liable to appellants on the basis of the district decision to readmit demarcus to public school in the fall of.
nevertheless,appellants contend there is a triable issue of material fact as to whether demarcus should have been suspended immediately when mcclymonds learned that demarcus may have been responsible for the poster fire and threatened to hit student yvonne j.according to appellants,a jury could conclude that,if demarcus had been suspended immediately on the afternoon of january,he would not have been on campus during lunch period the following day when he injured plaintiff.the contention fails.
education code section states that a student may not be suspended or recommended for expulsion unless the superintendent or principal of the school in which the student is enrolled finds that the student has committed one or more of certain specifically enumerated acts.as relevant here,the acts that may justify suspension or expulsion include causing,attempting to cause,or threatening to cause physical injury to another person,subd.a causing or attempting to cause damage to school property or private property,subd.f and disrupting school activities or otherwise willfully defying the valid authority of supervisors,teachers,administrators,school officials,or other school personnel engaged in the performance of their duties,subd.k.
education code section provides that suspension shall be imposed only when other means of correction fail to bring about the proper conduct.however,suspension may be imposed for a first offense for certain acts,including causing,attempting to cause,or threatening to cause physical injury.suspension also may be imposed for a first offense if the principal or superintendent determines that the student presence causes a danger to persons or property or threatens to disrupt the instructional process.
a suspension from school may be imposed for no more than five consecutive school days,subd.a.the decision to impose a suspension may be made by the principal of the school,the principal designee,or the superintendent of schools.ibid.normally,a suspension must be preceded by an informal conference conducted by the principal,the principal designee,or the superintendent of schools,between the student and,whenever practicable,the teacher,supervisor,or school employee who referred the student for discipline,subd.b.at the conference,the student must be informed of the reason for the disciplinary action and the evidence against the student,and must be accorded the opportunity to present his or her version of the incident and evidence in defense against the allegation.ibid.
a student may be suspended without an opportunity for a conference only if it is determined that an emergency situation exists,subd.c.an emergency situation means a situation determined by the principal,the principal designee,or the superintendent of schools to constitute a clear and present danger to the life,safety,or health of pupils or school personnel.ibid.in the event of an emergency suspension,the conference must be held within two school days unless it is waived or the student is physically unable to attend.ibid.
the clear and present danger standard is a test for determining when,despite constitutional requirements or limitations that otherwise would apply,the government can act to prevent a substantive evil from occurring.the test requires consideration of the extent to which the evil to be prevented is substantial or serious,the probability of its occurrence,and the extent to which it is imminent.to meet the clear and present danger test,the substantive evil must be extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high.danskin san diego unified sch.dist.cal d,see also bridges california,katzev county of los angeles cal d.but there is no talismanic formula for application of the clear and present danger test rather,it is by nature a balancing test requiring the exercise of significant judicial or discretion.sun of san bernardino superior court d.
statutory procedures with respect to suspension of school students were enacted to meet the constitutional requirements of due process.in goss lopez,d,the united states supreme court held that school students are entitled to due process of law in the decision to impose a short suspension.this requires that there be sufficient cause determined through fundamentally fair procedures.id.at.at,d at.for short suspensions,the procedure need not be formal however,at a minimum,it requires that the student be given oral or written notice of the charges,an explanation of the evidence against the student,and the opportunity to contest the charges.id.at.at,d at.obviously,due process of law demands that the administrator who imposes discipline must make a fair and unbiased attempt to determine what happened and if it justifies suspension.id.at.at,d at see perlman shasta joint.college dist.bd.of trustees d.appropriate procedures for suspension must precede the actual imposition of a suspension unless the student presence poses a continuing danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disrupting the academic process.goss lopez,supra,at.at,d at.
to briefly summarize the constitutional and statutory requirements for imposition of a suspension a suspension may be imposed only by a relatively high level administrator,the principal,the principal formal designee,or the superintendent of schools before imposing suspension,the administrator must be satisfied that he or she knows what happened and that the conduct warrants this respect,the administrator must bear in mind the legislature has expressed a preference that,if possible,misconduct be addressed by means other than suspension unless the administrator is satisfied that the situation constitutes a clear and present danger to life,health or safety,then the determination whether to suspend may not be made until the student is accorded a conference at which the student is informed of the charges and the evidence,and is given the opportunity to explain or contest the charges and in reaching a determination,the administrator must remain fair and unbiased.
in this light,only one reasonable conclusion can be drawn from the facts here defendant can not be held liable for the injury to plaintiff based on mcclymonds failure to immediately suspend demarcus after his argument with yvonne.we explain.
when a plaintiff seeks to impose liability upon a defendant for a particular act or omission,the plaintiff must establish that the act or omission breached a duty owed to the plaintiff.duty is a question of law for the court to determine on a basis.bryant glastetter th,d.duty is not a discoverable or immutable fact of nature it is the expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy that lead the court to say that the particular plaintiff was entitled to protection from the particular act or omission alleged.hernandez city of pomona th,d.the factors that may be considered include the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,the policy of preventing future harm,the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach,and the availability,cost,and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.rowland christian cal d.when a public agency is involved,additional factors include the extent of the agency powers,the role imposed on the agency by law,and the limitations imposed on it by budget.hernandez city of pomona,supra,th at,d.
in this case,several factors compel the conclusion that mcclymonds did not owe a duty to plaintiff to immediately suspend demarcus on the afternoon of january.
first,the conduct for which suspension allegedly should have been imposed was wholly unrelated to plaintiff.on january,demarcus and plaintiff bore no antagonism toward one another,and they do not appear to have even known each other.demarcus became a danger to plaintiff only during the lunch period on january,when he was told that plaintiff had a substantial amount of marijuana.while in appropriate circumstances a duty may arise when a person makes a specific threat of harm directed at a specific victim,courts otherwise generally decline to recognize a special duty.see thompson county of alameda,supra,cal d at.
second,the only basis upon which it can be claimed that the failure to immediately suspend demarcus caused plaintiff injury is that it enabled him to be on campus the following day.there was no other logical connection between demarcus prior conduct and plaintiff injury.this does not establish a close connection between vice principal mcclymonds failure to suspend demarcus and the injury,thus militating against a finding of duty.see bryant glastetter,supra,th at,d.
third,and most significant,is the matter of mcclymonds power with respect to suspension and the role imposed upon him by law.although he had the authority to suspend students,it was an authority that mcclymonds was required to exercise in accordance with substantive and procedural requirements imposed by the legislature and by the constitution.these included recognition of the legislative preference for lesser measures of discipline the requirement of a conference unless mcclymonds was satisfied the student presence created a clear and present danger the requirement that mcclymonds be satisfied he knew the facts and that the incident warranted suspension and the requirement that he proceed in a fair and unbiased manner,unaffected by extraneous considerations.
where,as here,the conduct raising an administrator suspension authority is wholly unrelated to the plaintiff,and the plaintiff only basis for asserting a causal connection is that the failure to impose an immediate suspension allowed the student to be on campus,the imposition of a special duty to suspend would undermine the role of an administrator in the suspension process.there would be an inevitable conflict between the administrator obligation to act in a fair and unbiased manner and the fear of potential liability should anyone be injured during the period for which an immediate suspension could be imposed.this conflict precludes the recognition of a special duty to suspend a student under such circumstances.
in any event,even assuming for purpose of argument that a claim of negligence can be premised on mcclymonds failure to immediately suspend demarcus on the afternoon of january,we are satisfied that a properly instructed jury could not find mcclymonds acted unreasonably in failing to do so.
although breach of duty generally is a question of fact,it may be determined as a question of law if reasonable jurors following the law could draw only one conclusion from the evidence.lindstrom hertz th,d osborn hertz d.
if a claim of negligence could be premised on mcclymonds failure to immediately suspend demarcus,a jury would have to be informed of the statutory and constitutional requisites that inhere in the suspension decision.in particular,the jury would have to be instructed that an immediate suspension can be imposed only if the facts satisfy the administrator that the student presence at school constitutes a clear and present danger.the jury also would have to be instructed that it may not the administrator action through the benefit of hindsight instead,it must defer to the administrator judgment and discretion unless he acted unreasonably under the circumstances that existed at the time he acted.see authorities cited in part b,ante.
setting fire to a birthday poster is a matter for which suspension could be imposed,subd.f.however,it is not a matter for which suspension can be imposed for a first offense unless it is determined that the student presence poses a danger to person or property or threatens to disrupt the educational process.the poster was burned on january,and the students who implicated demarcus waited two weeks,until january,to come forward.at that point the matter,including the students credibility,had not been investigated and demarcus had remained in school for two weeks without injurious consequences.these facts preclude a rational jury from finding that mcclymonds acted unreasonably in awaiting an investigation before deciding what,if any,disciplinary action should be imposed for the alleged arson.
the same must be said with respect to demarcus argument with yvonne near the end of the school day on january,when the two students got into a heated confrontation about whether demarcus former girlfriend was going to do his hair.yvonne called demarcus helly messed up and may have said she was going to hit him.in turn,demarcus threatened to hit her.yvonne responded by stating she would get her dad if demarcus tried to hit her whereupon demarcus said f your dad.in other words,nothing more than vague threats were exchanged,the argument was mutual,and it did not escalate into violence.in his deposition,mcclymonds testified that students have a habit of saying things like i gon na whip your butt and that,when threats are reported,he investigates to determine what happened and why,and what the next step should be.these facts preclude a rational jury from finding that mcclymonds acted unreasonably in waiting for an investigation and conference with demarcus before deciding upon the next step to take.
when demarcus was escorted to the office after his argument with yvonne,campus monitor saldana told him he would have to go to conflict management.when demarcus said he would refuse to do so,he was told that his refusal would result in an automatic suspension.appellants claim this exchange establishes that demarcus should have been immediately suspended for three days and that,had he been suspended,he would not have been on campus to injure plaintiff.the contention fails.
an immediate suspension can not be imposed except upon an individualized factual determination,made by the appropriate administrator,that the situation poses a clear and present danger to the life,safety,or health of pupils or school personnel,subd.c.a blanket rule of immediate suspension would be contrary to the school statutory authority and unlawful.and the record reflects only that demarcus refusal to take part in conflict management would result in an automatic suspension,not an immediate one.if,after investigation,mcclymonds determined that conflict management was the appropriate response to the argument,a refusal to attend would be grounds for suspension,subd.k.but it would be legally precipitous to impose an immediate on demarcus statement that he would not participate in conflict the matter was investigated and a determination is made,and before a conference was held at which he was given the actual choice of going to conflict management or accepting a suspension.
appellants argue that mcclymonds was negligent in failing to go through the suspension process before lunch period on the day following the argument.the record reflects that campus monitor saldana orally informed mcclymonds of the argument on the afternoon of january,and submitted a written report to his office the next morning.mcclymonds may have spoken with yvonne and her father on the morning of january however,there is no evidence that,before lunch period on ja
