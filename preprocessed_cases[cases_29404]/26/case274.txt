in this case concerning the individuals with disabilities in education act,appellant school district of philadelphia school district appeals a district court order requiring it to reimburse mary courtney courtney and her parents collectively,plaintiffs for the cost of courtney placement in a residential health care facility from october,to january.plaintiffs the district court denial of reimbursement for placement at the same facility from may,to october,and they seek compensatory education in the event that we deny their request for reimbursement.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm in part and reverse in part.
courtney and her parents live in the school district.courtney,who is now years old,suffers from learning disabilities,speech and language impairments,attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,and other mental health disorders.because of her educational needs,the school district paid for courtney to attend private schools beginning in when courtney entered kindergarten.
since,courtney evolving needs have required a variety of educational and medical placements.in the fall of,she was briefly hospitalized as a result of escalating behavioral problems including.then,after she was diagnosed during a evaluation with a variety of educational and emotional special needs,courtney parents unilaterally placed her at the rancho valmora school rancho valmora,a residential educational institution in new mexico that specializes in the treatment of adolescents with educational,emotional,and behavioral problems.courtney did well at the school,and she was discharged and returned to philadelphia in june.she was then placed at the pathway school aps for the academic year.courtney appeared to flourish,becoming valedictorian of her class at the end of the year.but by the beginning of the following school year,her emotional condition began to deteriorate and aps could no longer serve her needs.in december,courtney parents placed her back at rancho valmora.
courtney condition continued to worsen in.rancho valmora educational plan from february of that year notes psychotic events,severe anger problems,the abuse of chemical substances,and behaviors.at the end of april,rancho valmora informed courtney parents that it could no longer provide sufficient care for courtney because of her and aggressive behaviors.courtney parents then placed her for a short period at the menninger clinic,a psychiatric hospital in houston,texas.the clinic discharged courtney on may,because it was unable to serve her needs.the following day,courtney parents enrolled her in supervised lifestyles sls.
sls is a psychiatric residential treatment center in new york.it is licensed by the new york state office of mental health and is accredited with a national organization for the accreditation of rehabilitation facilities.it does not have any educational accreditation.it also has no school,special education teachers,or school affiliation.
for more than six months at sls,courtney was treated in the acute care wing.she received hour care provided on a,staff to patient ratio.courtney did not receive educational services during this period most of her days were spent in intensive individual and group psychotherapy.the school district sought to conduct a neuropsychological evaluation in june,but was unable to do so because courtney parents advised that she was not sufficiently stable at the time.also,according to the school district,courtney parents stated that her educational plan from rancho valmora could not be implemented at sls because of courtney emotional state.in fact,nearly every person to have evaluated courtney appears to agree that her safety and emotional were the predominate concerns for at least the first five months she was at sls.
on october,courtney parents informed the school district that she could be evaluated.an evaluation,which the school district arranged to be conducted on october,noted courtney limited academic capacity at the time and recommended focusing her instruction on adaptive and vocational skills.thereafter,on november,the school district assembled courtney educational team and developed an educational plan based on the evaluation.the plan provided for three hours per week of tutoring in language arts,reading,and math this instruction had a vocational and remedial focus as demonstrated,for instance,by courtney english instruction,which focused on vocabulary development and required her to give an oral presentation to improve her communication skills.
on december,courtney was transferred from the acute care ward at sls to the ward.courtney received treatment at sls from may,until her discharge on july.
the individuals with disabilities education act idea requires that a state receiving federal education funding provide a free appropriate public education fape to disabled children.a.school districts provide a fape by designing and administering a program of individualized instruction that is set forth in an individualized education plan iep.d.the iep must be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive meaningful educational benefits in light of the student intellectual potential.shore reg l high sch.bd.of ed,cir quoting polk cent.susquehanna intermediate unit,cir.
a parent who believes that a school has failed to provide a fape may request a hearing,commonly known as a due process hearing,to seek relief from the school district for its failure to provide a fape.in pennsylvania,the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer.carlisle area sch.scott,cir.if challenged,the hearing officer decision is then subject to an independent review of that decision by an appellate body,which is referred to as the appeals panel id.upon the completion of the pennsylvania administrative process,a party may appeal the appeals panel decision to federal district court.e carlisle area,at.
in november,plaintiffs requested a due process hearing pursuant to and sought to compel the school district to reimburse plaintiffs for the cost of courtney stay at rancho valmora,from december to april,and sls from may up to the date of the hearing provide compensatory education for the period may,up to the date of the hearing,in the event that tuition reimbursement was denied and pay for an independent evaluation of courtney.a hearing was conducted in january.the school district agreed to reimburse plaintiffs for courtney stay at rancho valmora,but opposed reimbursement for the sls placement on the ground that a medical crisis precipitated courtney stay there.
the hearing officer faulted the school district for failing to develop an iep in june and for not providing educational services beginning in may when courtney entered sls.he rejected arguments that courtney expenses at sls were medical as opposed to educational,concluding that her educational needs were not severable from her medical needs.the hearing officer also determined that sls was an appropriate placement.accordingly,he awarded tuition reimbursement for courtney stay at sls from may through january.
the appeals panel reversed the decision of the hearing officer.the panel noted the acute nature of courtney condition when she was admitted to sls and concluded that courtney admission to the new york facility was prompted by a psychiatric crisis,was necessary for medical reasons rather than educational purposes,and that the services provided to courtney during the first four months there were medical rather than educational in nature.in such circumstances,it deemed it inappropriate to award tuition reimbursement for courtney stay at sls.
courtney appealed this decision to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.in its analysis,the district court separated courtney treatment into two distinct time first period covered courtney stay in sls acute care ward from may,to october,and the second period covered from october,when courtney parents informed the school district that she could be evaluated,until january,the date through which the hearing officer awarded tuition reimbursement.
for the first period,the district court concluded that courtney was not entitled to tuition reimbursement because sls did not constitute special education within the meaning of the idea.it noted that courtney sls placement did not contain any appreciable academic component.further,to the degree that courtney program included some behavioral and emotional strategies that could aid her education,the court concluded that this treatment was aimed at stabilizing her medical condition and not at enabling academic instruction.
with regard to the second period,the district court awarded tuition reimbursement.it stated that,once the school district began providing educational services to courtney,it also had an obligation to provide related services.in that regard,the court determined that courtney treatment at sls was a related service.it also concluded that the costs of sls were not excluded by the medical services exception to federal regulations requiring the provision of related services.
finally,the district court denied the plaintiffs request for compensatory education for may through october in lieu of tuition reimbursement.the court held that the school district developed courtney iep within a reasonable period of time.it reasoned that courtney parents did not consent to an evaluation until october,the school district conducted that evaluation five days later,and it then developed the iep within one month of the evaluation date.

parents who believe that a public school is not providing a fape may unilaterally remove their disabled child from that school,place him or her in another school,and seek tuition reimbursement for the cost of the alternate placement.a c burlington sch.comm.dep t of,d.a court may grant tuition reimbursement if the school district failed to provide the required fape and the parents sought an appropriate private placement.deflaminis,at see also forest grove sch.dist,d w hen a public school fails to provide a fape and a child parents place the child in an appropriate private school without the school district consent,a court may require the district to reimburse the parents for the cost of the private education.
we would ordinarily begin by determining whether courtney was denied a fape.in this case,the fape analysis would require that we consider separately the two distinct periods of courtney stay at may through october,when courtney was in sls acute care ward,and from october through january,after courtney parents informed the school district that she could be evaluated and receive educational the school district provision of services differed during these periods.the second component of the tuition reimbursement analysis,however,does not require separate analyses for the different time periods,as it focuses on the appropriateness of sls as a private placement.for this reason,we will start by considering whether sls was an appropriate placement.
a parent decision to unilaterally place a child in a private placement is proper if the placement is appropriate,it provides significant learning and confers meaningful benefit deflaminis,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.that said,the parents of a disabled student need not seek out the perfect private placement in order to satisfy idea.ridgewood bd.of educ,cir.in fact,the supreme court has ruled that a private school placement may be proper and confer meaningful benefit despite the private school failure to provide an iep or meet state educational standards.florence county sch.dist.four carter ex rel.carter,d.
in this case,the parties disagree as to whether courtney placement at sls was appropriate.the school district argues that,particularly during her period in the ward,courtney received exclusively medical services.the appeals panel agreed with this argument.it found that courtney was in the acute care ward because she needed attention from someone trained in crisis intervention because of the acute nature of courtney mental illness during this four month period,the treatment goals and services for courtney were almost entirely devoted to stabilizing her mental health the treatment plan did not contain any academic goals.
plaintiffs argue that,while courtney was not capable of receiving traditional academic instruction,she could and did receive other services focused on behavior modification and her emotional wellness that can be considered educational in this context.furthermore,they argue that her medical and educational needs were not severable under this court decision in kruelle new castle county school district,cir,thereby requiring the school district to reimburse plaintiffs for courtney tuition at sls.
in kruelle,the plaintiff,paul kruelle,had severe mental disabilities and cerebral palsy at age thirteen he has the social skills of a six month old child and his is below thirty h e can not walk,dress himself,or eat unaided h e also has had a history of emotional problems which result in choking and vomiting when experiencing stress.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in,the kruelles lived in pennsylvania and paul was enrolled in a residential educational facility that combined school programs with care.id.at.paul did well in this program,but he was forced to leave when his parents moved to delaware.id.in delaware,paul parents sought and were denied a residential placement facility,and paul was instead placed in a school during the day and a respite care facility in the evening.id.the kruelles then requested a due process hearing to challenge this placement.id.after the state hearing officer and appeals body denied the kruelles request,the kruelles sought review in this court.id.at.
the kruelles efforts to obtain a residential placement were rooted in paul emotional problems the kruelles medical expert testified that paul vomiting,choking,and behaviors limited his ability to learn,but that a consistent environment could reduce these behaviors and improve paul ability to learn.id.the defendant school argued that,because paul need for residential placement arose from his emotional problems,the school was not obligated to provide this placement or pay for it.id.we disagreed.
we began by noting that,while the scope and details of an appropriate education are largely left to local school authorities,a school obligations are guided by federal law requiring the provision of special education and related services.id.at.furthermore,we recognized that federal regulations require residential placements which are made by public agencies for educational purposes.id.finally,we acknowledged that the concept of education is necessarily broad with respect to persons such as paul.where basic and social skills such as toilet training are lacking,formal education begins at that point.id.at.
with those principles as guideposts,we then considered whether placement may be considered necessary for educational purposes,or whether the residential placement is a response to medical,social or emotional problems that are segregable from the learning process.id.if the placement was required by the former,the school was obligated to bear the cost if the placement was necessitated by the latter,the cost of the placement was the responsibility of the parents or social service agencies.id.at.and to differentiate between the two possible predicates to a residential placement,the kruelle court instructed that we are to look to whether the social,emotional,medical and educational problems are so intertwined that realistically it is not possible for the court to perform the task of separating them.id.at internal quotations and citation omitted.the kruelle panel concluded the relevant question in the present case is whether residential placement is part and parcel of a specially designed instruction to meet the unique needs of a handicapped child.id.internal quotation marks omitted.applying this framework to paul case,we held that paul emotional and medical needs were not severable h ere,consistency of programming and environment is critical to paul ability to learn,for the absence of a structured environment contributes to paul choking and vomiting which,in turn interferes fundamentally with his ability to learn.id.
plaintiffs argue that sls is not a medical facility or psychiatric hospital,but is instead a residential treatment facility.while sls may be classified as a residential program,this fact alone is insufficient to warrant reimbursement.a wide variety of a range of issues from substance abuse to mental health and from aging services to spinal cord claim to be residential programs.only those residential facilities that provide special education,however,qualify for reimbursement under kruelle and idea.in kruelle,we stated that federal regulations require residential placements which are made by public agencies for educational purposes.at emphasis added.in fact,federal regulations declare that i f placement in a public or private residential program is necessary to provide special education and related services to a child with a disability,the program,including care and room and board,must be at no cost to the parents of the child.emphasis added.thus,we must consider whether the residential placement at sls was necessary to provide courtney with special education.
in kruelle,we recognized that not all services that can be broadly construed as educational are cognizable under idea.this is because ultimately any life support system or medical aid can be construed as related to a child ability to learn.at.instead,we declared that we must assess the link between the supportive service or educational placement and the child learning needs.id.
to support the argument that sls provided special education as defined by kruelle,plaintiffs point to the fact that courtney program at sls offered a token economy program,through which students could earn dollars for good behavior to be spent for various rewards,and that it provided support.they argue that these services are customarily offered in public schools.plaintiffs also cite the fact that courtney participated in some sls group therapies,such as the life skills training and psychoeducational skills groups,that can arguably be considered educational given courtney limited academic abilities at that time and her need to learn how to manage her illness.
as an initial matter,we reject plaintiffs argument that because sls utilizes some of the same modalities employed by schools it is thereby providing special education.this argument ignores the fact that institutions use tools such as a token economy program to incentivize a change in behavior,but the targeted behavior might well be one affecting health,education,or even conduct like the use of obscenities.thus,the relevant consideration is not the tool the institution uses,but rather the substantive goal sought to be achieved through the use of that tool.for the reasons that follow,we believe that sls employed these tools to enable courtney to manage her medical condition,not her educational needs.
we acknowledge that some services courtney received at sls may have provided an educational benefit.they are not,however,the sort of educational services that are cognizable under kruelle.during testimony before the hearing officer on january,courtney behavioral therapist at sls testified that courtney was enrolled in the mood disorders group,the psychotic disorders group,medication and pychoeducational group,anxiety disorders group,psychological skills group,life skills training group,and medication group.when asked the purpose of these groups,the therapist responded courtney will learn skills that will help with those specific areas.if courtney is having depressive symptoms it will teach her coping skills to work with her depression and anxiety.for instance,the psychotic disorders group provided group therapy where the members talked about how psychotic thoughts affect their daily lives and the psychological skills group taught techniques for anger control and managing other emotions.this account of the services provided to courtney demonstrates that sls programs and skills were predominately designed to make her aware of her medical condition and how to respond to it.thus,courtney received services that are not unlike programs that teach diabetic children how to manage their blood sugar levels and sorts of programs teach children to manage their conditions so that they can improve their own health and well being.however,because both programs are an outgrowth of a student medical needs and necessarily teach the student how to regulate his or her condition,they are neither intended nor designed to be responsive to the child distinct learning needs.see kruelle,at stating that idea requires courts to assess the link between the supportive service or educational placement and the child learning needs.accordingly,the link required by kruelle between placement and the student learning needs is lacking.
this is further demonstrated by the fact that the program at sls is designed to address medical,rather than educational,conditions.sls is licensed by the new york state office of mental health,its sole accreditation is with a national organization of rehabilitation facilities,and it has no state educational accreditation or even any educators.this stands in sharp contrast to kruelle,where we noted that paul earlier residential placement had been in a facility jointly regulated by state education and social services organizations.at.and courtney admission to sls was necessitated,not by a need for special education,but by a need to address courtney acute medical condition.statements from courtney parents and authorities at rancho valmora demonstrate that her condition deteriorated rapidly and that she needed emergency intervention and stabilization.
finally,we conclude that courtney medical and educational needs are severable.in kruelle,we began by noting that federal law requires schools to pay for care and room and board when a private residential placement provides special education.at.paul kruelle medical expert testified that paul needed a consistent and structured environment in order to benefit from educational services the expert testified that paul might be able to physically tolerate a placement requiring a transition from home to school,but he may not learn.kruelle biggs.recounting paul expert testimony in greater detail see also kruelle,at relaying the expert testimony that paul needed a consistent environment in order to learn.thus,with only a change in environment and without more extensive medical interventions such as drugs or psychiatric care,paul might be enabled to learn.
the present case is clearly distinguishable from kruelle.courtney education was impeded,not by a lack of educational services or a specific kind of placement,but by a complex and acute medical condition.the school district could neither prevent the onset of such a condition nor control when it would subside.furthermore,a change in environment would not by itself bring about an improvement in courtney medical required medical intervention,including psychiatric treatment and drug therapies,to address the biological pathology underlying her medical condition.this is far beyond the capacity and the responsibility of the school district.
nor can sls be reimbursable as a related service.under idea,schools must provide not only special education,but also related services in order to furnish students with a fape,a.the term related services is defined to include 
transportation,and such developmental,corrective,and other supportive services including pathology and audiology services,interpreting services,psychological services,physical and occupational therapy,recreation,including therapeutic recreation,social work services,school nurse services designed to enable a child with a disability to receive a free appropriate public education as described in the individualized education program of the child,counseling services,including rehabilitation counseling,orientation and mobility services,and medical services,except that such medical services shall be for diagnostic and evaluation purposes only as may be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education 
a.the district court concluded that,because the school district had begun to provide academic services to courtney,it was obligated to provide related services.it further determined that the entire cost of courtney stay at sls qualified as a related service because those costs did not run afoul of the limits on medical services.
while the district court is correct that idea requires school districts to pay for some medical services,the costs of sls are outside of the parameters of this mandate.idea states that medical services are covered except that such medical services shall be for diagnostic and evaluation purposes only.id.federal regulations further indicate that medical services only include those services provided by a licensed physician to determine a child medically related disability that results in the child need for special education and related services.c.
plaintiffs argue,however,that the supreme court has not interpreted medical services so narrowly.they point to a pair of supreme court rapids community school district garret,d,and irving independent school district tatro,d requiring school districts to pay for nursing services in school settings.they argue that these cases make abundantly clear that medical services are excluded from the responsibility of school districts under idea only when the service must be provided by a physician or hospital.
though it is true that the supreme court has concluded that schools must provide school nursing services as related services,the present case does not fall under tatro or cedar rapids.in tatro,an girl needed clean intermittent catheterization cic to empty her bladder every three or four hours to remain in school.at.to determine whether cic qualified as a related service,the supreme court stated that it must consider whether cic is a supportive service that enables a child to benefit from special education and whether cic is excluded as a medical service.id.at.it held that cic was a supportive service,as a service that enables a handicapped child to remain at school during the day is an important means of providing the child with the meaningful access to education that congress envisioned.id.at.
the court also concluded that cic was not excluded as a medical service because federal law and regulations pertaining to related services excluded physician services but specifically permitted those medical services that could be provided by a school nurse.id.at.it stated that this distinction likely arose from an effort to spare schools from an obligation to provide a service that might well prove unduly expensive and beyond the range of their competence.id.at.though the court also said that it presumed that medical services not owed under the statute are those services by a licensed physician that serve other purposes than to determine a child eligibility for special education,id.at,it did not expressly hold that physician services,and only physician services,are excluded medical services.in fact,it declared with regard to the federal regulations that,b y limiting the medical services exclusion to the services of a physician or hospital,both far more expensive,the secretary has given a permissible construction to the provision.id.at.emphasis added.the court statement that hospital services are specifically excluded would apply regardless of whether those services were provided by a physician,nurse,aide,or therapist in the hospital setting.
in cedar rapids,the supreme court was asked once again to consider whether a school was required to provide a disabled student with certain nursing services during school hours.at.garret was a bright and creative student who was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident.id.at.though garret needed many of the same types of services that were considered in tatro,he needed them on a more continuous basis.id.at.
the cedar rapids court reaffirmed that,with regard to supportive services,congress envisioned services that enable a disabled child to remain in school during the day.id.at.it also reaffirmed that the likely cost of the services and the competence of school staff justified drawing a line between excluded and covered medical services.id.at.that said,the court stated that the continuous nature of services,and the higher costs associated with that level of support,did not render those services more medical.id.at.the court reasoned defining related services in a manner that accommodates the cost concerns congress may have had is altogether different from using cost itself as the definition.id.at.
the instant case is distinguishable from tatro and cedar rapids.in the first instance,we note that it is not clear that sls even qualifies as a supportive service under tatro and cedar rapids.while stabilizing courtney medical condition would ultimately render her more amenable to educational services,the services provided by sls did not enable her to remain at school during the day.as courtney behavioral therapist indicated,even with several weeks of extensive support and services at sls,courtney was not sufficiently stable to undergo evaluation or receive educational services.
beyond this,however,we believe courtney care at sls is an excluded medical service.as noted above,while the supreme court stated that physician services other than those provided for diagnostic purposes are excluded,it also specifically excluded hospital services.see clovis unified sch.dist.cal.office of admin.hearings,cir concluding that medically excluded services are not only those services provided by a physician,but also those services provided in a psychiatric hospital see also butler evans,cir concluding that psychiatric hospitalization was not reimbursable as a related service.here,though plaintiffs go to great lengths to distinguish sls from a hospital,the facility is nonetheless far more similar to a hospital than a school or even a residential educational facility.sls promotional materials indicate that it specializes in the treatment of individuals with depression,dual diagnosis,psychosis,borderline personality disorder and similar psychological problems.it addresses these conditions through a combination of assessment,diagnosis,psychotherapy and medication management,as well as a number of group therapy offerings.furthermore,patient care is coordinated and directed by the patient personal psychotherapist,which in courtney case was a psychiatrist.it is also worth reemphasizing that sls has no educators,offers no educational services,and is not accredited with or regulated by educational authorities.second,the supreme court offered several guideposts to help determine when medical services are excluded,stating that the definition of medical services was designed to spare schools from an obligation to provide a service that might well prove unduly expensive and beyond the range of their competence.tatro,at.in this case,courtney care at sls may undoubtedly be classified as unduly expensive.but more importantly,and for the reasons discussed in part,that care is far beyond the range of competence of any public school district or that of any sch
