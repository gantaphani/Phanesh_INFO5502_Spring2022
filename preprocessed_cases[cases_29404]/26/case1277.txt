procedural background 
because the issues before us are entirely procedural,we will not rehearse here the factual details of plaintiff complaint or the evidence for and against those allegations presented in connection with defendants summary judgment motion.in brief,plaintiff,a tenured professor in the college of business administration at csu long beach,was chair of that college finance,real estate and law department from until,when defendant luis ma calingo,dean of the college of business administration,removed him from the chairmanship.
in october,plaintiff filed a complaint with csu of human resources against csu and dean calingo,alleging he had been removed as departmental chair and subjected to other adverse actions in retaliation for his having reported improper conduct by calingo.pursuant to csu established procedures for resolving whistleblower complaints,ellen bui,a csu human resources manager,was designated to investigate the complaint in march,bui provided a summary of her investigation and conclusions to the of human resources,who forwarded a copy to plaintiff.bui concluded the revelations plaintiff claimed to have made regarding dean calingo wrongdoing did not qualify as protected disclosures under the act that plaintiff did suffer an adverse employment action in being removed from the chairmanship of his department a position that carried an increased salary and stipend but that calingo had removed plaintiff as departmental chair because plaintiff had made inadequate progress toward an expected review of the department curriculum,rather than in retaliation for plaintiff complaints and accusations against him.
in a written response,plaintiff took issue with many of bui conclusions.in particular,plaintiff argued dean calingo stated reason for removing failure to meet expectations regarding a curriculum review pretextual.in an april letter of determination from the of human resources,however,csu decided that,while plaintiff had made a protected disclosure in complaining about dean calingo habitual absence from campus,he had not been removed as chair because of that disclosure,but for having what the dean considered an inadequate curriculum review process.
plaintiff then filed this action for damages against csu and calingo,alleging retaliation in violation of section.the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on two grounds.first,subdivision c of section authorizes a civil action only if csu has failed to reach a decision within the time set by its internal procedures while the subdivision goes on to say that it does not bar an action if csu has not satisfactorily addressed the complaint within months,the trial court interpreted that language as meaning only that csu is subject to a civil action if it fails to reach a decision within the stated timeframe,a condition not met here.second,the court held plaintiff was required to successfully challenge csu decision by writ of mandate,whether administrative code civ,or ordinary,before bringing an action for damages plaintiff,that is,failed to exhaust his judicial remedies.
the court of appeal affirmed.relying on ohton board of trustees of california state university th ohton,the court rejected plaintiff contention that by denying his claim of retaliation csu failed to satisfactorily address his whistleblower complaint the quoted language,the court of appeal held,did not mean addressed to the satisfaction of the employee.at the same time,again following ohton,the court rejected csu interpretation adopted by the superior court here,under which satisfactorily addressed would mean simply timely rendered.rather,the appellate court here opined,a t minimum,the phrase must mean a thorough investigation of whistleblower claims of retaliation,conducted in good faith,consistent with the spirit and purpose of the california whistleblower protection act.
the court of appeal further held summary judgment for the defense was proper because plaintiff had not,before bringing his action for damages,successfully establish ed through a writ proceeding that his claim had not been satisfactorily addressed reversal of an adverse csu decision through a proceeding for writ of mandate,the appellate court concluded,is a prerequisite for pursuing an action for damages under section,subdivision c.
we granted plaintiff petition for review.
discussion 
we are required here to determine the procedural prerequisites for bringing an action for damages under section,subdivision c,and in particular to decide whether,when csu has reached a final administrative decision adverse to the alleged whistleblower,he or she must,before bringing a damages action,demonstrate through a petition for writ of mandate that csu failed to satisfactorily address the internal complaint.to decide that we must also decide what the quoted statutory phrase means.
while this court has not previously addressed either question,we have recently faced parallel issues arising under related parts of the act.
subdivision c of section,which authorizes an action for damages by an employee of the university of california alleging retaliation for a protected disclosure,provides that the action is not available unless the employee has made an internal complaint and the university has failed to reach a decision regarding that complaint within the applicable time limit.this subdivision of section closely matches the corresponding part of section,except that it does not contain the latter last sentence nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the injured party from seeking a remedy if the university has not satisfactorily addressed the complaint within months,subd.c.
in miklosy regents of university of california cal th miklosy,we interpreted subdivision c of section according to its plain language,explaining,a civil action for damages against the university is available only when the plaintiff employee has first filed a complaint with the university and the university has failed to reach a timely decision on the complaint.miklosy,at.if,conversely,the university of california has reached a timely decision in its own favor,then it has not failed to reach a decision id.at,and no action is authorized under section although in miklosy we discussed other provisions of the act,including section,subdivision c,we explicitly reserved judgment on the meaning of the phrase satisfactorily addressed in that subdivision.miklosy,at.
a third textual variation is found in subdivision c of section,which authorizes a whistleblower retaliation action by a state agency employee that subdivision provides no such action is available unless the employee has filed a complaint with the state personnel board and that board has issued,or failed to issue,findings on the complaint.in state bd.of chiropractic examiners superior court,supra,cal th hereafter arbuckle,we relied in part on this language to hold that a state agency employee was not required to overturn adverse state personnel board findings through a writ of mandate before bringing an action for damages.t he legislature expressly authorized a damages action in superior court for whistleblower retaliation c,and in doing so it expressly acknowledged the existence of the parallel administrative remedy.it did not require that the board findings be set aside by way of a mandate action rather,it gave as the only precondition to the damages action authorized in section c,that a complaint be filed with the board and that the board issue,or fail to issue,findings.arbuckle,at.
with this background on our prior constructions of the act provisions,we proceed to consider the proper interpretation of section,subdivision c.
meaning of satisfactorily addressed 
we begin with the statutory language,viewed in light of the entire legislative scheme of which it is a part,as the language chosen is usually the surest guide to legislative intent.in re corrine cal th.to the extent we find the statutory language susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we examine other sources,including the history of the provision enactment,for insight into the legislature intent.elsner uveges cal th.munson del taco,cal th.
for ease of reference,we repeat here the pertinent statutory language.section,subdivision c authorizes alleged csu whistleblowers to bring actions for damages,but provides however,any action for damages shall not be available to the injured party unless the injured party has first filed a complaint with the university officer identified pursuant to subdivision a,and the university has failed to reach a decision regarding that complaint within the time limits established for that purpose by the trustees.nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the injured party from seeking a remedy if the university has not satisfactorily addressed the complaint within months.
the parties agree these two sentences authorize an alleged whistleblower to bring an action for damages if csu has either failed to reach a decision on the employee internal complaint within the administrative time limit or has not satisfactorily addressed the complaint within months.put another way,a civil action is precluded only if csu has reached a timely decision and has done so in a way that satisfactorily addresses the complaint.the parties disagree,however,as to what is meant by the condition that csu has failed to satisfactorily address an alleged whistleblower internal complaint.
plaintiff,as he has throughout the litigation,contends that the quoted phrase refers to the satisfaction of the complaining party,the alleged whistleblower.under this interpretation,csu employees,like state agency employees under section,may file an action for damages if csu either fails to reach a timely decision or reaches a timely but adverse decision on their complaint.
defendants,adopting a version of the court of appeal interpretation,contend csu has failed to satisfactorily address a whistleblower complaint only if csu investigatory process was so slipshod that it failed to be conducted in good faith and respect due process,or that if a violation was found in the internal process,the csu failed to properly rectify the matter.defendants also contend such procedural deficiencies must be shown in a mandate proceeding,not in the damages action itself.
we agree with plaintiff.we rely first on the language of the statute itself.while standing alone the word satisfactorily does not indicate the person,organization,or entity that is to be satisfied,in the statute the word does not stand alone.again,the sentence of section,subdivision c at issue provides nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the injured party from seeking a remedy if the university has not satisfactorily addressed the complaint within months.the only person referred to in the sentence is the injured party,or complainant,and the only organization or other entity is csu.no one contends it is csu that must be satisfied by its own investigation.moreover,the thing to be addressed is the complaint,and the person who will most obviously be either satisfied or dissatisfied by the way a complaint is addressed is the complainant.thus the most natural reading of the sentence is that the complainant may bring an action for damages if csu does not,within months,address the complaint to his or her satisfaction.
in defendants reading,the entity to be satisfied is a court presented with a mandate petition.the plaintiff must,in a writ proceeding,convince the court csu acted in bad faith or in a slipshod manner.the court is to deny the petition,precluding further remedy for the plaintiff,if using this standard it is satisf ied by the way csu investigated the plaintiff complaint.this reading,however,lacks support in the statutory text.neither the entity purportedly to be satisfied,a court reviewing the matter on petition for writ of mandate,nor the standard under which it must be satisfied,a good faith and a minimally careful not slipshod investigation,is mentioned or alluded to in the text of section,subdivision c.while not absolutely precluded by the text,therefore,defendants interpretation is not one that can be naturally drawn from the statute itself.
defendants rely on a passage in ohton,supra,th at page,in which the appellate court rejected the plaintiff proposed interpretation of satisfactorily addressed as referring to the subjective satisfaction of the whistleblower.the ohton court reasoned ohton subjective interpretation of satisfactorily addressed can be rejected out of hand.such an approach would render the statutory and administrative proceedings mandated by section and eo nugatory a complainant need only assert that he is unhappy with the decision in order to overturn it.we find no indication that the legislature intended such a farfetched standard.ibid.
the premises of this argument fail to withstand analysis.first,availability of a civil action for damages once administrative remedies have been exhausted does not render the administrative process nugatory.we addressed this point in arbuckle,supra,cal th at pages,explaining that an administrative process may serve important functions,such as promoting prompt and inexpensive resolution of disputes,even if its result is not binding in a later civil action our conclusion does not make the proceeding before the state personnel board a waste of time and meaningless.we can think of several instances in which the legislature has required or permitted disputing parties to complete a nonbinding adjudicative procedure before proceeding with a damages action in superior court.for example,an employee who does not receive wages has the option of filing a wage claim with the labor commissioner,who holds an informal hearing and issues a decision.labor code section then permits either party to appeal the labor commissioner decision to the superior court,where the appeal is heard de novo.additional analogies can be made to nonbinding arbitration under the mandatory fee arbitration act see bus,subd.a and judicial arbitration,which is also nonbinding see code civ.the legislature may consider such nonbinding proceedings to be useful as a means of promoting settlement,and in many cases nonbinding proceedings may be an effective way of resolving minor disputes with minimal expense to the parties.ibid.
nor does the availability of a civil action allow the complainant to overturn the administrative decision at will.a csu employee can not obtain relief in a civil action merely by assert ing that he is unhappy with the decision of csu on the administrative complaint,as ohton,supra,th at page,maintains.rather,the dissatisfied employee simply has the opportunity of proving,in court,all the elements of a cause of action under section,subdivision c.moreover,like section,subdivision c,which we addressed in arbuckle,supra,cal th,section authorizes,not an action to review the decision of the administrative decision maker,but a completely separate damages action in the superior court in which the employee will enjoy all the procedural guarantees and independent factfinding that generally accompany such actions.arbuckle,at.thus,even if the employee proves a case of retaliation for whistleblowing and obtains damages in the civil action,that result does not overturn csu administrative decision as stated in ohton,at it is a completely separate remedy authorized by statute.
there is,then,nothing farfetched ohton,supra,cal.app th at in an interpretation of section,subdivision c under which a csu employee who has submitted an internal complaint but received an adverse decision may sue civilly.such an interpretation puts csu employees on precisely the same footing as state agency employees under section,subdivision c,who may bring a civil action if they have submitted a complaint to the state personnel board and the board has issued findings,including adverse findings,on the complaint.see arbuckle,supra,cal th at.
to the extent any ambiguity remains after reading the language in its statutory context,the legislative history resolves it in favor of plaintiff interpretation.

on july,an analysis for the republican members of the assembly committee on public employees,retirement,and social security discussed problems with the current version of senate bill at greater length the report cited a letter in opposition to the bill from the university plaintiffs,which argued as summarized in the report the bill,in its present form,is inadequate to carry out its own objectives and would a waste millions of taxpayer dollars to defend illegal practices by uc and csu,and b encourage uc and csu to retaliate against whistle blowers.assem.republican caucus,analysis of bill reg.sess.july.to address these concerns,the republican analysis suggested amendments to,among other things,remove loopholes that presently free uc and csu from any liability by tracking the language and standards of the federal whistle blower protection act of.id.at.a june,analysis for republican members of the assembly committee on consumer protection,government efficiency,and economic development similarly noted that the university plaintiffs argued the bill was inadequate in its present form and suggested amendments to remove loopholes for both csu and uc.assem.republican caucus,analysis of bill reg.sess.june.both republican analyses recommended members oppose the bill unless the suggested amendments were adopted.id.at assem.republican caucus,analysis of bill reg.sess.july.
the amendments urged by the university plaintiffs and favorably referenced by the two republican committee analyses are found in the file of the assembly committee on public employees,retirement,and social security.in a proposal dated july,the organization argued that both the existing law relating to the university of california and senate bill were riddled with loopholes that undercut legal protections for whistleblowers.university plaintiffs,proposed amendments to sb,july.the proposal,among many other changes,suggested that the measure subdivision c be amended to provide,in part a ny action for damages shall be available to the injured party after the injured party has first filed a complaint of retaliation with the university officer identified pursuant to subdivision a and the university has failed to provide a remedy satisfactory to the injured party regarding that complaint within months.id.at,italics added see id.at.without this amendment,the proposal argued,protections against retaliation for whistle blowers at cal state will be as phoney as it is for those at uc now.id.at.
on august,as previously noted,the assembly amended senate bill to add the last sentence of subdivision c to the proposed new statute,section.the assembly did not fully adopt the university plaintiffs phrasing,the university has failed to provide a remedy satisfactory to the injured party regarding that complaint within months,but did use similar language,the university has not satisfactorily addressed the complaint within months.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.the bill passed both houses with that language included the bill author,in a letter to the governor requesting his signature,explained that the provision had been added to the bill b ecause of concerns raised by republican members.tom hayden,letter to governor wilson.
to summarize,the legislative history shows the requirement that csu act satisfactor ily in addressing a whistleblower complaint or face the possibility of an action for damages originated in a proposal for amendments to senate bill reg.sess.that the university plaintiffs submitted to legislators to close loopholes undercutting whistleblower protection.in this proposal,the person to be satisfied by csu resolution of the complaint was the injured party.the loophole objection and proposed remedy were noted in several legislative reports and adopted in particular by republican staff for two assembly committees,who recommended that republican members vote against the bill unless it was amended as suggested in the reports.in response to the concerns of republican members,the bill was then amended to provide for a civil remedy if csu has not satisfactorily addressed the complaint within months.while the phrasing ultimately adopted by the legislature was not identical to that initially proposed by the university plaintiffs,the similarity suggests a legislative intent merely to shorten and,to make a stylistic than to substantially alter the proposed language meaning or effect,a conclusion supported by the absence of further recorded objection by the university plaintiffs.the history thus tends to confirm our reading of satisfactorily addressed as referring to the satisfaction of the complainant 
we conclude that,under the terms of section,subdivision c,plaintiff was entitled to seek a damages remedy for retaliation against him as a whistleblower once he had filed his retaliation complaint with csu and csu had rejected it.we next consider whether the doctrine of exhaustion of judicial remedies for an adverse administrative decision required him to overturn csu decision through a petition for writ of mandate before filing his civil action.
ii.exhaustion of judicial remedies 
under the doctrine of exhaustion of judicial remedies,o nce a n administrative decision has been issued,provided that decision is of a sufficiently judicial character to support collateral estoppel,respect for the administrative decisionmaking process requires that the prospective plaintiff continue that process to completion,including exhausting any available judicial avenues for reversal of adverse findings.johnson city of loma linda cal th.failure to do so will result in any administrative findings achieving binding,preclusive effect and may bar further relief on the same claims.id.at.mcdonald antelope valley community college dist.cal th.generally speaking,if a complainant fails to overturn an adverse administrative decision by writ of mandate,and if the administrative proceeding possessed the requisite judicial character see pacific lumber state water resources control bd.cal th,the administrative decision is bi
