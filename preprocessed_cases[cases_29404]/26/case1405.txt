the california teachers association cta petitions for review of an order of the public employment relations board perb or the board which dismissed its own complaint against real party in interest journey charter school journey the complaint stemmed from cta charge that journey had violated the educational employment relations act eera,et,when it terminated the employment of three teachers stephanie edwards,paola schouten and marlene nicholas.
cta had initially charged the terminations were in retaliation for the teachers efforts to unionize with it,and amounted to illegal interference with those efforts.after perb determined the charge stated a prima facie case,it issued a complaint,which was later amended to include the additional allegation that journey conduct had also been in retaliation for a letter the teachers had sent to parents of journey students.
however,after an evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge alj,and a review of his findings by the board,perb issued a decision dismissing the complaint.that dismissal was based upon the board factual conclusion the terminations had not been based upon the cta unionization efforts,but were instead prompted solely by the letter sent to parents.the board then concluded the letter had not qualified as protected activity under the eera,and thus the terminations were not actionable.
cta now argues the evidence is insufficient to support the board factual determination that the teachers unionizing efforts with the cta had not been the cause of their terminations and perb erred in concluding the letter,which it believed was the cause,did not amount to protected conduct.we conclude the second claim has merit perb determination the teachers letter did not amount to protected activity can not be reconciled with its own precedent cited in support of that determination,and thus its decision to dismiss the complaint was clearly erroneous.
journey is a charter school begun in as a private preschool run by edwards out of her home.schouten joined the school in,and the two women wrote the school charter.journey charter was approved by the capistrano unified school district in,at which point journey became part of the district.
journey is modeled on the waldorf method of education,which emphasizes arts and music,and has a collaborative structure of governance involving teachers,parents,and management.as explained in journey brief to this court,charter schools are different from regular schools in that a charter school which does not retain parents and students literally goes out of business administrators,teachers,parents,and students in charter schools are involved in the creative exercise of redefining education.as a consequence,journey waldorf methods instruction to students and parents innovates in many collegial ways,including having teachers serve as directors on the governing school council.
journey governing council,which includes both parent and teacher representatives,has responsibility for all school operations,including hiring and firing of employees,and reports to the district.the teacher members of the council were referred to at various times as lead teachers or directors,and were paid a stipend in addition to their teacher salary as compensation for participation on the council.
by the school year,journey had a total staff of about,including teachers,and served students ranging from kindergarten to sixth grade.both edwards and schouten were teachers as well as members of journey council,while nicolas was a teacher only.in march of,the district deputy superintendent informed the council that journey charter was no longer acceptable and would have to be rewritten.some of the parents became concerned about the future of the school and expressed those concerns in the form of complaints about edwards and schouten.
in april of,the council held a special meeting to discuss the issues raised.in the course of that meeting,the council decided to remove edwards and schouten as council members,but to retain them as teachers.when word of that decision spread among the teachers the following morning,there was some disruption of the school day,and the council scheduled a teachers meeting at lunch time to explain the decision.the decision also caused dissension in the wider journey community,including the parents of journey students.
a community meeting was held in late april,during which parents voiced their strongly diametrically regarding the propriety of removing edwards and schouten from the council.nicholas spoke out strongly in favor of edwards and schouten,and ultimately stated to one parent that if the discord continued,she wonder ed how much longer before we have another columbine.that remark offended several parents,and nichols later sent a letter of apology to the council,parents,and journey staff.
at a council meeting in,one member made a motion to terminate edwards and schouten employment as teachers at journey,but the motion was not seconded.instead,the council ultimately passed a motion to reinstate edwards and schouten to the council,on the condition they participate in mediation with other members of the council and staff.
meanwhile,having become concerned about her own position and that of the other teachers employed at journey,edwards contacted cta,which arranged for a meeting between the teachers and one of its organizers on the day following the council meeting.
during june and july,edwards,schouten,and other council members participated in mediation.the mediator suggested a reorganization of journey governing structure,including the formation of new committees which would report to the council.although edwards and schouten solicited teachers to participate in the committees,some of the teachers viewed that participation as amounting to additional duties and were reluctant to agree.schouten informed one of the other council members in june that the teachers were going to organize.
on june,the mediator sent an to council members,seeking approval to send a letter he had written for distribution to the journey community.in the letter,the mediator proposed a restructuring of journey governance,and stated that edwards and schouten had resigned their positions on the council.the letter also asserted that in the future all official communication from journey would contain a statement that it was approved by journey faculty and council.however,some of the council members objected to distribution of the letter absent written resignations by both edwards and schouten from the council.and while it is undisputed that edwards and schouten had resigned from the council no later than june,the last day of the school year,they had apparently never been asked to put those resignations in writing.the proposed letter was never approved by the council for distribution.
on that last day of the school year,the teachers had an informal meeting with two of the members of the council.during that meeting,teachers expressed their concern about the impact the proposed new committees would have on their workload.one of the teachers,who was also a member of the council,stated the workload concern was the reason the teachers needed to join cta.
on july,all of the teachers met at edwards home,and collectively drafted the following letter to the parents of journey students the july letter 
dear parents of journey school,
this letter by the teacher faculty at journey school is intended to communicate directly to you some of the issues that have been weighing heavily on our hearts and minds.we are aware and sensitive to the honest concerns that some of the parents have expressed concerning their frustration with some aspects of the relationship and operations of journey school.the teaching faculty is open and committed to these efforts of dialogue and mediation for resolving issues.
the teacher faculty,along with the parents,has been committed to the students educational welfare from the very inception of the school.the record shows that even with growing pains,journey school had been a flourishing and financially sound place where the children were thriving.
the teachers have believed that continual acrimony on certain issues was unnecessary and unhealthy for the welfare of the children and the school.this was the reason that the teaching directors decided to take a hiatus while mediation was in process and had not taken any legal recourse.
we have been seriously concerned with the financial and executive management course that the school has taken since april.it is our belief at this point that the council financial and management decisions are putting the school at serious legal and financial risk of insolvency.these issues pale in comparison to the possible of the charter by the district.we have serious concerns over the financial,executive management and accountability of the school for the following reasons 
repeated violations of the brown act by failure to properly agendize items for meetings and improper postings of agendas and continuing to ignore the school legal council sic opinion on conducting the council meetings within the boundaries of the law.
accessing of confidential student files by council members.
prior to april,journey school was financially sound with a balanced budget of more that in revenue and in savings.currently,the school is facing a shortfall that has been exacerbated by an enrollment decrease of.
the hiring of a consultant despite journey school policies to put the contract up for competitive bidding.this consultant was initially hired for the mediation process,but has now been directed to run the school operations,despite the schools growing budget crisis.
lack of follow up on solid leads in procuring a site in san clemente.
this management approach is not in accordance with the spirit of steiner model.we are open to meeting with any parent or parents directly and discussing and resolving the issues.
we do not feel that the current political climate is serving the best interests of the children,the parents,or the community.we do not want any part of a political power struggle we want dialogue,cooperation,and balance and a truly model education environment for the children to exist and thrive.we agree that there are areas within the school where we could have done a better job,which is something we want to examine and improve upon.however,we do not think that this gives current council a license to compromise the educational welfare of the children to serve political ends.our experience with council management has brought us to the conclusion that there is little interest in a collaborative,open,and transparent model,which ultimately impacts the viability of the school.
in closing,our reports are nearing completion and our summer training was inspiring and uplifting.we are looking forward to moving into the future where the vision and integrity of journey school promise to deliver a quality waldorf education will not be compromised.we ask for your help and commitment towards the goal of a healthy steiner school.
the letter ended with the names of all the teachers,who had unanimously agreed to send it out the letter was duplicated on plain paper,and mailed to parents in journey envelopes.
the letter angered some parents,including the parent members of the council.those parent members apparently believed the letter had been conceived and written by edwards and schouten,and that the other teachers had not given their full consent.there was also concern the teachers had violated the new communications the one set forth by the mediator in his draft letter that had itself never been approved by the council for sending the letter directly to parents.
at some point in july,the mediator apparently renounced that role and signed a contract to become an administrator at journey.on august,the teachers met again with a representative of the cta,and voted to become part of the district faculty bargaining union.when the former was informed the teachers were meeting with the cta,he questioned the suitability of cta to represent the journey teachers,remarking on their unique work ethic,which required availability outside of school hours.
on august,the members of journey council went into closed session to discuss teacher contracts.they voted not to renew the contracts of edwards and schouten,despite the recommendation they should be retained as teachers but not directors and voted not to renew nicholas contract.
schouten was told her contract had not been renewed because,as no seventh grade curriculum had yet been approved,there was no teaching position available for her.edwards was told her contract had not been renewed because she no longer fit in at journey.nicholas was given no explanation for her termination,but one of the parent members of the council later testified that her columbine remark had been inappropriate,and her attitude generally hostile after the april,community meeting.
on october,cta filed an unfair practice charge against journey with perb,alleging that all three teachers had been terminated because of their involvement with cta.perb general counsel concluded that the allegations of the charge demonstrated a prima facie case of wrongful interference with employee rights protected by the eera,and retaliation against them for exercising those rights.consequently,perb issued a complaint.
in september of,a hearing was held before an administrative law judge.during that hearing,cta was granted permission to amend its charge and the complaint,to allege that journey termination decision had also been in retaliation for the three teachers involvement with the july letter.
in january of,the alj issued a proposed decision sustaining,for the most part,cta charges.the alj concluded that while journey was not legally responsible for comments made by the mediator which had allegedly interfered with the teachers exercise of their right to organize under the eera,it had acted improperly by terminating their employment in retaliation for both their protected efforts to unionize with the cta and their protected conduct of creating and sending the july letter.specifically,the alj concluded that either of those protected acts,standing alone,would have caused the terminations if the teaching staff had not expressed interest in cta,the contracts of the three teachers would still not have been renewed because of the july letter,and if that letter had not been sent,their contracts would still not have been renewed because of the cta.
journey filed a statement of exceptions to the proposed decision with perb.after conducting its own review of the record and the alj proposed decision,the board concluded that decision could not be sustained.first,the board rejected the alj conclusion there was a nexus between the teachers efforts to unionize and their termination.although the board expressly deferred to the alj credibility determination that the council had been aware of the unionizing effort despite their denials,a majority nonetheless concluded there was insufficient evidence to support the inference of a nexus between that knowledge and the decision to terminate these teachers 
among other things,the board majority noted there was no evidence that any representative of journey had ever tried to frustrate,thwart or discourage the cta unionization attempt.for example ware a teacher who testified about informing the council of the teachers organizing efforts,was not subjected to any adverse action.further,when the teachers held their first meeting with the cta representative in a journey classroom on may,the council took no action to prevent it.
second,while the board agreed with the alj factual determination that the employment terminations were based on the july letter,it disagreed with the alj legal conclusion the letter had amounted to a protected act under the eera.the board noted that p reliminarily,the speech must be related to matters of legitimate concern to the employees as employees so as to come within the right to participate in the activities of an employee organization for the purpose of representation on matters of relations.quoting rancho santiago community college district perb decision.and while the board acknowledged that materials which did not directly address disputed issues at the bargaining table or in negotiating proposals,could nonetheless qualify as comments on matters which were of legitimate concern to the teachers as employees quoting san antonio community college district perb decision,fn.omitted and that c riticism of a supervisor on subjects is protected under the act when its purpose is to advance the employees interests in working conditions,quoting regents of the university of california perb decision,the july letter did not meet the test.in the present case,contents of the letter to parents did not directly address any issue relating to the teachers interests as employees.the teachers expressed their concerns for the operations of the school,welfare of the children,financial and executive management of the school,possible of the charter,hiring of the consultant,and complained that the management approach was not in accordance with the spirit of waldorf model however,the teachers did not state how all those complaints impacted their working conditions,or how these concerns would advance their interests as employees.without such evidence,the board can not make any inference of protected activity.
in light of its factual conclusion the employment terminations in this case had not been based upon the protected cta contacts,as well as its legal conclusion the july did prompt the not qualify as a protected act,the board determined that cta had failed to sustain its burden of proving journey had discriminated or retaliated against edwards,schouten or nicholas based upon activity protected by the eera.it consequently dismissed the charge and complaint against journey.

what cta has charged in this case is that edwards,schouten and nicholas were terminated from their teaching positions at journey in retaliation for their efforts to unionize journey teachers with the cta and their promotion and participation in the teachers creation and dissemination of the july letter.because perb expressly concluded that the terminations were based upon the letter,we turn first to the issue of whether perb correctly determined the letter did not amount to protected activity under the eera.
government code section,subdivision a,provides in pertinent part that public school employees shall have the right to form,join,and participate in the activities of employee organizations of their own choosing for the purpose of representation on all matters of relations.government code section,subdivision a makes it unlawful for an employer to i mpose or threaten to impose reprisals on employees,to discriminate or threaten to discriminate against employees,or otherwise to interfere with,restrain,or coerce employees because of their exercise of rights guaranteed by this chapter.
those provisions of the eera are expressly made applicable to charter schools such as journey by education code,subdivision a,and t he public employment relations board shall take into account the charter schools act of part commencing with section when deciding cases brought before it related to charter schools,subd.d.
the cta asserts that the july letter,which was produced and disseminated with the approval of all of journey teachers,qualifies as a protected act under the eera because its content related to the teachers interests as employees,which is the standard articulated in perb own precedents.
in reaching its contrary conclusion,the board relied on rancho santiago community college district,supra,perb decision,san antonio community college district,supra,perb decision,and regents of the university of california,supra,perb decision.however,each of those cases is distinguishable from this one in two important ways first,none of those cases involved a writing produced by a teacher in a charter school,and thus none of them considers the possibility that such a teacher might have a different scope of issues which legitimately relate to their interests as employees,than would the average public school teacher.in this case specifically,all the parties have taken pains to explain how the waldorf model,followed by journey,specifically entails a collaborative structure of governance involving teachers,parents and management,and how charter schools require a dministrators,teachers,parents and students to be involved in the creative exercise of redefining education.
as set forth in education code section,subdivision d,an express part of the legislative intent in creating the charter schools act was to c reate new professional opportunities for teachers,including the opportunity to be responsible for the learning program at the schoolsite.and as noted above,perb is expressly required to take those unique goals into account when deciding cases brought before it related to charter schools,subd.d.
here,there is no indication perb considered the unique role played by the teachers in a charter school,and specifically the collaborative role these particular teachers were expected to play at journey,when it decided the july letter did not qualify as a protected act under the eera.it is undisputed that at the time the letter was written and distributed,journey was experiencing significant upheaval,with something of a rift growing between the parent members of the council and the teaching staff.the council,dominated by those parent members,had either implemented,or was considering implementing,a policy which purported to prohibit the teachers from communicating directly with the wider community of journey parents in an official capacity.instead,according to the policy,all official communications from journey were to be approved by the council.
that communications policy,whether actually in effect or not,appeared to be an obvious effort to restrict the influence of the teachers,and a significant departure from the ra
