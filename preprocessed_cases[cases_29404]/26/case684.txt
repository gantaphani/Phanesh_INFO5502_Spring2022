after dismissal for academic misconduct from the university of illinois the university,diane pugel brought this action against the board of trustees of the university the board.she alleged violations of her due process and free speech rights.pugel also brought state claims.the district court dismissed the federal claims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
given the procedural posture in which this case comes to us,we must accept the allegations of pugel complaint as factually true and must rely solely upon those allegations.prior to her dismissal,pugel was enrolled as a graduate student in the physics department at the university of illinois at.she also served as a teaching assistant and received a stipend from the university for her services.in october,pugel submitted her research to the scientific journal nature on march,she presented that research at a conference of the american physical society the aps.
on april,the university initiated a disciplinary action against pugel based on allegations of academic misconduct.the research standards officer sent pugel a letter indicating that the university was investigating whether pugel had fabricated the results included in figure of the submission to nature and whether,at the aps conference,she had presented results that she knew to be invalid.specifically,the letter alleged 
you continued to use a seriously flawed algorithm to analyze your experimental data even after you were informed that the negative probabilities included in the algorithms were nonsensical you presented the data in figure at the march meeting of the american physical society,even though you knew that there were questions about the validity of the data you have not produced a satisfactory explanation of how the points in this graph in figure of the nature submission were generated,despite requests for the original data and a documented analysis and you were not able to demonstrate the generation of the points in figure from experimental data to professor laura greene when requested to do so in person.
at.in accordance with university policies and procedures,a inquiry team was appointed to review the factual allegations and to determine whether sufficient evidence of academic misconduct existed to warrant a full investigation.
on or about august,the inquiry team issued a report that found sufficient credible evidence to proceed with a full investigation.the report recommended that such an investigation focus on events from september through april.specifically,the inquiry team recommended full investigation of the following charges 
that pugel fabricated the data included in figure of the submission to nature on october,sic and,that pugel presented data that she knew to be invalid at the aps meeting on march.
at.university policy required the vice chancellor for research to review the inquiry team report and to define the subject matter of further investigation in a written charge to a investigation panel.the vice chancellor therefore submitted the inquiry team recommendations for investigation as the specific charges against pugel.at this time,pugel was notified by the research standards officer that the university was proceeding with the next phase of the disciplinary process and that the investigation panel had been appointed.
the investigation panel conducted a review of the charges.on september,the panel held a hearing at which pugel had an opportunity to present evidence.pugel presented the testimony of her physician,who opined that pugel could not have been guilty of academic misconduct because she suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd.one of the panel members left the meeting during the presentation of this evidence.
on december,the panel concluded its investigation and issued a report in which it determined that 
pugel fabricated the results included in figure of the submission to nature on october,sic,and that she presented results she knew to be invalid at the aps meeting on march.in the view of the panel,these actions constitute grave academic misconduct under the university of illinois policy and procedures on academic integrity in research and publication.
at.on april,the acting research standards officer sent a certified letter to pugel,informing her that the chancellor concurred with the investigation panel conclusion of academic misconduct and that she had determined that the appropriate sanction for the misconduct was dismissal from the university.pugel appealed the chancellor decision to the president of the university on six different grounds.on may,the president responded by letter,denying relief with respect to five of those grounds.he ultimately concluded,however,that the senate committee should review the investigative report and decide if the violation of academic integrity in this case warrants a sanctioned dismissal.at.
on september,the executive director and associate dean of students informed the dean of the graduate college as well as pugel and her counsel that the senate committee on student discipline had determined that dismissal was warranted.on the basis of that decision,pugel was dismissed from the university effective nunc pro tunc august.pugel then brought this action against the board.
district court proceedings 
pugel alleged that her dismissal violated her due process and free speech rights.the board filed a motion to dismiss under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the magistrate judge issued a report recommending dismissal,and the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation.
with respect to the due process claims,the district court concluded that the allegations of the complaint revealed that pugel had received notice and a meaningful opportunity to clear her name.as to the free speech claims,the district court concluded that the university interest in academic integrity outweighed any speech interests of pugel.having dismissed the federal constitutional claims,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over pugel state claims.
discussiona.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision to grant a motion to dismiss under rule b.see gonzalez city of chicago,cir.we accept all facts as true,and we draw all reasonable inferences in pugel favor.see id.the motion is properly granted when the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of her claim that would entitle her to relief.see martinez hooper,cir.
due process claim 
a procedural due process claim requires a analysis.first,we must determine whether the plaintiff was deprived of a protected interest second,we must determine what process is due.see doherty city of chicago,cir citing logan zimmerman brush,d forbes trigg,cir.we assume for purposes of this appeal that pugel was deprived of a cognizable interest we therefore address only whether pugel was denied adequate procedural protections in the disciplinary proceedings.
due process requirements 
the hallmarks of procedural due process are notice and an opportunity to be heard.see mullane cent.hanover bank trust.due process is a flexible concept that calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.gilbert homar,d quoting morrissey brewer,d.to evaluate the adequacy of procedural protections in a particular situation,we consider f irst,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest.id.at.quoting mathews eldridge,d.
pugel is an employee of the university,but her employment arises out of her status as a graduate student.as a general matter,the supreme court case law on the adequacy of procedural protection has distinguished between employees and students.in cleveland board of education loudermill,d,upon which both parties rely,the supreme court considered the mathews factors and determined that a pretermination hearing was necessary in the case of a tenured public employee.see id.at.the court indicated that such an employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him,an explanation of the employer evidence,and an opportunity to present his side of the story.id.at.
the supreme court has approved less rigid procedural requirements in the student context,however.in goss lopez,d,the supreme court indicated that a high school student facing a suspension for misconduct was entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him and,if he denies them,an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story.id.at.courts addressing graduate student dismissals on charges of academic dishonesty traditionally have relied upon goss.see than of texas med.sch.at houston,cir crook baker,cir nash auburn,cir hall med.coll.of ohio at toledo,cir addressing the rescission of a previously awarded master degree on a charge of academic dishonesty.
nonetheless,the deprivation to which pugel was subjected is more severe than the suspensions at issue in goss.see bd.of curators of the of missouri horowitz,d t he deprivation to which respondent was from a graduate medical more severe than the suspension to which the high school students were subjected in goss.the severity of the deprivation suggests the appropriateness of more formal procedures.goss,at.indeed,more extensive procedures in the context of a university dismissal comport with the supreme court own admonition in goss that due process requirements depend upon context.see id.at.see also id.at.accordingly,those cases considering the adequacy of notice and hearing procedures in the context of graduate student deprivations have dealt with procedural requirements significantly more extensive than those described in goss 
even assuming,then,that pugel was entitled to heightened levels of process,such as the requirements contemplated in loudermill,she has not alleged a viable claim for a violation of due process.it is clear from the complaint that pugel received written notice of the charges against her and a pretermination hearing in which she had an opportunity to explain her side of the story.pugel alleged,however,that certain deficiencies in the notice and hearing she received constitute due process violations.we disagree.
procedures afforded pugel 
we review first the process pugel received.as alleged in the complaint,in april of,pugel received notice of an academic inquiry into her conduct in generating and presenting her data that inquiry led to a investigation,the existence of which pugel was notified in the fall of.at this time,she also was notified of the formal charges against her the submission of fraudulent data to nature and the presentation of data she knew to be invalid at the aps conference.in september,a hearing was held before the investigation panel,at which time pugel had an opportunity to present witnesses and to introduce evidence on her behalf.the december decision of the investigation panel,that pugel had engaged in academic misconduct,was subject to review by the chancellor.in april of,pugel received notice that the chancellor concurred with the investigation panel and had determined that dismissal was appropriate.pugel then had an opportunity to appeal that decision to the president.the president affirmed the chancellor decisions on five of six grounds asserted by pugel but did,in fact,reverse the chancellor discharge decision on the ground that another decisionmaking body should review the sanction.in september of,pugel was informed that the senate committee on student discipline had determined that dismissal was warranted and that her discharge had become effective as of august.
we turn next to pugel specific allegations of inadequate process.as part of her due process claim,pugel alleged that the university failed to inform her of the charges and that the decision to discharge her was based on an allegation abandoned before the formal charges.these claims contradict her prior factual allegations.according to her own complaint,pugel received written notice of an inquiry into her research.she later received written notice of formal charges that she fabricated data submitted to nature and that she presented data she knew to be invalid at the aps meeting.the investigation panel found pugel guilty of those charges.the senate committee concluded that dismissal was warranted based on those conclusions.thus,pugel own complaint reveals that she had notice of the charges against her and that the decision to discharge her was based on those same charges.this court is not obligated by the standard of review to disregard factual allegations that undermine a plaintiff claim.see,roots lands end,cir see also endsley city of chicago,cir indicating that a plaintiff may plead herself out of court by including factual allegations,which,if true,reveal that legal rights were not invaded.
pugel further alleged that she lacked a meaningful opportunity for a hearing.she submits that the investigation panel reached a conclusion contrary to the testimony of her physician and that one of the investigation panel members did not hear a portion of that testimony.we conclude that these alleged insufficiencies do not rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation.
first,according to the complaint,pugel physician testified that she could not be guilty of academic misconduct because she suffered from adhd.due process did not entitle pugel to a favorable result based on this testimony,only to a meaningful opportunity to present it it is clear from the complaint that,in presenting her physician testimony,pugel had an opportunity to explain why she should not be found guilty of academic misconduct.due process does not require decisionmakers to adopt the charged party explanation.
second,the absence of one panel member from a portion of the physician testimony did not invalidate the meaningfulness of the hearing.three other members of the investigation panel were present,and the panel decision was subject to further review by the chancellor,president and senate committee,although the panel member absence may have violated pugel rights under the university policies,a violation of state law is not necessarily a violation of due process.see osteen henley,cir a violation of state law for purposes of this case the student judicial code may be treated as a state law is not a denial of due process,even if the state law confers a procedural right.
pugel allegations reveal that she received an opportunity to present witnesses on her behalf to the investigation panel.after the hearing and determination of misconduct,she was able to appeal the chancellor decision to discharge her to the university president.she then received a further review of the sanction by the senate committee on student discipline.the complaint does not allege that these procedures were a sham.levenstein salafsky,cir holding that constructively discharged medical school professor who essentially alleged that procedures were a sham through and through sufficiently alleged a due process violation.nor do the specific allegations of error rise to the level of a due process violation.thus,the complaint itself establishes that pugel received substantial opportunity for hearing that comports with due process.
in sum,according to pugel own complaint,five decisionmaking entities found evidence that she had fabricated data and then publicly had presented that data knowing it to be invalid.the ultimate decisionmakers determined that the misconduct warranted dismissal.throughout the disciplinary process,pugel received notice of the charges against her and of the decisionmakers determinations.she had an opportunity both to present evidence on her behalf and to appeal the discharge decision.accepting these factual allegations as true,we conclude that pugel claims of inadequate process either contradict her factual allegations or do not rise to the level of constitutional concern.pugel therefore has failed to state a claim for violation of due process.
