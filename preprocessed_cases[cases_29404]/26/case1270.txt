in the united states district court for the district of oregon,a jury found that applyyourself,applyyourself infringed claims,and of collegenet,collegenet patent the patent,and claims and of collegenet patent the patent.on a motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol,the district court granted applyyourself motion for noninfringement of the patent and alternative motion for a new trial.collegenet,applyyourself,wl.because the district court misconstrued the phrase in a format specified by the institution in the patent,this court reverses the jmol and reinstates the jury verdict of infringement.this court also holds that the district court correctly dismissed without prejudice applyyourself counterclaim and affirmative defenses that the patent was invalid.in addition,this court holds the district court correctly construed the patent automatic limitation and correctly denied applyyourself motion for a new trial on the claims relating to the patent in a format specified by the institution limitation.
the patent issued,is a continuation of the patent issued.both patents share a common specification.the patents are directed to an online service for reducing the amount of work required by applicants and institutions in,respectively,submitting and processing applications for admission.in a common application of this online service,a college applicant could access a site and fill out an application to a particular university or institution.the applicant data would then remain available to complete applications for other universities and institutions.the applicant could thus apply with greater ease to multiple institutions.at the same time,the system would allow the institutions to access the applicant submitted information online and,in addition,allow the institutions to request delivery of the information in a particular format,thereby reducing the amount of work required by the institution in processing the application.as the patent describes 
a forms engine allows data sharing between customizable forms,such as college admissions applications.before applying,an applicant opens an account with a third party application servicer.after the applicant completes an application for one institution,the data is saved in a data base and automatically populates fields in subsequent application forms.the form for each institution is created from a form description file.each form is branded for its institution and forms for different institutions differ in appearance and content so that the presence of the third party servicer is transparent to the applicant.

the patent is specifically directed to the of the invention,the component that transfers common as applicant name and date of multiple applications.independent claim is representative 
a method of creating and processing over a computer network forms representing applications to different higher education institutions,comprising 
creating in response to a request from an applicant for an application to a first institution a first application form customized in accordance with the preferences of the first institution,the first application form including first form data fields for entering applicant information 
providing to the applicant over a computer network the first application form 
entering the applicant information in the first form data fields 
posting the applicant information entered into the first form data fields of the first application form to a server 
storing the posted applicant information in a database having a database field structure defined by multiple database fields,the database including multiple records,each record capable of storing information corresponding to each of the database fields 
creating in response to a request from the applicant for an application to a second institution a second application form customized in accordance with the preferences of the second institution,the second application form including second form data fields for entering applicant information,at least one of the second form data fields corresponding to applicant information not entered into the first form data fields 
automatically inserting into some of the second form data fields applicant information from the database 
providing to the applicant over a computer network the second application form 
entering applicant information into the second form data fields into which information was not inserted from the data storage or into which the data inserted from the data storage is to be changed 
posting the applicant information entered into the second form data fields to the server and 
automatically storing the applicant information entered into the second form data fields into the database by adding new records to the database,the automatic storing of the applicant information not altering the database field structure,thereby allowing new form data fields corresponding to applicant information not previously requested to be added to an application form without requiring alterations of existing application forms or of programs that access the database,whereby customized applications to different institutions share data through common,extensible data storage.

the patent,in turn,is directed to the portion of the invention that reduces the burdens imposed on institutions in processing applications for admission.in particular,the patent claims a method in which the institution receives the application in a format specified by the institution.independent claim is representative 
a method of processing over a computer network forms directed by multiple public forms users to multiple institutions,the forms being processed by a third party forms servicer that is neither one of the multiple institutions nor one of the public forms users,the method comprising 
presenting to a form user over a computer network by a third party forms servicer a form directed to one of the multiple institutions,the forms including fields for the forms user to enter user information 
receiving by the third party forms servicer over the computer network user information and electronic payment information entered by the user 
processing by the third party forms servicer an electronic payment associated with the form,the processed payment being from the user to the one of the multiple institutions to which the form is directed 
providing by the third party forms servicer the user information to the institution to which the form is directed in a format specified by the institution,the third party forms servicer thereby providing to public form user customized forms identified with institution of higher education and providing to the institutions data,while relieving the institution of the administrative burden of processing forms and payments.

applyyourself offers online systems for processing application forms.flagship was applyyourself first online system.it includes a software component called aim applyyourself information manager that offers a number of ways that an institution can specify a particular application format.applyyourself second product,known as the system,delivers data to the institution in three general types of file,delimited,and xml.each format type offered many variations.
on april,collegenet filed suit against applyyourself for infringement of the patent.on october,collegenet filed a separate suit for infringement of the patent.the district court consolidated the two cases and assigned them to the honorable dennis hubel,united states magistrate judge,for trial.the district court ultimately granted collegenet summary judgment of infringement as to claims,and of the patent,but denied summary judgment on the patent.with respect to the patent,the court determined that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the flagship or systems satisfied the in a format specified by the institution limitation,which the court had previously construed to mean any file and other formats specified by that institution.
the issue of infringement of all of the claims of the patent and the remaining claims of the patent therefore proceeded to trial.the jury found infringement of all claims except claims of the patent.however,the district court subsequently granted applyyourself motion for jmol of noninfringement of the patent and,in the alternative,a new trial.the court found that no reasonable juror could find infringement of the in a format specified by the institution limitation.
this appeal followed.in the main appeal,collegenet contends that the district court erred in granting applyyourself jmol of of the patent and,in the alternative,a new trial.collegenet principally argues that the district court erred in its construction of the in a format specified by the institution limitation.collegenet also argues that the district court erred in allowing applyyourself to dismiss its affirmative defense and counterclaim of invalidity without prejudice.

in the main appeal,collegenet contends that,in granting jmol of noninfringement of the patent,the district court misconstrued the in a format specified by the institution limitation.the context of the term usage is shown above in representative claim.the district court instructed the jury as follows 
user information provided to the institution by the servicer is available in an unlimited number of formats and is processed wholly by the third party forms servicer and not the institution.that is,the function is one of providing limitless formats for the transfer of user information from the servicer to the institution with no additional formatting or mapping performed by the institution.
this construction does not preclude formatting,mapping,or other manipulation of the user information data by the institution once it is received by the institution in a format specified by the institution.
any reference to unlimited number of formats and limitless formats should be interpreted to mean that the third party forms servicer provides the user information to the institution in any format specified by the institution.
in a format specified by the institution means in any file format,and it may include any other type of format,specified by the institution.

the patent does not expressly define these disputed claim terms.thus,this court,like the district court,must derive the meaning of these disputed claim terms from their usage and context.this court seeks a term usage in the ordinary and accustomed meaning of the words amongst artisans of ordinary skill in the relevant art at the time of invention.see phillips awh,wl at en banc citing water,safari water filtration,rexnord laitram.indeed,t he inquiry into how a person of ordinary skill in the art understands a claim term provides an objective baseline from which to begin claim interpretation.phillips,at,wl.importantly,the person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears,but in the context of the entire patent,including the specification.id.thus,a patent applicant may use the words in the specification,prosecution history,or both in a manner inconsistent with its ordinary meaning.boehringer ingelheim vetmedica,citing teleflex,ficosa am.in other words,a patent applicant may consistently and clearly use a term in a manner either more or less expansive than its general usage in the relevant community,and thus expand or limit the scope of the term in the context of the patent claims.see ballard med.prods.allegiance healthcare,noting that an applicant may disclaim claim scope during prosecution middleton.mining,explaining that in order to disavow claim scope,a patent applicant must clearly and unambiguously express surrender of subject matter during prosecution.in examining the specification for proper context,however,this court will not at any time import limitations from the specification into the claims.teleflex,ficosa am.
in this case,this court agrees with collegenet that the district court erred in construing the claim limitation a format specified by the institution to require an unlimited number of formats.first,the district court improperly read the term format to mean any file format.the specification and claims use the word format in its customary sense to mean the arrangement of data for storage or display.see phillips,at,wl at customary meaning refers to the customary meaning in the art field citing home diagnostics,lifescan.for example,in describing data formatting,the patent states 
not only are the individual data elements tailored to the specifications of a particular institution,the entire data set is formatted to conform to that institution needs.the data formats may include comma separated values,tab delimited values,fixed length formats,pairs,and edi.for all of these methods,of course,the data is ordered as required,social security number first,last name second,high school name.
patent,to.by listing five exemplary data formats,this passage suggests that an institution may tailor the arrangement of data to its needs within reasonable parameters,namely within one of the supported data formats.while the particular set of supported formats may indeed be broader than those specifically listed in the specification,at no point,however,does the patent require support for an unlimited number of formats,ll.t he invention is not limited,however,to the processing of any particular type of form or to the use of any particular network or database.thus,the district court definition of format was unnecessarily narrow.
the district court also overlooked this court precedent on the meaning of it is well settled that the term a or an ordinarily means one or more.tate access floors,interface architectural.the district court replaced a with any.for this proposition,the trial court relied on passages from the specification,which state that the invention allows the information submitted by the applicant to be transmitted to each institution in any data format that
