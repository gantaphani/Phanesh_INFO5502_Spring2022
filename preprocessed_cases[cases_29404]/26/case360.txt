more than thirty years after congress enacted a mandate for equal opportunity between the sexes in college athletics,this case reminds us that the realization of that congressional goal continues to pose myriad challenges to our nation colleges and universities.equity in athletics,eia,a membership organization comprised of,coaches,parents,alumni,and fans,is a virginia nonstock corporation.in this lawsuit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,eia challenges the department of education doe interpretative guidelines implementing the equal opportunity mandate of title ix of the education amendments of,stat,u.title ix.eia alleges that the guidelines violate title ix,the constitution,and the administrative procedure act apa,et.eia also seeks relief against james madison university jmu,challenging jmu decision to eliminate ten of the university varsity athletic teams seven men teams and three women teams,on the grounds that the elimination of those teams violates title ix,the constitution,and virginia law.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss and dismissed the case eia has noted a timely appeal.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
we begin with a brief review of the statutory and regulatory background relevant to this case.
in,congress enacted title ix,which provides in part that n o person in the united states shall,on the basis of sex,be excluded from participation in,be denied the benefits of,or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.title ix did not specifically address its application to athletics,and in,congress enacted the javits amendment,which directed the secretary of health,education,and welfare hew to prepare and publish proposed regulations which shall include with respect to intercollegiate athletic activities reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports.education amendments of,javits amendment.
on june,hew published its proposed regulations implementing title ix,containing provisions that addressed the statute application to athletic programs,june.hew followed notice and comment rulemaking procedures,and president ford approved the final regulations,as required by title ix,effective july,the regulations provided in part that a recipient which operates or sponsors interscholastic,intercollegiate,club or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes.c.one of the ten factors used to determine equality of opportunity is w hether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes.id.
in december,hew issued a proposed policy interpretation to provide further guidance for the regulations.after receiving numerous comments in response to its proposed interpretation,hew issued a final policy interpretation in december.the policy interpretation aimed to supply guidance to educational institutions to effectively accommodat e the interests and abilities of male and female athletes and provided that compliance would be assessed in any one of the following ways 
whether intercollegiate level participation opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments or 
where the members of one sex have been and are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes,whether the institution can show a history and continuing practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing interest and abilities of the members of that sex or 
where the members of one sex are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes and the institution can not show a continuing practice of program expansion such as that cited above,whether it can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.
id.at.this provision has come to be known as the test,and its first prong is at the heart of eia claims in this case against doe and jmu.
in,congress split hew into the department of health and human services and the department of education.see department of education organization act.as part of that reorganization,hew functions with respect to educational programs were transferred to the department of education.a transferring to doe all functions of hew office of civil rights,which relate to functions transferred by this section see also haven bd.of educ.bell,hew functions under title ix were transferred to the department of education.mccormick ex rel.mccormick sch.dist.of mamaroneck,cir noting that we treat doe as the administrative agency charged with administering title ix.
in,after soliciting public comments on its proposal,doe issued a clarification to the policy interpretation.the clarification provided that institutions need only comply with one part of the test and enumerated factors that would guide doe analysis of compliance under each part.clarification of intercollegiate athletics policy guidance the test,transmitted by letter from norma cantu,assistant secretary for civil rights,department of education clarification,reprinted in guidelines provide three individual avenues to choose from in order to comply.
in,doe issued a further clarification,which reiterated that the policy interpretation did not mandate reductions to men teams and noted that doe disfavored the elimination of teams as a means of compliance.further clarification of intercollegiate athletics policy guidance regarding title ix compliance july,transmitted by letter from gerald reynolds,assistant secretary for civil rights,department of education further clarification,reprinted in.
in,doe issued an additional clarification,emphasizing that institutions could demonstrate compliance under any prong of the test.see additional clarification of intercollegiate athletics policy three march,transmitted by letter from james manning,delegated authority of assistant secretary for civil rights,department of education additional clarification,reprinted in.while attempting to delineate institutions obligations under title ix,these clarifications have emphasized that doe intended to provide schools with flexibility in selecting methods of achieving compliance.
the parties here agree that the cardinal facts giving rise to this litigation are essentially undisputed.on september,jmu announced its plan to eliminate seven men and three women athletic teams in order to bring its intercollegiate athletic program into compliance with title ix in a press release issued following its decision,jmu noted that,as of the fall semester,although women represented of the undergraduate student body,they constituted only of the varsity intercollegiate athletes.the press release went on to announce that the proposed cuts would yield a female athletic participation rate of,a figure that would align more closely with female student enrollment.
in explaining its decision to eliminate the designated teams,jmu stated that a lternatives were proposed,considered,and analyzed to deal with the need to come into compliance with title ix,but ultimately,the university was left with the need to comply with the proportionality prong of the test.the university found that compliance under either of the two other prongs of the test was untenable.with respect to the second prong of the test,jmu determined that it could not demonstrate a history or continuing pattern of program expansion to accommodate the needs of the sex,having added only one women sport since.jmu also found it could not comply with the third prong of accommodating unmet student interest,as a ny solution that would require the addition of sports beyond the current teams was deemed unacceptable.as the university explained,the primary reason for the decision was to bring jmu into compliance with the law.the proposed team eliminations took effect on july.
meanwhile,opponents of jmu decision incorporated eia on february,in order to challenge jmu proposed cuts.on march,eia filed this action against doe,the secretary of education,the assistant secretary for civil rights,and the united states federal defendants,challenging title ix interpretive guidelines.in particular,eia asserted that doe policy interpretation,the test,and its subsequent policy clarifications violated title ix,the constitution,and the apa.at about the time it filed suit against the federal defendants,eia requested that jmu defer its proposed elimination of the ten teams and,when jmu refused,eia amended its complaint to join jmu and numerous jmu officials as defendants.eia complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief that would invalidate the allegedly unlawful guidelines and forestall jmu proposed team eliminations.in the alternative,eia sought damages under title ix to compel jmu to equalize scholarship payments to affected by the alleged scholarship gap created by jmu decision to eliminate teams.
on june,eia filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent jmu from going forward with its plan to cut the athletic teams slated for elimination.the district court denied the motion for preliminary injunction,equity in athletics,united states department of education,d,and we affirmed the district court,fed.appx.cir unpublished,cert.denied.following the appeal of the denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction,eia filed a second amended complaint,and the parties filed dispositive motions.on december,the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss and entered final judgment.equity in athletics,dep t of,d the district court opinion.eia brought this timely appeal.we review a district court grant of a motion to dismiss de novo nemet chevrolet,cir.
we first address the issue of standing,which is indispensable to a federal court exercise of jurisdiction.the federal defendants challenge eia standing to bring this suit,arguing that the underlying injury of which it complains could be redressed only by the university.jmu,on the other hand,contends that eia membership does not include female athletes on existing teams it thus argues that eia lacks standing to challenge the university scholarship allocation.jmu does not contest eia standing with respect to its other claims.
where,as here,the plaintiff is an organization bringing suit on behalf of its members,it must satisfy three requirements to secure organizational standing that its members would have standing to sue as individuals that the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and that the suit does not require the participation of individual members.hunt washington state apple advertising comm n.individual members of the organization must be able to show that they suffered an actual or threatened injury that is concrete,particularized,and not conjectural the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct and the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,miller brown,cir.this court assumes the merits of a dispute will be resolved in favor of the party invoking our jurisdiction in assessing standing and,at the pleading stage,presumes that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.lujan national wildlife federation,see also parker.district of columbia,aff by district of columbia heller,the supreme court has made clear that when considering whether a plaintiff has article iii standing,a federal court must assume arguendo the merits of his or her legal claim.nonetheless,the court has clarified that pleadings must be something more than an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable.students challenging regulatory agency procedures scrap.
we find that eia meets the requirements for organizational standing as to its claims against doe and jmu.it appears uncontested that the interests eia seeks to protect are germane to its purpose,given that eia claims it acts to preserve athletic participation at jmu and other universities by seeking judicial invalidation of doe test.further,its suit does not require the participation of its individual members,as eia seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against doe interpretations and jmu actions predicated thereunder see hunt,at.finally,eia has made a sufficient showing that individual members meet the constitutional standing requirements of injury,causation,and redressability,as set forth in defenders of wildlife,at.
with regard to injury,the record supports eia allegations that its members include current jmu students who were on the teams eliminated in as well as female athletes on continuing teams moreover,eia claims that its membership base is broader than students and includes coaches,alumni,and fans who assert that their injuries are manifested in denial not only of participation opportunities for athletes,but also of economic and associational opportunities.because eia can demonstrate that it has members that were directly affected by jmu decision to eliminate teams to comply with prong one of the doe test,it has sufficiently stated an.see mccormick,at concluding the jurisdictional requirements were met because student athlete plaintiffs had not yet graduated and could benefit from the injunctive relief sought.
similarly,we find that eia has set forth allegations sufficient to support causation and redressability for standing purposes as to its claims against both doe and jmu.eia has shown that the injuries suffered by its members were fairly traceable to jmu decision to eliminate teams,a decision jmu insists it made as part of an effort to comply with prong one of the doe test and its title ix obligations.eia contends that doe test caused injury to eia members by inducing educational institutions,including jmu,to achieve proportionality by cutting and capping men athletic teams.as jmu explained,having found compliance under the other two prongs untenable,the university was left with the need to comply with the proportionality prong of the test.eia seeks redress for its members injuries in the form of a declaration that the test is both substantively and procedurally invalid and an injunction to prevent jmu from maintaining the elimination of athletic teams in reliance on doe current interpretations of title ix.invalidating the test,eia alleges,will redress its members injuries by restoring the regulatory standard,under which schools must provide opportunity or ration scarcity based on relative interest rather than on substantial proportionality.though such an outcome would not necessarily guarantee the restoration of the teams that jmu chose to eliminate,no explicit guarantee of redress to a plaintiff is required to demonstrate a plaintiff standing.
for example,in national parks conservation ass manson,the circuit found that the plaintiff organization had shown redressability where,although a federal district court ruling in favor of national parks would not directly determine whether the roundup plant will get its permit,the effect of such a ruling would not be far removed.the court there found it sufficient that the court decision would significantly affect plaintiff injuries.id.at see also massachusetts envtl.prot.agency,finding the redressability requirement met where the court decision would reduce to some extent plaintiffs risk of additional injury utah evans,noting that a significant increase in the likelihood that the plaintiff would obtain relief that directly redresses the injury suffered suffices to show standing florida audubon soc.bentsen,redressability examines whether the relief sought will likely alleviate the particularized injury alleged by the plaintiff.emphasis added.
here,jmu announced that it was relying on the proportionality prong of the test in making the cuts accordingly,a declaration invalidating the test would likely significantly affect jmu decision.more importantly,jmu would be bound by the decision of this court.this is not a case of injury resulting from the independent action of some third party not before the court,simon eastern kentucky welfare rights organization.rather,the regulated party here is also a party to the case,and,as such,will be bound by this court determination of the validity of the agency interpretations as well as the necessity for the school actions to comply with such interpretations in light of jmu reliance on prong one of the doe test and the fact that jmu is a party to this action,we find that eia has made a sufficient showing to demonstrate standing against both doe and jmu.
we next consider the merits of eia claims.eia contends that the test is rendered substantively infirm by its alleged purposes and effects unlawfully establish ing a standard and unlawfully authoriz ing intentional discrimination.however,because neither of these contentions has merit,the district court properly granted defendants motion to dismiss eia substantive challenge to the regulations.
under the test,the first benchmark used to assess whether an educational institution is effectively accommodat ing the interests and abilities of members of both sexes,as required by a,is whether intercollegiate level participation opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments.eia argues that the use of this criterion violates title ix by requiring schools where men are more interested than women in athletics to discriminate against male and by effectively imposing an affirmative action requirement that mandates preferential treatment for women.
eia argument appears to be based upon the notion that,because title ix prohibits intentional discrimination as disparate treatment,any implementing regulation that is directed toward disparate impact violates the statute.eia contends that the test constitutes a disparate impact standard that should not be permitted to trump title ix prohibition against intentional discrimination,citing the supreme court recent decision in ricci destefano.however,eia argument both fails to take into account the statutory language that explicitly permits consideration of disparities in title ix enforcement actions and mischaracterizes the test as a mandatory disparate impact standard.
eia fails to acknowledge the clear statutory language of title ix that allows for some consideration of proportionality between participation and enrollment.title ix does not require proportionality between the percentage of persons of a particular sex who participate in an activity or program and the percentage of persons of that sex in the community as a whole.the provision at issue reads 
nothing contained in subsection a of this section shall be interpreted to require any educational institution to grant preferential or disparate treatment to the members of one sex on account of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of persons of that sex participating in or receiving the benefits of any federally supported program or activity,in comparison with the total number or percentage of persons of that sex in any community,state,section,or other area provided,that this subsection shall not be construed to prevent the consideration in any hearing or proceeding under this chapter of statistical evidence tending to show that such an imbalance exists with respect to the participation in,or receipt of the benefits of,any such program or activity by the members of one sex.
b emphasis added.however,as the plain language of the provision indicates,the statute does not forbid seeking such proportionality,and,moreover,as the highlighted language makes clear,the statute expressly allows for consideration of statistical imbalances in the course of enforcement proceedings.
in cohen brown university,the first circuit rejected a similar challenge to title ix regulations.cir hereinafter cohen ii.in a suit by female student athletes against the university for failure to comply with title ix,the university attempted to challenge the substantive validity of the test.the first circuit found that title ix,like other schemes,permits an inference that a significant statistical disparity may indicate the existence of discrimination.id.at finding that title ix does not ban remedies.the ninth circuit has also held that title ix does not bar remedial actions designed to achieve substantial proportionality between athletic rosters and student bodies.neal bd.of tr.of the cal.state,cir.like the defendants in those cases,eia here fails to show how the test exceeds the permissive bounds of the statute.
in addition to its failure to take into account the express language of title ix that permits consideration of disparities,eia also misconstrues the nature of the regulations themselves.eia contends that doe test constitutes a mandatory disparate impact standard that would violate title ix.however,this contention is without merit,as numerous courts have held.
in kelley bd.of,of,the seventh circuit found that the policy interpretation does not,as plaintiffs suggest,mandate statistical balancing.rather the policy interpretation merely creates a presumption that a school is in compliance with title ix and the applicable regulation when it achieves such a statistical balance,cir.the court in kelley went on to note that,d espite plaintiffs assertions to the contrary,neither the regulation nor the policy interpretation run afoul of the dictates of title ix.id.at.the first circuit in cohen ii echoed this rejection 
the university talismanic incantation of affirmative action has no legal application to this case and is not helpful to its cause no aspect of the title ix regime at issue in this of the statute,the relevant regulation,and the pertinent agency preferences or quotas,or specific timetables for implementing numerical goals.
cir citations omitted.
moreover,courts have held that the test provides universities with flexibility in achieving statutory compliance.the ninth circuit in neal found 
every court,in construing the policy interpretation and the text of title ix,has held that a university may bring itself into title ix compliance by increasing athletic opportunities for the underrepresented gender women in this case or by decreasing athletic opportunities for the overrepresented gender.
at.as the first circuit emphasized in its first opinion in cohen brown university,title ix does not require that a school pour sums into its athletic establishment,cir hereinafter cohen i.the tenth circuit further clarified that f inancially strapped institutions may still comply with title ix by cutting athletic programs such that men and women athletic participation rates become substantially proportionate to their representation in the undergraduate population.roberts.state bd.of,cir.
doe itself has consistently emphasized that its guidance is meant to provide this kind of flexibility to educational institutions,explaining that the test furnishes an institution with three individual avenues to choose from when determining how it will provide individuals of each sex with nondiscriminatory opportunities to participate in intercollegiate athletics.clarification,reprinted at.further,i f a school does not satisfy the substantial proportionality prong,it would still satisfy the test if it can meet one of the remaining prongs.clarification,reprinted at.eia claim that balancing for the purposes of achieving participatory proportionality violates title ix has been consistently dismissed,as has its contention that the test creates a mandatory disparate impact requirement.because eia fails to provide support to the contrary,the district court dismissal of this claim was proper.
equal protection 
eia also hypothesizes that the test violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment by requiring compliance with an quota that serves no government purpose.appellant br.at.relying on the decisions of the first,seventh,and ninth circuits,the district court rejected eia argument that the test is unconstitutional,stating that every appellate court that has considered the constitutionality of the proportionality prong of the test has held that it does not offend constitutional principles of equal protection.district court opinion,d at.the district court analysis is sound.
in kelley,the seventh circuit explained,
while the effect of title ix and the relevant regulation and policy interpretation is that institutions will sometimes consider gender when decreasing their athletic offerings,this limited consideration of sex does not violate the constitution there is no doubt but that removing the legacy of sexual discrimination in the provision of offerings such as our nation educational institutions is an important governmental objective.
at see also cohen i,at rejecting brown university equal protection challenge to the test.the ninth circuit in neal adopted the reasoning of the first and seventh circuits and held that the constitutional analysis contained therein persuasively disposes of any serious constitutional concerns that might be raised with respect to the test.at see also boulahanis bd.of regents,cir reiterating kelley holding.eia equal protection argument has been widely rejected,and this court finds the reasoning of our sister circuits persuasive.
to counter this overwhelming rejection of its contentions by other courts,eia cites to parents involved in cmty.sch.seattle sch.dist,for the proposition that any attempt to achieve balance or proportionality in the education context is inappropriate.however,as the district court explained,parents involved and other cases furnish no support for eia position.parents involved centered on school assignments and the strict scrutiny to which racial classifications are subject.at.the supreme court analysis in parents involved has little bearing on a case involving classifications,which are subject to the lesser standard of intermediate scrutiny here,eia concedes the higher degree of scrutiny applied by the court in parents involved when it notes that the court rejected balancing as a compelling interest.appellant br.it is far from clear that achieving sex equality in college athletics is not an important government interest,and eia fails to show otherwise moreover,the nature of collegiate athletics differs from the school assignments at issue in parents involved in part because teams are segregated by sex and participation opportunities are decided in advance.in neal,the court noted that these differences meant that t he paradigm that has motivated the supreme court more recent racial jurisprudence simply does not fit the case at bar.at.eia fails to provide any support to the contrary.accordingly,eia equal protection claim,like its claim based on title ix itself,was properly dismissed.
eia also argues that the district court erred in rejecting its claims that publication of the test was procedurally flawed and its efficacy therefore fatally undermined.among the procedural flaws that eia complains of are the fact that the test did not undergo apa notice and comment review and lacked presidential approval as mandated by title ix we conclude that the district court properly dismissed eia procedural claims.
apa notice and comment 
eia claims that doe test is procedurally invalid because neither the policy interpretation nor the doe subsequent clarifications underwent the notice and comment procedures prescribed by the apa.the district court found that neither the policy interpretation nor the later clarifications were subject to the apa notice and comment requirements because they were interpretative guidelines and did not create new rights,impose new obligations,or change the existing law.district court opinion,d at citing chen zhou chai carroll,cir.
at the time the policy interpretation went into effect,the agency noted that it represent ed hew interpretation of the intercollegiate athletic provisions of title ix and its implementing regulation.emphasis added.both the policy interpretation and the subsequent policy clarifications were intended to provide additional guidance on the requirements for compliance with title ix.emphasis added.
eia contends that the policy interpretation and the subsequent clarifications amended the regulations,but it utterly fails to provide support for this contention.as the district court appropriately noted,a n interpretive guideline does not become an amendment merely because it supplies crisper and more detailed lines than the authority being interpreted.district court opinion,d at quoting american mining congress mine safety health.in nwca,the circuit regarded doe test as interpretive guidelines that the department was not obligated to issue in the first place.at.as a result,the court there found that the policies were not subject to notice and comment requirements.eia claims regarding procedural flaws due to lack of notice and comment similarly fail here.
presidential approval 
eia also contends that the test is procedurally invalid because it was not approved by the president.as described in part i supra,provides in part that any rule,regulation,or order issued by a federal agency to effectuate title ix must be approved by the president in order to become effective.consistent with this requirement,president ford signed the title ix regulations promulgated by hew in.eia contends that the policy interpretation,including the test,is invalid because it lacked similar presidential approval.the district court correctly rejected this contention as meritless.
as with the apa notice and comment requirements,courts have held that the requirement of presidential approval does not apply to the issuance of interpretive guidelines.see,cohen brown,rev in part on other grounds,cir holding that the policy interpretation need not be approved by the president in order to become effective,as it is not a rule,regulation,or order.eia efforts,moreover,to corral the full range of agency action into the categories that require presidential approval fail to grasp longstanding conceptions of administrative law and are without merit.see,united states mead,noting that agencies charged with applying a statute necessarily make all sorts of interpretive choices.we find the reasoning of these courts persuasive,and find that eia argument with regard to procedural invalidity of the test due to lack of presidential approval also fails.the district court properly rejected eia procedural claims,and this court finds no reason to disturb that judgment.
finally,eia asserts both state and federal claims against jmu.with respect to state law,eia alleges that jmu violated the virginia freedom of information act by working in secret to eliminate athletic teams and violated other state laws by making the decision to eliminate teams for the express purpose of attaining enrollment proportionality.eia claims jmu violated federal law in the following ways that jmu violated the equal protection clause by eliminating ten athletic teams to comply with the test that jmu violated its members substantive and procedural due process protections by eliminating the ten teams in order to comply with the test and,finally,that jmu violated title ix by eliminating ten athletic teams,which resulted in both a participation and scholarship gap,in violation of the test.the district court properly dismissed the claims against the jmu defendants,and we affirm for the following reasons.
state law claims 
the district court dismissed eia state law claims as barred by the eleventh amendment.the eleventh amendment provides that the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi courts have held this immunity to extend to state agents and state instrumentalities.regents of of cal.doe.though there are several exceptions to this jurisdictional bar as the district court noted,none of the established exceptions permit private citizens to bring suit against state officials for injunctive or declaratory relief designed to remedy violations of state law.district court opinion,d at.see pennhurst state school hosp.halderman,holding an exception to eleventh amendment immunity inapplicable in a suit against state officials on the basis of state law see also antrican odom,cir finding that the ex parte young exception does not apply to actions against state officials seeking to compel their compliance with state law.
to overcome this bar,eia contends that a federalizes doctrines into eia federal cause of action under and.appellant br.eia argues that a incorporates virginia human rights act into eia claim against state officers.without specifying which elements are missing from the federal law that state law could provide,eia maintains that s tate law supplies elements to eia claims.appellant br.eia fails to offer support for this proposition but we need not decide the issue here,as it is not squarely before us.therefore,we affirm the district court dismissal of eia state law claims.
equal protection 
eia next alleges that jmu decision to eliminate certain men athletic teams violated the equal protection rights of male athletes with respect to participation.the district court rejected this argument,noting that jmu eliminations were made in an attempt to comply with the requirements of title ix,a reason that two other circuit courts had found sufficient to reject similar claims.district court opinion,d at citing kelley,at miami.wrestling club miami,f d,cir.
arguing that the district court reliance on the kelley and miami.wrestling club decisions is misplaced,eia appears to contend that,even if the title ix regulations are valid on their face,jmu implementation of them violated equal protection.however,eia fails to provide any support for its challenge other than to claim that jmu has established an impermissible quota,a claim that has been roundly rejected by other courts,see part supra.
in order to survive a motion to dismiss an equal protection claim,a plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to demonstrate plausibly that he was treated differently from others who were similarly situated and that the unequal treatment was the result of discriminatory animus.morrison garraghty,cir see also bell atlantic twombly.here,eia has failed to make sufficient allegations with respect to either element.
other courts have relied on the intent element to dismiss similar claims in the past.in miami.wrestling club,the eighth circuit noted,only if title ix,its regulations or the policy interpretation are unconstitutional could we hold that miami compliance with the law and the regulations is unconstitutional.at.here,jmu made its decision to cut the teams in order to comply with the test.as such,eia fails to plead facts plausibly identifying any discriminatory intent on the part of the university decision makers.
moreover,to avoid dismissal of its claim,eia must plead sufficient facts to show,plausibly,that jmu treated male athletes differently from female athletes.while jmu relied on sex in making its decision about which teams to cut,its efforts were an attempt to bring athletic participation in line with the student body population.as such,although more male athletes might have been affected by the cuts,the result was to ensure that the student body as a whole was substantially equally represented in the availability of opportunities for athletic participation.
eia argues that the student body is not the appropriate pool against which to compare athletic participation rather,it contends such comparisons should be made with respect to interest.however,in affirming the district court denial of eia motion for preliminary injunction,we found that c ourts have consistently rejected eia underlying claim that equal opportunity under should be tied to expressed interest rather than actual participation.equity in athletics,fed.appx.at.we unhesitatingly make clear our endorsement of this principle.as the first circuit explained in cohen ii,i nterest and ability rarely develop in a vacuum they evolve as a function of opportunity and experience.at.see also neal,at finding that an approach that ties interest to opportunity is fundamentally inconsistent with the purpose of title ix.eia attempts to shift the focus of this inquiry into proportionality are unpersuasive.
because eia fails to provide any support for its equal protection challenge to jmu decision to eliminate ten athletic teams,we affirm the district court dismissal of that claim.
due process 
eia also claims that jmu violated the substantive and procedural due process rights of the on the teams chosen for elimination.however,because eia fails to identify a specific liberty or property interest that were deprived of as a result of jmu actions,we affirm the district court dismissal of this claim.
in order to make out either a substantive or procedural due process claim,a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to support a finding that the were deprived of life,liberty,or property,by governmental action.beverati smith,f d,cir.a protected property interest can not be created by the fourteenth amendment itself,but rather must be created or defined by an independent source.see bd.of regents.roth,paving,ashe county,cir.in order to have a property interest in a benefit,a person must have more than a mere unilateral expectation of it or abstract need or desire for it.see roth,at.
the district court found that eia failed to offer any support for its claim that a property interest in continued participation in intercollegiate athletics exists under state law.district court opinion,d at.as the district court noted,other courts have addressed this issue and have consistently held that the interest of the student athletes in participating in intercollegiate sports was not constitutionally protected.seminary collegiate athletic ass n,cir see also neosho cmty.on appeal,eia challenges the district court conclusion,but the cases it cites are inapposite,relying,by and large,on contract theories.though individual athletes could have contract claims with respect to lost scholarships eia fails to show how these cases have established a property interest in intercollegiate athletic participation.
eia fails both to address this body of precedent in its briefs and to provide support for its preferred outcome.accordingly,we conclude the district court properly dismissed eia due process claims against jmu.
eia argues in the alternative that jmu actions violated the test and title ix in that jmu overdid its elimination of male athletes.appellant br.eia alleges that in the academic year,as a result of jmu cuts,men became the gender in jmu athletics,by,which represents male athletic slots.appellant br.because of this lack of exact proportionality,eia claims,jmu ultimately violat ed the test to the extent that it has any lawful effect.this contention misses the mark.
according to figures submitted by eia,men made up of jmu undergraduate population,but only of the university athletes in.however,eia figures are inconsistent with those collected by doe.contrary to eia assertions,the record demonstrates that,for the academic year,of athletic spots at jmu were allocated to men female athletic slots and male athletic slots,whereas men constituted of the total student body women and men.based on these figures,men were only underrepresented by,and not two percent as claimed by eia.
notwithstanding eia mistaken calculations,the district court correctly noted that the gap created by jmu attempts to comply with the proportionality prong of the test,regardless of whether it was one or two percent,was insufficient by itself to establish a violation under title ix,as the doe has expressly noted that determinations of what constitutes substantially proportionate under the first prong of the test should be made on a basis.clarification,reprinted at because this determination of substantial proportionality depends on the institution specific circumstances and the size of its athletic program,doe makes this determination on a basis,rather than through use of a statistical test.moreover,as the district court noted,other courts that have addressed the issue have found educational institutions to be in compliance with title ix where the sex disparity was similar to that alleged by eia.see,boulahanis,at finding substantial proportionality where the number of male athletes was within three percentage points of enrollment following the elimination of men soccer and wrestling miami.wrestling club,at noting successful title ix compliance where the number of female athletes was within two percentage points of the number of f
