alexandra gerena alexandra and her mother constance gerena collectively,the gerenas or appellants appeal from the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut eginton,dismissing their case under federal rule of civil procedure m for failure to timely serve defendants yale university yale and gregory korb korb,and additionally finding the gerenas claims untimely under connecticut law.for the reasons explained below,we affirm the district court dismissal of the suit against yale for failure to timely serve.however,we disagree with the district court conclusion that the gerenas time to serve korb was never extended.with respect to the district court second ground for dismissal of the claims against under connecticut statute of is a preliminary choice of law issue that was not explored in the opinion below.we therefore remand for a determination of whether personal jurisdiction over korb existed in new york,such that new york choice of law should have governed the gerenas claims against korb.
background 
underlying events and commencement of the action 
the gerenas commenced this action in new york supreme court,bronx county,on april.they are seeking damages arising out of an incident that occurred in august,at the beginning of alexandra and korb sophomore year of college at yale.according to the complaint filed by alexandra and her mother,korb sexually and physically assaulted alexandra in her dorm room after a social event.defendant yale allegedly did little to prevent this assault or other similar assaults and did not punish offenders adequately.as a result,alexandra and her mother are asserting claims of intentional conduct against korb and negligence,willful misconduct and recklessness against yale.
the gerenas claim that shortly after their state complaint was filed,but before service,yale sent one of its employees to obtain a copy of the state court summons and complaint yale disputes whether this occurred and the significance of it.in any event,on may,yale removed the action to the southern district of new york on diversity grounds,where it was assigned to judge sand.at that point,neither yale nor korb had been served with the complaint in the state action,although both obviously were aware of the action,given that yale had effectuated removal with korb consent.the federal time limit for service of process therefore began to run on may,and expired on september.see.m.
service on the defendantsa.service on yale 
one month after this time period expired,on october,plaintiffs served yale with a state court summons,which yale believed was insufficient since the case had been removed to federal court.soon after,yale moved for dismissal on the ground of improper service,or alternately,for transfer to connecticut under a.about eight months later,on august,plaintiffs finally served yale with a federal court summons.a few weeks after this,on august,judge sand granted yale motion to transfer to the district of connecticut.
service on korb 
in their brief,the gerenas explain that they had a difficult time serving korb.according to appellants,korb began studying overseas in the spring of.korb was originally scheduled to return to the united states at the end of may,but appellants were advised that month by korb probation officer that he was remaining overseas.although appellants apparently attempted to serve korb through his parents several times during the summer of,and enlisted the essex county sheriff to aid in these attempts,korb parents repeatedly refused service.the record includes an affidavit of service from an essex county sheriff stating u nable to serve,spoke with the deft father who refused to accept the papers.the undersigned instructed the father to have his son contact the undersigned.deft.avoiding service.undersigned made over attempts.
in december,counsel for korb filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff complaint for,inter alia,lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to serve process.on december,however,judge sand adjourned both korb and yale motions to dismiss in order to give plaintiffs an opportunity to properly effect service.
failed attempts at service on korb continued throughout the spring of.in summer,plaintiffs made an ex parte motion to judge sand to appoint a united states marshal to serve korb.judge sand held a teleconference with the parties shortly thereafter during this conference,after noting that korb seemed to be playing a game with plaintiffs regarding service,judge sand declined to grant korb motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,explaining that he would not do so under circumstances which deprived the plaintiffs counsel of questioning whether new york personal jurisdiction might exist,for example letting the gerenas attorney depose korb about the extent of his contacts in new york.
judge sand granted plaintiffs ex parte motion for service by marshal on july,stating that good cause has been shown in support of the application that the defendant korb has made himself unavailable for service by other means.a connecticut state marshal finally effected service on korb on october,after the case had been transferred to connecticut.united states marshals also served korb in november.
decision below 
this case came before judge eginton of the district of connecticut in august.in october,korb renewed his motion to dismiss for untimely service and expiration of the statute of limitations.yale made motions on the same grounds the following month.judge eginton granted both defendants motions on may.he first found that service on both defendants was untimely,as neither was served within days and no extensions of time for service were requested or granted.applying connecticut law,he further found that the gerenas claims against both defendants were barred by the relevant statutes of limitations.

discussion 
dismissal for failure to timely serve 
we begin with the district court decision to dismiss the gerenas claims against yale and korb for failure to effect timely service under federal rule of civil procedure m.rule m provides 
if a defendant is not served within days after the complaint is filed,the motion or on its own after notice to the dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified time.but if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure,the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period.
we have interpreted this rule to give wide latitude to courts in deciding when to grant extensions on time to serve,including permitting courts to grant extensions even absent good cause.see zapata,at.because we find here that the district court was within the bounds of its discretion in determining that the gerenas had neither sought nor received an extension of time to serve yale,we affirm its dismissal of the case against yale under rule m.however,for the reasons explained below,it was an abuse of discretion to find that plaintiffs time to serve korb had not been extended by judge sand prior to transfer.
dismissal under rule m against yale was proper 
the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that service on yale was untimely.although the gerenas case was removed to federal court on may,they did not serve yale until october,and at that point served only a state court summons.it was not until august,that plaintiffs served yale with a federal summons.
appellants primarily argue that yale had notice of this lawsuit before it was removed to federal court,as evidenced by the fact that yale had someone pick up a copy of the complaint from the bronx county clerk.however,the simple fact that yale obtained a copy of the state court complaint against it is insufficient for service to be deemed effective under new york law.see macchia russo,in a challenge to service of process,the fact that a defendant has received prompt notice of the action is of no moment.notice by means other than those authorized by statute does not bring a defendant within the jurisdiction of the court.internal citations omitted.the gerenas additional arguments that yale waived any jurisdictional objections by removing the action from state to federal court,or by commencing discovery,are similarly unavailing.yale promptly and repeatedly raised the defense of defective service.see hamilton atlas turner,cir cantor fitzgerald,peaslee,cir.
a stronger argument for appellants is that their delivery to yale of a state court summons might have adequately effected service as of october.there is a clear split of authority on whether or not service of a state court summons,after removal to federal court,is sufficient to effect service.see minter showcase sys,d collecting cases on both none from courts in the second ultimately determining that the view that federal service could be completed by delivery of the state court summons after removal was correct.we need not resolve this question here,however,because even if the state court summons were deemed sufficient,it too was served outside of the period prescribed for service.see.m.moreover,as judge eginton noted,there is no indication that the gerenas sought an extension of the time to serve yale from judge sand or that judge sand ever granted such an extension.
there are some indications in the record that judge sand intended to be permissive with the gerenas in their service of yale.in particular,the record contains a letter from yale university to judge sand acknowledging that on december,the court adjourned defendants motions to afford plaintiffs an opportunity to properly effect service,suggesting that judge sand may have intended to allow untimely service.however,this does not amount to a conclusive extension of time to serve,such that we could say that judge eginton abused his discretion in deeming the gerenas service of yale untimely.we are particularly deferential to judge eginton conclusion given that appellants still have advanced no argument as to why they could not timely serve yale.zapata,at when good cause is not shown,whether or not to grant an extension is a discretionary determination.
because the district court acted within the bounds of its discretion in determining that service on yale was untimely and that the gerenas had never been granted an extension of time to serve,its decision to dismiss the suit against yale is affirmed on this ground.
failure to timely serve korb was excused for good cause 
the gerenas efforts to serve korb stand in contrast to their lack of effort to serve yale.given the record before this court and the facts as they stood before the district court,we can not agree with its conclusion that the gerenas service on korb was also defective as untimely.
in his may opinion,judge eginton explained that service on korb was defective because korb was untimely served and there is no indication that plaintiffs sought an extension of time to perfect service or that korb did evade service upon his return to the united states.this statement,however,is not supported by the record.to the contrary,the record indicates that plaintiffs sought an extension of time to perfect service on korb,and that judge sand granted it.
specifically,judge sand july order directing service by united states marshals on korb operated as an extension of time to serve for good cause.during a june telephone conference,judge sand said the following to korb counsel about defendant korb avoidance of service 
t here have been efforts to serve korb at his parents home and to invoke the sheriff office i do think i can,on the papers before me,conclude that plaintiffs counsel has taken such ineffective means to effect service that on that ground,his motion for service by marshal should be denied y our letter which points out that korb has been within the jurisdiction on a number of occasions and has not been served is a little bit like the little child sticking out his or her tongue and saying,nah,nah,you ca catch me.korb has been fully aware that the plaintiff is seeking to serve him 
shortly thereafter,on july,judge sand granted plaintiffs ex parte motion appointing marshal to serve defendant korb,noting that good cause has been shown in support of the application that the defendant korb has made himself unavailable for service by other means 
korb argues that service was nevertheless untimely because although judge sand order may have included a finding that good cause had been shown for service by marshal,this does not equate to a good cause finding that the rule m service time should be extended.brief of gregory korb at.this argument,however,is implausible.it makes no sense that judge sand would order service by marshal almost a year after service originally should have been accomplished while not also intending to extend the time to serve.a decision to allow service by marshal at this point in the litigation implicitly included a decision to allow late service.
moreover,the good cause language used in judge sand order likely references rule m,regarding timeliness of service,not rule c,permitting service by marshal.rule c does not use the phrase good cause,but rather simply provides at the plaintiff request,the court may order that service be made by a united states marshal or deputy marshal or by a person specially appointed by the court.c.in contrast,rule m specifically states that if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure to serve,the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period.m.accordingly,judge sand order stating that good cause had been shown is best read as a finding that the plaintiffs failed attempts at service warranted an extension of time to serve,as well as a grant of permission to use the alternative method of service by marshal.and once this good cause finding was made,an extension of time to serve was mandatory,not discretionary.see.m see also blessinger united states,if the plaintiff has shown good cause,the extension is mandatory.
we note that judge sand extension on time to serve did not specify a time by which service was to be completed,despite rule m instruction that extensions on time to serve should be made for an appropriate period.it would have avoided an unnecessary issue had the time been specified.in this case,the appropriate period by which to extend time to serve likely would have been the time it took the marshals to serve.however,no argument has been raised that judge sand abused his discretion by not setting an appropriate period for service.accordingly,we need not consider at this point the necessity of a district court explicitly defining an appropriate period when extending time to serve.in re wireless data,cir finding argument not raised on appeal to be waived.
based on the record in this case prior to transfer,we conclude that the district court clearly erred in finding that no extension of time to serve had previously been sought by plaintiffs one had been sought and had been granted by judge sand,along with an order for united states marshals to effect service.we thus reverse the district court determination that korb was not timely served.
dismissal under the statute of limitations 
the district court provided a second ground upon which it dismissed the claims against both korb and yale the untimeliness of the gerenas claims under the applicable connecticut statutes of limitations.the district court reached this result by applying connecticut choice of law,and thus connecticut limitations period,without discussion.but there was a pre
