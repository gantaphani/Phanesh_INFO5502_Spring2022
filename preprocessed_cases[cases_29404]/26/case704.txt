during the spring of steven albrechtsen,a professor in the department of health,physical education,recreation,and coaching at the university of,suffered two reverses he was told that he could not teach two particular summer workshops that year losing about in pay,and he did not receive an merit increase in his salary for the next year.he responded with this lawsuit under title vii of the civil rights act of.albrechtsen contended that the department had discriminated against him on account of sex and retaliated for his support of other teachers who he believed to have been the victims of sex discrimination.he had some other claims as well,but the district judge removed them before the start of trial.a jury decided that albrechtsen was the victim of retaliation but not sex discrimination,and it awarded him a total of in damages when topped up with four years back pay calculated by the court.the bulk of this represented mental distress.sensing that this number had been drawn from a hat,the district judge produced a smaller container and drew out to replace it albrechtsen accepted the remittitur and a final award of,to which the judge added about in attorneys fees.
both sides have appealed.albrechtsen requires no discussion beyond stating that we agree with the district judge decision with respect to all of the claims resolved before trial.the university appeal presents nine contentions,counting the major subdivisions,but we need consider only one whether the evidence supports the jury conclusion that the university retaliated against albrechtsen for taking a stand against sex discrimination.
after a trial,the evidence including all plausible inferences normally must be viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict.that a blackletter principle,but what is normal does not always hold.the norm supposes that the parties have presented that evidence to the court of appeals in a digestible fashion,so that we may evaluate the record contents.both sides fell down at that task.the university failed to comply with circuit rule c the statement of facts required by fed.a shall be a fair summary without argument or comment.no fact shall be stated in this part of the brief unless it is supported by a reference to the page or pages of the record or the appendix where that fact appears.instead of summarizing the record so that we could learn what inferences in albrechtsen favor the evidence fairly supports,the university statement of facts is a tendentious recap of the defense case.no opportunity to disparage albrechtsen position is missed,and facts that might support his position do not see the light of day.when his turn came,however,albrechtsen.instead of marshaling the facts that support the verdict,the portion of the brief captioned statement of facts just refers us to the district court opinion denying the university motion for summary judgment.this is bad on three counts first,appellate briefs may not incorporate other documents by reference,see fleming kane county,cir hunter,cir second,we need to know what evidence was presented at trial,not whether the district judge thought that there was an issue for trial third,the district court overview of the pretrial situation does not contain a single reference to the record.albrechtsen has effectively provided no statement of facts at all.
an appellee is entitled to pretermit a statement of facts unless dissatisfied with the appellant statement.b.when the appellee chooses to omit a statement of facts,the court of appeals may decide the case on the basis of the facts that the appellant supplied.see investment funds bomar,cir.just as many district courts require responses to facts recited in support of motions for summary judgment,appellate courts require narrative responses.the effect of omission is the same in either court treats silence as assent to the moving party presentation.see,bradley work,cir little cox supermarkets,cir.
this is not to say that we have a fetish for section headings.if a statement of facts appeared somewhere else in the brief,say as an introduction to a section with the caption argument,we would give it the same effect as one with the proper caption and in the proper place.see fed.a.yet albrechtsen brief falls down here too.his entire argument devoted to the sufficiency of the evidence fits within pages,only a quarter of the space the university dedicated to laying out its version of the facts,and it does not furnish any detail.most of the references in this section are to the administrative charge of discrimination,which lacks evidentiary value.when asked at oral argument what evidence he was relying on,counsel replied the entire record.that will not do,nor will counsel fallback invitation that we read all of albrechtsen testimony.courts are entitled to assistance from counsel,and an invitation to search without guidance is no more useful than a litigant request to a district court at the summary judgment stage to paw through the assembled discovery material.judges are not like pigs,hunting for truffles buried in the record.united states dunkel,cir.we therefore approach this appeal on the assumption that the facts are those that the university has recounted,plus those in the transcript pages to which albrechtsen brief directly refers.
from that perspective,this is an easy case.to show that the university violated title vii,albrechtsen had to establish that a he complained about sex discrimination b the persons who made the decisions in knew about those complaints and c the adverse actions in occurred because of the complaints in other words,that,if albrechtsen had not complained,and all else had remained the same,he would have received a raise and been allowed to teach the workshops.as the university recounts the story,the only complaint in the record is a letter that albrechtsen wrote in,and this full of protests about the management of the not contain the words sex or gender.instead the letter contends that the department is mistreating all members of the faculty and picking on albrechtsen in particular,a position that is incompatible with a contention that men have been preferred over women,or the reverse.we read that letter the same way the university does,and no reasonable juror could understand it otherwise.if there has been no protest about sex discrimination,there can not have been any prohibited retaliation.
the university adds that it had lawful reasons for acting as it did.a new department chair asked faculty members to submit student evaluations for use in the process.albrechtsen refused to do this,and the chair responded by withholding any merit pay increase.the new chair asked albrechtsen for a current curriculum vitae so that she could assess whether his knowledge encompassed the subjects he proposed to teach wilderness medicine and electrocardiography again albrechtsen refused,and again the chair followed albrechtsen no with a no of her own.albrechtsen concedes that he refused to furnish a current or hand over student evaluations he says that he viewed the requests as harassing and that the department should have known his qualifications to teach the workshops and receive a merit increase.new administrators may want to verify for themselves what their predecessors supposedly knew.often people come to management posts planning to change the way things are done,so the fact that albrechtsen had taught these workshops,and received merit increases,in years past does not imply that the new chair must have been discriminating or retaliating when she asked for information and concluded that a truculent faculty member should not receive a reward.with only the january letter to go on it would be impossible for a jury reasonably to conclude that the decisions in spring were retaliation rather than a use of the broom that new managers often bring to office.
albrechtsen tells us that the protected speech occurred between and,when he made numerous protests about sex discrimination.by his lights,what the letter does is imply that the department would not have forgotten these events.yet albrechtsen does not point to any example of his protests in the record.the few references
