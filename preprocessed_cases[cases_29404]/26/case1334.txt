before the beginning of the school year,the district contacted appellant to see if she wished to return for another year as a temporary employee.because appellant had recently had a child,she notified the district she needed a short maternity leave.because she could not report to work at the beginning of the school year,the district declined to offer her a temporary position.in november,she began working as a employee for the district.
on july,appellant filed a petition for a writ of mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section.appellant alleged that she was improperly classified as a temporary employee instead of a probationary i employee for the school year,pursuant to education code section in support of her petition,appellant argued she had become a permanent employee pursuant to section,subdivision b,which provides that an employee who has been employed for two complete consecutive school years and is reelected for the next succeeding school year shall,at the commencement of the succeeding school year,be classified as and become a permanent employee of the district.appellant argued she had been employed for two complete school years because the district two notices of nonreelection were ineffective,as the notices did not comply with section,subdivision b,and the notices referenced an education code provision applicable only to temporary employees

appellant filed a reply,contending she was not properly nonreelected as a probationary i teacher in march,because the notice of nonreelection did not reference section,and there was no board resolution authorizing that appellant be nonreelected as a probationary employee.
on march,the superior court denied appellant petition.in its written statement of decision,the court ann jones determined that when appellant was first hired,both she and the district believed that she was a temporary certifi cated employee.the court determined that by operation of law,appellant was a probationary i employee,because she started working before she received written notification that she was a temporary employee.however,the court concluded that her misclassification as a temporary employee did not render the subsequent notices of nonreelection ineffective,because section,subdivision b does not apply to probationary i employees,and the reference to the wrong statutory authority did not prejudice appellant.
judgment in favor of the district was entered april.appellant timely appealed.
