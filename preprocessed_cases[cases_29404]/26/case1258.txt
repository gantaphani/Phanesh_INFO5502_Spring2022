engage provides professional training,curriculum development,and technical assistance to schools,teachers,and administrators.since,engage has provided these services to schools run by the bureau of indian affairs bia,united states department of the interior,through the bia family and child education face program.the bia funds services for its face program in two ways directly through bia contracts,or purchase orders,with a service provider and indirectly through the distribution of funds under the no child left behind act of nclb act,et,to bia schools,which in turn contract with a provider.engage seeks payment from the bia for services provided to schools during two time periods october through november,and march and april.according to engage,it rendered these services pursuant to an express or contract with the bia.with respect to the services performed in,engage also alleges that those services were covered by a contract with the principal of a school under the nclb act.
regarding the time period,it is undisputed that in august the bia awarded contract po to engage.under the terms of this contract,engage was to provide a teacher training on august,and an unspecified number of site visits to bia schools between august,and june,to support implementation of the face program.the total contract was for for the teacher training and for the site visits.lana shaughnessy,special assistant to keith king,the director of the office of indian affairs oia,requested the services included in po on june,via requisition.the requisition was also signed by approval official william mehojah,director of the office of indian education programs.the contract,dated august,was signed by contracting officer co sonia nelson.
po contract price of was significantly lower than what engage originally proposed to the government.earlier in the year,engage had submitted a contract proposal to the bia for services to be performed in and totaling,including for two teacher trainings and for four site visits to schools.two amendments were later made to requisition.the first amendment,dated august,includes an additional teacher training and additional site visits as well as two trainings and technology support,for a total cost of.the second amendment,dated october,includes additional site visits for.both amendments were requested by shaughnessy and approved by mehojah.no contracts signed by a co accompany these requisition amendments.co nelson did sign one amendment to po on december.this amendment,however,makes only an administrative change a change to the accounting code and specifically states that the purchase order amount is not effective sic by this amendment.there is only one other contract in the record from the time period po,dated september,and signed by oia director and co king.this contract authorizes for a teacher training.later,in february,king signed a contract with engage for over a million dollars in services to be provided through december.
overall,engage claims to have provided in services to bia schools between september and december,including the paid by the bia under po.shaughnessy sent much of the rest of the remaining amount to the schools,which engage then billed directly.at dispute is the partial nonpayment for services engage provided to fourteen schools between october and november.engage submitted invoices for services totaling,of which the bia refused payment on contained in eight invoices.in may,engage again requested payment of the outstanding from king.
on july,king denied payment.in his letter,addressed to diana johnston,president and ceo of engage,king states his determination that the invoices are in fact the result of an unauthorized commitment,made by a government employee who did not have the authority to enter into an agreement on behalf of the government.king further states that he notified shaughnessy and johnston prior to the work being performed which generated the above invoices,that there was not a contract in place for these services and that,until a contract is in place,that these services should not be provided.shaughnessy disputes king version of the facts.specifically,she attests that,during this period,she was the contracting officer representative with the authority to authorize and approve work performed by engage learning,including the authority to direct the schools to contract for these services and to bind the government in that commitment.shaughnessy also attests that,during this period,king ability to perform his job was severely hampered by extensive absenteeism from work.id.engage vice president also contests king account.according to engage vice president,keith king gave verbal authority to conduct four site support visits each to different indian schools during the to school year.
the reference in king letter to notifying johnston is the subject of a memorandum from king to shaughnessy dated october,in the memorandum,king states that he and johnston had talked that day about the absence of a contract for upcoming training sessions and site visits and that they had agreed that engage would not perform any services until a contract was in place.johnston denies that the october,conversation with king,now deceased,took place.rather,johnston claims that king did not instruct her to pause work until december,causing the company to halt all work between december,and approximately february,when king signed a new contract.
