zuni public school district zuni and county public school district seek review of a final decision of the secretary of education which addressed whether,and to what extent,the state of new mexico can consider its receipt of federal impact aid when making its own statewide distributions of educational funds.both zuni and filed timely petitions for review of the secretary decision.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to b and affirm.
in october,zuni filed an objection to a certification made by the department of education that the state of new mexico was equalized pursuant to b and the corresponding regulations at this certification allows new mexico to offset its contributions to local education agencies leas including zuni and,by a proportion of the federal impact aid payments made to those leas.see,d b.in november,filed a similar objection with the department,alleging that new mexico took an inappropriate proportion of impact act funds into consideration when determining state aid,in violation of d and a 
the objections of zuni and were consolidated for the purposes of administrative adjudication.an administrative law judge alj issued a decision sustaining the department certification and rejected all other arguments presented by zuni and.both school districts appealed the alj decision to the secretary,who affirmed the alj decision.we will discuss as necessary any additional relevant facts throughout the course of this opinion 
zuni frames its challenge on appeal as whether the united states department of education and state of new mexico applied the mandatory statutory formula for determining whether a state has an equalized funding system for its schools which would entitle the state to take credit for federal impact aid funding.aplt.br.at.as we will detail below,the secretary determined the state of new mexico was equalized under,and reached this decision by reference to and application of the implementing regulations and appendix supporting the statute.see a pt,subpt.k,app.thus,we must determine 
whether the text of the statute resolves the issue,or if not,whether the department interpretation as evidenced by its application of the regulatory index is permissible in light of the deference to be accorded to the agency under the statutory scheme.if the statute speaks clearly to the precise question at issue,we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if the statute is instead silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we must sustain the agency interpretation if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
yellow,michigan,d quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d barnhart walton,d.in so doing,it is important for us to examine the current statute as well as its implementing regulations and appendix,and the history accompanying each.
impact aid is compensatory financial assistance paid by the united states to an lea experiencing financial burdens because the lea ability to raise local revenues has been limited as a result of the real property within its boundaries having tax exempt status due to the property acquisition by the federal government,or because the lea educates children residing on,or whose parents are employed on federal property,including indian lands.see.
generally,states are prohibited from reducing the state aid they provide to their leas if the leas receive impact aid.see a.pursuant to b,however,if a state is certified by the department as having a program of state aid that equalizes expenditures for free public education among local educational agencies in the state,then the state is permitted to factor in the receipt of impact aid funds when making its own distributions of educational aid to its leas.the statute sets out a general disparity test to determine whether a state is equalized.under this test,leas are ranked in descending order by their expenditures or revenues.if the lea that is ranked highest in terms of its expenditures or revenues does not exceed the revenues or expenditures of the lowest ranked lea by more than percent,then the state qualifies as equalized under the statute.b a.
in making this calculation,leas ranked at the extremes with the highest and lowest expenditures are excluded.as directed by the statute,local educational agencies with expenditures or revenues above the percentile or below the percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the state,b b i,are disregarded when determining whether a percent disparity exists between the highest and lowest leas.
the exception detailed in b allowing equalized states to take into consideration impact aid when making their own distributions of state aid first appeared in the impact aid laws in.that statute used general language similar to that which appears in the current statute but instead of describing a disparity test,the statute expressly delegated to the secretary the power to define the term equalize expenditures.see d b.
in,after engaging in the process of notice and comment rulemaking,the secretary promulgated regulations in which it outlined the disparity test.it directed that a state would be deemed equalized if the disparity in the amount of current expenditures or revenue per pupil for free public education among local educational agencies having similar grade levels in the state is no more than per centum,as determined according to the procedures set forth in appendix a to this subpart,june.appendix a detailed the specific method by which to make the disparity determination.first,leas were ranked by expenditures or revenues per pupil,and then those leas which fell at the and percentiles of the total numbers of pupils in attendance in the schools of those agencies,were eliminated.id.at.the percent disparity comparison was then made between the remaining highest and lowest ranked leas.id.
in the course of the notice and comment process,the department of education responded in length to a question regarding whether the and fifth percentiles were to be calculated based on the total number of pupils in the state or by school districts.it stated that 
the referenced percentiles are based on number of pupils.the regulation provides that in calculating the disparity standard according to the procedures set forth in appendix a,the districts in a state will be ranked on the basis of current expenditures or revenue per pupil,and that those districts which fall above the and below the percentile of those agencies in terms of the number of pupils in attendance in the schools of those agencies will be excluded for purposes of the calculation.the percentiles will be determined on the basis of numbers of pupils and not on the basis of numbers of school districts.however,it appears that the proposed regulation may not have been as clearly expressed as desired.in regard to the question of pupils versus districts for the percentages used in calculating the disparity standard,it is the commissioner view that basing an exclusion on numbers of districts would act to apply the disparity standard in an unfair and inconsistent manner among states.the purpose of the exclusion is to eliminate those anomalous characteristics of a distribution of expenditures.in states with a small number of large districts,an exclusion based on percentage of school districts might exclude from the measure of disparity a substantial percentage of the pupil population in those states.conversely,in states with large numbers of small districts,such an approach might exclude only an insignificant fraction of the pupil population and would not exclude anomalous characteristics.
id.at emphasis added.in,the regulations and the accompanying appendix were codified with substantially the same language in the code of federal regulations.see,pt,subpt.k,app.
in,the statute at issue in this case was passed,repealing and replacing d.as noted above,the replacement statute,specifically details within its text the percent disparity test,and also includes language setting out the basic parameters of the required and fifth percentile determinations.this statutory language largely reiterates the disparity test and percentile determinations laid out in the earlier regulations and appendix.however,the percentile language appearing in the statute differs slightly from that which appeared in the earlier regulations.while the former appendix directed that the and fifth percentiles should be calculated by the total number of pupils in attendance in the schools to determine which leas to eliminate,pt,subpt.k,app,the statute dictates that leas with expenditures or revenues above the percentile or below the percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the state,b b i,should be disregarded.nothing in the legislative history for the changes to the law gives any indication as to what meaning,if any,should be ascribed to the language above the percentile or below the percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the state,when calculating whether a state is equalized.at most,the legislative history merely notes that the statute prohibits a state from taking impact aid payments into account in determining the amount of state aid to be paid to leas that receive impact aid,unless that state has an equalization plan approved by the secretary and describes the standard which state plans must meet,at,reprinted in.
following the passage of,the department enacted new regulations to replace the regulations.the new disparity calculation regulation closely mirrors the language of the statute 
the secretary considers that a state aid program equalizes expenditures if the disparity in the amount of current expenditures or revenues per pupil for free public education among leas in the state is no more than percent.in determining the disparity percentage,the secretary disregards leas with per pupil expenditures or revenues above the or below the percentile of those expenditures or revenues in the state.
a.but the regulation goes on to state,in a fashion similar to its predecessors,that t he method for calculating the percentage disparity in a state is in the appendix to this subpart.id.the appendix,pt,subpt.k,contains the same expenditure percentile ranking method as was outlined in the earlier appendices,and details the same specific methodology for calculating the percent disparity test.it directs as follows 
a the determinations of disparity in current expenditures or revenue per pupil are made by 
i ranking all leas having similar grade levels within the state on the basis of current expenditures or revenue per pupil for the second preceding year before the year of determination 
ii identifying those leas in each ranking that fall at the and percentiles of the total number of pupils in attendance in the schools of those leas and 
iii subtracting the lower current expenditure or revenue per pupil figure from the higher for those agencies identified in paragraph ii and dividing the difference by the lower figure.
id.emphasis added.the history accompanying the regulation notes that the regulation outlines the single statutory standard for determining whether a state is equalized and specifies the method the secretary will employ to measure the statutory disparity standard.detailed examples of the application of this method to state funding programs are provided in the appendix following subpart,september,in sum,the department has adhered since to a rule which dictates that when disregarding leas to determine whether a state is equalized,the and fifth percentiles should be calculated by the total number of students in the state,rather than by the number of leas.
with this history in place,we turn to an examination of the department percentile calculation to determine whether the department construction is permissible in light of the language in which directs that local educational agencies with expenditures or revenues above the percentile or below the percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the state,should be disregarded.b b i.
in determining whether new mexico qualified in the year in question here as an equalized state under,the department followed the methodology provided in the appendix to to decide which leas fell within the and fifth percentiles of the total number of pupils in attendance in the schools of those leas.pt,subpt.k,app.applying this methodology to new mexico,which has predominately small leas among its public leas,the department eliminated the eighteen and the seven leas before ascertaining that the lea received only more state funding than the lea.the department thus concluded that new mexico public school funding is substantially equalized.
zuni argues that this methodology directly conflicts with the statutory language of b b i,which it reads to require the department to eliminate leas on the basis of lea percentiles rather than by student population percentiles.it asserts that the statute requires one of only two methods for determining the and fifth percentiles of expenditures eliminate five percent of the leas at the top and bottom of the ranked chart of leas,or figure five percent of the highest and lowest actual expenditure figures and disregard those leas that are funded above and below those numbers,respectively zuni asserts the total number of students is irrelevant to determining percentiles of expenditures and thus conflicts with the statute.we disagree.
where a law entrusted to an agency administration is ambiguous,or where congress implicitly or explicitly left a gap in the law to be filled in by the agency through the formulation of policy or rules,we must accept the agency position so long as it reflects a permissible construction of the language in question.hill ibarra,cir quotation omitted.see also chevron,at.such an interpretation is given controlling weight unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or contrary to law.mcnamar apfel,cir.
when congress passed in,it codified the disparity standard essentially as it appeared in the former regulations,albeit with an unexplained and slight alteration to the wording regarding percentile exclusions.compare and pt,subpt.k,app.with b.while the prior statutory scheme and regulations made clear that the percentiles were to be calculated by total student population,the new statutory language is not as explicit the precise language directs the secretary to disregard local educational agencies with expenditures or revenues above the percentile of such per pupil expenditures in the state.b b i emphasis added.we agree with the secretary determination that the statute is ambiguous 
a lthough the impact aid statute sets forth the parameters for calculating state public education expenditures or revenues under the disparity test,the statute does not contain a specific implementation of the disparity test instead,congress left that gap to be filled by regulation,which has been duly promulgated at an appendix to subpart k of cfr part.
vol.iii,doc.at.in other words,we do not know what calculations congress intended by such per pupil expenditures in the state.even zuni conceded in its argument before the alj that the statute may be ambiguous as to the precise formula that is to be used,doc.at.the statute ambiguity coupled with the gap left by congress regarding the specific means by which to implement the disparity test,requires us,in accordance with the rule laid out in chevron,to give deference to the secretary interpretation of the statute if we deem that interpretation to be reasonable or based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.based on our review of the statute,the regulations and the history accompanying both,we can not hold that the department construction of the statute and the method by which it applied the disparity test was impermissible.
the statute mandates that the expenditures or revenue for each lea be calculated on a per pupil basis.see b b i.the statute then directs that those leas which fall above the percentile or below the fifth percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the state should be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the disparity standard.id.because the statute mandates that expenditures or revenues be examined on a basis,we conclude the department method of determining the and fifth percentiles based on the total student enrollment in the state is a permissible construction.having already ranked the leas in descending order by their expenditures,it makes sense that the points for percentiles would also be based on total student enrollment.such an approach supports the basic purpose of the percentile exclusion because it eliminates in a fair and effective manner any unusual or noncharacteristic revenues or expenditures that may appear at the extremes of the range of leas in the state.this is especially true for the state of new mexico,which has predominately small leas,several of which rank near the top of expenditures.see,vol.i,doc,attach.at.to base the percentile calculation on leas,rather than student population,would not further the goal of eliminating this unusual distribution of expenditures in new mexico.as we previously pointed out,the department rejected determining percentiles solely on an lea basis for this very reason.
b asing an exclusion on numbers of districts would act to apply the disparity standard in an unfair and inconsistent manner among states.the purpose of the exclusion is to eliminate those anomalous characteristics of a distribution of expenditures.in states with a small number of large districts,an exclusion based on percentage of school districts might exclude from the measure of disparity a substantial percentage of the pupil population in those states.conversely,in states with large numbers of small districts,such an approach might exclude only an insignificant fraction of the pupil population and would not exclude anomalous characteristics.
june.finally,as detailed above,the department method of calculating percentiles by student population comports with the longstanding history surrounding such calculations.
there may exist some other,and perhaps even better,way to eliminate anomalies in school district funding in new mexico.however,given the large number of small leas in the state,the department disparity calculation methodology implements the statute in a manner that will give a more consistent result when applied to a variety of state school systems.we need not conclude the agency construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted to uphold the construction,or even the reading we would have reached if the question initially had risen in a judicial proceeding.chevron,at.rather,we are compelled to sustain the agency determination if it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.yellow,at.quotation omitted.based on our analysis above,we hold that the department construction of b b i,through its application of the disparity calculation methodology laid out in a and its accompanying appendix,is permissible,and therefore warrants our deference under chevron.
we turn next to argument challenging new mexico offset of contributions to leas.we decline to devote any substantial analysis to the merits of contention because we conclude it failed to raise this issue in a sufficient manner before the agency below.
congress limits state offsets for federal impact aid funding to a proportion to the share that local tax revenues covered under a state equalization program are of total local tax revenues.d b.the corresponding regulation provides,in part,that d eterminations of proportionality must be made on a basis for each lea affected and not on the basis of a general rule to be applied throughout a state.a.on appeal,complains that,in violation of the regulatory language requiring the state to determine proportionality on a basis,new mexico applies an standard to its school districts.contends it raised this specific issue during oral arguments before the alj.
in the course of the proceedings below,outlined three different methods by which it believed the proportional impact aid offset should be calculated.one of these methods was admittedly presented to the alj for the first time during oral arguments,vol.iii,doc.at.in that argument,asserted a method of determining proportionality that conflicted with new mexico method.it was only at the very close of oral argument that made the most general of references to the regulation language.id.at.but did not present any argument to the alj,either during the course of oral argument or in any of its initial written submissions to the judge,to explain why the state of new mexico proportionality calculation allegedly violated the language appearing in a while its suggested method did not.the alj asked the parties to include in their supplemental briefs a discussion of whether additional method fell within the regulations.id.at.
in their supplemental briefs to the alj,the state of new mexico and department of education appropriately focused their arguments on whether newly proffered proportionality offset method fit within the regulations.did the same,claiming in conclusory fashion and without any substantial discussion,argument,or analysis,that the regulation language was violated by new mexico method.it never offered any explanation as to why its suggested proportionality formula met the requirement while new mexico did not,doc.at,and it still offers no such explanation in its appeal brief to us.
in its opinion,the alj considered three different interpretations of how d should be applied in light of the general proportionality issues timely and sufficiently presented to it,and rejected each as inconsistent with the statute and its corresponding regulation,doc.at.it did not mention the language of the regulation.in seeking review of the alj decision to the secretary of education,reframed its challenge against the state of new mexico proportionality offset determination,and stated the sole issue on appeal was whether determinations of proportionality must be made on a basis for each lea or if it can be based upon a general rule applied throughout the state,doc.at.in addressing appeal,the secretary limited its analysis to the more general proportionality issues that were presented to the alj,and did not devote any discussion to new and undeveloped argument,doc.at.

based on our review of the record,passing and conclusory references to a language during oral argument and in its supplemental briefs to the alj are,at best,ambiguous and vague.as a result,neither the alj nor the secretary addressed the merits of this potential argument.we therefore conclude that failed to preserve this issue for appeal,and we decline to address it.
the petition for review is denied.
the federal government makes payments for the benefit of local education agencies leas to ameliorate costs incurred in educating federally connected children.such children include those residing on indian lands.a c.quite reasonably,congress wants the impact aid payments to be applied for the intended and expressed purpose,not merely used as a federal supplement for a state general education needs.but the matter is complicated because some states have equalized education spending,taking money from wealthy leas to meet the needs of children in less fortunate ones.in truly equalized states the special costs of educating federally connected children are borne,rather than by the leas where those children reside.congress recognized the complication and dealt with it quite specifically in the statutes.that is the backdrop for and focus of this litigation.
