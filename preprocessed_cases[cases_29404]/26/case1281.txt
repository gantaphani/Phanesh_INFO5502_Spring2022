in,the legislature added a statutory provision that revived for the calendar year those causes of action for childhood sexual molestation that would otherwise have been barred solely by expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.code civ,subd.c.does that provision also apply when a plaintiff suing a public entity has failed to first present a timely claim to the entity,as required by the government claims statute,our answer is no.
because this appeal arises from a ruling on a demurrer,we treat the demurrer as admitting all properly pleaded material facts.fox ethicon,cal th,d,blank kirwan cal d.the facts set out here are those alleged in plaintiff complaint.
plaintiff linda shirk was born on june.in september,when she was years old,the vista unified school district school district assigned her to an english class taught by jeffrey paul jones.jones began flirting with her on the first day of school in may,jones initiated their first sexual encounter.in the ensuing months,jones and plaintiff engaged in sexual conduct both on and off school premises.their last sexual contact occurred in november.in the following months plaintiff neither notified the school district of her abuse nor presented a claim to it.
in june,when plaintiff daughter was attending vista high school,plaintiff began to encounter teacher jones at high school band tournaments.that same month,having become very upset by her molestation by jones,she filed a report with the local sheriff office.in february,she met with jones and surreptitiously recorded a conversation in which he admitted to sexual conduct with her and with another student.
on september,a licensed mental health practitioner interviewed plaintiff and concluded that she was still suffering psychological injury from her sexual abuse by jones.that same day,plaintiff presented a claim to the school district for personal injury stemming from her sexual abuse by its employee jones.when,as here,the defendant is a public entity,such claim presentation is required under the government claims statute,et,sometimes referred to as the tort claims act.government code section requires timely notice to a public entity before commencing legal action against it.
on september,plaintiff,then years old,sued teacher jones and the school district.pertinent here are two causes of action for negligent tortious conduct against the school district,alleging that it knew or should have known that jones was a sexual predator who was engaging in inappropriate sexual misconduct with his students,including plaintiff.on a form complaint,plaintiff entered the date of the act complained of as,per ccp c and she checked two boxes indicating compliance with the government claims statute.
the school district demurred to plaintiff complaint,asserting that the negligence causes of action were barred by her belated claim presentation.the trial court agreed it concluded that plaintiff causes of action accrued as of the last act of sexual molestation,which was in november,but that they were barred because of plaintiff failure to first present a claim to the school district at some point in,as statutorily required.accordingly,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and it entered a judgment of dismissal as to the school district.
plaintiff appealed,arguing that she had timely presented her government tort claim to the school district on september,when her statutory cause of action under subdivision c of section accrued,because it was only then that she discovered the cause of her adult psychological injuries.the court of appeal agreed.it reasoned that the legislature addition in of provisions making entities liable for sexual abuse committed by their employees,subd.a,coupled with its failure to make special rules regarding the application of government claims requirements,indicated legislative intent not to differentiate between public entity defendants and private entity defendants.accordingly,the court of appeal held that in,when the legislature enacted the revival provision to open a window for childhood sexual abuse plaintiffs to bring statutorily lapsed causes of action,it also extended the government claims statute deadline for presenting a claim to a public entity defendant.the court of appeal reasoned that,because plaintiff only discovered on september,that the cause of her psychological injury was the teacher sexual abuse of her more than two decades earlier,the claim she presented to the school district on that same day was timely.
we granted the school district petition for review to resolve a conflict between the decision of the court of appeal in this case and a nearly contemporaneous decision of a different court of appeal in county of los angeles superior court th,d county of los angeles.that case held that the legislature amendment of section did not reflect the legislature intent to excuse victims of childhood sexual abuse from complying with the government claims statute when suing a public entity defendant.we reach the same conclusion here,thus reversing the court of appeal in this case.
below we summarize the pertinent provisions of section,which sets forth deadlines for bringing a lawsuit for childhood sexual abuse,and government code section,which sets forth a deadline for presenting a claim to a public entity and is a prerequisite to the filing of a lawsuit against the entity.
at the time of plaintiff sexual molestation in,the applicable statute of limitations for sexual molestation was one year.former,subd.in,the legislature enacted section,which expanded to three years the statute of limitations for sexual abuse by a relative or household member of a child under years of age.former,added by stats,ch.
in,the legislature amended section to make it applicable to anyone who sexually abused a child,regardless of that person relationship to,or residence with,the victim.it also extended the statute of limitations to eight years from the date the victim attains the age of majority,or three years from the date the victim discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual abuse,subd.a.a plaintiff over the age of years had to provide a certificate of merit from a mental health practitioner.former,subds.a,b,d,as amended by stats,ch.
in,the legislature again amended section by expressly providing that the amendments apply to any action commenced on or after january,including any action otherwise barred by the period of limitations in effect prior to january,thereby reviving those causes of action which had lapsed or technically expired under the law existing prior to january.former,subd.o,added by stats,ch.
in,there was another amendment to section,acknowledging the liability of a person or entity whose negligent or intentional acts were a legal cause of a child sexual abuse,subd.a,added by stats,ch.causes of action against such persons or entities had to be brought before the victim birthday,subd.b,amended by stats,ch.
in,the legislature again amended section,clarifying that its changes relating to the liability of nonabuser persons or entities were is,its provisions applied only to actions begun on or after january,or if filed before that time,actions still pending as of that date,including any action or causes of action which would have been barred by the laws in effect prior to january,subd.u,added by stats,ch.
in,the legislature yet again amended section,this time reviving for the calendar year those causes of action based on childhood sexual abuse brought against a person or an entity that had reason to know or was on notice,of any unlawful sexual conduct by an employee,volunteer,representative,or agent,and failed to take reasonable steps,and to implement reasonable safeguards,to avoid acts of unlawful sexual conduct,subd.b,added by stats,ch.thus,this change revived for the year those causes of action brought by plaintiffs over the age of years against nonabuser persons or entities that would otherwise have been time barred as of january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired as of that date,subd.c,italics added.
government claims statute 
before suing a public entity,the plaintiff must present a timely written claim for damages to the entity,state of california superior court cal th,d,bodde,but see,itemized exceptions not relevant here.in and,a claim relating to a cause of action for injury to person had to be presented to a government entity not later than the day after the accrual of the cause of action,added by stats,ch.since,such claims must be presented to the government entity no later than six months after the cause of action accrues,as amended by stats,ch.accrual of the cause of action for purposes of the government claims statute is the date of accrual that would pertain under the statute of limitations applicable to a dispute between private litigants,whitfield roth cal d,jefferson county of kern th,d dujardin ventura county hosp.d.

only after the public entity board has acted upon or is deemed to have rejected the claim may the injured person bring a lawsuit alleging a cause of action in tort against the public entity,williams horvath,supra,cal d at.the deadline for filing a lawsuit against a public entity,as set out in the government claims statute,is a true statute of limitations defining the time in which,after a claim presented to the government has been rejected or deemed rejected,the plaintiff must file a complaint alleging a cause of action based on the facts set out in the denied claim.code civ,addison state of california cal d,tubbs southern cal.rapid transit dist.cal d,county of los angeles,supra,th,d martell antelope valley hosp.med.center th,d see cal.law revision com,reprinted at pt.west ann.ed.foll,addition.
the statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit that is generally applicable to actions against public defendants code civ,subd.a is not implicated by the facts here.rather,it is the claim presentation deadline code civ,that is at issue,as we explain below.
school district demurrer to plaintiff complaint 
as discussed earlier,on september,plaintiff sued the school district under subdivision c of section,alleging,as relevant here,two causes of action for negligence based on the district employment of teacher jones.plaintiff alleged that on september,when she consulted a licensed mental health professional,she learned she was suffering from psychological injuries caused by teacher jones sexual abuse of her in and,when she was a teenager.the school district successfully demurred to both causes of action,arguing that not only were the year old negligence claims,but also that they were not subject to the revival provision in subdivision c of section,because of plaintiff failure to present a claim to the school district at the time of her molestation by jones.
generally,a cause of action for childhood sexual molestation accrues at the time of molestation.john oakland unified school dist.cal d,doe bakersfield city school dist.th,fn,d ortega pajaro valley unified school dist.th,d.here,plaintiff complaint alleged that her molestation by teacher jones began in may and ended in november.the trial court found that plaintiff cause of action accrued on november,the last possible act of molestation,and that under the deadline for presenting a claim to a public entity former,added by stats,ch,she was required to submit a claim to the school district at some point in.plaintiff,however,did not submit a claim to the school district until september,nearly years after the last act of molestation.
plaintiff acknowledges that because of her failure to present a claim to the school district in,her cause of action against the school district was extinguished in.but she argues that under section,subdivision c,which revived for the year those childhood sexual abuse causes of action on which the statute of limitations had already lapsed as of january,her cause of action against the school district on september,when she discovered that her present psychological injury was caused by teacher jones sexual abuse of her some years earlier.alternatively,she argues that her duty to present her claim to the school district,as required under the government claims statute,first arose on september,when she discovered that her psychological injury was caused by the teacher sexual abuse and presented her claim to the school district.we conclude that neither of her contentions is supported by the language and history of the legislative scheme,as we explain below.
we apply principles of statutory construction in seeking to determine the legislature intent in enacting the statute so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.kibler northern inyo county local hospital dist.cal th,d,people king cal th,d,fitch select products cal th,d.we begin with the statutory language because it is generally the most reliable indication of legislative intent.city of burbank state water resources control bd.cal th,d.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute controls.people hudson cal th,d.but if the statutory language may reasonably be given more than one interpretation,courts may consider various extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.people king,supra,cal th,d,people yartz cal th,d,people garcia cal th,d.
as amended in,the pertinent language of subdivision c of section reads a claim for damages brought against an entity that owed plaintiff a duty of care and whose wrongful or negligent act was a legal cause of injury to plaintiff resulting from childhood sexual abuse,if the cause of action would otherwise be barred as of january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired is revived italics added,and the revived cause of action may be commenced within one year of january.
in plain language,that provision expressly limited revival of childhood sexual abuse causes of action to those barred solely by expiration of the applicable statute of limitations,subd.c.the term s tatute of limitations is the collective term applied to acts or parts of acts that prescribe the periods beyond which a plaintiff may not bring a cause of action.fox ethicon,supra,cal th at,d,norgart upjohn cal th,d.as the code of civil procedure explains,c ivil actions,without exception,can only be commenced within the periods prescribed,after the cause of action shall have accrued.
section,subdivision c,makes no reference whatsoever to any revival of the period in which to present a claim under the government claims statute.that lack of reference led the court of appeal here to infer that because the legislature must have been aware that by expressly reviving causes of action against entity defendants in general under subdivision c,it implicitly revived the deadline for presenting a claim to public entity defendants.we are not persuaded.
the legislative history of the amendment at issue here is virtually silent as to its impact on a public entity defendant it mentions only the general principle that a school district,church,or other organization engaging in the care and custody of a child owes a duty of care to that child to reasonably ensure its safety.assem.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended june.no opposition at all to the bill was noted in the committee report.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june,com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.and the bill legislative history makes no mention of an int
