in this case,a child with a disability,was denied a free appropriate public education a fape by the scarsdale union free school district the district.his parents,and,placed him in a specialized private school designed to educate children with learning disabilities and sued the district for tuition reimbursement under the individuals with disabilities education act the idea,u.et.an impartial hearing officer iho awarded tuition reimbursement to parents,holding that the district denied a fape and that the parents private placement was appropriate.a state review officer sro reversed,agreeing that was denied a fape but holding that the parents private placement was not appropriate,at least in part because the specialized private school was a more restrictive environment than the public school in which had been placed.the district court affirmed.
we reverse.we hold that the sro decision was insufficiently reasoned to merit deference and we instead defer to the iho decision,which was more thorough and carefully considered.the iho detailed the programs that the parents placement provided to and the progress made there.the iho also took into account the school restrictiveness as one factor in his decision.in contrast,the sro did not examine the kind of education and services the parents placement provided,effectively ruling that the school was inappropriate only because it was more restrictive than the public school he previously attended.when a public school district,however,denies a child with a disability a fape,a private placement is not inappropriate merely because the environment is more restrictive than the public school alternative.when a child is denied a fape,his parents may turn to an appropriate specialized private school designed to meet special needs,even if the school is more restrictive.
the parents also brought a claim under section of the rehabilitation act of the rehabilitation act,alleging that the district discriminated against on account of his disability.the district court granted summary judgment dismissing the claim,concluding that the parents had not presented sufficient evidence of bad faith or gross misjudgment.we affirm the dismissal of the rehabilitation act claim.

the idea seeks to provide to all children with disabilities a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services.d a see bd.of educ.of hendrick hudson cent.sch,westchester cnty.rowley,interpreting predecessor statute to idea,education of the handicapped act.states receiving federal funding must provide children with disabilities with a fape tailored to meet the unique needs of a particular child.walczak.union free sch,cir citation omitted.a fape must also reflect the idea strong preference for educating disabled students alongside their peers that is,in their least restrictive environment.ex rel.dep t of,cir citing walczak,at.

b.the facts 
the relevant facts are largely undisputed.has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd,nonverbal learning disability,and executive function weakness.he has exhibited problems with anxiety,stuttering,fine motor development,and visual motor coordination,all of which inhibit his ability to learn.from the school year to the school year kindergarten to third grade attended greenacres elementary school,a public school in scarsdale,new york,operated by the district.during the fourth year,the school year,parents requested that be considered for an iep under the idea.after the district determined that he was not entitled to an iep,the parents enrolled at the eagle hill school,a specialized private school in greenwich,connecticut,for the school year.
the first three years at greenacres 
in october,in kindergarten,began receiving therapy sessions once a week to address his episodic dy sfl uency.in january,he began receiving instruction sessions twice a week in greenacres learning resources center lrc an occupational therapy evaluation in march noted delays in fine motor development and visual motor coordination,which were impacting his ability to perform classroom tasks,such as writing and using scissors.
in march,the district convened a committee pursuant to section of the rehabilitation act the committee to consider whether was disabled within the meaning of the statute and,if so,to recommend a course of action.the committee determined that was eligible for services under the rehabilitation act and thus prepared a section accommodation plan the plan.the plan recommended that be removed from class for thirty minutes once weekly for occupational therapy sessions in a ratio setting.
the committee reconvened in october and october to plan for the and school years,respectively.noting difficulties with writing,remembering routines,and sustaining attention,the plan recommended the continuation of the once weekly therapy sessions in a setting an increase of the lrc sessions to four times a week in a setting and an increase of the occupational therapy sessions to twice weekly in one setting and one setting.the plan observed that reading ha d improved,but his level of disfluency ha d increased to stuttering and he had begun to exhibit anxiety in the classroom.the plan called for to continue largely the same services as the previous school year,except that the twice weekly occupational therapy sessions were now both in settings.
in april,a private occupational therapy evaluation arranged by parents placed in the twelfth percentile in integration,second percentile in visual perception,first percentile in motor coordination,and sixth percentile in total motor composite.in may,parents arranged for private occupational therapy sessions for him and consequently informed the district that he would no longer be receiving occupational therapy at greenacres.
parents also arranged for the soifer center to conduct an independent psychoeducational evaluation of,which took place over the course of six days in april and may.the soifer center evaluation placed intellectual functioning within the upper end of the low average range.the evaluation found,however,that language and executive functioning abilities were weak,and that his reading and mathematical skills were also limited.alarmed by this evaluation,parents requested that the committee reconvene.
on june,two days after the parents conference with the soifer center about their child,the committee amended plan.the amended plan noted that a lthough has made overall progress this year both in class and in the lrc,his teacher corroborates the findings of the soifer center evaluation.the plan acknowledged that fidgeted and often required refocusing and reteaching of new concepts when he was in a large classroom setting,but noted that he had less trouble remaining on task in the smaller learning environment of the lrc.the plan was amended to add hours of classroom aide time per week to assist with his organization and execution of writing tasks,as well as various program and testing modifications.
after the end of the school year,parents sought a second opinion on the results of the soifer center evaluation and arranged for a neurodevelopmental evaluation of by marilyn agin.after examining in june,agin found that he had an early history of dyspraxia,which caused him to suffer from weaknesses in attention,organization and sequencing handwriting difficulties and language processing difficulties.she also expressed concern about emotional and.although agin largely concurred with the recommendations of the plan created at greenacres,she nonetheless strongly urged that parents investigate a private educational setting with an expertise in teaching children with attentional and learning issues.
the fourth year at greenacres 
in october,at the beginning of fourth year at greenacres,the committee met and made no changes to the amended plan for.in november,a month after the committee created the plan,parents requested a review by the district committee on special education cse to determine whether was entitled under the idea to special education services,including the development of an iep the parents provided the cse with the private evaluations of,and the cse conducted its own classroom observation,evaluation,and standardized testing of,along with a developmental history interview of the parents.
the evaluation indicated that was consistently performing in the average to significantly above average range.on the stanford diagnostic reading test,scored in the,and percentiles in phonetic analysis,vocabulary,and comprehension respectively.on the first administration of the stanford diagnostic mathematics test,scored in the and percentiles in concepts and applications and in computations respectively,but the test administrator believed those scores did not reflect abilities because he was not concentrating.the second administration a few days later placed in the and percentiles in concepts and applications and in computations respectively.
after reviewing the private and district evaluations of,the cse concluded on january,that was not disabled under the idea and that he therefore was not eligible for special education services or an iep.the cse determined,however,that remained eligible for services and accommodations under section of the rehabilitation act.the cse added that,s ince reading skills have improved,committee members would like to reduce his time in the lrc to two periods per week,to address his writing skills.in reaching these conclusions,the cse acknowledged,as the parents contended,that had become increasingly resistant to attending the lrc and fe lt stigmatized by having to leave the classroom to attend the lrc for four periods per week.
in may,the committee convened to begin planning for.fourth grade year.the plan continued the services c.was already receiving.as suggested by the cse,however,lrc sessions were reduced from four to two times a week.dissatisfied with the progress he was making,parents informed the district on june,that they were withdrawing c.from greenacres and enrolling him at the eagle hill school.
the school year at eagle hill 
the eagle hill school is a private school for children with disabilities.the school educates children with learning disabilities,approximately half of whom also have attention disorders.in determining whether to admit,eagle hill reviewed his educational records,interviewed his parents,and observed him in a visit during which he was paired with a current student.eagle hill teachers evaluated to determine his cognitive potential,learning style,and academic strengths and needs,and considered whether he would benefit from the eagle hill program.
was admitted and assigned an advisor who met with him daily to coordinate and oversee his academic program,and to help him with goal setting,communication among the staff,communication between teaching staff and specialists,and communication between school and home.
eagle hill employs a diagnostic teaching model where teachers are constantly,on a daily basis,assessing a child progressed goal and making adjustments based on that assessment,tailoring accommodations to the child learning style.class sizes at eagle hill are tailored to the strengths and weaknesses of the individual students,and children with similar learning styles are assigned to the same classes.was placed in a ratio language arts tutorial class for two periods daily to assist with his reading,comprehension,writing,and study skills.for math,history,writing,literature,and modeling,was placed in classes ranging from five to nine students in each class.
progress reports at eagle hill,issued in december and june,show that he made progress in all subject areas.also became more active and enthusiastic over the school year,and was better able to express his ideas and work independently.
proceedings below 
administrative proceedings 
on june,parents requested a due process hearing before an iho to seek reimbursement of the tuition that they paid to eagle hill.the iho concluded that at least by the third grade,if not before,was receiving such a substantial array of test modifications,classroom accommodations,special education services and related services that the district was obligated to evaluate him under the idea.the iho further determined that the district should have classified as disabled under the idea,which would have entitled him to special education services and the creation of an iep.the iho ruled that,by failing to provide an iep for,the district denied him a fape.the iho also concluded that the plan proposed by the district for the school year was not an appropriate substitute for an iep because,among other things,the plan recommended a general education class that was too large.the iho also held that the parents private placement was appropriate under the idea,highlighting the various services eagle hill offered and noting the significant progress made during the school year.the iho then weighed the equities and found no reason to deny tuition reimbursement.
on appeal,the sro found error in the iho decision.although the sro agreed that was indeed denied a fape,he concluded that the parents failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that the private placement they chose for was appropriate under the idea.in the sro view,there was evidence in the record that made progress at greenacres,and consequently did not require a special education environment such as eagle hill,which provided no opportunity for the student to interact with nondisabled peers.the sro then concluded when considering the restrictiveness of the parental placement,under the facts of the instant case,i conclude that the parents are not entitled to an award of tuition reimbursement based on the restrictiveness of eagle hill.the sro did not discuss any of the specific services provided at eagle hill other than to observe that was not receiving occupational therapy at eagle hill.
the district court 
parents filed suit in the district court seeking to have the sro decision reversed.they also added a claim under section of the rehabilitation act,arguing that the district had discriminated against on account of his disabilities.the district court determined that the sro decision was entitled to deference because there was evidence supporting the sro conclusions that made progress at greenacres and that he benefited from interactions with his peers.scarsdale union free sch,d.the district court also found no evidence of bad faith or deliberate indifference,as required to establish a rehabilitation act claim.id.at.consequently,the district court granted the district for summary judgment as to both claims.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
we address the idea and rehabilitation act claims in turn.
a.the idea claim 
applicable lawa.standard for tuition reimbursement under the idea 
where a school district denies a disabled child a fape,the parents may place the child in an appropriate private school and then seek tuition reimbursement from the school district.see burlington,at florence cnty.sch.dist.four carter ex rel.carter.the parents bear the burden of showing that the private placement they selected was appropriate for the child and that the equities weigh in their favor.dep t of,cir,cert.denied.ex rel.bd.of educ.of the city sch.dist.of yonkers,cir,abrogated in part on other grounds,schaffer weast.
the parents placement of the child must be reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits,frank,at quoting rowley,at,such that the placement is likely to produce progress,not regression,id.quoting walczak,at.progress may be demonstrated by grades,test scores,regular advancement,or other objective evidence,but no single factor is dispositive as courts assessing the propriety of a unilateral placement must consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether that placement reasonably serves a child individual needs.id.an inquiry into the appropriateness of a private placement is thus a search for indicators that the placement provides educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of a disabled child,supported by such services as are necessary to permit the child to benefit from instruction.id.at quoting rowley,at.
this case presents the issues of whether and,if so,to what extent a parents private placement must take into account the idea strong preference for mainstreaming,or educating children with disabilities t o the maximum extent appropriate alongside their peers.grim rhinebeck cent.sch,cir quoting a.
with respect to the first issue,we have held that restrictiveness is a factor in the parents choice of private placement,for it remains the case that the idea maintains a strong preference for educating disabled children in the least restrictive environment.walczak,at.we have recognized that the idea requirement that an appropriate education be in the mainstream to the extent possible remains a consideration that bears upon a parent choice of an alternative placement and may be considered by the hearing officer in determining whether the placement was appropriate,at citing b we held in that the sro conclusion that the private placement was inappropriate was supportable,and thus we reversed the district court conclusion otherwise.id.
with respect to the second issue,the extent to which the restrictiveness of a private placement is a consideration in the appropriateness inquiry,we note the following 
first,parents are not barred from reimbursement where a private school they choose does not meet the idea definition of a free appropriate public education.frank,at citing see also carter,at observing that a number of idea provisions including those requiring education of disabled children under public supervision and the creation of ieps designed by local educational agencies do not make sense in the context of a parental placement.
second,along the same lines,parents may not be subject to the same mainstreaming or lre requirements as a school board,at citing warren cumberland cnty.sch,cir see also frank,at.as the fourth circuit has pointed out,the idea lre requirement was aimed at preventing schools from segregating disabled students from the general student body,but not necessarily to restrict parental options when the public schools fail to comply with the requirements of the idea.carter ex rel,carter florence cnty.sch.dist.four,cir citing,aff.
third,parents whose children are denied a fape may be and often are forced to turn to specialized private schools that educate only disabled children.such private schools are necessarily restrictive as they do not educate disabled and nondisabled children together,and may be more restrictive than the public school from which the child was removed.inflexibly requiring that the parents secure a private school that is nonrestrictive,or at least as nonrestrictive as the public school,would undermine the right of unilateral withdrawal the supreme court recognized in burlington.see at see also boss,at noting congress did not intend for a parent to choose between,on the one hand,letting child remain in public school,and,on the other hand,removing child to specialized private school without tuition reimbursement merely because specialized private school is more restrictive than public school.
finally,the test for the parents private placement is that it is appropriate,and not that it is perfect.warren,at.
hence,while the restrictiveness of a private placement is a factor,by no means is it dispositive.see sumter cnty.sch.dist.heffernan ex rel.th,cir w hile a parental placement is not inappropriate simply because it does not meet the requirement,it is nonetheless proper for a court to consider the restrictiveness of the private placement as a factor when determining the appropriateness of the placement.emphasis in original.restrictiveness may be relevant in choosing between two or more otherwise appropriate private placement alternatives,or in considering whether a private placement would be more restrictive than necessary to meet the child needs,but where the public school system denied the child a fape,the restrictiveness of the private placement can not be measured against the restrictiveness of the public school option.
standards of review 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant summary judgment on an idea claim,at.
in considering an idea claim,a district court must engage in an independent review of the administrative record and make a determination based on a preponderance of the evidence.gagliardo arlington cent.sch,cir quotation marks omitted see also i c iii,at.the obligation to independently review the record,however,is by no means an invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.rowley,at.federal courts lack the specialized knowledge and experience necessary to resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy.id.at quotation marks omitted.consequently,district courts must accord deference to state administrative agencies when reviewing their idea decisions.see gagliardo,at see also cerra pawling cent.sch,cir in reviewing the administrative proceedings,it is critical to recall that idea statutory scheme requires substantial deference to state administrative bodies on matters of educational policy.the deference owed,however,is not absolute as it will hinge on the kinds of considerations that normally determine whether any particular judgment is persuasive,for example whether the decision being reviewed is,and whether it was based on substantially greater familiarity with the evidence and the witnesses than the reviewing court.dep t of,cir.
finally,as a general matter,w hen an iho and sro reach conflicting conclusions,we defer to the final decision of the state authorities,that is,the sro decision,at internal quotations marks and alterations omitted.where the sro decision,however,is insufficiently reasoned to merit that deference and the iho decision is more thorough and carefully considered,the reviewing court may consider and defer to the iho decision.id.at alteration omitted quoting,at accord ex rel.dep t of,cv,wl,at cir.
application 
both the iho and sro found that was denied a fape because he should have been classified as a student with a disability who was eligible for special education services under the idea.the district does not challenge these findings.hence,the questions presented are a whether placement at eagle hill was appropriate,and,if so,b wh
