plaintiffs challenged constitutionality of ordinance prohibiting children subject to compulsory education laws from being in public places other than school between certain hours during school days.the superior court,los angeles county,no.bc,irving feffer,found the ordinance was a police power ordinance,not a truancy ordinance.plaintiffs appealed.the court of appeal,no,armstrong,held that ordinance was exercise of city police power and did not seek to supplement state education legislation ordinance was not coextensive with state education law ordinance was not inimical to state truancy laws and ordinance did not enter field fully occupied by state law.
plaintiffs appeal the judgment of the trial court finding that a city of monrovia ordinance was not a truancy ordinance but was a police power ordinance,the effect of which was to regulate juvenile activity during school hours.we concur with the trial court,and so affirm the judgment.
in,the city adopted an ordinance the ordinance that prohibits children who are subject to the compulsory education laws from being in public places other than school between the hours of and on days when school is in session.plaintiffs challenged the ordinance as unconstitutional on two grounds first,they maintained that the city council has no authority to legislate in the field of education,that field being delegated by the legislature exclusively to local school districts.if this ordinance is an educational ordinance,then it is ultra vires and unconstitutional.monrovia is a city and not a school board.school boards have the power to enact supplemental rules governing education cities have no power to enact supplemental education ordinances.
plaintiffs also maintained that the ordinance can not be upheld as a valid exercise of the police power,because cities excepting charter cities only have power to enact police ordinances not in conflict with general laws.cal,art.xi.local police power ordinances that conflict with general laws are preempted,and california courts have clarified that a conflict exists if the local legislation duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication.city of los angeles,cal th,d.education in general,and compulsory attendance in particular,are areas fully occupied by general law.monrovia ordinance duplicates much of california compulsory attendance law and contradicts the rests.it is therefore preempted.
we note at the outset that plaintiffs challenge is to the facial validity of the ordinance.we therefore look only to the language of the ordinance itself,and are unconcerned with the application of the ordinance under any particular factual scenario,or with the supposed reduction in crime rates during school hours since adoption of the ordinance.tobe city of santa ana cal th,d,a facial challenge focuses on the text of the measure itself,not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.neither are we concerned with the characterization of the ordinance as a truancy ordinance by the city chief of police.see los angeles city school dist.of los angeles county odell cal,a statute title can not be used for the purpose of restraining or controlling any positive provision of the act.for this reason,we deny plaintiffs request for leave to produce additional evidence or,in the alternative,for judicial notice.
discussion 
the ordinance as an ultra vires act 
plaintiffs first argument is based on the premise,long established in california law,that education is exclusively the function of the state which can not be delegated to any other agency.piper big pine school dist.of inyo county cal.indeed,not only is education exclusively a state function,but cities may not enact supplemental legislation to benefit education.see,city and county of san francisco patterson d.the city does not challenge the premise.rather,it maintains that the ordinance is a valid exercise of its police power,and is not,as plaintiffs would characterize it,a supplemental education ordinance.
plaintiffs argument goes as follows as our supreme court has held,the state truancy laws are educational,not penal,in nature.in re james cal d.the sole agency of local government which possess any authority regarding education is a local school district.cal.because compulsory attendance and truancy enforcement are clearly within the education power of the state,they are not subject to a municipality constitutional art.xi,police power.
in support of their argument,plaintiffs cite welfare institutions code sections,and,which authorize curfew ordinances prohibiting minors from remaining in or upon the public streets unsupervised after hours.plaintiffs maintain that this express legislative authorization of police ordinances establishing nighttime curfews only demonstrates the lack of any authority for an education ordinance establishing a daytime curfew during school hours.plaintiffs also seek to surmise the city purpose in enacting the ordinance if the city primary goal had really been to reduce juvenile daytime crime,it would logically seek to remove children from the streets when any were found violating the ordinance.but the city did no such thing.children who were found on the streets were issued a citation and left on the streets.it is obvious that the harm to be prevented is unexcused absence from school,not vandalism or other juvenile crime.that makes this an education ordinance,and that makes it ultra vires.
we are not persuaded.with respect to the last argument,plaintiffs conclusion that the city must be concerned only with truancy and not with crime prevention or victimization simply does not follow from the fact that violators are issued citations and left on the streets.indeed,if unexcused absences were the city primary concern,one would think that a minor found in violation of the statute would be returned to school,resolving the minor truant status.
as plaintiffs acknowledge,the california constitution is the source of the city police power,not the welfare and institutions code.cal.a city police power under this provision can be applied only within its own territory and is subject to displacement by general state law,but otherwise is as broad as the police power exercisable by the legislature itself.birkenfeld city of berkeley cal d.obviously,if the ordinance is a valid exercise of the city police power,it is not ultra vires.the critical issue,then,is can a municipality exercise its police power to prohibit the presence of unsupervised minors in public places during normal school hours 
plaintiffs say no however,they arrive at that answer by simply labeling the ordinance educational and reiterating that only the state or a school board may regulate education.we agree with plaintiffs that compulsory attendance and truancy enforcement are within the educational power of the state,and can not be drawn under the police power of a municipality.however,the ordinance,on its face,does not seek to compel school attendance or to enforce truancy provisions.rather,the ordinance simply states that a minor who is subject to the compulsory education laws and who is absent from school without excuse between the designated hours will be subject to citation if the minor chooses to be unsupervised in a public place within the city.thus,a minor who skips school to go to the beach,or who simply stays at home,is every bit as truant as one who hangs out at an arcade,or park,or other public place within the city.however,the ordinance is not addressed to regulating the conduct of the truant who stays home or who leaves the city limits.it only affects truants who are present in public in monrovia during certain hours when they are required to be in school.
the rationale for such an ordinance can be readily surmised children,with certain exceptions,are required to be in school.when in school,they are under the supervision of adults.parents,police,and the community at large rely on the schools to supervise the minors in their charge.when children are absent from school without excuse,they are no longer under the watchful eye of school authorities and,for that reason,are at greater risk of both being harmed and of causing harm to others.the monrovia city council recognized the risks associated with minors who the community assumes are being supervised at school but who in fact are not,and sought to address this problem by making it unlawful for a child who is supposed to be in school to be unsupervised in a public place.this is a classic exercise of a city police power.see,hodgson minnesota,d the state has a strong and legitimate interest in the welfare of its young citizens,whose immaturity,inexperience,and lack of judgment may sometimes impair their ability to exercise their rights wisely hutchins district of columbia,there can be no serious dispute that protecting the welfare of minors by reducing juvenile crime and victimization is an important governmental interest the fact that the ordinance makes reference to the compulsory education laws simply does not render it an education ordinance.
preemption 
plaintiffs next argue that,even if the ordinance is a proper exercise of police power,it is preempted by state law.
under article xi,section of the california constitution,a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.where the legislature has assumed to regulate a given course of conduct by prohibitory enactments,a municipality with subordinate power to act in the matter may make such new and additional regulations in aid and furtherance of the purpose of the general law as may seem fit and appropriate to the necessities of the particular locality and which are not in themselves unreasonable.pipoly benson cal d.there are many situations wherein municipal police power may operate on the same subject matter embraced in state legislation.this is particularly true when the local regulations purport only to supplement the general by additional reasonable requirements,or are in aid and furtherance thereof.people mcgennis d.thus,it is that the preemption doctrine does not preclude a city from exercising its police power on a subject simply because the legislature has also enacted a law on the same subject.
however,if otherwise valid local legislation conflicts with state law,it is preempted by such law and is void.citations.
a conflict exists if the local legislation duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication.citations.
local legislation is duplicative of general law when it is coextensive therewith.see in re portnoy cal d,finding duplication where local legislation purported to impose the same criminal prohibition that general law imposed.
similarly,local legislation is contradictory to general law when it is inimical thereto.see ex parte daniels cal,finding contradiction where local legislation purported to fix a lower maximum speed limit for motor vehicles than that which general law fixed.
finally,local legislation enters an area that is fully occupied by general law when the legislature has expressly manifested its intent to fully occupy the area citation or when it has impliedly done so in light of one of the following indicia of intent the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action or the subject matter has been partially covered by general law,and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the locality citations.city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.
plaintiffs maintain that monrovia ordinance violates preemption in all three ways as amended,the ordinance duplicates state law insofar as it makes it unlawful to violate compulsory attendance contradicts state law as it pertains to warrantless stops,the threshold for violations,and the punishments imposed and enters the fully occupied field of compulsory education and truancy.
a.the ordinance does not duplicate state law 
plaintiffs argue that the ordinance makes it a violation of city law to violate state law if a student skips school,the school will call the police to have them come to the school to issue a citation.the student is cited for skipping school,but state law already prohibits skipping school.this is duplication.
as noted above,a student who skips school by staying home violates state law but not the ordinance.thus,contrary to plaintiffs position,the ordinance is not coextensive with,and therefore not duplicative of,the state education law.if,in fact,minors are being cited as described by plaintiffs in the preceding paragraph,they are not being cited pursuant to the terms of the ordinance.while that fact may subject the ordinance to an as applied challenge,it has no bearing on a facial challenge to its validity.
b.the ordinance does not contradict state law 
l ocal legislation is contradictory to general law when it is inimical thereto.city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.stated another way,d irect conflict exists when the ordinance prohibits conduct which is expressly authorized by state law.sports committee dist,county of san bernardino d.
plaintiffs argue that the ordinance contradicts state law because it provides for different penalties than those set forth in the education code.
the education code provides no penalty for the first three times a minor is absent without excuse.upon the fourth absence which the statute defines as truant,a warning may be issued by any peace officer,which becomes a part of the student permanent record,subd.a.upon the fifth absence second truancy,the student may be assigned to an after school or weekend study program,subd.b.upon the sixth absence third truancy,the minor is referred to the student attendance review board,or truancy mediation program,subd.c.and upon the seventh absence fourth truancy,the student is subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,adjudged a habitual truant,and made a ward of the court,subd.d.in contrast,under the ordinance,a minor is subject to citation the first time he or she is found in violation of the ordinance,and may be fined or ordered to serve hours of community service.the second infraction carries a fine,while each subsequent citation is subject to a fine of.
from the foregoing facts,plaintiffs argue thus,under state law a student can not be summoned into court until his seventh absence.indeed,the california supreme court has said that use of the student attendance review board sarb is a condition precedent to the juvenile court in a truancy matter.in re michael superior court of fresno county cal d.but in monrovia,there is no requirement that the student be referred to a sarb before being taken to court for a violation of the ordinance.under the ordinance,the student could be fined a total of from his six previous trips to court before the condition precedent has been satisfied for the first trip to the courthouse under state law.
however,the court appearance to which a minor is subject under the ordinance is a proceeding in juvenile traffic court before a juvenile traffic referee.enforcement of the ordinance does not set in motion the prospect that the minor will be adjudged a habitual truant and made a ward of the juvenile court.
in city of los angeles,supra,the supreme court discussed the test of whether the los angeles ordinance regulating the display of aerosol paint cans was contradictory to the state statute regulating the sale of aerosol paint cans to minors.said the court we must next determine whether the ordinance contradicts the statute.it does not.the former is not inimical to the latter.as the description in the preceding paragraph makes clear,the ordinance does not prohibit what the statute commands or command what it prohibits.cal th at,d.
so too here,the ordinance is not inimical to the state truancy laws.it neither prohibits conduct which the state law mandates,
